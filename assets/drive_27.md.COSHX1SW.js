This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.  Paragraph: David was working in his chemistry lab. He selected two isotopes, sample A and sample B. Sample A had longer half-life, but sample B had shorter half-life. After some time he checked sample A when its one half-life had passed. He noted it as sample A1. Then he came back to see it again when two half-lives had passed. He noted it as sample A2.

In Steve's kitchen, there are two burners. Burner A is currently not turned on, and burner B is set to \\"medium.\\" Steve was planning on cooking some fried eggs for lunch, but is currently distracted by an article in the newspaper that was deliver to his door.  Hint: Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this air flow due to the Coriolis effect. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena.  Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes. Answer:","output":"The air above burner B is warmer. In the given scenario, Steve's kitchen has two burners - burner A and burner B. Burner A is currently not turned on, meaning it is not producing heat. On the other hand, burner B is set to \\"medium,\\" which means it is producing heat.  The paragraph explains that surface temperature differences can cause pressure differences. When a hot surface, such as burner B, warms the air, this air then expands. This expansion leads to lower density and decreased surface air pressure. In other words, the air above a warmer surface has a lower pressure compared to the air above a cooler surface.  Furthermore, the paragraph explains that the horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from areas of higher pressure to lower pressure, creating wind. Earth's rotation can also cause a deflection in this air flow due to the Coriolis effect. This phenomenon can cause the formation of complex systems and weather phenomena. In this case, burner B is currently on and producing heat which warms the air above it, while burner A is not turned on and is not warming the air above it. Based on the information provided and the principles explained in the paragraph, the air above burner B is warmer compared to the air above burner A."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Mike is studying for his zoology class. Today, he is studying about reptiles and amphibians. He found it easy to understand their differences by categorizing them. For that, he classified reptiles as class A and amphibians as class B.  Which class of animals would have weaker separation of  oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams, class A or class B?  Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...","output":"Based on the information provided, Class B animals (amphibians) would have a weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams as compared to Class A animals (reptiles). Amphibians, which include frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts, have a less efficient circulatory system as compared to reptiles. Their circulatory system is only partially divided, consisting of a three-chambered heart with two atria and one ventricle. This allows some mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the single ventricle, which then gets pumped to both the lungs and body tissues. This results in a less efficient transport of oxygen throughout the body.  On the other hand, reptiles have a more advanced circulatory system with a heart that is partially or completely divided into separate chambers, depending on the species. This septum in the heart allows for more complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, leading to more efficient oxygen transport and gas exchange in reptiles. As mentioned in the hint, reptiles also have a more efficient respiratory system which uses their lungs to draw air by expanding their chest walls, further emphasizing their improved oxygen transportation. In conclusion, Class B animals (amphibians) have a weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams due to their less advanced circulatory and respiratory systems compared to Class A animals (reptiles)."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who was survived by his third wife, as well as his daughter, Galina, and son, Maxim?, using the article: In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film Hamlet, which was favourably reviewed by The New York Times: \\"But the lack of this aural stimulation – of Shakespeare's eloquent words – is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\\".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: \\"Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.\\"A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony. Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who was survived by his third wife, as well as his daughter, Galina, and son, Maxim, is Shostakovich.

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job. And not only that, but a chance at a scholarship, two really important long term friendships—relationships I'd enjoyed since high school. I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind. It is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding. Twenty-six months since I knew that somewhere in the deepest parts of who I am, I was slipping. Nine seasons since I begged Dr. Poe, “Remember me to myself!” I'm still recuperating. Yes. I have felt like I wasn't me. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What kind of help did Julie get after the situations in her story?

Power down your computer and turn off the power switch located on the back of your computer case, near the power cord socket.  Remove the case door and locate the memory slots on the motherboard. Options are: * The slots, which are approximately 4.5 to 5 inches (10 to 12 cm) long, typically will be lined up in a row of 4 to 8. Depending on amount of ram installed on your system and the number of memory slots on your motherboard, some of the slots may be empty.; * In case one had to be replaced, use a phillips-head screwdriver to turn the screws counterclockwise. Place the old memory stick in the slot behind the ram slot.; * Hit the key on your mouse to place the index card into the slot for ram. Insert the memory stick into the slot.; * The slots for the ram stick are located on the back of your computer case, or within the case itself. Find the gnu motherboard connector located in the back of your computer.;","output":"After locating the memory slots on the motherboard, you will need to assess the situation based on the options provided: 1. If you see the slots lined up in a row of 4 to 8 with some potentially empty, it indicates that you have identified the correct memory slots on your motherboard. Before proceeding, take note of the number of memory slots and the number of installed memory modules. This observation will help you determine the RAM type and the expansion options available. 2. In case you need to replace an existing memory stick, carefully unscrew the memory module from the motherboard using a Phillips-head screwdriver by turning the screws counterclockwise. Make sure to handle the memory module with care to avoid any damage to it. Keep the old memory stick in a safe place or slot it into a designated slot behind the RAM slot to prevent misplacement or damage. 3. Before installing the new memory stick, ensure that you have the right RAM type for your system by confirming its compatibility with your motherboard. Gently press the key on your mouse to insert the index card into the RAM slot for alignment purposes. Now, correctly align the notches on the memory stick with those on the slot and gently push down on both ends until you hear a click. This indicates that the memory stick has been securely inserted into the slot. 4. If you still haven't located the RAM stick slots, look for them on the back of your computer case or inside the case itself. You should be able to identify the 'gnu' motherboard connector at the back of your computer, which will help you find the memory slots. Once you have located the RAM stick slots, follow the instructions in the previous steps to replace or install the new RAM modules. After successfully placing the new memory stick into the slot, it's time to reassemble your computer case. Secure the case door back in place and fasten all the screws. Turn on the power switch at the back of your computer case and power up your computer. Once your computer has booted up, you should be able to notice the increased RAM capacity, as well as improved performance. You can verify the RAM type and its capacity using the system information tools provided by your operating system or through third-party diagnostic utilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly.

Read this article and answer this question In the United States, conscription began in 1917 and was generally well received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas. The administration decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war. In 1917 10 million men were registered. This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3 million inducted into the military services. The draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted , compared to 2,442,586 white . Forms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. Many socialists were jailed for \\"obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service\\". The most famous was Eugene Debs, head of the Socialist Party of America, who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. In 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the Selective Draft Law Cases on January 7, 1918.

Most residents accept this promise of rebirth, but those who do not and attempt to flee the city are known as \\"Runners\\". An elite team of policemen known as \\"Sandmen\\", outfitted in predominantly black uniforms and serving in an agency of the city called \\"Deep Sleep\\", are assigned to pursue and terminate Runners as they try to escape. Logan 5 and Francis 7 are both Sandmen. After terminating a Runner, to whose presence they were alerted during a Carrousel ritual, Logan finds an ankh among his possessions. Later that evening, he meets Jessica 6, a young woman also wearing an ankh pendant. Logan takes the ankh to the computer, which tells him that it is a symbol for a secret group whose members help the Runners find \\"Sanctuary\\", a mythical place where they will be safe to live out the rest of their lives; it points out that the Sandmen have lost one thousand and fifty-six (1056) Runners that way.

Select from: (I) unacceptable. (II) acceptable.","output":"(II) acceptable. A linguist would find the sentence \\"She could not have been working\\" to be an acceptable English sentence grammatically. To understand why, we can analyze the sentence structure and parts of speech: 1. \\"She\\": The subject of the sentence is \\"She,\\" which is a pronoun that refers to a female person. In English grammar, pronouns can function as the subject, and \\"She\\" is an appropriate pronoun in this context.  2. \\"could not\\": This construction is known as a modal verb, which indicates possibility, ability, or permission. In this case, \\"could\\" suggests ability or possibility, and the addition of \\"not\\" negates it, meaning that it is not possible or the subject is not able (or is not allowed) to do the action described. Modal verbs, also known as auxiliary verbs, accompany the main verb of the sentence and provide additional information about the action. 3. \\"have been\\": This is another auxiliary verb construction, which adds further information about the action. The auxiliary verb \\"have\\" is used in perfect tense constructions, while \\"been\\" is the past participle of \\"be.\\" The present perfect continuous tense (also known as present perfect progressive) is formed by combining the present tense of \\"have\\" (or \\"has\\" for third person singular) with \\"been\\" and the present participle of the main verb. 4. \\"working\\": This is the main verb and the action of the sentence. \\"Working\\" is the present participle of the verb \\"work,\\" which denotes a continuous action.  In summary, the sentence \\"She could not have been working\\" is a negative sentence in the present perfect continuous tense. The meaning of the sentence is that it was not possible (or the subject was not able) for the female person to be engaged in a continuous action (working) at a specific time or during a period in the past. The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable, as it follows the rules and conventions of English syntax and tense formation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is believed that the couple had been experiencing marital troubles and that the content of the three-page letter likely revolved around these issues. Thai police believe that the content of the letter could have played a significant role in Mr. Slym's decision to leap from the hotel room.  Following the tragic incident, Tata Motors released a statement expressing their deep condolences to the family and stating their shock at the sudden loss of their managing director. \\"Karl Slym was a highly respected leader who was instrumental in the ongoing growth and development of the company,\\" the statement read. \\"His untimely death leaves a significant void in the organization, and we will all miss his leadership and vision.\\" The circumstances leading to Mr. Slym's tragic death caused a considerable outpour of support from both within and outside the company.

Colleagues and friends also took to social media to share their memories of Karl Slym and to offer condolences and support to the grieving family. As the news of Karl Slym's death sent shockwaves through the corporate world, particularly in the automotive industry, many began to question the future of Tata Motors. Under Slym's leadership, the company had made significant strides in driving innovation and expansion into new markets. However, with the sudden loss of their leader, Tata Motors now faced the challenge of finding an equally capable successor to continue Slym's vision and maintain their competitive edge.

A month after the tragedy, Tata Motors announced the appointment of a new managing director to take up the mantle left vacant by Slym's passing. The new leader was selected after a thorough evaluation of potential candidates, both internal and external, who could carry forward Slym's strategic direction and maintain Tata Motors' growth trajectory. Additionally, the company took measures to ensure that mental health and employee well-being are accorded greater importance within the organization, establishing programs to help employees seek assistance in times of personal crises. As the dust settled and Tata Motors continued to forge ahead under new leadership, the automotive world took a moment to reflect on the life and accomplishments of Karl Slym.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: How do I get a lug nut off of my tire? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To remove a lug nut off of your tire, you should follow these steps, taking into consideration safety, efficiency, and the right tools for the job. Below are two methods for accomplishing this goal, followed by the recommended and most sensible way. Method 1: Using a Lug Wrench 1. Park on a level surface: Find a flat and solid surface to safely park your vehicle. This ensures stability when working on it. Make sure to engage the parking brake and place wheel chocks on the wheels that are not being lifted to prevent any rolling. 2. Loosen the lug nuts: Before lifting the vehicle, slightly loosen each lug nut on the tire you want to remove. Do not remove them yet; only loosen them enough so that you can easily unscrew them later. To loosen the lug nuts, use a lug wrench (also known as a tire iron) that comes with your vehicle or a suitable aftermarket wrench. Remember to turn the lug nuts counterclockwise to loosen them. 3. Lift the vehicle: Locate the jacking points on your vehicle by referring to the owner's manual. Place the jack under the appropriate jacking point and slowly pump or crank it until the tire is off the ground. Ensure the jack is secure and the vehicle is stable before proceeding. 4. Remove lug nuts and tire: Now that the lug nuts have been loosened and the vehicle is lifted, fully unscrew the lug nuts and set them aside safely. In case of stubborn lug nuts, you can use a breaker bar or a pipe extension on the lug wrench for extra leverage. After removing all lug nuts, carefully remove the tire. Method 2: Using an Impact Wrench 1. Park on a level surface: As mentioned previously, you should park the vehicle on a flat and solid surface to ensure stability. Engage the parking brake and use wheel chocks to prevent any rolling. 2. Loosen the lug nuts: In this method, use an impact wrench—an electric or air-powered tool—to quickly and easily remove the lug nuts. Connect the impact wrench to an air compressor or power outlet and select the appropriate size socket for the lug nuts. Gently press the trigger and turn the lug nuts counterclockwise to loosen them. 3. Lift the vehicle: Follow the same process to lift the vehicle using the jack in the correct jacking point, as described in Method 1. 4. Remove lug nuts and tire: Once the vehicle is properly lifted and stable, continue to use the impact wrench to fully remove the lug nuts, and then remove the tire. Recommended and Most Sensible Way: If you're not a professional or do not own an impact wrench, the most sensible and accessible way to remove a lug nut from your tire is by using the lug wrench method. Most vehicles come equipped with a lug wrench, and this method is suitable for occasional tire changes. However, if you frequently work on vehicles or need to change tires often, investing in an impact wrench is a time-saving and efficient approach."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was formed by a merger of French Aérospatiale-Matra Missiles (of EADS, now Airbus Group), Italian Alenia Marconi Systems (now Leonardo) and British Matra BAe Dynamics (of BAE Systems) in December 2001. In 2015 the company had 10,000 employees. In 2015, MBDA recorded orders for €5.2bn and an order book of €15.1 bn. MBDA works with over 90 armed forces worldwide.  - Radar is an object-detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed. Radar was developed secretly for military use by several nations in the period before and during World War II. The term \\"RADAR\\" was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging or RAdio Direction And Ranging. The term \\"radar\\" has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization.  - British Aerospace Dynamics Limited (BADL or BAe Dynamics) was a division of British Aerospace.  - Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS) was a major European integrated defence electronics company and an equal shares joint venture between BAE Systems and Finmeccanica until its dissolution on May 3, 2005.  - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941.  - Active radar homing (ARH) is a missile guidance method in which a missile contains a radar transceiver (in contrast to semi-active radar homing, which uses only a receiver) and the electronics necessary for it to find and track its target autonomously. NATO brevity code for an air-to-air active radar homing missile launch is Fox Three.  - Brimstone is an air - launched ground attack missile developed by MBDA for Britain 's Royal Air Force . It was originally intended for \`\` fire - and - forget '' use against mass formations of enemy armour , using a millimetric wave ( mmW ) active radar homing seeker to ensure accuracy even against moving targets . Experience in Afghanistan led to the addition of laser guidance in the dual - mode Brimstone missile , allowing a \`\` spotter '' to pick out specific targets when friendly forces or civilians were in the area . The tandem shaped charge warhead is much more effective against modern tanks than older similar weapons such as the AGM - 65G Maverick , while the small blast area minimises collateral damage . Three Brimstones are carried on a launcher that occupies a single weapon station , allowing a single aircraft to carry many missiles . After a protracted development programme , single - mode or \`\` millimetric '' Brimstone entered service with RAF Tornado aircraft in 2005 , and the dual - mode variant in 2008 . The latter has been extensively used in Afghanistan and Libya . An improved Brimstone 2 was expected to enter service in October 2012 , but problems with the new warhead from TDW and the ROXEL rocket motor put back the planned date to November 2015 . MBDA is working on the targeting of swarms of small boats under the name Sea Spear . The RAF intend to fit Brimstone to their Eurofighter Typhoons , and planned to integrate it with their Harriers until they were withdrawn from service in 2010 . MBDA is studying the use of Brimstone on ships , attack helicopters , UAVs , and from surface launchers ; it will be integrated on the Lockheed Martin F - 35 Lightning II when the F - 35B enters British service . The United States , France and India have expressed interest in buying Brimstone for their aircraft , but Saudi Arabia is the only export customer as of 2015.The cost per missile has been quoted as £ 175,000 (  263,000 ) each in 2015 , or ' over £ 100,000 ' .  - BAE Systems plc is a British multinational defence, security and aerospace company. Its headquarters are in London in the United Kingdom and it has operations worldwide. It is among the world's largest defence companies; it was ranked as the third-largest based on applicable 2015 revenues. Its largest operations are in the United Kingdom and United States, where its BAE Systems Inc. subsidiary is one of the six largest suppliers to the US Department of Defense. Other major markets include Australia, India and Saudi Arabia. The company was formed on 30 November 1999 by the £7.7 billion merger of two British companies: Marconi Electronic Systems (MES)  the defence electronics and naval shipbuilding subsidiary of the General Electric Company plc (GEC)  and British Aerospace (BAe)  an aircraft, munitions and naval systems manufacturer.  - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.  - Matra BAe Dynamics was formed in August 1996 by merger of half the missile business of Matra Defense of France and BAe Dynamics (a division of British Aerospace) of the UK and was Europe's largest manufacturer of missiles and UAVs.

You can buy gum at pretty much every corner store. Chewing gums can be used to make bubbles, but they won't be as big, and they'll usually pop too easily. Hypothesis: It has been said that chewing gum bubbles are easy to pop.","output":"Yes, we can draw the following hypothesis from the context: Hypothesis: Chewing gum bubbles are easier to pop as compared to bubblegum bubbles. The context indicates that although it is possible to create bubbles with chewing gum, they tend to not be as large and are generally less durable than bubbles made with bubblegum. This is because bubblegum is specifically formulated to be more elastic and better suited for bubble-blowing purposes, whereas chewing gum is primarily meant for the enjoyable experience of chewing and flavor release. In further detail, the key difference between bubblegum and chewing gum lies in the ingredients and properties of the two. Bubblegum typically contains higher levels of a particular type of polymer, which gives it enhanced pliability and elasticity, allowing it to be stretched and blown into larger bubbles without easily bursting. Chewing gum, on the other hand, tends to have a denser and more brittle texture, making it less ideal for creating large and stable bubbles. Furthermore, the process of how gum is formulated can also contribute to these characteristics. For instance, bubblegum often includes ingredients, such as synthetic rubbers and plasticizers, which impart elasticity and flexibility, allowing the gum to be manipulated into various shapes with ease. Chewing gum, however, is largely designed for prolonged chewing and the release of flavors, which means that it may focus more on providing a satisfying texture and taste, instead of prioritizing the ability to blow bubbles. In conclusion, the hypothesis drawn from the context suggests that chewing gum bubbles are indeed easier to pop compared to bubblegum bubbles, primarily due to the differences in ingredients, formulation and intended purpose of the two types of gum. Bubblegum is specifically designed for blowing bubbles, while chewing gum is formulated to offer a pleasant chewing experience and flavor release. As a result, bubbles made with chewing gum tend to be less stable and resilient than those created using bubblegum."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This may imply that the app has bugs, is not user-friendly, or has other problems that make it frustrating or impossible to use. Without more information, it is difficult to identify the specific issues with the app, but the experience of the reviewer is enough to warrant caution when considering whether to recommend the app. The review could potentially be an isolated incident, but it is important to err on the side of caution when recommending applications to friends. Providing friends with reliable and enjoyable recommendations helps maintain trust and credibility, so recommending a potentially problematic app would not be in anyone's best interest. It is worth considering that the user who provided the review may have encountered issues because of factors such as their device, operating system, or personal preferences. However, without further information, this cannot be determined, and the safest option is to not recommend the app. To make a better, more informed decision about whether or not to recommend this app, it would be beneficial to seek out additional reviews or try the app personally.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: The old saying that practice makes perfect seems to make no sense when it comes to schoolwork. Many educators today are looking for evidence to support the case for homework, but are coming up empty-handed. Mary Jane Cera is the academic administrator for the Kino School, and she maintains a no-homework policy across all grades. The purpose of the policy is to make sure learning remains a joy, not a thing that discourages social time and creative activity. At the Kino school, Cera says children often choose to take their favorite parts of school home. \\"A lot of what we see kids doing is practicing music with their friends, and taking experiments home to show their parents,\\" she says. Surveys of Kino graduates suggest that the early control they are given over their education continues to serve them well into college. \\"One of the reasons that we continue to assign much homework is our obsession   with tests, although we can agree on the importance of kids doing better on tests through proper homework to some degree,\\"says author Alfie Kohn. In his book The Homework Myth, Kohn points out that no study has ever found a relation between homework and academic achievement and that if kids have no choice in the matter of homework, they're not really exercising judgment, and are instead losing their sense of self-control. However, many supporters of homework argue that life is filled with things we don't like to do, and that homework teaches self-discipline, time management and other non-academic life skills. Wherever the homework debate goes next, it's worth taking a moment to examine if we're doing the right thing about our children's education. The good news is -- it's never too late to start.

In the UK, what is the name of the pedestrian crossing with traffic lights that go green only when no more pedestrians are detected on the crossing by infrared detectors and mats?","output":"In the UK, the name of the pedestrian crossing with traffic lights that go green only when no more pedestrians are detected on the crossing by infrared detectors and mats is the Puffin Crossing. Puffin stands for \\"Pedestrian User-Friendly Intelligent Crossing.\\" Puffin Crossings were introduced in the 1990s to improve safety and efficiency for pedestrians and road users alike. They are designed to be more responsive and adaptive to the current traffic and pedestrian conditions. Puffin Crossings have advanced features that differentiate them from other types of pedestrian crossings in the UK, such as zebra, pelican, and toucan crossings. The primary characteristics of Puffin Crossings are: 1. Smart Sensors: Unlike the older pelican crossings, puffin crossings are equipped with infrared detectors and pressure mats. These sensors detect when pedestrians are waiting to cross and when they are in the process of crossing. This real-time information allows the system to adjust the traffic light timings more accurately, ensuring that vehicles only proceed when the crossing is clear of pedestrians. 2. Nearside Signal Display: In Puffin Crossings, the pedestrian signal display is located close to the pedestrian waiting area (on the same side as the pedestrian), which means that users do not need to look across the road to see the signal status. This helps pedestrians to monitor the oncoming traffic while observing the status of the traffic lights. 3. No Flashing Amber Light: Unlike pelican crossings, puffin crossings do not have a flashing amber phase for traffic signals. When the green pedestrian light turns off (signaling pedestrians to stop crossing), the traffic lights change directly from red to green. This eliminates the potential confusion resulting from the flashing amber light and reduces the risk of collisions between pedestrians and road users. 4. Extended Crossing Time: The infrared detectors and pressure mats at puffin crossings can identify slower-moving pedestrians, such as elderly people or individuals with mobility issues. The system allows for extra crossing time by holding the red traffic light for a longer period, which ensures that all pedestrians can safely cross the road before the traffic signal turns green for vehicles. Overall, Puffin Crossings provide a safer and more efficient crossing experience for both pedestrians and road users. The intelligent features of these crossings help prevent accidents and promote a more coordinated flow between pedestrians and motorists in urban environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On a busy Friday morning in Manhattan, nine pedestrians suffered bullet or fragment wounds after police unleashed a hail of gunfire at a man wielding a .45 caliber pistol who had just killed a former co-worker. The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said. Police identified the slain co-worker as Steven Ercolino, 41, who had apparently filed a prior complaint against his assailant, claiming that he thought Johnson would eventually try to kill him. Both men had filed harassment complaints against each other in April 2011, Kelly added.

The idea of spending two months in Argentine was exciting. Then I began having second thoughts. I had never been far from New England, and I had been homesick my first few weeks at college. What would it be like in a strange country? What about the language? The more I thought about it, the more the idea worried me.  In the end I turned down the invitation. As soon as Ted asked somebody else to go, I began kicking myself. I had turned down something I wanted to do because I was scared, and had ended up feeling depressed. That unhappy summer taught me a valuable lesson out of which I developed a rule for myself: do what makes you anxious; don't do what makes you depressed.  At the end of my senior year, I began to think about becoming a writer. But my professor was urging me to aim at teaching. I hesitated. The idea of trying to live by writing was a lot scarier than spending a summer in Argentina. Back and forth I went, making my decision, unmaking it. Suddenly I realized that every time I gave up the idea of writing, that downhearted feeling went through me. Giving up on what I really wanted to do depressed me. Right then I learned another lesson. To avoid that kind of depression meant having to bear a certain amount of worry and concern. When I first began writing articles, I was frequently required to interview big names. Before each interview I would get butterflies in the stomach and my hands would shake. One person I particularly admired was the great composer Duke Ellington. On the stage and on television, he seemed the very model of confidence. Then I learned Ellington still got stage fright. If the highly honored Ellington, who had appeared on the bandstand some 10,000 times over 30years, had anxiety attacks, who was I to think I could avoid them? I went on doing those frightening interviews. Then I realized to my astonishment that I was even looking forward to the interviews....

Write an article based on this summary: – With thousands of rape kits languishing untested in Texas, one state lawmaker devised a clever solution: crowdfunding. Rep. Victoria Neave came up with the idea after learning that many rape investigations were going nowhere because there was no money to analyze evidence collected from victims, NPR reports. The Dallas Democrat filed a bill that would ask Texans to pony up 1 or more when they stop into the DMV to renew or apply for drivers licenses. The donations would mirror those collected for veterans and other organizations, except they would be used to test DNA evidence collected in reported rapes, such as semen, hair, and fibers. If the measure passes—it's cleared the House and is set for a Senate vote—Neave says it could generate 1 million a year \\"and end the backlog of untested rape kits.\\" The price tag for testing a rape kit can hit 2,000, per NPR, leaving many police departments in Texas and other states balking at the expense. Neave told the New York Times in March that it's tough enough for women to muster the \\"courage\\" to report rape. When they do, she adds, \\"we owe it to them\\" to ensure the physical evidence is properly tested. It's unclear how many untested kits are in Texas, though estimates sit at about 20,000, the Daily Beast reported last month. Not everyone is impressed with the idea. \\"It's really horrifying that ... evidence testing for survivors is reliant on charitable donations by the public,\\" says Kristen Lenau, a victims' advocate. \\"We believe the onus to test this evidence is on the state and local governments.\\" (For one rape victim, even finding a rape kit was an ordeal.)","output":"Title: Crowdfunding Proposed to Address the Untested Rape Kit Backlog in Texas Introduction: Thousands of rape kits go untested in Texas due to the lack of funding for the analysis of evidence collected from victims. In response to this issue, Texas State Rep. Victoria Neave has proposed a creative solution: crowdfunding. Neave's plan entails collecting donations from citizens when they visit the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to apply for or renew their driver's licenses. The Proposal: According to NPR, the idea behind Neave's proposal is that for many rape investigations, no progress is made due to a lack of funds to analyze vital evidence associated with the case. Thus, the Democratic lawmaker from Dallas has filed a bill encouraging Texans to donate 1 or more when they make a transaction at the DMV. The crowdfunding campaign format would resemble those that collect funds for veterans and other organizations, but the money would be directed towards testing DNA evidence gathered from reported rape cases, such as hair, semen, and fibers. Possible Impact: The bill has already been cleared by the House and is awaiting a vote in the Senate. If passed, Neave estimates that it could generate around 1 million per year, which would help address the backlog of untested rape kits. The cost for testing a single rape kit can reach 2,000, according to NPR, deterring many police departments in Texas and other states from pursuing the expense. Importance of Addressing the Issue: Neave told the New York Times in March that reporting rape already requires considerable courage from women. Therefore, she believes that \\"we owe it to them\\" to ensure the physical evidence in their cases is thoroughly tested. Although the exact number of untested rape kits in Texas is uncertain, the Daily Beast has estimated it to be around 20,000. Criticism: Not everyone is impressed with Neave's proposal. Kristen Lenau, a victims' advocate, finds it horrifying that \\"evidence testing for survivors is reliant on charitable donations by the public.\\" Lenau argues that the responsibility to test this evidence lies with state and local governments. Conclusion: Efforts to address the backlog of untested rape kits highlight the need for adequate funding for law enforcement agencies to conduct efficient and effective investigations. It remains to be seen whether Neave's crowdfunding proposal will pass in the Senate and what impact it could have on Texas's backlog of untested rape kits. Although crowdfunding may provide a temporary solution, it is essential to consider the long-term responsibility of state and local governments to ensure justice for survivors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the information provided, we can't calculate the percentage increase without that data. However, I can address if the answer you provided is relevant to the question. The quoted text appears to describe three different types of investments that the college may utilize for its endowment: 1. Unitised Scheme: This is a unit trust investment vehicle, which pools money from various sources such as colleges, faculties, and departments. The purpose of this type of investment is to generate long-term returns. 2. Non-Core Property: This portfolio includes approximately 120 properties that the college has deemed not core to its academic mission. These properties serve as operational and developmental investments in the portfolio. 3. Strategic Asset Investments: These investments consist of the college's shareholding in companies such as Imperial Innovations and other restricted equity holdings. While the quoted text provides an overview of the different types of investments that may make up the college's endowment, it doesn't answer the specific question about the percentage increase in the endowment's market value from 2014 to 2015. As mentioned earlier, to answer that question, we would need the actual endowment market values for those years. In summary, while the provided text sheds some light on how the endowment is invested, it doesn't contain the necessary information to calculate the percentage increase in endowment market value from 2014 to 2015. You would need to obtain the relevant endowment values for both years to answer your initial question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Ma had put a stack of clean clothes at the foot of the bed for me. I dressed without caring what I put on. The only important items were my cowboy boots and my Roy Rogers belt with two holsters for cap guns, even though I only had one cap gun left, and its trigger was broken. When I used the toilet, I sat on the front edge of the seat, watching the water beneath me, and scooted off as soon as I was done. I had seen a cartoon in a book at Grandpa Abner's that showed a fish leaping out of a toilet bowl and a woman staring at it with big eyes. I thought that was funny and I knew it was impossible, but I didn't think there was any reason to take chances. Ma called, \\"Little Bit has to use the bathroom.\\" I yelled, \\"I'm almost done.\\" Ma called, \\"Are you off the toilet?\\" I yelled, \\"Yes!\\" Ma opened the door and brought Little Bit in. Squeezing toothpaste onto my toothbrush, I said, \\"I wasn't done yet.\\" Ma said, \\"Your father's making breakfast in the restaurant.\\" That meant we should hurry, so I slid the brush over my teeth while Little Bit sat next to the sink, and then I ran out of the house.

The sun has a weaker or stronger force of gravity than the moon? The answer is:","output":"The sun has a stronger force of gravity than the moon.  This is due to the fact that the sun has a significantly greater mass than the moon. The force of gravity between two objects is determined by their masses and the distance between their centers. This relationship is described by the gravitational force formula: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant (~6.674 x 10^-11 N m²/kg²), m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between their centers.  In the case of the sun and the moon, the sun's mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, while the moon's mass is about 7.342 x 10^22 kg.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Select from the following. (a). no; (b). yes;","output":"(a). No, the questions are not the same. They address different aspects of MP3 players and iPods. The first question asks about the differences between an iPod and other MP3 players, while the second question asks if it's possible to assemble and install an MP3 player or iPod by ourselves. Regarding the answer to the first question, the differences between an iPod and other MP3 players can be categorized into several aspects: design, functionality, compatibility, and ecosystem. 1. Design: The iPod, developed by Apple, is known for its sleek and minimalistic design. The iconic white headphone and the click wheel are associated with the iPod brand. Many other MP3 players, on the other hand, may come in various designs and colors. Some may have a simple and clean design, while others may be more colorful or have distinct features that set them apart from the iPod. 2. Functionality: The iPod and other MP3 players both primarily serve as portable music players. However, Apple has introduced several iPod models over the years that have different features, such as the iPod Touch, which comes with a touch screen, internet access, and support for various apps. Other MP3 players generally don't have these additional features. 3. Compatibility: In terms of file format compatibility, some non-iPod MP3 players support a wider range of audio file formats like FLAC, OGG, or WMA, while iPods mostly work well with their proprietary AAC format and MP3. Using iTunes, Apple encourages users to manage their content and sync it with their device. In contrast, most other MP3 players can be managed using various software or even by directly accessing the device's storage through Windows Explorer, which offers more flexibility. 4. Ecosystem: Perhaps the most notable difference is the ecosystem that surrounds the iPod. Apple has built a comprehensive ecosystem through its iTunes store and its integration with other Apple devices and services. This makes managing and syncing music across devices easier if you are using multiple Apple products. On the other hand, other MP3 players do not have a specific ecosystem like Apple, but they can be compatible with various types of software and streaming platforms. As for the second question, it is not very feasible for an individual to assemble and install an iPod or MP3 player by themselves. These devices are generally manufactured in factories where several small and precise components are carefully assembled through automated processes or by specialized technicians. It would be challenging for an individual without proper knowledge, materials, and tools to assemble an iPod or MP3 player from scratch. However, if you are referring to installing a specific MP3 player or iPod software on your computer, then yes, it is possible for an individual to do so. In the case of the iPod, you would install the iTunes software, whereas other MP3 players may require their manufacturer's software or simply plug-and-play through USB. This process is generally simple and can be done with instructions available online."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I loved the little guy from the day she brought him home. She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame. According to the above context, answer the following question. What kind of feelings did Steve have for Miss Tennessee? Options: A). Very positive feelings. B). Ambivalent feelings. C). Very negative feelings. D). not enough information Answer:","output":"A). Very positive feelings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She plans to reopen the orphanage as a facility for disabled children. SimÃ³n claims to see a boy named TomÃ¡s (Ãscar Casas). He befriends TomÃ¡s and draws pictures of him as a child wearing a sack mask. Social worker Benigna Escobedo (Montserrat Carulla) informs Laura that SimÃ³n's adoption file indicates that SimÃ³n is HIV positive. Incensed at Benigna's intrusion, Laura asks her to leave. She later finds Benigna in the orphanage's coal shed, but Benigna flees the scene. Later, SimÃ³n teaches Laura a game which grants its winner a wish. Clues lead the two to SimÃ³n's adoption file. SimÃ³n becomes angry, and says that his new friend told him that Laura is not his biological mother and that he is going to die soon. During a party at the orphanage, Laura and SimÃ³n argue, and SimÃ³n hides from her. While looking for him, she encounters a child wearing a sack mask who shoves her into a bathroom and locks her inside. Escaping, she finds that SimÃ³n is missing and she is unable to find him. That night Laura hears several loud crashes. Police psychologist Pilar (Mabel Rivera) suggests to Laura and Carlos that Benigna may have abducted SimÃ³n. Six months later, SimÃ³n is still missing. Searching in a Spanish city, Laura spots Benigna who is then struck and killed by a car.

Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.  Mark was studying the effect of Sun's radiations on Earth. To that end, he studied Sun's radiations, which he labeled as rad A. Then he studied Earth's radiations, which he labeled as rad B. He also learned that longer wavelength radiations would produce heat.  Would rad A have longer or shorter wavelengths than rad B? Answer:","output":"Rad A would have shorter wavelengths than rad B.

Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors.  Which student read more about a greater frequency of collisions?  Hint: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases. Answer:","output":"Sean read more about a greater frequency of collisions, as he studied the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. When the temperature is raised, reactant particles move faster, resulting in a higher rate of collisions. Furthermore, these collisions occur with a greater force, making them more likely to overcome the activation energy barrier and lead to the formation of products.

Critics have argued that the rule would stifle innovation and pick winners and losers among internet companies.      The regulation was scheduled to take effect later this year, but Congress used its authority under the obscure Congressional Review Act to wipe it from the books.      With a Republican president in the White House, the GOP-controlled Congress has turned to the 20-year-old law to scrap numerous regulations that Republicans say are costly, burdensome or excessive, many of which were finalized in the closing months of Democrat Barack Obama's presidency.      Internet companies like Google don't have to ask their users for permission before tracking what sites they visit, a discrepancy that Republicans and industry group have blasted as both unfair to companies and confusing to consumers.      White House press secretary Sean Spicer said last week that the president's support for the bill was part of a larger effort \\"to fight Washington red tape that stifles American innovation, job creation and economic growth.\\"      \\"The president pledged to reverse this type of federal overreach in which bureaucrats in Washington take the interest of one group of companies over the interest of others,\\" picking the winners and losers, he said.      Supporters of the privacy measure argued that the company that sells an internet connection can see even more about consumers, such as every website they visit and whom they exchange emails with, information that would be particularly useful for advertisers and marketers.      Undoing the regulation leaves people's online information in a murky area. Experts say federal law still requires broadband providers to protect customer information — but it doesn't spell out how or what companies must do, which is what the online privacy rule aimed to do.      The absence of clear privacy rules means companies that supply internet service, and who can monitor how consumers use it, can continue to mine that information for use in their own advertising businesses. Consumer advocates also worry that the companies will be a rich target for hackers.      Ajit Pai, the agency chairman appointed by Trump, has said he wanted to roll back the broadband privacy rules. Pai and other Republicans want a different federal agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to police privacy for both broadband companies like AT&T and internet companies like Google.      Broadband providers don't fall under the trade commission's jurisdiction, and advocates say that agency historically has been weaker than the communications commission.      Trump signed three other bills Monday, including one that eliminates a rule that prohibited the use of tactics like baiting and shooting bears from the air on the National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska.      ___      The bills are S.J. Res 34 and H.J. Res 69      ___      Associated Press writers Kevin Freking in Washington and Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.      ___      Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday signed a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules, the White House said, a victory for internet service providers and a blow to privacy advocates.      Republicans in Congress last week narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no Democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates.      The signing, disclosed in White House statement late on Monday, follows strong criticism of the bill, which is a win for AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc.      The bill repeals regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc.      The rules had not yet taken effect but would have required internet providers to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing.      FCC Chairman Ajit Pai praised the repeal in a statement late on Monday for having “appropriately invalidated one part of the Obama-era plan for regulating the internet.” Those flawed privacy rules, which never went into effect, were designed to benefit one group of favored companies, not online consumers.”      Pai said the FCC would work with the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees websites, to restore the “FTC’s authority to police internet service providers’ privacy practices.”      Republican FCC commissioners have said the Obama rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers.      The action is the latest in a string of reversals of Obama administration rules. On Monday, the FCC reversed a requirement that Charter Communications Inc extend broadband service to 1 million homes that already have a high-speed provider.      On Friday, Comcast, Verizon AT&T; Inc said they would voluntarily not sell customers’ individual internet browsing information.      Verizon does not sell personal web browsing histories and has no plans to do so but the company said it has two advertising programs that use “de-identified” customer browsing data, including one that uses “aggregate insights that might be useful for advertisers and other businesses.”      The American Civil Liberties Union said last month Congress should have opposed “industry pressure to put profits over privacy” and added “most Americans believe that their sensitive internet information should be closely guarded.”      President Trump speaks in the East Room of the White House. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts      Trade group USTelecom Chief Executive Jonathan Spalter in a statement praised Trump for “stopping rules that would have created a confusing and conflicting consumer privacy framework.”      Last week, 46 Senate Democrats urged Trump not to sign the bill, arguing most Americans “believe that their private information should be just that.”      Republicans later this year are expected to move to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility - a move that is expected to spark an even bigger fight. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The President, Mr. Trump, signed a bill that may allow internet providers to sell information on what people do online. This removes a rule that was supposed to protect people's privacy by controlling how companies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon share this information. Some people think that undoing the rule will help businesses grow, while others are worried about people's privacy. With no clear rules, internet service companies might continue to use this information for their own businesses, like advertising, and it might be a target for bad people (hackers) trying to steal this information."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Your task is to predict if the kid is in elementary school or high school. Anyone who is from grade 1st to 6th-grade will be considered as in elementary school, and 7th to 12th-grade kids will be considered as in high school. There are only two possible outputs, i.e., elementary and high. All inputs have at least one output and it cannot have both categories at a time. Teacher: Now, understand the problem?

Poem: basketball be fun a 3 point shot shoot the ball kentay be a good player entintinol foul the foul call basketball be very athelic all the player be tierd losing be not fun lebron james be a star Step 1: Analyze language The language used in this poem is quite simple and there isn't any complex vocabulary present. Step 2: Analyze grammar There are several grammar mistakes in the poem: wrong verb forms (e.g. \\"be\\" instead of \\"is\\" or \\"are\\"), misspellings (e.g. \\"athelic\\" instead of \\"athletic\\", \\"tierd\\" instead of \\"tired\\"), and lack of punctuation. These grammar mistakes could indicate that it is written by a younger child who is still learning proper grammar rules. Step 3: Analyze content The content of the poem is about basketball, mentioning basic elements of the game (3-point shot, fouls, tiredness) and a popular basketball player (LeBron James). This topic could be appealing to both elementary and high school students but doesn't provide enough context to pinpoint the exact age. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of language, grammar, and content, I would predict that the poem is written by a kid in elementary school due to the simple vocabulary and grammar mistakes, which indicate early stages of language/grammar development."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: The Bourbon monarchs resisted expansion. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise and the hypothesis appear to be contradictory rather than entailing one another. Let's dissect both statements to understand why. Premise: West of Puerta del Sol is the city's 18th-century expansion engineered by the Bourbon monarchs. In the premise, we learn about the city's expansion during the 18th century. The Bourbon monarchs were responsible for this development, and it took place in the west of Puerta del Sol. This statement conveys the idea that the Bourbon monarchs played a significant role in expanding the city and were instrumental in its growth during that time. Hypothesis: The Bourbon monarchs resisted expansion. The hypothesis, conversely, claims that the Bourbon monarchs were opposed to expansion. This statement suggests that they tried to restrict or prevent the city's growth rather than promoting it. It is the exact opposite of the idea presented in the premise where the Bourbon monarchs were responsible for the city's expansion during the 18th century. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of the two statements, the premise and the hypothesis contradict each other instead of entailing one another. While the premise highlights the Bourbon monarchs' role in expanding the city, the hypothesis makes it seem as if they were against expansion. Therefore, the premise and the hypothesis cannot coexist, and the premise does not entail the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

November 14, 2016, marked one such rare occurrence: an extra-super moon that hadn't been seen since 1948, and that will not grace our skies again until November 25, 2034. The Super Supermoon While a regular supermoon occurs when the full moon coincides with its perigee - the point at which it swings closest to Earth during its orbit - the extra-super moon of November 14 boasted an even more spectacular display. This additional feature was owed to the fact that the moon attained ultimate fullness within two hours or so of perigee. According to NASA, this unique alignment caused the moon to appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than normal, which is why it was dubbed as an \\"extra-super moon.\\" This phenomenon was recognized by ScienceAlert as the \\"one astronomical event\\" you had to see in 2016. Viewing the Extra-Super Moon As the extra-super moon reached its peak fullness during the morning rush hour on November 14, at 8:52am EST, those living in the eastern United States had the opportunity to witness the majestic event during the evening of November 13 or at night on November 14. Meanwhile, those residing in the western part of the country could catch the spectacle at 5:52am local time on November 14. This rare celestial happening was indeed a sight to behold and held a special place in the hearts of astronomical enthusiasts around the world. Looking Forward to the Next Supermoon While the extra-super moon of November 14 was an exceptional anomaly, the next regular supermoon was set for December 14, 2016. This close encounter with our natural satellite is still an eye-catching show for observers on Earth. As we look forward to witnessing similar celestial events in the future, we are reminded of the wonders that the cosmos holds and the beauty that can be found in the night sky. Conclusion The extra-super moon phenomenon of November 14, 2016, was a rare and awe-inspiring event that drew the attention of stargazers worldwide. As we anticipate the return of this celestial marvel in 2034, we can only hope that a new generation of astronomers and enthusiasts will appreciate the breathtaking beauty and profound wonder that the universe has to offer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye.  Paragraph: This year thee comets would be of interest, comet A, comet B, and comet C. Comet A and comet B would enter the inner solar system. But comet C would not enter the inner solar system. Moreover, comet A is categorized as a bright comet, but comet B is categorized as a faint comet.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which comet's dust would not reflect sunlight, comet A or comet C?

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: In what reaction will the formation of organomagnesium halide fail if water is present? Context: There are many important organozinc compounds. Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties, synthesis and reactions. Among important applications is the Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester(ROCOCOOR) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X, zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR, the Reformatskii reaction which converts α-halo-esters and aldehydes to β-hydroxy-esters, the Simmons–Smith reaction in which the carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide reacts with alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane, the Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds. The Barbier reaction (1899) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two. In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water. On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, are expensive and difficult to handle. Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc, diethylzinc and diphenylzinc. In one study the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors: Answer:","output":"The formation of organomagnesium halide will fail in the presence of water during the Grignard reaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was an immensely influential philosopher, theologian, and jurist in the tradition of scholasticism, within which he is also known as the Doctor Angelicus and the Doctor Communis. The name \\"Aquinas\\" identifies his ancestral origins in the county of Aquino in present-day Lazio.  - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).  - Scholasticism is a method of critical thought which dominated teaching by the academics (\\"scholastics,\\" or \\"schoolmen\\") of medieval universities in Europe from about 1100 to 1700, and a program of employing that method in articulating and defending dogma in an increasingly pluralistic context. It originated as an outgrowth of and a departure from Christian monastic schools at the earliest European universities. The first institutions in the West to be considered universities were established in Italy, France, Spain, and England in the late 11th and the 12th centuries for the study of arts, law, medicine, and theology, such as Schola Medica Salernitana, the University of Bologna, and the University of Paris. It is difficult to define the date at which they became true universities, although the lists of studia generalia for higher education in Europe are a useful guide, held by the Catholic Church and its various religious orders.  - Adam Pulchrae Mulieris , also called Adam de Puteorumvilla , was a Paris master who studied under Peter of Lamballe , who flourished in the first half of the 13th century . Little is known of his life . He has been described as one of the \`\` metaphysicians of light '' ( Robert Grosseteste was another ) . He was a contemporary of William of Auvergne , Bishop of Paris , and his works are cited by Richard de Fournival , Gerard of Abbeville and Thomas Aquinas . The origin of his name is unknown . The only book seriously attributed to him is Memoriale Rerum Difficilium , also known as De Intelligentiis . This was originally attributed to Witelo . It was published as Adam 's in 1908 but in the 1930s the question of this attribution was re-opened .  - Trouvère, sometimes spelled trouveur , is the Northern French (langue d'oïl) form of the langue d'oc (Occitan) word \\"trobador\\". It refers to poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours (composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages) but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known \\"trouvère\\" was Chrétien de Troyes (\\"fl\\". 1160s-1180s) (Butterfield, 1997) and the \\"trouvères\\" continued to flourish until about 1300. Some 2130 \\"trouvère\\" poems have survived; of these, at least two-thirds have melodies.  - Canonization is the act by which the Catholic Church and Anglican Communion declare that a person who has died was a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the canon, or list, of recognized saints. Originally, people were recognized as saints without any formal process. Later, different processes, such as those used today in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church, were developed.  - Robert Grosseteste (   9 October 1253) was an English statesman, scholastic philosopher, theologian, scientist and Bishop of Lincoln. He was born of humble parents at Stradbroke in Suffolk. Upon his death, he was almost universally revered as a saint in England, but attempts to procure a formal canonization failed. A. C. Crombie calls him \\"the real founder of the tradition of scientific thought in medieval Oxford, and in some ways, of the modern English intellectual tradition\\".  - Mendicant orders refers primarily to certain Christian religious orders that have adopted a lifestyle of poverty, travelling, and living in urban areas for purposes of preaching, evangelization, and ministry, especially to the poor. At their foundation these orders rejected the previously established monastic model of living in one stable, isolated community where members worked at a trade and owned property in common, including land, buildings and other wealth. By contrast, the mendicants avoided owning property, did not work at a trade, and embraced a poor, often itinerant lifestyle. They depended for their survival on the goodwill of the people to whom they preached.  - Gerard of Abbeville (1220-1272) was a theologian from the University of Paris. He formally became a theologian in 1257 and from then was known as an opponent of the mendicant orders, particularly in the second stage of the conflict, taking part in a concerted attack that temporarily affected their privileges.  - The Bishop of Lincoln is the ordinary of the Church of England Diocese of Lincoln in the Province of Canterbury.  - The University of Paris, metonymically known as the Sorbonne (its historical house), was a university in Paris, France. Appearing around 1150 as a corporation associated with the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral school, it was the second-oldest modern university in Europe. Chartered in 1200 by King Philip II (Philippe-Auguste) of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was often nicknamed after its theology collegiate institution, College of Sorbonne, founded about 1257 by Robert de Sorbon.  - Doctor of the Church (Latin \\"doctor\\" \\"teacher\\") is a title given by the Catholic Church to saints whom they recognize as having been of particular importance, particularly regarding their contribution to theology or doctrine.  - Richard de Fournival or Richart de Fornival (1201  ?1260) was a medieval philosopher and trouvère perhaps best known for the \\"Bestiaire d'amour\\" (\\"The Bestiary of Love\\").  - Oxford is a city in the South East region of England and the county town of Oxfordshire. With a population of 159,994 it is the 52nd largest city in the United Kingdom, and one of the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse. The city is situated from London, from Bristol, from both Southampton and Birmingham and from Reading.  - A friar is a member of one of the mendicant orders founded since the twelfth or thirteenth century; the term distinguishes the mendicants' itinerant apostolic character, exercised broadly under the jurisdiction of a superior general, from the older monastic orders' allegiance to a single monastery formalized by their vow of stability. The most significant orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites.    What object entity has the relation of 'occupation' with the subject 'adam pulchrae mulieris'?

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Teacher:In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Show the id of each employee and the number of document destruction authorised by that employee. Student:","output":"Sure, let's break down the problem into simple steps: 1. Identify the table(s) you need to use: In this case, let's assume there is a table named \`destruction_records\` that contains information about the document destructions authorized by employees. 2. Identify the columns you need to select: You need to display the \`employee_id\` and the number of document destructions authorized by that employee. Let's assume the table has a column named \`authorized_by\` which contains the \`employee_id\`. 3. Write the SQL query to select the required data: You need to count the number of document destructions authorized by each employee. So, you can use the COUNT() function with the GROUP BY statement: \`\`\`sql SELECT authorized_by AS employee_id, COUNT(*) as destruction_count FROM destruction_records GROUP BY authorized_by; \`\`\` This query selects the \`authorized_by\` column as \`employee_id\` and counts the number of destructions for each employee by using the COUNT(*) function. It then groups the results by the \`authorized_by\` column to display the count for each employee."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The huge building has not changed much since it opened in February, 1913. About 750,000 people pass through Grand Central every day. Some just come to look at it, others to visit the stores. But most are there to catch the trains that enter and leave from the station. It is the largest train station in the world. There are 67 train tracks, all of them underground. The main part of the building has large, arched windows, a jeweled four-sided clock and ticket windows. Grand Central has been seen in many movies through the years. Dan Brucker is with the New York Transit Authority, which operates the station. Dan Brucker has worked for the transit authority at Grand Central for 30 years. In all those years, he has not lost his interest in the building. Justin Ferate, a historian, has been giving tours of Grand Central Station for 30 years.

Let me break down the two questions for you: Question 1: What % ROI do top hedge funds average? This question is asking for the average percentage Return on Investment (ROI) of top hedge funds. ROI is a metric used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment, and it is calculated by dividing the profit from an investment by the cost of the investment. In the context of hedge funds, it refers to how well a fund's investment strategies are performing, generating gains on the assets under management.  It is important to note that the ROI of top hedge funds can vary greatly depending on factors such as market conditions, investment strategy, and the fund manager's expertise. Historically, top hedge funds have averaged anywhere from 10% to 20% annually, with some even reporting much higher figures. However, these figures change from year to year, and there is no guarantee that every top hedge fund will achieve this level of performance in any given year. Question 2: Who are the top 100 women in hedge funds? This question is asking for a list of the top 100 women who have prominent roles in hedge funds, either as fund managers, executives, or other critical positions. This can include individuals who have a history of success in managing hedge funds, demonstrated exceptional leadership, or have significantly impacted the industry through their work. Creating a comprehensive list of the top 100 women in hedge funds is subjective and depends on the criteria by which you define \\"top.\\" It would be more appropriate to consider different sources and lists that reflect various aspects of achievement within the hedge fund industry.

Write an article using the following points: The U.S. economy is roaring and the Russian economy is sagging. President Obama is in an approval slump, but Vladimir Putin is seeing a popular surge. Article:","output":"Title: A Comparative Analysis of U.S. and Russian Economies amid Leadership Approval Ratings Introduction: The Global Economic Scene In the complex web of international politics and economics, two superpowers often find themselves at the forefront of discussions: the United States of America and the Russian Federation. Despite their fluctuating relations and varying approaches to governance, these two nations hold significant sway over the global stage. In recent years, a noteworthy development has emerged, as the U.S. economy soars and the Russian economy lags. Interestingly, the leaders of these countries, President Barack Obama and President Vladimir Putin, have experienced contrasting approval ratings, with Putin gaining popularity and Obama's approval levels dipping. This article delves into the reasons and implications of this multifaceted phenomenon. The U.S. Economy: A Roaring Comeback In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, the U.S. economy experienced considerable challenges that jeopardized its stability and growth. However, through concerted efforts and strategic policy implementation, the U.S. has managed to establish a solid economic recovery. Factors that contributed to this success include consistent job growth, low unemployment rates, and strong consumer confidence. The resilience and adaptability of the country's industries, workforce, and financial markets also played a significant role in bouncing back from the recession. In addition, policy measures like the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing and a commitment to fiscal responsibility aided the nation on a sustainable upward trajectory. The Russian Economy: A Sinking Ship? While the U.S. economy flourishes, the Russian economy appears to be experiencing some turbulence. Factors contributing to the spiraling Russian economy include a significant decrease in oil prices, international sanctions following the country's annexation of Crimea, and a lack of diversified industries. As a result, Russia has witnessed a decline in its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), increased inflation, and a weaker national currency, the ruble. Consequently, the country's standard of living has been adversely impacted, leading to a deterioration of growth prospects and increased financial vulnerability. Leadership Approval Ratings: The Obama and Putin Divide Amid the contrasting economic performances, an intriguing development persists regarding the approval ratings of the respective leaders of the United States and Russia. President Barack Obama experienced a slump in his approval rating, with possible reasons including the divisive nature of U.S. politics, general dissatisfaction with the rate of economic recovery, and concerns over healthcare reform. On the other hand, President Vladimir Putin has seen a surge in popularity, with many Russians attributing the country's ability to hold on to a semblance of stability in the face of adversity to Putin's strong, resolute leadership style. This has earned Putin a reputation for defending the nation's interests, particularly in response to perceived encroachments from the West. Implications and Future Prospects The United States' booming economy coupled with a dwindling Russian economy can impact the global balance of power. As the U.S. economy strengthens, investments and spending will likely increase, allowing American influence to expand across the globe. Moreover, a stronger economy can bolster the country's military capabilities, reinforcing its international dominance as a superpower. On the other hand, the Russian economy's vulnerability could lead to an increased reliance on foreign investments, dwindling resources, and potential economic stagnation. The sagging economy might limit Russia's ability to invest in military advancements and modernize its infrastructure. However, Putin's high approval ratings could serve to push an agenda that seemingly prioritizes the consolidation of power. As a result, the global community must remain cautious and vigilant in monitoring the progression of these trends. Conclusion: Unraveling Tides of Change Ultimately, the U.S. and Russian economic dynamics and the approval ratings of their leaders exemplify the complexities inherent in the global political and economic landscape. While on the surface, these issues may seem unrelated, they present important insights into the intricacies of international relations, the impact of economic performances on political popularity, and the nature of power dynamics. As the world continues to evolve, staying attuned to these ever-shifting tides of change is essential in navigating future challenges and opportunities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Albanian was proved to be an Indo-European language in 1854 by the German philologist Franz Bopp. The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family. Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German.  Question: \\"What are some reasons for uses of the Albanian language?\\" Answer: \\"Orthodox\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer is not correct for the question asked. Let me explain it in a simpler way. The Albanian language was used for different reasons. First, the language was part of the cultural renaissance, which means people started to care more about their own culture and history. This led to the development of the Albanian language in religious texts and publications, not just in the Catholic areas in the north but also in the Orthodox areas in the south. Also, a person named Gjon Buzuku brought the Catholic liturgy, which is a religious service, into the Albanian language. This was an important step for the growth and use of the Albanian language. So, the reasons for the use of the Albanian language are: the cultural renaissance, religious texts and publications, and the translation of the Catholic liturgy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas. Question: Why do some birds thrive in noisy environments? - Because there are fewer dangers. - Because there is more food to eat. - Because there is less light pollution - Because there are more places to take shelter.

Write an article with the title: \\"Tony Hayward and BP: 100 days\\" Article:","output":"Title: Tony Hayward and BP: 100 Days Intro: The Aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon Blowout On 20th April 2010, a blowout at the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig – located 41 miles off the coast of Louisiana - would prove to be one of the biggest ecological calamities of the 21st century. The explosion led to the tragic loss of 11 human lives and caused millions of gallons of crude oil to spill into the Gulf of Mexico over the span of 87 days, heavily sabotaging the ecosystem, marine life, and local economies. At the helm of BP – the company operating the rig – was CEO Tony Hayward, whose response to the disaster garnered near-universal criticism and subsequent repercussions. In this article, we analyze Tony Hayward's fateful 100 days leading BP through the crisis and its ramifications. I: Crucial First Moments: The Veil of Ignorance When the explosion occurred, the primary goal was to ascertain the extent of the damage and begin formulating an appropriate response. At this point, certain disclosure inadequacies had already begun to surface. On April 24th, BP announced that approximately 1,000 barrels of oil were being leaked per day; however, this figure was heavily revised upward to almost 5,000 barrels per day on April 28th. This crucial period in leadership raised concerns about the clarity and transparency of information shared with authorities and the public. II: An Emergency Response: The Fight to Contain an Ecological Disaster As the urgency and magnitude of the problem set in, Tony Hayward and BP swung into action by attempting to implement damage control measures. These ranged from chemical dispersants that would break down the oil to a massive containment dome to capture the crude oil before it could spread further. Additionally, relief wells drilled to help stem the leak and a 'top kill' operation aimed at clogging the well with drilling mud were among the tactics utilized. During this period, Hayward frequently appeared in the media, assuring the public and government of BP's commitment to effectively addressing the crisis. However, conflicting opinions, lack of clarity on responsibility, and media gaffes would soon cast a long shadow on Hayward's leadership. III: Public Relations Nightmare: Tony Hayward's Missteps Hayward's communication style and some of his remarks during the tragedy undoubtedly drew negative attention, exacerbating public scrutiny. Statements such as \\"I'd like my life back\\" or downplaying the oil spill's environmental impact with comments like \\"the Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean\\" were perceived as insensitive, causing outrage and serious questions about his leadership style. Moreover, the perceived lack of empathy and absence of a strong message of accountability further dented Hayward's reputation. The infamous yachting incident – where he took a break during the crisis to go sailing on his yacht – compounded these issues, giving the impression that he was out of touch with the gravity of the situation and its reverberations on the American populace. IV: Presidential Lashings and Congressional Hearings Unsurprisingly, Hayward's response garnered the ire of US politicians. President Barack Obama stated that Hayward should have been fired after many of his comments, and the Department of Justice announced a criminal investigation into the disaster. During a congressional hearing, Hayward faced rigorous questioning from US congressmen and was criticized for deflecting responsibility and failing to answer direct questions about BP's safety measures and response to the accident. V: A Change in Leadership and Legacies On July 27, 2010, just 100 days after the explosion, Tony Hayward announced his resignation as CEO of BP. The company declared him as a \\"lightning rod\\" for criticism, and amidst immense pressure, Hayward stepped down with an effective date of October 1, 2010. Bob Dudley succeeded him, inheriting a monumental task of amending BP's global reputation and addressing the aftermath of the disaster. Conclusion: Lessons from 100 Turbulent Days In the confinement of these 100 days, Tony Hayward's leadership in the face of the Deepwater Horizon disaster serves as a cautionary tale for CEOs and emphasizes the significant impact of crisis management on public perception and future corporate prospects. Transparency in communication, empathy, preparedness, and a high level of personal accountability are critical lessons for corporations and individuals alike to imbibe from this event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Taking everything into consideration, then, the agricultural budget will next year require 0.48% of each Member State’s gross national income, and nearly 45% of the total European Budget. Translate to German","output":"Unter Berücksichtigung all dieser Aspekte wird für das nächste Jahr voraussichtlich ein Agrarhaushalt erforderlich sein, der 0,48 % des Bruttonationaleinkommens jedes Mitgliedstaates und fast 45 % des gesamten Europäischen Haushalts ausmacht. Wenn man alles in Betracht zieht, wird der Agrarhaushalt im nächsten Jahr 0,48 % des Bruttonationaleinkommens jedes Mitgliedslandes benötigen und fast 45 % des gesamten europäischen Haushalts ausmachen. Die Landwirtschaft ist eine wichtige Säule der Wirtschaft in vielen europäischen Ländern, und der Agrarhaushalt trägt dazu bei, diese Vitalität aufrechtzuerhalten. Durch Investitionen in die Landwirtschaft und die ländliche Entwicklung soll die Lebensmittelversorgung sichergestellt, die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der europäischen Landwirtschaft gestärkt und die Entwicklung und Erhaltung ländlicher Räume unterstützt werden. Dabei spielt der Europäische Garantiefonds für die Landwirtschaft (EGFL) eine entscheidende Rolle, indem er den Landwirten Direktzahlungen zur Verfügung stellt und Marktmaßnahmen finanziert, während der Europäische Landwirtschaftsfonds für die Entwicklung des ländlichen Raums (ELER) gezielte Investitionen und Kooperationen in ländlichen Gebieten ermöglicht. Die Landwirtschaftspolitik der Europäischen Union (EU) hat sich im Laufe der Zeit gewandelt und an die Bedürfnisse der Mitgliedstaaten sowie die globalen Herausforderungen angepasst. Die Gemeinsame Agrarpolitik (GAP) der EU hat sich seit ihrer Einführung in den 1960er Jahren von einer reinen Markt- und Preispolitik hin zu einem umfassenderen Ansatz entwickelt, der auch Umweltschutz, Tierwohl, Klimawandel und soziale Aspekte berücksichtigt. Die Reformen der GAP zielen darauf ab, die Nachhaltigkeit und Resilienz der Landwirtschaft zu verbessern und gleichzeitig den ökologischen Fußabdruck der Branche zu reduzieren. So sollen beispielsweise die Subventionen zunehmend an Umweltschutzmaßnahmen wie Bodenerhaltung, Wasserwirtschaft oder Biodiversität gekoppelt werden. Zusätzlich wird die EU auch Projekte unterstützen, die neue Technologien und innovative Lösungen für die Landwirtschaft fördern und so die Effizienz und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit steigern. Ein Beispiel hierfür ist die Verwendung von Präzisionslandwirtschaft, bei der satellitengestützte Systeme und Drohnen zum Einsatz kommen, um die Pflanzenproduktion effizienter und umweltverträglicher zu gestalten. Trotz der zunehmenden Bedeutung von Umweltschutz und Innovation bleibt die Sicherstellung einer fairen Einkommensverteilung für Landwirte einer der Hauptgründe für den beträchtlichen Agrarhaushalt der EU. Gerade in einer Zeit, in der viele ländliche Gebiete mit Problemen wie der Landflucht, demografischen Veränderungen und einer alternden Bevölkerung konfrontiert sind, ist es wichtig, den Erhalt der Landwirtschaft und ihrer Gemeinden zu gewährleisten. Letztendlich muss der Agrarhaushalt jedes Jahr sorgfältig abgewogen und an die jeweiligen Bedürfnisse und Herausforderungen angepasst werden. Dies ist notwendig, um eine nachhaltige, wettbewerbsfähige und umweltfreundliche Landwirtschaft in der EU zu gewährleisten und gleichzeitig die Lebensgrundlage der Landwirte und den sozialen Zusammenhalt in ländlichen Gebieten zu erhalten."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Cuba holds large gay rights rally Monday, May 19th 2008, 10:20 AM Mariela Castro, center, daughter of Cuba's President Raul Castro, presides the International Day Against Homophobia in Havana, May 17. HAVANA â Cuba's gay community celebrated unprecedented openness â and high-ranking political alliances â with a government-backed campaign against homophobia on Saturday. The meeting at a convention center in Havana's Vedado district may have been the largest gathering of openly gay activists ever on the communist-run island. President Raul Castro's daughter Mariela, who has promoted the rights of sexual minorities, presided. \\"This is a very important moment for us, the men and women of Cuba, because for the first time we can gather in this way and speak profoundly and with scientific basis about these topics,\\" said Castro, director of Cuba's Center for Sexual Education. Mariela Castro joined government leaders and hundreds of activists at the one-day conference for the International Day Against Homophobia that featured shows, lectures, panel discussions and book presentations. A station also offered blood-tests for sexually transmitted diseases. Cuban state television gave prime-time play Friday to the U.S. film \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" which tells the story of two cowboys who conceal their homosexual affair. Prejudice against homosexuals remains deeply rooted in Cuban society, but the government has steadily moved away from the Puritanism of the 1960s and 1970s, when homosexuals hid their sexuality for fear of being ridiculed, fired from work or even imprisoned. Now Cuba's parliament is studying proposals to legalize same-sex unions and give gay couples the benefits that people in traditional marriages enjoy. Parliament head Ricardo Alarcon said the government needs to do more to promote gay rights, but said many Cubans still need to be convinced. Things \\"are advancing, but must continue advancing, and I think we should do that in a coherent, appropriate and precise way because these are topics that have been taboo and continue to be for many,\\" Alarcon told reporters. Some at the conference spoke of streaming out into the streets for a spontaneous gay-pride parade, but others urged caution. The gay rights movement should be careful not to \\"flood\\" Cuban society with a message that many are not ready to hear, physician and gay activist Alberto Roque cautioned. And Mariela Castro said gay activists should opt for more subtle ways to chip away at deep-seated homophobic attitudes. Defending equal rights for Cubans, of all sexual orientations, is a key principal of the Cuban revolution led by her uncle Fidel Castro, who overthrew dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959, she said. \\"The freedom of sexual choice and gender identity (are) exercises in equality and social justice,\\" she said. Summary:","output":"In Cuba, there was a big event where many people who are gay came together to support each other and talk about how to make life better for gay people in their country. They had shows, lectures, and even blood tests for health checkups. This was important because, in the past, it was difficult to be openly gay in Cuba. Some people were not treated well, lost their jobs, or even went to jail. The government is now trying to change that and make things better for gay people in Cuba. They are thinking about letting gay couples get married and have the same benefits as other married couples. However, some people still don't agree with this, so they are trying to be careful and help others understand why this is important."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But also a question for economists, argued Kenneth Boulding, a British economist, in an essay published in 1966. We have run our economies, he warned, like cowboys on the open grassland: taking and using the world's resources, confident that more lies over the horizon. But the Earth is less a grassland than a spaceship--a closed system, alone in space, carrying limited supplies. We need, said Boulding, an economics that takes seriously the idea of environmental limits. In the half century since his essay, a new movement has responded to his challenge. \\"Ecological economists\\", as they call themselves, want to revolutionise its aims and assumptions. What do they say--and will their ideas achieve lift-off? To its advocators, ecological economics is neither ecology nor economics, but a mix of both. Their starting point is to recognise that the human economy is part of the natural world. Our environment, they note, is both a source of resources and a sink for wastes. But it is ignored in conventional textbooks, where neat diagrams trace the flows between firms, households and the government as though nature did not exist. That is a mistake, say ecological economists. There are two ways our economies can grow, ecological economists point out: through technological change, or through more intensive use of resources. Only the former, they say, is worth having. They are suspicious of GDP, a crude measure which does not take account of resource exhaustion, unpaid work, and countless other factors. In its place they advocate moreholistic  approaches, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), a composite index  that includes things like the cost of pollution, deforestation and car accidents. While GDP has kept growing, global GPI per person peaked in 1978: by destroying our environment we are making ourselves poorer, not richer.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who was transferred to the asylum while one of his children was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\"? , can you please find it?   Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although   on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\". There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the  music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century.

Harvard joins growing trend of arts education in med schools Aspiring doctors may not think they have time to gaze at paintings or play the viola while they’re cramming for anatomy tests. But Harvard Medical School thinks students should be doing more of that — and the school is not alone. This fall, Harvard launched a new initiative to use more drama, dance, and literature to help medical students become empathetic and reflective doctors. In doing so, Harvard joins a growing number of schools making more overt efforts to weave arts and humanities into medical education. The Yale School of Medicine, for instance, requires students to scrutinize paintings in a museum to improve their skills at observation and empathy — a program that has been replicated around the country, including at Harvard and Brown. At Columbia, incoming medical students are required to complete a six-week narrative medicine course. They can take classes in fiction writing, obituary writing, and visual art. At Penn State College of Medicine, the first medical school in the country to create its own humanities department, students can take a comics and medicine course to fulfill a required humanities elective. These kinds of programs are now spreading to more medical schools. “There is, on a national level, increasing support for this kind of activity,” said Dr. John Prescott, chief academic officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges. The arts have not been absent from Harvard’s medical campus, where students play in a popular orchestra and produce a literary magazine. But individual professors have been promoting the arts “in the dark, on their own,” said Dr. Joel Katz, a Harvard Medical School associate professor who takes students to Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts to hone their observation skills. Now, he said, the Arts and Humanities Initiative — which includes arts-themed field trips, an artist-in-residency each spring, monthly events like open mic nights, and a collaboration with Harvard’s American Repertory Theater — has coordinated existing efforts and expanded them. Efforts like these don’t aim to make doctors into artists, said Dr. Kenneth Ludmerer, a professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine who studies the history of medicine. They are “a tool to help doctors understand people and their conditions.” They help doctors see beyond the disease, the “narrow biological aspect,” to the illness, which includes anxiety, fear, and the whole human experience of being sick, he said. Medical schools started introducing ethics and literature into their curriculums in the 1960s, Ludmerer said. In the last decade, the movement has accelerated and broadened to include sociology, music, and most recently, art. That’s taken place partly as pushback against the growing specialization of medicine, combined with technological advances, that make doctors “cursingly narrow in their vision,” Ludmerer said. Despite the competing pressures — “standardizing care, technologizing care, quickening care, streamlining care, fragmenting care, sub-specializing care” — the medical humanities movement is gaining more institutional support from medical schools, said Dr. Rita Charon, executive director of Columbia’s Program in Narrative Medicine. She is working with several universities, including Dartmouth, McGill, and the University of Southern California, to incorporate arts and humanities into their medical programs. Research has found that physician empathy improves clinical outcomes for patients — but that empathy declines as students go through medical school and become desensitized. Museum-based observation courses do improve students’ visual diagnostic skills, studies show. But more evidence is needed to show that programs like these also improve students’ empathetic skills, said Dr. Horace DeLisser, associate dean for diversity and inclusion at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. His school is piloting a museum-based training course for students and conducting a scientific study to evaluate its impact. The study includes measuring whether the course improves students’ ability to recognize the emotions in photographs of actors’ eyes. Besides building empathetic skills, Harvard’s arts program aims to help students process the human tragedies they’re exposed to in medical school, said Dr. Lisa Wong, a pediatrician and musician who is helping to lead the initiative. “Medical school is so intense,” she said. “There’s a lot you have to suppress in yourself.” The more students learn to express their feelings through the arts, she said, “the less traumatized you will be.” Harvard’s program is starting on a small scale, with some seed money from the dean’s office and outside donors, and optional events instead of required course work. The Arts and Humanities Initiative’s first event of the year, on a rainy Wednesday night in September, drew just a handful of medical students. The occasion was a dramatic reading of Margaret Edson’s play “Wit,” about an English professor’s experience undergoing chemotherapy for metastatic ovarian cancer. Organizers put on the play to generate reflection and discussion about how hospitals treat — and mistreat — patients with their words and attitudes. Two medical students performed alongside drama students from Harvard. In a post-play discussion, Ivana Viani, a third-year medical student who performed in “Wit” two years ago, said the experience stuck with her as she moved into a hospital setting. One day on a clinical rotation, she said, she found herself standing by a patient’s bedside, presenting his case to a medical team. Radiological evidence had just shown the patient was very likely to have cancer, but Viani didn’t want to say the “c” word until there was a biopsy because the play showed her how powerful that word can be. “The attending [doctor] just interrupted me and said, ‘You have cancer.’ And we just left,” she recalled. After finishing her rounds, she went back to ask how he was doing. He started to cry. He asked her how long he had to live. She talked through the diagnosis and told him, “We’re going to go through this together.” Embodying someone else’s experience through theater helped Viani acknowledge what the patient was going through, she said. “You have a way to be there for a patient, in a way that you wouldn’t have been there before.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. Harvard Medical School launched an initiative to incorporate arts education into medical training with the aim of fostering empathy and reflection in medical students. 2. Other medical schools, including Yale, Columbia, and Penn State, have also introduced similar programs involving arts and humanities, aiming to help doctors understand the human aspects of patients' conditions beyond the biological aspect. 3. The integration of arts and humanities into medical curriculums has gained more institutional support and has shown positive results in improving students' observational skills, though more evidence is needed to confirm the impact on their empathetic skills. 4. Physician empathy has been linked with better clinical outcomes for patients, but the level of empathy declines as students progress through medical school. 5. Harvard's arts program also aims to help medical students process the emotional challenges they face during their medical education, potentially reducing the level of trauma experienced."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lewis Fry Richardson was the youngest of seven children born to Catherine Fry (1838-1919) and David Richardson (1835-1913). They were a prosperous Quaker family, David Richardson operating a successful tanning and leather manufacturing business. At age 12 he was sent to a Quaker boarding school, Bootham School in York, where he received an education in science, which stimulated an active interest in natural history. In 1898 he went on to Durham College of Science (a college of Durham University) where he took courses in mathematical physics, chemistry, botany, and zoology. Richardson also applied his mathematical skills in the service of his pacifist principles, in particular in understanding the basis of international conflict. For this reason, he is now considered the initiator, or co-initiator (with Quincy Wright and Pitirim Sorokin as well as others such as Kenneth Boulding, Anatol Rapaport and Adam Curle), of the scientific analysis of conflict--an interdisciplinary topic of quantitative and mathematical social science dedicated to systematic investigation of the causes of war and conditions of peace. As he had done with weather, he analysed war using mainly differential equations and probability theory. Considering the armament of two nations, Richardson posited an idealised system of equations whereby the rate of a nation's armament build-up is directly proportional to the amount of arms its rival has and also to the grievances felt toward the rival, and negatively proportional to the amount of arms it already has itself. Solution of this system of equations allows insightful conclusions to be made regarding the nature, and the stability or instability, of various hypothetical conditions which might obtain between nations.  He also originated the theory that the propensity for war between two nations was a function of the length of their common border. And in Arms and Insecurity (1949), and Statistics of Deadly Quarrels (1960), he sought to analyse the causes of war statistically. Factors he assessed included economics, language, and religion. In the preface of the latter, he wrote: \\"There is in the world a great deal of brilliant, witty political discussion which leads to no settled convictions. My aim has been different: namely to examine a few notions by quantitative techniques in the hope of reaching a reliable answer.\\"  In Statistics of Deadly Quarrels Richardson presented data on virtually every war from 1815 to 1945. As a result, he hypothesized a base 10 logarithmic scale for conflicts. In other words, there are many more small fights, in which only a few people die, than large ones that kill many. While no conflict's size can be predicted beforehand--indeed, it is impossible to give an upper limit to the series--overall they do form a Poisson distribution. On a smaller scale he showed the same pattern for gang murders in Chicago and Shanghai. Others have noted that similar statistical patterns occur frequently, whether planned (lotteries, with many more small payoffs than large wins), or by natural organisation (there are more small towns with grocery stores than big cities with superstores).

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.  - Bari (Bari dialect: Bare;  \\"Bárion\\") is the capital city of the Metropolitan City of Bari and of the Apulia region, on the Adriatic Sea, in Italy. It is the second most important economic centre of mainland Southern Italy after Naples, and is well known as a port and university city, as well as the city of Saint Nicholas. The city itself has a population of about 326,799, , over , while the urban area counts 653,028 inhabitants over . The metropolitan area counts 1.3 million inhabitants.  - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.  Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education.  - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role.  - Lupus Protospatharius Barensis was the reputed author of the Chronicon rerum in regno Neapolitano gestarum ( also called Annales Lupi Protospatharii ) , a precise history of the Mezzogiorno from 805 to 1102 . He has only been named as the author since the seventeenth century . Lupus , along with two other Bariot chronicles , the Annales barenses and the Anonymi barensis chronicon , used some lost ancient annals of Bari up to 1051 . William of Apulia appears to have used these same annals . Lupus also used the lost annals of Matera . Perhaps most unusual to Lupus is his dating method . He began his years in September and so places events of the latter half of a given year in the next year .  - The Normans (Norman: \\"Nourmands\\"; ) were the people who, in the 10th and 11th centuries, gave their name to Normandy, a region in France. They were descended from Norse (\\"Norman\\" comes from \\"Norseman\\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Gallo-Roman populations, their descendants would gradually adopt the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia, ultimately resulting in their own assimilation into the Romance society. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries.  - William of Apulia was a chronicler of the Normans, writing in the 1090s. His Latin epic, Gesta Roberti Wiscardi (\\"The Deeds of Robert Guiscard\\"), written in hexameters, is one of the principal contemporary sources for the Norman conquest of southern Italy, especially the career of Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia (10591085).  - Basilicata (or ), also known as Lucania, is a region in the south of Italy, bordering on Campania to the west, Apulia (\\"Puglia\\") to the north and east, and Calabria to the south. It also has two coastlines, one on the Tyrrhenian Sea between Campania and Calabria, and a longer coastline along the Gulf of Taranto between Calabria and Apulia. The region can be thought of as the \\"instep\\" of Italy, with Calabria functioning as the \\"toe\\" and Apulia the \\"heel\\". The region covers about and in 2010 had a population slightly under 600,000. The regional capital is Potenza. The region is divided into two provinces: Potenza and Matera. The president of Basilicata is Marcello Pittella.  - Matera (or locally ) is a city and a province in the region of Basilicata, in Southern Italy. It is the capital of the province of Matera and the capital of Basilicata from 1663 to 1806. The town lies in a small canyon carved out by the Gravina.  - Robert Guiscard ( 17 July 1085) was a Norman adventurer remembered for the conquest of southern Italy and Sicily. Robert was born into the Hauteville family in Normandy, went on to become Count of Apulia and Calabria (10571059), and then Duke of Apulia and Calabria and Duke of Sicily (10591085).  - Saint Nicholas; (15 March 270  6 December 343), also called Nikolaos of Myra, was a historic 4th-century Christian saint and Greek Bishop of Myra, in Asia Minor (modern-day Demre, Turkey). Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nikolaos the Wonderworker. His reputation evolved among the faithful, as was common for early Christian saints, and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus through Sinterklaas.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot).

Like the previous Sui dynasty, the Tang dynasty maintained a civil-service system by recruiting scholar-officials through standardized examinations and recommendations to office.  The rise of regional military governors known as jiedushi during the 9th century undermined this civil order.  Chinese culture flourished and further matured during the Tang era; it is traditionally considered the greatest age for Chinese poetry.  Two of China's most famous poets, Li Bai and Du Fu, belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as Han Gan, Zhang Xuan, and Zhou Fang.  Scholars of this period compiled a rich variety of historical literature, as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. The adoption of the title Tängri Qaghan by the Tang Emperor Taizong in addition to his title as emperor was eastern Asia's first \\"simultaneous kingship\\".Many notable innovations occurred under the Tang, including the development of woodblock printing.  Buddhism became a major influence in Chinese culture, with native Chinese sects gaining prominence.  However, in the 840s the Emperor Wuzong of Tang enacted policies to persecute Buddhism, which subsequently declined in influence. Although the dynasty and central government had gone into decline by the 9th century, art and culture continued to flourish. The weakened central government largely withdrew from managing the economy, but the country's mercantile affairs stayed intact and commercial trade continued to thrive regardless. However, agrarian rebellions in the latter half of the 9th century resulted in damaging atrocities such as the Guangzhou massacre of 878–879.  answer the following question:  Under what dynasty did the regional military governors gain power?

Help as much as you can. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: People have always wanted to speak with animals. There are many books about this, especially children books. Now there are also movies, such as Dr. Doolittle. When you watch animals, it seems clear that they can communicate with each other. Many people wonder why people can't also communicate with them.    Scientists know how some animals communicate. Bees, for example, use their bodies. They do a kind of dance to give information about food. Birds, on the other hand, share information with sounds. They use certain sounds to protect their homes and to stay together when they fly. Some male birds use lovely songs to attract a female . Other animals communicate with both body movements and sounds. For example, dogs wag their tails when they are happy, and they bark when they are excited.    People used to think it was possible to teach human language to animals. Parrots and other birds, for example, can learn to say words. But the birds just repeat the words. They don't understand them. Some American scientists tried to teach English to chimpanzees , close  s of human beings. However, this was impossible. Chimpanzees can't move their mouths the right way. They could never learn to speak like people.    Then scientists tried to teach human language to chimpanzees in other ways. Some tried with American Sign Language (ASL). Others tried with a simple computer. But chimpanzees could only learn to use a few words. They could never learn to use grammar. Their brains are very different from the brains of human beings.    Now some scientists are studying the same points between human and animal language. In fact, some animals use sounds like people do. Dogs, for example, use an unpleasant, low sound to tell other dogs to stay away. People, too, use that kind of voice to say the same things. A dog's noisy bark communicate that something is happening. People use the same high tone when they shout, \\"Watch out!\\"    Scientists want to understand the language of other animals, such as whales and bears. To do this, they go...

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Dr. Beecham  for the following movie plot:  A group of scientists with Operation Deep Freeze discover frozen prehistoric trees and other specimens in the Antarctic dating back to the first Ice Age. They collect samples of each for further study and load them aboard their C-47 military transport. The dull, workaday life at the Navy weather station base on Gow Island in the South Pacific is interrupted by that very same C-47 transport aircraft. On a routine approach for refueling, the transport experiences unusual trouble and suddenly crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying its control tower and the island's only two-way radio. The stricken aircraft also blocks the runway, preventing its further use. Lieutenant Charles Brown (Eisley) is in command of Gow's weather station. He, Navy nurse Nora Hall (Van Doren), and biologist Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) reach the wreck only to find that seven scientists and crew aboard the cargo aircraft when it left Antarctica are now mysteriously missing. The only one found aboard is the transport's pilot, who is traumatized and in a state of shock, unable to speak. Unloading the prehistoric cargo from the crashed C-47, Dr. Beecham recommends planting the trees to ensure their survival in the island's tropical conditions. Somewhat later, Gow Island's bird population becomes disturbed by something unknown. At the same time, the weather station's scientists try to figure out a connection between this event and a corrosive residue that begins turning up at various island locations. It slowly becomes clear that the planted prehistoric trees have quickly grown into acid-secreting, carnivorous monsters that move about Gow Island at night, at will. They reproduce fast and eventually cut off the island with their growing numbers and nocturnal assaults on Gow's native islanders. Brown has to hold together his dwindling Navy personnel and the coterie of scientists and civilians while figuing out a way to stop this prehistoric menace. The Navy personnel's only available weapons prove largely ineffective against...

Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process. If a person sweats less than usual or has reduced sweating, it will affect their body's ability to cool down efficiently. This could cause the person to become overheated more easily since the evaporation of sweat plays a crucial role in dissipating heat from the body's surface. In this case, the reduced moisture release and evaporation would decrease the cooling effect on the body, which could potentially lead to overheating, discomfort, and possible heat-related illnesses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On March 1, 2017, it was announced that the Gaither Vocal Band lineup consisted of Reggie Smith, Wes Hampton, Adam Crabb, Todd Suttles, and Bill Gaither, as of April 1. Although the group started out recording contemporary Christian music in the 1980s, it became known for southern gospel after the popularity of the Gaither Homecoming videos. The lineup of the band changes often, with artists leaving to work on solo careers, and new and old ones coming to replace them. Michael English was hired as the new lead singer, so McSpadden was moved down to baritone, and Gaither dropped to the lowest part. At this point the group dropped the \\"new\\" part of their name. Although the previous album (New Point of View) had been more contemporary than its predecessors, the album with this version of the group (One X 1) took it even further. After this album, Larnelle left and was replaced by Lemuel Miller. The group did not record an album with Lemuel before he too left. He was replaced by Imperials alumnus, Jim Murray. This line up cut one album (Wings) before Gary McSpadden left to start his solo career. Mark Lowry was convinced to replace him. Along with a great voice, Lowry added comedy to the mix. Their Gospel roots project Homecoming in 1991 caused most Southern Gospel fans to welcome the Vocal Band with open arms. Jim Murray left and was replaced by Terry Franklin. The album Southern Classics was released in 1993 with the hit \\"I Bowed On My Knees\\".  Later Michael English left. He was replaced by Buddy Mullins. Mullins was only a temporary fill-in, but he was included on the album Testify. Terry Franklin soon left and was replaced by yet another Imperials alumnus, Jonathan Pierce (formerly known as Jonathan Hildreth, his first and last name--then changed to his first and middle name). Strengthened by the popularity of the Homecoming video series, the Vocal Band added Guy Penrod at lead. After Pierce's departure, Gaither hired David Phelps at tenor. After Lowry's departure, Imperials alumnus Russ Taff sang baritone for a couple of years. Marshall Hall was his replacement. Wes Hampton succeeded Phelps in 2005.  The group has had three number one songs on the Singing News chart. \\"Yes, I Know\\" held the top position from July to October 1997, as did \\"I Will Go On\\" in November 2006. \\"Greatly Blessed\\" was their third number one single. The group has routinely performed classic Southern Gospel songs including many written by Bill and Gloria Gaither like \\"He Touched Me\\", \\"I Believe In A Hill Called Mount Calvary\\", and \\"Sinner Saved By Grace.\\" Entity:","output":"The text is about the Gaither Vocal Band, an American southern gospel vocal group founded and led by Bill Gaither."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Premise: \\"My only thought was to get out in the corridor as quick as ever I could.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I thought about many things before walking out into the corridor. \\"?","output":"If the premise \\"My only thought was to get out in the corridor as quick as ever I could\\" is true, it suggests that the individual was solely focused on leaving the current space and entering the corridor as fast as possible. The situation implies a sense of urgency, where the person did not have the luxury of time to contemplate or think about various matters. There might be external factors or conditions that trigger this determination to move quickly. It could be due to fear, danger, anxiety, or a pressing matter that demands expeditious attention. However, the hypothesis \\"I thought about many things before walking out into the corridor\\" suggests a different scenario. It implies that the individual had the time and the mental capacity to consider multiple subjects, factors, or concerns before taking action. This situation indicates that the individual was not dealing with the same sense of urgency as in the premise. Comparing the premise and the hypothesis reveals a notable contradiction. The premise highlights the urgency of the individual's thoughts and actions, focusing on escaping the area and entering the corridor as quickly as possible. In contrast, the hypothesis involves a more relaxed and contemplative state of mind, where the individual takes the time to mull over various topics before deciding to walk out into the corridor. Given this dissonance between the two statements, it can be reasonably concluded that if the premise is true, it does not entail the hypothesis. The idea of having only one thought centered on swiftly moving to the corridor directly negates the hypothesis that the individual had the time, mental capacity or inclination to think about multiple aspects before walking out into the corridor. In summary, if the premise \\"My only thought was to get out in the corridor as quick as ever I could\\" is indeed accurate, it contradicts and therefore does not entail the hypothesis \\"I thought about many things before walking out into the corridor.\\" The two situations portrayed are fundamentally incompatible, as one involves a single-minded focus with a sense of urgency, while the other revolves around a more deliberate, reflective state of mind that considers a range of subjects or concerns before taking action."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Draw them by making two or three large, rod-shaped ovals in the cell but outside the nucleus. Each mitochondrion (singular) should contain an enclosed shape with many ridges and switchback lines. This shape represents the mitochondrial cristae or inner folds of the organelle's membrane that provide more surface area to carry out processes. Leave a gap between the oval of the outer membrane and the inner membrane. Starting at one edge of the nuclear membrane, draw a large shape that extends out of the membrane with several finger-like shapes pointing to each side before reconnecting to the nucleus. This entire shape is the endoplasmic reticulum. The shape should be fairly large because the endoplasmic reticulum can take up as much as 10% of the volume of the entire cell. Animal cells have both a smooth and a rough endoplasmic reticulum. To make the rough endoplasmic reticulum, place dots on the outside edge of the finger-like shapes on one side of the endoplasmic reticulum. These dots represent ribosomes. To make the Golgi body (or Golgi apparatus), draw a set of three dumbbell-type shapes that are cylindrical at the center and bulbous at the ends. Each dumbbell should successively increase in size as they get farther from the nucleus and closer to the cell membrane.  The Golgi body packages and sends complex molecules around and out of the cell. It does this via vesicles that you can represent around the Golgi body with a few small circles.  Capitalize Golgi since it is the name of the discovering biologist. Centrioles help assist with cell division. They are close to but separate from the nucleus. Form the centrioles by drawing two small rectangles perpendicular to each other near the nucleus. The centrioles are paired organelles, which is why you draw two of the rectangles together. The lysosome is like the scrapyard of the cell that breaks down unneeded material to reuse. Represent the lysosome with a small circle at the edge of the cell. Add many small dots in the lysosome to show the digestive enzymes inside, which is called a hydrolytic enzyme mixture. You can place the lysosome near the Golgi apparatus since the organelles are often budded from the Golgi body. Ribosomes also float around in the cytosol, which is the cellular fluid inside the membrane but outside of all the organelles. Show the extra ribosomes in the cytosol by making several more dots inside the cell.  If you have color-coordinated your drawing, make the ribosomes in the cell, attached to the nuclear membrane, and attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum all the same color. Cytosol and cytoplasm are often used interchangeably for the fluid in the cell. Though the fluid in the nucleus is nucleoplasm.","output":"The article provides a comprehensive guide to drawing various organelles within an animal cell, including details on illustrating mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi body, centrioles, lysosomes, and ribosomes, while explaining their functions and interrelationships within the cellular structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Not much negative to say about the club itself besides the fact that it was SUPER Packed, but hey, its supposed to be one of the most poppin clubs in vegas so I can't complain about this too much.    Here's the deal with Kalani.  I had reserved a table with 3 bottles for me and my buddies through a promoter.  He passed on my info to Kalani and I got a text the day before confirming the table and our price minimum.  I responded quickly to confirm and he says make sure were there by 10:30 and to call him when we arrive.  So far so good.  Anyways, we get there early, around 10.  I call him and communication is pretty horrible, not his fault, it was loud and there was already a long line.  He says come to the front of the general admission line.  I look for him for a while and after some confusion we finally meet up.  He tells another host to take care of my group so we go through and pass the entire line and get let into the club.  So far so good.  Now, were in front of the cashier and my friends are just waiting for me since I'm organizing all of this.  Keep in mind, this is my first time trying to get a table in vegas.  So one of my buddies asks if I got a receipt slip from Kalani, i didn't, so i go back out and ask kalani what were supposed to do.  He finishes helping the dude before us and starts writing on the receipt slip and communicating with his ear piece.    He repeats my name into his mic and proceeds to say \\"His name is Sennett, s-e-n-n-e-t-t, he's in the system\\".  And a minute later, he looks over and says, sorry man they don't have your table.    I look at him with a perplexed look and say, \\"what?, what are you talking about\\".    ANYWAYS... He proceeds to tell me and my group to pay the cover to get in, and that a table should open up in an hour and that he would reimburse our cover and give us our originally agreed upon table minimum.  He says he will stay in contact with me via text.    At that point, I realized that we had just gotten fucked over and that we weren't getting a table.  I felt bad and responsible for me and my friends not getting a table.  We paid the cover and got in and of course did not hear anything back from Kalani.    Ended up still having a pretty good time but that started our night off at XS in a sour manner...","output":"To determine the sentiment of the review, I will analyze each part of the review and the tone of the writer. 1. \\"This 1 star rating is for the VIP Host by the name of Kalani.\\" - Negative sentiment 2. \\"If I didn't have this unfortunate dealing with kalani, XS would've probably gotten 5 stars from me.\\" - Positive sentiment about the club but negative about the interaction with Kalani. 3. \\"The Club is very nice, outdoor pool area and table games is nice, music was cool, crowd was cool.\\" - Positive sentiment 4. \\"Not much negative to say about the club itself besides the fact that it was SUPER Packed, but hey, its supposed to be one of the most poppin clubs in vegas so I can't complain about this too much.\\" - Neutral to slightly positive sentiment, as the author acknowledges the crowd as being expected. 5. The long paragraph detailing the issues with Kalani in securing a table is mostly negative sentiment, as it describes a frustrating and ultimately unsuccessful experience. 6. \\"Ended up still having a pretty good time but that started our night off at XS in a sour manner...\\" - Mixed sentiment, as the author mentions having a good time despite the negative experience. Conclusion: The overall sentiment of this review is mixed but leans towards negative, primarily due to the author's experiences with VIP host Kalani. However, there is some positive sentiment about the club itself, its amenities, and the fact that they still had a good time in the end. The negative experiences with the VIP host, Kalani, seem to outweigh the positive aspects of the club in this review, leading to a 1-star rating."},{"instruction":"Given the following context:  In Spring 1989, sisters, Alex, and Annie Morrell, finish prep school and return home to start college.

A better, more detailed answer would be: The Never Ending Story, a West German-produced English-language film, was released in 1984. The film, directed by Wolfgang Petersen, is based on the fantasy novel of the same name written by Michael Ende. The movie, featuring a blend of live-action and animation, tells the story of a young boy named Bastian who becomes immersed in the fantastical world of a book he discovers. As he reads, he is drawn into the struggle between the forces of good and evil in the magical land of Fantasia, which is threatened by a malevolent force called The Nothing. The Never Ending Story achieved commercial success at the box office and received generally positive reviews from critics. Moreover, the soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder and Klaus Doldinger, including the iconic theme song by Limahl, added to the film's popularity.

Write an article based on this \\"Factory workers found in an anti-slavery raid in Greater Manchester \\"clung\\" to officers and begged to be rescued, police said.\\"","output":"Title: Factory Workers Found in Anti-Slavery Raid: A Glimpse into Modern Slave Labor in Greater Manchester Introduction In a recent raid in Greater Manchester, police officers were shocked to find factory workers clinging to them and begging to be rescued from deplorable working conditions, highlighting the persisting issue of modern slavery in the workforce. Despite increased efforts to combat human trafficking and forced labor worldwide, incidents such as this one reveal the harsh reality faced by countless individuals. This article examines this recent raid and its broader implications, delving into the hidden world of modern slave labor in Greater Manchester and beyond. The Raid Acting on a tip-off, Greater Manchester Police led an operation targeting a local factory suspected of housing slave labor. The police found numerous workers toiling in cramped and unsanitary conditions, with limited access to basic necessities such as food and water. Chillingly, some of these workers were so desperate for rescue that they \\"clung\\" to officers, pleading for help as they were removed from the environment. The police have since arrested several individuals, with authorities gathering evidence and resources to protect the victims and ensure that justice is served. This case has illuminated the need for continued vigilance and action against modern slavery, not just in Greater Manchester, but in workplaces across the country. Modern Slavery in Greater Manchester While the anti-slavery raid is a significant achievement in the ongoing fight against human trafficking and forced labor, it exposes a grave reality in Greater Manchester. Regrettably, these victims are not alone in their suffering — modern slavery is a widespread issue that affects countless vulnerable individuals within the local community. According to the Global Slavery Index, over 40 million people worldwide are subjected to modern slavery, including forced labor and human trafficking. Many of these victims are working in the shadows of society, too afraid or unable to seek help. Tragically, exploitation and slave labor persist in various sectors, such as agriculture, construction, hospitality, and domestic work. Factors Contributing to Modern Slavery Several key factors contribute to the prevalence of modern slavery, even in developed economies like the UK. A lack of awareness and information on the topic exacerbates the issue, as many victims are unable or unwilling to seek help due to fear, shame, or ignorance. Moreover, loose regulations and enforcement in high-risk industries provide fertile ground for exploitation. Perpetrators often prey on vulnerable populations, such as migrants and refugees, who may be fleeing war, persecution, or poverty. These individuals can be more susceptible to exploitation due to factors like language barriers, limited access to legal employment opportunities, and a need for income to support themselves and their families. Recognizing and Combating Modern Slavery Recognizing the signs of modern slavery is crucial for everyone, from law enforcement officials to ordinary citizens. Indicators can include signs of physical or emotional abuse, a lack of personal belongings, restricted social interactions, and long or unreasonable working hours. As awareness of the issue grows, efforts to combat modern slavery and protect its victims must continue. The Modern Slavery Act of 2015 was a crucial step forward, but ongoing collaboration between the government, law enforcement agencies, businesses, and NGOs is necessary to make a meaningful impact.        Regularly reviewing and reporting on labor exploitation, providing resources and support to victims, and ensuring accountability for companies are all vital components that strengthen the fight against modern slavery. Moreover, educating the public through awareness campaigns and fostering a culture of vigilance and empathy will help bring slave labor out of the shadows and into the light. Conclusion As the Greater Manchester raid illustrates, modern slavery remains a dire issue that requires continued attention and action. By recognizing its existence, understanding its contributing factors, and implementing the appropriate measures to combat it, we can work towards a future that safeguards the rights of all workers, regardless of their background or circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

The 'Pilgrim's Way' runs in an easterly direction from Winchester in Hampshire, to which city?","output":"The 'Pilgrim's Way' is an ancient track that runs in an easterly direction from Winchester in Hampshire to the city of Canterbury in Kent. The route stretches for approximately 153 miles (246 km) and has been followed by countless travelers, including pilgrims, for centuries. Canterbury, the final destination of the Pilgrim's Way, is a historic English cathedral city located in the southeast part of the country. It is known for its world-famous Canterbury Cathedral, which is the seat of the spiritual head of the Church of England. The city has a rich religious history, drawing pilgrims from near and far to visit its magnificent cathedral, as well as the other historic sites it hosts. Canterbury's cultural and historic significance further grew after the famous murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket in the cathedral in 1170. In response to this event, Christians from across the region began to visit his shrine, leading to the creation of the 'Pilgrim's Way.' The journey, later immortalized in Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th-century literary masterpiece, \\"The Canterbury Tales,\\" became a significant aspect of medieval life in England, bringing together people from all social classes to share their experiences and tell their stories. The 'Pilgrim's Way' traverses through picturesque landscapes, idyllic villages, and historic sites. The route typically starts at Winchester Cathedral, passes through towns and villages such as New Alresford, Farnham, Guildford, and Westerham, skirts London, and crosses the River Medway before entering the lush countryside of Kent. Throughout the journey, travelers can explore ancient churches, medieval castles, and heritage sites, all while enjoying the natural beauty that England has to offer. Upon reaching Canterbury, pilgrims can relive the history by visiting the famous Canterbury Cathedral, where the shrine of Archbishop Thomas Becket is found. Other historical landmarks in the city include St. Augustine's Abbey, St. Martin's Church (the oldest church in England), and the Canterbury Heritage Museum. Today, modern-day pilgrims and outdoor enthusiasts can still follow the 'Pilgrim's Way' by walking, cycling, or horseback riding along the ancient trail. They can experience the rich history, fascinating stories, and stunning landscapes associated with the journey, all while reflecting on what it might have been like for medieval travelers walking the same path hundreds of years ago."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After a while he stopped doing it. Tom noticed his slippers smelled really bad. He got a new pair and his dog fetched them again. Can we draw the following conclusion? tom owns at least one pair of slippers","output":"Based on the provided information, we can analyze Tom's behavior with his dog and his slippers in detail to draw conclusions. Initially, Tom's dog was trained to fetch his slippers for him, and the dog did this every single time. This implies that Tom did own a pair of slippers, which his dog fetched for him consistently. However, after some time, the dog stopped fetching the slippers, and Tom realized that his slippers smelled bad. It is evident that those bad-smelling slippers were the ones Tom owned, and so he had at least one pair of slippers causing that issue. The fact that Tom identified the problem and procured new slippers confirms that he understood the significance of having a clean pair of slippers to prompt his dog to continue fetching them. Once Tom got a new pair of slippers, the dog resumed fetching them for him again. This exchange indicates that Tom acknowledged the issue and made the effort to rectify it. At this point, Tom owns another pair of slippers, which replaced the old smelly ones. Taking these factors into consideration, we can draw the conclusion that Tom owns at least one pair of slippers. In fact, it can be inferred that Tom has owned at least two pairs of slippers considering that he initially had the smelly pair and eventually purchased a new one to replace it.

Not long after this an event occurred which produced great excitement in the new settlement; namely, the appearance of natives in the woods. It occurred under the following circumstances.  One morning Karlsefin gave orders for one of the exploring parties to be got ready to go out immediately. Karlsefin's plan from the beginning had been to class his men in two divisions. One half stayed at home to work, the other half searched the land,--always taking care, however, not to travel so far but that they could return home in the evening. They were careful also not to wander far from each other. Sometimes Karlsefin went with the exploring party, at other times stayed at home to superintend the work there, while Biarne or Thorward filled his place. On the occasion in question Biarne was in charge.  Soon after the party had started, Hake, who was one of them, observed a female figure disappear round a copse near the shores of the lake. At that part they were about to strike off into the thick woods, so Hake went up to Biarne and asked leave to go along by the borders of the lake, saying that he could overtake the party again before they had reached the Willow Glen, a well-known rendezvous of the hunters and explorers of the colony.  \\"Go as thou wilt, Hake,\\" replied Biarne; \\"only see to it that ye overtake us before noon, as I intend to go on a totally new path to-day.\\"  1.

UPDATED:. 17:48 EST, 5 September 2012. Fall from grace: A federal probe found former Harvard psychology professor Marc Hauser to be responsible for six cases of research misconduct. Federal investigators have found that a Harvard University psychology professor who resigned after being accused of scientific transgression fabricated data and manipulated results in experiments. The findings detailing Marc Hauser's transgressions were contained in a report by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Research Integrity (ORI) released Wednesday online. Hauser, 52, left Harvard last summer, ten months after a faculty investigation found him ‘solely responsible’ for eight instances of scientific misconduct at the prestigious Ivy League school, the Boston Globe reported. The federal document found six cases in which Hauser engaged in research misconduct in work supported by four National Institutes of Health grants. One paper was retracted and two were corrected. Other problems were found in unpublished work. Hauser released a statement Wednesday, saying that although he has fundamental differences with the findings, he acknowledges that he made mistakes. ‘I let important details get away from my control, and as head of the lab, I take responsibility for all errors made within the lab, whether or not I was directly involved,’ he stated. ‘I am saddened that this investigation has caused some to question all of my work, rather than the few papers and unpublished studies in question. ‘I remain proud of the many important papers generated by myself, my collaborators and my students over the years. I am also deeply gratified to see my students carve out significant areas of research at major universities around the world,’ Hauser said. Internal probe: A three-year investigation at Harvard found in 2010 that Hauser had committed eight instances of scientific misconduct. In one instance, investigators determined that Hauser fabricated half the data in a bar graph in a research paper on cotton-top tamarind monkeys’ ability to learn syllables that was published in 2002 in the journal Cognition. According to the findings of the probe, the 52-year-old professor ‘falsified the coding’ of some monkeys’ responses to sound stimuli in two unpublished papers to ensure that a particular finding does not appear random, and ‘falsely reported the results and methodology’ for one of seven experiments in a paper published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B in 2007. A paper examining monkeys’ abilities to learn grammatical patterns included false descriptions of how the monkeys’ behavior was coded, ‘leading to a false proportion or number of animals showing a favorable response,’ the report stated. The document, which will be published in the Federal Register Thursday, comes on the heels of a three-year internal investigation at Harvard that found in 2010 that the popular professor had committed eight instances of scientific misconduct. According to the report, Hauser ‘neither admits nor denies committing research misconduct but accepts ORI has found evidence of research misconduct.’ As part of a voluntary settlement, the former professor has accepted several professional restrictions for the next three years. New job: Hauser currently works with at-risk youth at the Alternative Education Program at Cape Cod Collaborative. Hauser has agreed to have any research supported by the U.S. Public Health Service supervised, to exclude himself from serving as an adviser to the PHS, and to have his employer guarantee the accuracy of his data and methodology before applying for federal funding. According to his LinkedIn profile, Hauser currently works with at-risk youth at the Alternative Education Program at Cape Cod Collaborative. Houser, a published author of popular books favored by the media, gained wide recognition for his research into the evolutionary roots of human abilities, including language, and whether morality was inborn or learned. Less than a week ago, Hauser's former Ivy League employer made national headlines after it has been revealed that 125 students at the prestigious institution are being investigated for allegedly cheating on a take-home exam.","output":"So, imagine if you're playing a game and you cheat to win, but then get caught, you'd be in a lot of trouble, right?

But then people found out he was cheating in his research - that's like the homework he does as a teacher. They discovered he made up some of his results instead of finding them out the right way. He was found to have cheated six times on a big project funded by the National Institutes of Health. Because of all this, he had to leave his job at Harvard. Now, he's helping young people who are having a tough time with their lives, which is very different to what he used to do.

Ethem Orhon, 67, is accused of attacking the women in a Sainsbury's car park in Hampton, London, on 20 May, Kingston Crown Court heard he had been arrested for possession of a knife on 19 May and was bailed two hours before the alleged assaults. Mr Orhon, of Hampton, denies two counts of attempted murder. He has also pleaded not guilty to two counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The prosecution says Suzanna Brand, 53, Janet Morsy, 63, Jean Sullivan, 68, and Charandasi Chandiramani, 71, were entirely innocent and selected at random in the car park in south-west London. The court heard they had suffered appalling injuries after Mr Orhon attacked them with a Leatherman knife, which was shown to the jury. Ms Brand was stabbed 12 times, including in her back and side that led to two collapsed lungs and laceration to her liver. Ms Morsy was heard pleading \\"please don't\\" shortly before Mr Orhon stabbed her three times. She lost a litre of blood in the attack. The jury heard that Mr Orhon did not say a word during the attacks, but was eventually stopped by police officers who had to draw their Tasers before he surrendered. The prosecution said Mr Orhon felt he had been mistreated by the police and that this was his motive for the attacks. It said the trial would hear of the \\"true bravery\\" of members of the public who tried to help, including two school children who may have prevented further attacks by distracting him and calling the police.

Available options: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no;...I think the answer is","output":"c). no. It is not possible to conclude that \\"A young lady with a pink shirt and white hat is standing on her horse with her hand over her heart\\" if \\"The man is riding his scooter next to the park\\" for a number of reasons. First and foremost, the two scenarios presented in these statements are completely unrelated. The first statement describes a young lady and her actions while riding a horse, while the second statement describes a man riding a scooter next to a park. There is no connection or common ground between these two situations that would allow us to draw any conclusions about the young lady based on the information about the man. In addition to the lack of connection between the two situations, the statements themselves do not provide any overlapping or shared information. The first statement gives details about the young lady's attire and how she is positioned on her horse, while the second statement provides information about the man's mode of transportation and his location. There is no shared context, such as both subjects being in the same location or involved in the same activity, that could possibly link these statements and permit any conclusions to be drawn. Even if we consider additional possibilities or interpretations for these statements, it remains impossible to establish any conclusions about the young lady based on the information given about the man. For example, we might speculate that the man and young lady know each other, or that they are both participants in a parade or event. However, even in these alternative scenarios, we still lack sufficient information to definitively conclude anything about the young lady and her actions based on the man's actions. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the two statements, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the young lady with the pink shirt and white hat standing on her horse with her hand over her heart from the statement about the man riding his scooter next to the park.

Exploration occurs in all non-sessile animal species, including humans. In human history, its most dramatic rise was during the Age of Discovery when European explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world for a variety of reasons. Since then, major explorations after the Age of Discovery have occurred for reasons mostly aimed at information discovery.  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.  - Space exploration is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of continuously evolving and growing space technology. While the study of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, the physical exploration of space is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight.  - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole.  - Human spaceflight (also referred to as manned spaceflight) is space travel with a crew or passengers aboard the spacecraft. Spacecraft carrying people may be operated directly, by human crew, or it may be either remotely operated from ground stations on Earth or be autonomous, able to carry out a specific mission with no human involvement.  - The International Astronomical Union (IAU UAI) is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy. Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them.  - Stamatios ( Tom ) M. Krimigis ( Greek :   ) is a Greek - American scientist in space exploration . He has contributed to many of the United States ' unmanned space exploration programs of the Solar System and beyond . He has contributed to exploration missions to almost every planet of the Solar System . In 1999 , the International Astronomical Union named the asteroid 8323 Krimigis ( previously 1979 UH ) in his honor .  - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.  - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects  either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies.

A USCG pilot and his winchman Haig answer an SOS call at sea and arrive at a derelict schooner, the Requite. Haig lowers himself to the ship, where he finds three dead bodies along with one survivor, Eva, cowering in the cabin. As the pilot attempts to retrieve Haig and Eva with a rescue basket, the line breaks, plunging the two into the ocean.  After they swim back to the boat, the pilot informs Haig that he must return to base because his fuel is borderline.  Eva and Haig spend the night on the boat, during which time she recounts the story of the storm that killed everyone else aboard. She explains to him that the strange events began soon after they found a priest drifting in the ocean, apparently a survivor of a disaster. Then, she tells Haig of the violent storm that caused all of the freakish deaths on the boat. One man was hurled through a hatch; one is hanging from the ship's mast; another vanished before her eyes; and a fourth man is in an aft compartment, floating in the air. Eva attributes the deaths to supernatural causes, but Haig has a practical explanation for everything, including the man who appears to be floating in the air.  Early the next morning, the pilot returns along with the Coast Guard cutter Venturous.  Haig and Eva are transferred from the Requite to the deck of the Venturous, where they board the helicopter for the flight back to Miami.  At the same time, Coast Guard personnel from the Venturous investigate the wrecked schooner.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her. According to the above context, answer the following question. The narrating nurse probably believes that: Choices: 1). Connie was worth defending before she took action. 2). not enough information. 3). Connie will report the then impatient nurse for pouring cold water on her. 4).

Public speaking is not a \\"gift\\" like musical talent or being able to draw. Anybody who can talk can speak in public. Here are some tips:     Keep it simple. Your audience is going to learn one or two from your main ideas by heart.  If you can't express, then your speech is not focused well enough. And if you don't have a clear idea of what you want to say, then your audience will have no interest in your speech.      Get organized. No matter how long or short your speech is, you'd better get your materials in order: how you're going to start, what major points you want to make and how you're going to close. You may often write the last sentence first. When you know what your aim is, you can choose any ways to get there. A strong close is powerful. The last thing you say is what your audience will most likely remember.      Keep it short. The standard length of a vaudeville act was 12 minutes.

Movie title: Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Movie plot: Paul Newman (Brick) and Elizabeth Taylor (Maggie) in an early scene from the film Late one night, a drunken Brick Pollitt (Paul Newman) is out trying to recapture his glory days of high school sports by leaping hurdles on a track field, dreaming about his moments as a youthful athlete. Unexpectedly, he falls and breaks his leg, leaving him dependent on a crutch. Brick, along with his wife, Maggie \\"the Cat\\" (Elizabeth Taylor), are seen the next day visiting his family's estate in eastern Mississippi, there to celebrate Big Daddy's (Burl Ives) 65th birthday. Depressed, Brick decides to spend his days drinking while resisting the affections of his wife, who taunts him about the inheritance of Big Daddy's wealth. Numerous allusions are made to their tempestuous marriage â there are speculations as to why Maggie does not yet have children while Brick's brother Gooper (Jack Carson) and his wife Mae (Madeleine Sherwood) have a whole clan, many of whom run around the \\"plantation\\" (as Big Daddy's estate is called) unsupervised and singing obnoxiously. Big Daddy and Big Mama (Judith Anderson) arrive home from the hospital via their private airplane and are greeted by Gooper and his wife, along with Maggie. Despite the efforts of Mae, Gooper and their kids to draw his attention to them, Big Daddy has eyes only for Maggie. The news is that Big Daddy is not dying from cancer. However, the doctor later meets privately with first Gooper and then Brick where he divulges that it is a deception. Big Daddy has inoperable cancer and will likely be dead within a year, and the truth is being kept from him. Brick later confides in Maggie with the truth about Big Daddy's health, and she is very heartbroken. Maggie wants Brick to take an interest in his fatherâs wealth as well as health, but Brick stubbornly refuses. As the party winds down for the night, Big Daddy meets with Brick in his room and reveals that he is fed up with his alcoholic sonâs behavior, demanding to know why he is so stubborn.

The vehicle is always dirty and they have to rewash it and end up throwing in discounted goodies to help make up for poor workmanship.  Today after they had to wash my wifes car twice and waxed mine to make it right, I got in the truck to find 11 empty water bottles, 2 aluminum coke cans, two Styrofoam cups and an assortment of napkins and trash on the floor (we had just finished a road trip of sorts).

Context: The process of desegregation at Washington University began in 1947 with the School of Medicine and the School of Social Work. During the mid and late 1940s, the University was the target of critical editorials in the local African American press, letter-writing campaigns by churches and the local Urban League, and legal briefs by the NAACP intended to strip its tax-exempt status. In spring 1949, a Washington University student group, the Student Committee for the Admission of Negroes (SCAN), began campaigning for full racial integration. In May 1952, the Board of Trustees passed a resolution desegregating the school's undergraduate divisions.

The process of respiration and oxygen delivery as you described mainly depends on the proper functioning of the respiratory and circulatory systems. Environmental factors such as air quality and humidity can have some impact on the ease of breathing, but they do not directly affect the amount of oxygen absorbed by the blood vessels. The absence of a rainy season might lead to higher temperatures and reduced humidity, which could potentially cause discomfort or difficulty in breathing for some individuals, especially those with pre-existing respiratory conditions.

Answer the following question: What is the name of the province in whose southern areas are found the only extensive agriculture?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The province has a saltwater coastline bordering Hudson Bay and more than 110,000 lakes, covering approximately 15.6 percent or 101,593 square kilometres (39,225 sq mi) of its surface area. Manitoba's major lakes are Lake Manitoba, Lake Winnipegosis, and Lake Winnipeg, the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. Some traditional Native lands and boreal forest on Lake Winnipeg's east side are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site.Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. This basin's rivers reach far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the Red, Assiniboine, Nelson, Winnipeg, Hayes, Whiteshell and Churchill rivers. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This region, particularly the Red River Valley, is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.Baldy Mountain is the province's highest point at 832 metres (2,730 ft) above sea level, and the Hudson Bay coast is the lowest at sea level. Riding Mountain, the Pembina Hills, Sandilands Provincial Forest, and the Canadian Shield are also upland regions. Much of the province's sparsely inhabited north and east lie on the irregular granite Canadian Shield, including Whiteshell, Atikaki, and Nopiming Provincial Parks.Extensive agriculture is found only in the province's southern areas, although there is grain farming in the Carrot Valley Region (near The Pas). The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%). Around 12 percent of Canada's farmland is in Manitoba.

There's poignant drama in this brash, sometimes overstated film, and Muriel's transformation is truly touching. 4. Toni Collette gives an incredible performance - plus, there's a great use of Abba music. 5. Toni Collette gives a wonderful performance. 6. It stars the somewhat homely Toni Collette as Muriel, whose whole purpose in life is to get married. How she does that and what happens after that are a couple of the many delightful surprises in this film. 7. Ultimately, the comedy here is grounded in self-hatred, hostility, and despair. 8. So overrated. 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' for the nineties. 9. There are some funny and inventive sequences here, but for the most part Muriel's Wedding is disappointingly simplistic and cliched. 10. The film's good heart keeps it from ever making fun of Muriel, although there are moments that must have been tempting. What was the overall consensus about the movie?","output":"Analyzing these reviews, it seems that the overall consensus about the movie is mostly positive.

The second review praises the writer-director for unexpected twists, indicating that the story is unique and unpredictable. It also mentions an 'uplifting conclusion' which implies a positive feel. 3. The third review describes the film as brash and sometimes overstated, but also finds poignant drama and a touching transformation — suggesting these as good qualities. 4. Reviews four and five both specifically praise Toni Collette's performance, indicating that the acting is good. 5. The sixth review also speaks well of Collette's performance and hints at delightful surprises in the film, which is another positive aspect. 6. The seventh review mentions that the comedy is grounded in negative emotions, which depending upon the viewer's taste, could be seen as either negative or positive. 7. The eighth and ninth reviews are more negative, considering the movie overrated and cliched. 8. The tenth approval states that the film's good heart keeps it from making fun of one of its characters; this could be seen as a sign of good humor and empathy in the film. Out of 10 reviews, two are clearly negative, one is mixed, and the remaining seven are positive to varying degrees.

The Czech star's straight-sets win of 6-2, 6-0, 7-6 showcased his exceptional ability and propelled him towards a semifinal meeting with either Andy Murray or Nick Kyrgios. Berdych's victory over Nadal was nothing short of stunning, as he exhibited an aggressive, focused, and relentless style of play that dismantled the Spaniard on the Rod Laver Arena. The Czech tennis ace's tactical game plan was spot-on, as he applied constant pressure on Nadal, exploiting every opportunity presented to him. The first set began with both players holding their respective serves. However, Berdych quickly gained momentum and went on a rampage against a visibly flustered Nadal. The strong baseline strokes and precise service game that the Spaniard was known for seemed to vanish under the pressure applied by Berdych. As a result, Berdych took the first set 6-2, putting Nadal on the defensive. The second set saw Berdych continuing his domineering display, as the world No.7 broke Nadal's serve repeatedly. Surprisingly, he secured the set 6-0, a scoreline that few had ever seen against the Spaniard. This \\"bagel\\" only heightened the sense of shock piercing through the crowd. With his back against the wall, Nadal fought back in the third set, as he sought to turn the tide in his favor and prevent a humiliating defeat. The set was a more closely contested affair, with both players engaging in thrilling rallies showcasing their athleticism and skill. However, as the set progressed to a tiebreak, it became apparent that Berdych was the stronger competitor. He emerged victorious in the tiebreak, clinching it 7-5, and securing his place in the semifinals. Berdych's win over Nadal was a remarkable display of determination, perseverance, and confidence, as he overcame his previous 17-match losing streak against the world No.2 that had lasted since 2007. The victory demonstrated the relentless spirit of the Czech star, highlighting his desire and tenacity to challenge the world's very best tennis players. Awaiting Berdych in the semifinals will be either Andy Murray or Nick Kyrgios. Both potential matchups have their unique challenges and opportunities for the Czech player. Murray, a former world No.1, brings vast experience and multiple Grand Slam titles to the competition, while the young Australian Nick Kyrgios showcases raw talent and a passionate home crowd backing him. Regardless of his opponent in the semis, Berdych has shown that he has the ability to defeat the best. Riding high on the momentum from his unprecedented victory, the Czech star will enter the semifinal stage with a renewed sense of belief and the goal of securing his first Australian Open title. While there are still obstacles to overcome, his performance against Nadal may go down in history as the turning point that propelled him to the pinnacle of tennis greatness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: what is the most densely populated western european country?","output":"The most densely populated Western European country is the Netherlands (also referred to as Holland). It is located in Northwestern Europe and is bordered by countries such as Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest. Its total land area is 41,865 square kilometers, making it one of the smaller countries in Europe (ranked 131st worldwide regarding the land area). Despite its relatively small size, the Netherlands has a population of approximately 17.5 million people (as of 2021), leading to a population density of around 525 people per square kilometer. The Dutch population has continuously grown since the mid-20th century, with factors such as a general increase in life expectancy and a positive migration balance contributing to the population growth. Additionally, the Netherlands remains an attractive destination for immigrants due to its stable economy, high living standards, and favorable social services. The urbanization trend and the country's strong economy, particularly in the Randstad region, have played a large role in the high population density. The Randstad is a megalopolis that includes the country's four largest cities – Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht – and is the primary economic and population center of the Netherlands. It is home to approximately 7 million people, which accounts for almost 40% of the Dutch population. To cope with the high population density and maintain livability, the Netherlands has developed efficient land use and infrastructure policies. The Dutch have constructed well-planned cities with mixed-use neighborhoods that support walking, biking, and the efficient use of public transportation. They have also implemented policies to preserve the natural environment and encourage sustainable practices in agriculture, industry, and urban planning. The Netherlands' dense population has not hindered the country's ability to maintain a high standard of living, a strong economy, and a successful welfare state. Though the country faces challenges related to housing prices, urban congestion, and inequality, the Netherlands remains one of the most prosperous, sustainable, and innovative nations in Western Europe and the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, increase your count to 5, then 6, and eventually work your way up to 10. Do 3 or 4 sets of inhales, holds, and exhales for each count. Make sure to maintain the proper breathing techniques by filling your belly and keeping your shoulders down for this and any other exercise. Inhaling for a shorter count and exhaling for longer is great exercise for your diaphragm. Start by doing a few sets of 6 count inhales and 8 count exhales. Proceed to counting to 5 as you inhale and to 10 as you exhale, then gradually work your way up to inhaling for a 2 count and exhaling for a 20 count. Work on filling your lungs with air in a shorter amount of time and controlling your exhale to blow out in a steady stream for a longer amount of time. For this exercise, imagine there’s a candle in front of your face. Your goal is to blow out so slowly and gently that your breath doesn’t make the candle flicker. Fill your lungs with air, then exhale through your imaginary straw until you empty your lungs. Repeat this exercise 10 times. Start adding vocalizations to your breathing exercises. Say “B,” “F,” “S,” and “Sh,“ as you exhale. Extend the sound throughout your entire exhale by saying, “Beee-,” or “Esss-.” Try mixing up your counts for this exercise. Inhale for a 4 count, exhale for 8, then inhale for 2 and exhale for 6. Randomize your counts to mimic how you’d have to switch up your breathing during a song. Hum at a note in your middle register as you exhale. You can also try pronouncing syllables, like “Ba,” or “La.” Extend the sound evenly as you exhale: use your breath to keep the tone and volume steady throughout your exhale. Once again, try switching up your inhale and exhale counts for this exercise.

Please answer the following question: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

Summarize this article: The suggestion is part of Project Brave - the outcome of an SFA working group tasked with improving and increasing the development of elite players. It recommends reducing the 29 funded academies to a maximum of 16. Mackay will consult member clubs in detail at four events this week. Under the plans, clubs will have their academies assessed by an independent company to assess which ones meet the new criteria. \\"We need to focus on the very best players in the very best academies with our limited resources we have,\\" SFA chief executive Stewart Regan said. \\"One of the recommendations from the working group was to have no more than 16 academies in Scotland defined as elite. Any club can put a bid in, and they will be independently audited against a defined set of criteria. If they are successful, they will be included in Scotland's list of elite academies.\\" Project Brave's recommendations: The working group for the strategy was formed in March last year, and initiated by Mackay's predecessor, Brian McClair. Clubs that do not meet the eligibility criteria for Club Academy Scotland status - and central funding - will still have access to funding from the SFA to enable them to continue running their academies. \\"We want to make sure that we get the best support to help us manage the migration to our new academy system,\\" Regan told the SFA website. \\"We have identified an organisation from Europe, Double Pass, who work with a number of key countries, including the FAs in England, Belgium, and others in Scandinavia. \\"They will be coming on board sometime in 2017 to start the auditing process to establish whether club academies meet the criteria we set out, and will be continually reviewing academies into next year to make sure they are the standard we need.\\" In his first major task since succeeding McClair in December, Mackay will give presentations to member clubs in the academy programme at events at St Johnstone, Kilmarnock, Oriam and Hampden Park. Club feedback will then be incorporated into the final report before Project Brave becomes operational at the start of season 2017/18. Summary:","output":"The Scottish Football Association (SFA) is proposing to reduce the number of funded academies under its Project Brave programme. The project, overseen by an SFA working group, would reduce the number of academies from 29 to a maximum of 16, with elite academies being assessed by an independent company. Clubs which do not meet the new criteria will still have access to funding for their academies.

The story is narrated by Clarence Harvey \\"Cookie\\" Cook (Gil Stratton). The camp holds Poles, Czechs, Russian females and, in the American compound, 640 sergeants from bomber crews, gunners, radiomen, and flight engineers. Manfredi (Michael Moore) and Johnson (Peter Baldwin) try to escape through a tunnel, but are shot by waiting guards when they emerge outside the barbed wire fence. The other prisoners conclude that one of their own must have told the Germans.

He also runs a distillery, and organizes mouse races and various other profitable ventures. Sefton tells the men it is foolish to try to escape. The lives of the prisoners are depicted: they receive mail, eat terrible food, wash in the latrine sinks, and collectively do their best to keep sane and defy the camp's commandant, Oberst [Colonel] von Scherbach (Otto Preminger).

We clashed about something so important I can’t even remember what it was. We hadn’t really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can’t imagine life without the other. Well actually, there have been probably a couple of those days for my wife. She’s just too nice to say it. A great marriage isn’t built because it’s perfect.

She said a lot of staff had been calling for information on where they can get their hair cut in the correct style.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Marilyn Monroe’s iconic pose in front of Stamford church draws mixed reactions      STAMFORD — It’s a jarring sight for members of the First Congregational Church: The underwear-clad buttocks of Marilyn Monroe mooning the downtown parish.      A 26-foot Seward Johnson statue illustrating the star in her iconic pose from “The Seven Year Itch” was installed this week in Latham Park as part of the Stamford Downtown Special Services District’s “Art in Public Places” series that lasts through the summer.      But much like the subway grate stirred up her skirt, Monroe has created a whirlwind in just a few days in Stamford.      Lorri Tamburro, a lifelong Stamford resident, was disturbed when she visited the statue with her husband and watched children climbing up Monroe’s leg and looking up her skirt.      “I just find the position to be offensive,” she said. “It was, in my eyes, very disrespectful. I looked at it and I think because of what I saw with all these little kids looking up, the height is ruining it. It’s ruining beautiful Marilyn.”      Now Playing:      Tamburro isn’t the only one disturbed by the pose. City officials said they’ve received a handful of phone calls about the statue and social media has been abuzz with reactions, mostly about its placement in front of the Walton Place church.      On Thursday night, The Avon Theatre, which sponsored the statue’s installation, held a screening of the film that made the pose famous. Some 100 residents and civic leaders descended on the park for bruschetta and rose as the sun started to set on the massive woman, including several men who flitted behind the statue for photos from a different vantage point.      Even young children were drawn to the statue, using her base and legs as a playground and sat eating snacks below her billowing dress.      Alan Kalter, who gained fame as the announcer for “Late Night with David Letterman,” praised the artwork as he attended Thursday’s event.      “If art is supposed to create talk,” Kalter said, “well, they’re talking.”      Monroe has already been attracting people downtown. Marilyn Lodato, of Shelton, noticed the statue while in Stamford for work. Lodato is not only a big Monroe fan, she was also named after her.      “This is an iconic pose,” she said. “This art is incredibly well done from the details on her toenails to the shoes. I don’t think that it’s so offensive...I think it honors her.”      Lodato said she knows “every tidbit” about the pop culture icon who, despite her glamorous image, was plagued by depression, substance abuse and anxiety before committing suicide at age 36. Still, Lodato said the actress would be pleased by the sculpture.      “She would love it,” she said. “I think she would adore it.”      Rev. Todd Yonkman, senior minister at the First Congregational Church, was away this week and could not be reached for comment.      Pam Riley, a longtime member of the First Congregational Church, said she didn’t even look at the statue when it went up on Monday.      “It’s disrespectful to the church,” Riley said. “Her skirt is up in the air and everyone’s under there looking up her skirt.”      Like Tamburro, Riley said the statue would be less offensive if it wasn’t in front of the church.      But some of her fellow congregants were less bothered by the pose and its location.      “It’s wonderful for Stamford and Bedford Street,” First Congregational member Jean Meyer said. “We’re lucky to have that statue. You’re going to have different opinions on it, but you have to have a sense of humor.”      Another First Congregational member, Michael Dagostino, said he preferred the pine tree that once stood there and was a focal point of the city’s Christmas decorations.      “To me, it looks beautiful,” Dagostino said. “If God had something to say, he probably would’ve sent a bolt through it.”      Stamford residents have complained about the statue replacing the Christmas tree. However, according to Stamford DSSD President Sandy Goldstein, the tree was not cut down to accommodate the statue. She said the tree was removed last month after it died of disease.      “It was supposed to be a very hardy, strong, wonderful tree and it came in a little sickly looking, and within a month right after, even during the time the lights were on, it started to die,” Goldstein said. “It just turned brown and was dead.”      Goldstein said the DSSD will purchase a new tree for the holiday season. She said if the former tree did not need to be cut down, the Monroe statue would have been placed in a different park.

(Associated Press)      HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Marilyn Monroe's rear is getting some leers in Connecticut.      A 26-foot statue of the actress has been placed in a Stamford park across the street from a church, which is getting a full view of her behind. It depicts the famous scene from 1955's \\"The Seven Year Itch\\" where Monroe holds down her white dress as air blows up from a subway grate.      The back of the statue showing her underwear is clearly visible from the front of the First Congregational Church of Stamford. Some passersby this week said it was disrespectful to the church.      Most church members have yet to see the statue because it was put up Monday as part of a citywide art display. But it is sure to spark conversation when they return for Sunday worship, said church member Maureen Matthews.      \\"I think some people will be offended,\\" said Matthews, who is not bothered by the statue. \\"It is silly. There are bigger issues to worry about. But I'll be interested to see how people talk about it on Sunday.\\"      \\"Forever Marilyn\\" is one of 36 statues by artist Seward Johnson that are on loan and on display in the downtown area through the summer. They're part of the city's annual \\"Art in Public Spaces\\" program. All the statues except Marilyn are life-size and depict people doing everyday activities.      City resident Lorri Tamburro told The Advocate newspaper that she found it disturbing to see children climbing on the statue's leg and looking up the skirt.      \\"I just find the position to be offensive,\\" she said. \\"It was, in my eyes, very disrespectful. I looked at it and I think because of what I saw with all these little kids looking up, the height is ruining it. It's ruining beautiful Marilyn.\\"      The response to Marilyn and the other statues has been overwhelmingly positive, said Sandy Goldstein, president of the Stamford Downtown Special Services District, which is hosting the exhibit along with sponsors including real estate finance firm UC Funds.      Goldstein noted there are many nude statues outdoors in Europe — and near churches — that are accepted by the public.      \\"It is art and we don't believe it is offensive,\\" she said. \\"We absolutely mean no disrespect to the church.\\"      The Rev. Dr. Todd Grant Yonkman, pastor of the First Congregational Church, has a sense of humor about the statue, but said it was an odd artistic choice.      \\"The issue is, Why that statue,\\" he said in an email to The Associated Press. \\"Marilyn Monroe was an artist deserving our respect. Why appropriate her image in this way. Is this the best we can do?\\"      He said he heard Monroe's husband at the time of \\"The Seven Year Itch,\\" baseball star Joe DiMaggio, was uncomfortable with her shooting the subway vent scene.      \\"Maybe the city would let us give her some pants?\\" Yonkman said. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A big statue of Marilyn Monroe was put in a park in Stamford, Connecticut.

Please answer the following question: Question: While moving the antique a wooden rod fell out, but since it was just part of the chimes what was still functional? Options: - hardware store - old clock - broom closet - puzzle - old houses  Explain why a human would choose \\"old clock\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"The question provides several key points of information that I should analyze to answer correctly.  Firstly, it mentions \\"while moving the antique,\\" which implies the object in question is old or vintage. Of the five options given, \\"hardware store,\\" \\"broom closet,\\" \\"puzzle,\\" and \\"old houses\\" can be ruled out as they do not typically contain moving parts or chimes.  The clue that truly helps us choose the correct answer, however, is the phrase \\"a wooden rod fell out, but since it was just part of the chimes.\\" Chimes are typically found in wind chimes or clocks. Given that wind chimes aren't an option and considering that the antique is being moved and not a stationary building like an old house, the best choice left is an \\"old clock.\\" Old clocks, especially antique ones, often have chimes that make noise on the hour, which would require a wooden rod as part of the mechanism. Therefore a human would choose \\"old clock\\" as the answer because it aligns best with the clues given in the question, namely, the words 'antique' and 'chimes'. Even if a part of the chime mechanism falls out, the primary function of the clock - to tell time - remains undisturbed. Therefore, the clock is 'still functional'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  The chapter ordered that 13 canons, including the succentor and the archdeacon, should immediately \\"erect, construct, build, and duly repair their manses, and the enclosures of their gardens within the college of Moray\\". The manse of the precentor, erroneously called the Bishop's House, is partially ruined and is dated 1557. (Fig. 2) Vestiges of the Dean's Manse and the Archdeacon's Manse (Fig. 3) are now part of private buildings.The hospital of Maison Dieu (the Alms House), dedicated to St Mary and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry, was established by Bishop Andreas before 1237 for the aid of the poor. It suffered fire damage in 1390 and again in 1445. The cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may, in common with other hospitals, have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage. Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin on 17 November 1520, perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence. The property was taken into the ownership of the Crown after the Reformation and in 1595 was granted to the burgh by James VI for educational purposes and for helping the poor. In 1624, an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building, but in 1750 a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins. The remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a 19th-century redevelopment of the area.There were two friaries in the burgh. The Dominican Black Friars friary was founded in the western part of the burgh around 1233. The Franciscan (Friars Minor Conventual) Grey Friars friary was later founded in the eastern part of the burgh sometime before 1281. It is thought that this latter Grey Friars foundation did not long survive, but was followed between 1479 and 1513 by the foundation of a friary near Elgin Cathedral by the Franciscan (Observants) Grey Friars. The building was transferred into the ownership of the burgh around 1559 and later became the Court of Justice in 1563.

Situated on the Boite river, in an alpine valley, it is a popular winter sport resort known for its skiing trails, scenery, accommodation, shops and après-ski scene, and for its jet set and aristocratic European crowd.  - Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the sport or recreation of sliding down snow-covered hills on skis with fixed-heel bindings. It is characterized by the requirement for mechanical assistance getting to the top of the hill, since the equipment does not allow efficient walking or hiking, unlike cross-country skis which use free-heel bindings. It is typically practiced at ski resorts which provide services such as ski lifts, artificial snow making and grooming, first aid, and restaurants. Back-country skiers use alpine skiing equipment to ski off the marked pistes, in some cases with the assistance of snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats. Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 (except for the 1940 games).  - The Winter Olympic Games is a major international sporting event that occurs once every four years. Unlike the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympics feature sports practised on snow and ice. The first Winter Olympics, the 1924 Winter Olympics, was held in Chamonix, France. The original five sports (broken into nine disciplines) were bobsleigh, curling, ice hockey, Nordic skiing (consisting of the disciplines military patrol, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping), and skating (consisting of the disciplines figure skating and speed skating). The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936, after which they were interrupted by World War II. The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years. Until 1992, the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years, but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years, the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994.  - The 1952 Winter Olympics (Norwegian: \\"Vinter-OL 1952\\"), officially known as the VI Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"VIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\"), took place in Oslo, Norway, from 14 to 25 February. Discussions about Oslo hosting the Winter Olympic Games began as early as 1935; the city wanted to host the 1948 Games, but World War II made that impossible. Instead, Oslo won the right to host the 1952 Games in a contest that included Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy and Lake Placid in the United States. All of the venues were in Oslo's metropolitan area except for the alpine skiing events, which were held at Norefjell, from the capital. A new hotel was built for the press and dignitaries, along with three dormitories to house athletes and coaches, creating the first modern athlete's village.

He enters an orange room and, without warning, is killed by a trap. In another such room, five people â Quentin, Worth, Holloway, Rennes, and Leaven â meet. None of them knows where they are or how they got there. Quentin informs the others that some rooms contain traps, which he learned by nearly being killed by one. Rennes assumes each trap is triggered by a motion detector and tests each room by throwing one of his boots in first. Leaven notices numbers inscribed in the passageways between rooms. Quentin recognizes Rennes as \\"the Wren\\", an escape artist renowned for getting out of jails. After declaring one room trap-free, Rennes enters and is killed when he is sprayed with acid. The others realize that there are different kinds of detectors, and Quentin deduces that this trap was triggered by heat. Quentin believes each person has a reason for being there. Leaven is a mathematics student, Holloway a physician and conspiracy theorist, and the surly Worth declines to talk about himself. Leaven hypothesizes that any room marked with a prime number is a trap. They find a mentally challenged man named Kazan, whom Holloway insists they bring along. When Quentin nearly dies in a room deemed safe by Leaven's calculations, tensions rise due to personality conflicts and lack of faith in Leaven's system.

My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn’t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I’m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn’t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven’t set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I’m barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they’ve moved on, but I’m still too scared to find out.

An ice cap can bury an entire mountain range or region ( Figure below ). Glaciers come off of ice caps into valleys.   Q: What are large glaciers that cover a larger area than just a valley?   Choices:  - icebergs  - glacial continents  - ice floes  - ice caps  A:","output":"The large glaciers that cover a larger area than just a valley are called ice caps. As mentioned in the provided paragraph, these ice caps can bury an entire mountain range or region, making them significantly larger than smaller, valley-confined glaciers. Glaciers then form off of these ice caps and extend into the valleys. It is important to differentiate ice caps from the other choices presented. Icebergs, for example, are large pieces of freshwater ice that have broken off from a glacier or an ice shelf and are floating freely in open water. They mostly originate from the calving of glaciers in polar regions and are distinguishable by their varied shapes and sizes. Glacial continents (which technically do not exist as a separate term) could be mistaken for continental ice sheets, which are much larger than ice caps. These ice sheets cover vast areas of land and currently, there are only two of them – the Greenland ice sheet and the Antarctic ice sheet. Ice floes, on the other hand, are flat, floating sheets of ice that aren't attached to any landmass. They can originate when sea ice breaks apart, or they may also form from freshwater sources. Typically, they are found in polar regions, such as the Arctic Ocean, where they drift and mostly follow ocean currents. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question, \\"What are large glaciers that cover a larger area than just a valley?\\" is ice caps. Unlike other ice formations like icebergs, \\"glacial continents\\" (which do not exist or can be mistaken for continental ice sheets), or ice floes, ice caps are large glaciers that have the potential to bury entire mountain ranges or regions, with glaciers eventually extending from them into valleys."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.  Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

Problem: how many seconds will a 700 meter long train take to cross a man walking with a speed of 3 km / hr in the direction of the moving train if the speed of the train is 63 km / hr ?  Options: a ) 287 , b ) 288 , c ) 600 , d ) 277 , e ) 121 A:","output":"To determine how long the train takes to cross the man, we need to find the relative speed between the train and the man and then divide the length of the train by that speed. Step 1: Convert all measurements to a common unit (meters and seconds). The speed of the man is 3 km/hr, which is equal to 3000 meters/hr. To convert this to meters/second we need to divide by 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour):  (3000 m/hr) / (3600 s/hr) = 0.833 m/s. The speed of the train is 63 km/hr, which is equal to 63000 meters/hr. To convert this to meters/second we need to divide by 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour): (63000 m/hr) / (3600 s/hr) = 17.5 m/s. Step 2: Find the relative speed. Since the man is walking in the direction of the moving train, we need to subtract his speed from the train's speed to find the relative speed: Relative Speed = Train Speed - Man Speed Relative Speed = 17.5 m/s - 0.833 m/s = 16.67 m/s. Step 3: Determine the time it takes for the train to cross the man. To find the time it takes for the train to cross the man, we need to divide the length of the train (700 meters) by the relative speed (16.67 m/s): Time = Length / Relative Speed Time = 700 m / 16.67 m/s = 41.995 seconds.

A couple is planning to file a civil lawsuit against their neighbour after he shot dead their beloved pet dog when it ran into his backyard. Judy and Fred Galietta heard two shots after their six-year-old Brittany Spaniel, Sadie, ran into the backyard of retired police officer Christopher Gibbons' Hampstead, New Hampshire home. 'When I got to her, I knew she was dead,' Judy Galietta told WHDH. 'I lifted up her head and there was nothing. It's like losing a child. She was our life.' But Mr Gibbons claims the animal was pestering his pet rabbits and saw he had no choice but to shoot it dead - and police have revealed that the law is on his side. Scroll down for video. Battle: Christopher Gibbons, left, shot dead Judy Galietta's beloved dog after it went into his garden. He said he awoke on Saturday morning. to find the dog barking at the two pet rabbits he keeps in a pen in his back. garden, and feared the noise might give them heart attacks. 'I went to the window and looked and saw. and the dog was running round and round and round the cage jumping up on it and. clawing it,' he said. When screaming at the dog did make it stop, Mr Gibbons grabbed his AR-15 assault rifle and fired a warning shot from his second floor bedroom window before aiming for animal. 'I shot one round into the dog and killed the dog,' he said. Police said that Gibbons called 911 immediately after shooting the dog to report the incident, and initially claimed he did not know the animal. Killed: The Galiettas believe he shot dead their pet, Sadie, as revenge for their complaints about his noise. Scene: But Mr Gibbons said the dog was barking at and scaring his rabbits in this outdoor cage. But the Galiettas. insist he recognised the dog, who ran around their garden in summer. They said they think he aimed for the dog as they've previously. complained about Gibbons' target shooting. Lt. John Frazier from the Hampstead Police Department said: '[He] probably could have handled it a little bit differently, be more neighbour-like. But what he did is not illegal.' State. law dictates that 'any person may kill a dog that is… out of the care. of its owner… worrying, wounding, or killing sheep, lambs, fowl, or. other domestic animals'. There has been some contention over the exact meaning of the word 'worrying' and the Galiettas are now calling on lawmakers to scrap it from the law. Missed: The Galiettas said Sadie, a six-year-old Brittany Spaniel, was like a child to them. Sadness: Judy and Fred Galietta plan on filing a civil lawsuit against Gibbons and asked for a change in the law. In light of the incident, Rep. John. Sedensky said on Thursday that he plans to call a meeting with local. legislators to see if the law should be changed due to the different. interpretation of 'worrying'. Sen. Jim Rausch said the term 'worrying' was included to protect livestock, especially sheep, in situations where they may be chased by dogs, causing them damage while not being attacked. 'There is a legitimate reason for that terminology,' he said. 'It's not the law that's wrong, it's people not behaving.' He added: 'This situation just highlights that we. have individuals who use no common sense. This should have been resolved. in a manner of good neighborly relations.

Its wood-paneled trading floor was boxed up and moved to the Art Institute of Chicago in 1977. Now all-electronic, it accounts for just 0.5% of shares that change hands nationally. Yet each of the millions of buy and sell orders issued around the world for U.S.-listed stocks each day must scan the Chicago Stock Exchange's computers before it can be completed. The reason is a set of rules meant to make certain orders are always carried out at the best price available. It is called Regulation NMS, for national market system. Regulators installed the rules to modernize exchanges, boost competition and keep U.S. markets relevant world-wide. But as U.S. markets incur repeated technical glitches, such as a three-hour outage in a Nasdaq Stock Market data feed in August, many Wall Street executives blame the increased complexity of the securities markets. Behind much of that is a spaghetti-bowl of data streams and connections between brokers and trading platforms that grew out of Regulation NMS. The intense battle for trading business among a growing number of exchanges and private trading platforms, spurred by Regulation NMS, has created a fast-changing system that is tougher for traders to understand and navigate. \\"If you were to start fresh, you wouldn't build what we have today,\\" said Andy Brooks, vice president and head of U.S. equity trading at mutual-fund firm T. Rowe Price Group . Reg NMS, as it is often called, grew out of an effort nearly a decade ago to keep the U.S. abreast of financial centers such as London, Frankfurt and Hong Kong that were leaping ahead in embracing electronic systems. Securities and Exchange Commission officials worried that control of U.S. capital markets could begin to shift offshore if the U.S. didn't evolve. Some U.S. markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange, remained beholden to trading-floor models. Regulators fretted that investors couldn't be assured of getting the most competitive price when buying or selling stocks under those old-school systems, because traders manning the exchange floors had too much leeway when it came to competing with faster-moving electronic platforms. The result was a drive to digitally stitch together U.S. markets. It meant tethering marketplaces more tightly than ever. Reg NMS, passed by the SEC in 2005 and implemented in 2007, sent the securities industry rushing to update the electronic pathways and spelled change for market participants ranging from exchanges to traders to brokerage firms. \\"Some of us were worried, and it was fair, that this was too big an item to chew, and that technology would not be up to the task,\\" said Roel Campos, then an SEC commissioner. \\"Obviously, it's led to the recent situation.\\" To some degree, brokers and exchanges already were scanning various markets to see who had the most competitive prices. Reg NMS greatly increased the amount of this scanning and required a more nearly instantaneous routing of orders to where the price was best. Let's say that—before Reg NMS—the New York Stock Exchange received an order to buy shares of XYZ Company, at a time when some electronic exchange was offering to sell XYZ shares for less than the NYSE's \\"offer\\" price. Instead of shipping the order to that electronic exchange for immediate execution, NYSE floor traders were allowed to adjust their own offer price, and fill the trade. It was as if the electronic exchange had a yield sign that let floor traders pass first. This worried some regulators because they feared that floor-oriented markets were holding investors back from getting the best price instantly. Immediacy is a concern in a world where prices are constantly changing as trades take place and new orders are placed or canceled. Reg NMS removed the yield sign. It required exchanges and brokers to immediately \\"hit,\\" or accept, the most competitive bid or offer prices posted at any U.S. trading venue that displays price quotes. It sped up the stock market. For a stock exchange, Reg NMS has made it more important to be able to display the best bid and offer prices. A heavy flow of orders can increase the chance the exchange has the best prices. To obtain robust order flow, exchanges offer incentives to trading firms whose business is to constantly buy and sell stocks—the firms known as market makers. The incentives take the form of rebates. Meanwhile, exchanges also charge fees to investors who want to accept the prices the market makers quote. Reg NMS cemented this pricing practice by allowing exchanges to continue charging such fees. But for the market-making firms, as they constantly place bids and offers for securities, the stock exchanges' frequently shifting rebates and discounts have become one more factor that must be taken into account. With more than a dozen U.S. stock exchanges and around 50 private stock-trading venues, this is another way the rule adds complexity to the financial markets. \\"We've got competition in spades now,\\" said Kevin Cronin, global head of trading for the asset manager Invesco Ltd. \\"What none of us really thought about was that the competition would be all about prices and rebates.\\" Sometimes, stock exchanges, in an effort to have the best prices, offer specialized trading services to capture business from certain types of investors. When they do, some other market participants are obliged to change their software. The NYSE in 2012 introduced a program it hoped would enable it to fill orders placed by individual investors at slightly more competitive prices. To do that, the exchange created a new method of determining which orders came from individuals and a method for quoting better prices for them. Knight Capital Group Inc., a trading firm that specializes in filling masses of orders shipped to it by brokers who cater to small investors, rolled out new software to interact with the NYSE program. On Aug. 1, 2012, this new software led to a colossal trading error, which cost Knight 461 million. While Knight accepted responsibility for the error, some trace the series of events back to the NYSE's Reg-NMS-inspired wish to improve its price competitiveness, and to a faster pace of change set by the current market structure. Following the adoption of Reg NMS, it became more valuable for a trading platform to qualify as a full-fledged stock exchange. The reason is that if an exchange displays the best price for a stock, then that is where an order for the stock must be filled. The same isn't true of other types of trading platforms, some of which don't publicly display price quotes. BATS Global Markets in Lenexa, Kan., in 2008 converted its electronic trading platform to a full-fledged exchange in order to better capture trading business under the new Reg NMS rules. Direct Edge Holdings LLC, based in Jersey City, N.J., followed suit in 2010. In addition, established exchanges such as Nasdaq bought up fading exchanges that once represented regional markets in Philadelphia, Boston and Cincinnati, rehabbing them as electronic platforms geared toward specific niches. From 2007 to 2011, seven new stock exchanges opened for business. Regulation NMS also spurred the proliferation of \\"dark pools,\\" which are private electronic trading venues that don't publicly display bid and offer prices. The fees exchanges charge to access their prices gave brokers added incentive to direct stock orders toward these and other private platforms, where trading is often cheaper. The new structure spawned by Reg NMS also ramped up cat-and-mouse games played by sophisticated traders operating in the stock market, some stock-market participants say. Computerized firms called high-frequency traders try to pick up clues about what the big players are doing through techniques such as repeatedly placing and instantly canceling thousands of stock orders to detect demand. If such a firm's algorithm detects that a mutual fund is loading up on a certain stock, the firm's computers may decide the stock is worth more and can rush to buy it first. That process can make the purchase costlier for the mutual fund. Financial institutions that make large stock purchases have long been accustomed to breaking up their orders to avoid tipping off the market. But because buy and sell orders now are bounced around so widely, it has become easier for algorithms to detect what institutions are up to, some investors fear. They say they have had to grow craftier and deploy high-tech countermeasures, further deepening the market's complexity. Last year, T. Rowe Price's Mr. Brooks and colleagues ran an experiment. They directed one of their brokers to buy 2.5 million shares of a heavily traded stock, then sought a step-by-step account of how the broker made the purchase. What Mr. Brooks learned shocked him, he says. To hide the purchase from fast-moving traders, the broker placed and canceled many smaller orders all across the stock market, creating a dense smoke screen of phantom interest in the security. In total, the broker offered to buy 750 million shares of the stock while actually purchasing just 2.5 million. Mr. Brooks said he is bothered by the potential distortions to the stock market such practices may create. The realization of how much market subterfuge there is \\"was a two-by-four to the head, when you see how dysfunctional this market can be,\\" Mr. Brooks said. \\"We're pretty certain things are overly complex, with 13 exchanges and 50 dark pools,\\" Mr. Brooks said. \\"It adds operational costs, it adds complexity, it's destabilizing…and the improvement from all this stuff is negligible.\\" Invesco's Mr. Cronin found something similar a couple of years ago when he requested a detailed sample of his firm's trading. A 1,000-share stock order, which is small for Invesco, traversed 10 separate exchanges and dark pools before it was filled. The order had also been sent to eight other venues where ultimately no shares were bought—but where other traders may have had a chance to catch wind of Invesco's strategy. \\"Technology should be designed to make things more efficient and more effective, not just more complicated,\\" said Mr. Cronin. \\"We're getting away from that core purpose.\\" Reviews of institutional trading costs by Investment Technology Group Inc., a New York brokerage firm that also runs a private stock-trading platform, found that while trading costs have been on the ebb for several years, big investors now pay slightly more to execute a large trade than they did in 2007. Though competition prompted exchanges to cut trading fees, costs associated with carrying out trades have gone up. \\"I don't think there have been benefits from Reg NMS,\\" said Jamie Selway, an ITG executive. \\"I view it as a nuisance, barnacles on the way the market operates, and it doesn't get us much.\\" With stock-market technical glitches continuing to pop up every few months, regulators at the SEC have been pressing the stock exchanges and brokerage firms to come up with fixes. As they do so, Reg NMS has been steadily creeping into the conversation. Morgan Stanley in May asked regulators to consider changing rules so that firms wouldn't be obligated to send business to tiny exchanges, arguing that the cost of connecting to minuscule markets didn't carry meaningful benefits for investors. The same month, market-structure expert Larry Tabb, CEO of the research firm Tabb Group, said Reg NMS had made the stock market less transparent and a trickier thing to navigate for big institutions, some of which he said had \\"come to loathe\\" the rule. Speaking broadly, SEC Chairman Mary Jo White said in October that the SEC should \\"do more\\" to review the framework of the stock market. A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment further. Among SEC commissioners, there are growing signs of an inclination to revisit the rule, based on comments some have made in recent months. \\"A lot of things have evolved since Reg NMS\\" was implemented, said commissioner Michael Piwowar. He said he is discussing with other commissioners a possible multiyear effort to analyze the effects of the rule, and the evolved U.S. stock-market architecture. \\"As a general matter, retrospective analyses of existing rules is just good government,\\" he said. Others feel that despite the market's convoluted nature and blinding speed, Reg NMS is doing its job. Mr. Campos said that while he didn't oppose a review, \\"by and large, by a long way, the system works today. I think things could be better, but I don't lose sleep over Reg NMS.\\" Write to Jacob Bunge at jacob.bunge@wsj.com Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The increasingly complex U.S. stock market, involving a multitude of exchanges and private trading platforms, as well as repeated technical glitches, has led many Wall Street executives to blame a set of rules known as Regulation National Market System (Reg NMS).

By contrast, MRI shows numerous new demyelinating damage that actually correspond to relapses.\\" Let's dissect this sentence and explain its complex medical meaning. The patient in mention isn't experiencing or feeling any physical sensations of their condition worsening or any new neurological deficits - these deficits refer to any abnormality or damage to any part of the neuronal pathways, which basically are complex networks through which our brain and spinal cord communicate with the rest of our body. The 'etc.' in the context probably refers to other neurological symptoms that usually accompany the deterioration of nerve health, like muscle weakness, altered sensation like numbness or tingling, pain, and loss of balance or coordination. However, a contrast MRI shows a different narrative. MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a type of imaging technology which utilizes strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate images of the inside of the body. This form of imaging is especially useful in visualizing the brain and spinal cord. In this case, the MRI reveals numerous new instances of demyelinating damage. Demyelination refers to the process of damaging or stripping off the myelin sheath - a protective coating that surrounds nerve fibers and helps in efficient transmission of electrical signals between nerve cells. When this sheath gets damaged, nerve communication can be slowed or completely halted, leading to various neurological complications. This demyelinating damage actually corresponds to 'relapses'. In the context of neurological diseases like Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a relapse refers to an episode where new symptoms appear or existing symptoms worsen, typically lasting for more than 24 hours. The point being made here is that while the patient might not feel any new symptoms or worsening state, the MRI scans still display signs of progressing neurological damage, which would technically constitute a relapse. The disconnect between the physical experiences of the patient and their MRI findings is a critical facet of managing and understanding neurological conditions like MS."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks work by overloading websites or other online services with traffic. They have the power to knock whole sites offline and are usually carried out by automated bots or programs. Victims of such attacks in the past month include the Irish National Lottery and the BBC while in 2014 the popular videogame Wurm was also hit. 'Arms race' Darren Antsee, chief security technologist at software company Arbor Networks, believes the world is in an \\"arms race\\" between those carrying out DDoS attacks and those who try to defend against them His firm conducts an annual survey of internet service providers on the subject and the company also takes in data from its \\"Atlas\\" system - which monitors 300 providers every hour. Mr Antsee says this gives the firm an idea of what's happening across \\"about a third of the internet\\". A newly published report from the company suggests attacks are getting bigger and more sophisticated - with more and more businesses suffering. More than 200 of the reported attacks in 2015 summoned 100 gigabits per second (Gbps) of traffic, with the largest of these clocking in at 500 Gbps - enough to disrupt an entire internet service provider's network. To put that in context, in 2014 internet connectivity for the entire country of Kenya was about 500 Gbps. But Mr Antsee says the larger attacks are not the real story. Instead, it's the \\"big jump\\" in more sophisticated DDoS raids which, though smaller in terms of gigabits per second, target specific parts of a website which are more easily overwhelmed. Petty cyber crime These often involve some clever analysis of how a website functions before an attack is launched, according to John Graham-Cumming, chief technology officer at DDoS protection service Cloudflare. \\"If you know that, say, on an e-commerce website, adding something to the basket takes a long time, what we'll see is attackers doing that over and over again to consume resources,\\" he says. What's even more worrying is that there is now a wide range of \\"booter\\" services which offer to launch DDoS against specific targets for as little as 10 (£7). \\"My sense is that DDoS is just part of the internet at this point - it happens,\\" adds Mr Graham-Cumming. \\"It's a bit like petty crime.\\" Many motives Mr Antsee concurs and points out that a variety of motivations could prompt attacks these days. The most common now, according to the Arbor Networks survey, is criminals flexing their muscles against online targets to demonstrate their capabilities. Businesses occasionally dabble in attacking competitors, and there are also reports of individuals using DDoS for extortion - in which a ransom fee is demanded from the owners of a victim site. Finally, it's also sometimes the case that DDoS attacks will take place for \\"ideological\\" reasons - a website supporting a political viewpoint might be thrown offline by supporters of the opposing view, for example. In terms of protection, companies like Cloudflare offer to analyse web traffic for signs of malicious requests which can often weed out unwanted connections. Mr Antsee adds that \\"infrastructure access control lists\\" (ACLs) can be installed in routers and switches to detect suspicious patterns in traffic. Information overload However, the more sophisticated attacks mentioned above which target weak points in a website's structure are not always preventable with such technology. \\"You need to be using more intelligent DDoS mitigation systems to absorb that kind of traffic,\\" says Mr Antsee. Interestingly, he also comments that there is quite a large disparity between the number of attacks like this detected by service providers and the number seen by businesses - suggesting that more might need to be done before their true scale is understood. As a result of these developments, it is widely expected that the market for DDoS protection services is set to grow this year. Indeed, 74% of service providers surveyed by Arbor said they had seen an increase in such protections among their customers. \\"We certainly don't see things slowing down, the reality is, for a lot of websites, it's easy to knock them offline and so people do it,\\" notes Mr Graham-Cumming. He adds that these days, it seems as though anyone could be a target. \\"Who gets DDoS'd?

Earlier, sources said it would be delayed - but First Secretary of State Damian Green said he \\"can't confirm anything yet\\". Labour said the government was \\"in chaos\\". Mrs May is meeting her backbench MPs for the first time since losing the Tories' majority in Thursday's general election. The Queen's Speech is written by the government and presents an outline of its planned legislation for the next Parliamentary session. Mr Green cited the ongoing negotiations with the DUP when he was asked if next Monday's speech had been delayed. \\"I can't confirm anything yet until we know the final details of the agreement,\\" he said. \\"We know those talks are going well and also we know that, at this very important time, we want to produce a substantial Queen's Speech.\\" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was an \\"ambiguity\\" about both what would go in it - with several manifesto pledges expected to be watered down or dropped - but also the need for the Tories to \\"nail down\\" DUP support. A defeat for its Queen's Speech would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the new minority government, he said. One of the reasons for the delay is also believed to be because the speech has to be written on goat's skin parchment, which takes a few days to dry - and the Tory negotiations with the DUP mean it cannot be ready in time. Although it is rare for a Queen's Speech to be delayed, when the Conservatives and Lib Dems formed a coalition government in 2010, it did not take place until 20 days after the general election while in 1992 nearly a month elapsed between polling day and the government announcing its new programme. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: \\"This is an utter humiliation for Theresa May. It is time to stop trying to cling to power and time to admit enough is enough.\\" Meanwhile, the backbench 1922 Committee is expected to raise concerns about the PM's leadership style, and press for more details on talks with the DUP. The committee is made up of all Conservative backbenchers - the name is taken from the year in which its original members were elected. Its primary function is to keep the leadership of the party informed of the mood among the rank and file, and if a Conservative leader or other senior figure loses its support they could be in a particularly vulnerable position. Mrs May's new cabinet also met for the first time after a reshuffle. Earlier Brexit Secretary David Davis predicted some parts of the Tory manifesto would have to be \\"pruned\\" following the election result. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Davis said that while the Tory election campaign had been disappointing, Mrs May was a \\"formidable prime minister\\" and accused people speculating about her leadership of \\"the absolute height of self-indulgence\\". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has accused Mrs May of \\"squatting\\" in No 10, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the country \\"cannot go on with a period of great instability\\". On Sunday evening the PM finalised her cabinet with a small reshuffle, with Michael Gove returning to a ministerial role as environment secretary. Mr Gove, who took on Mrs May for the party leadership after David Cameron quit, was sacked by the PM in her reshuffle in July last year. A number of high-profile members kept their posts in the reshuffle, with Philip Hammond staying at the Treasury, Boris Johnson remaining at the Foreign Office and Amber Rudd keeping the Home Office brief. But some changed jobs too, with Liz Truss being demoted from justice secretary to become chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Green, who was work and pensions secretary, was promoted to become the first secretary of state - effectively Mrs May's second in command. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Iain Watson Widespread demands for Mrs May to go are not expected at Monday's 1922 Committee meeting. Instead, there will be demands for her to consult more, including meeting regularly with the 1922 executive, and to turn Downing Street from a bunker into an open house by broadening her range of staff. However, few MPs expect her position to be strong and stable for the next five years. One senior backbencher told me: \\"It is inconceivable she will lead the party into the next election. Her authority has been diminished unquestionably.\\" Another said: \\"Party members have been too bruised by her.\\" \\"She has bought herself some time\\", said another senior backbencher, but added: \\"How she behaves will determine how long she's there.\\" There is a feeling that the party is holding on to nurse for fear of something worse. Read more from Iain Watson here. After speculation in the Sunday newspapers that he was mounting a leadership challenge, Mr Johnson has called for Tory MPs to back Mrs May. Writing in Monday's Sun, the foreign secretary said those calling for the PM to step down should \\"get a grip\\", adding the electorate wanted the government to \\"get on with the job\\". Mr Johnson admitted the prime minister's election campaign did not go well - \\"to put it mildly\\" - and that Tory messages \\"got lost or misunderstood\\". But he added: \\"Theresa May led a campaign that inspired 13.7m people to vote Conservative, in the biggest total tally of Tory votes since the days of Margaret Thatcher. \\"That is a stunning achievement, for which she deserves the support of her party. And she will certainly get it from me.\\" He also said the proposal of a deal with the DUP to keep her minority government in power was \\"feasible\\". \\"The people of Britain have had a bellyful of promises and politicking,\\" he wrote. \\"Now is the time for delivery - and Theresa May is the right person to continue that vital work.\\" The return of Mr Gove to the front bench as environment secretary has been a shock to some, including the politician himself. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, he said he had been \\"quite surprised\\" to be asked to rejoin the cabinet. He added: \\"Of course I knew that today was reshuffle day, but I genuinely didn't expect this role - although I am delighted to be part of the government, and delighted to be able to support Theresa.\\" However, the BBC's environment analyst Roger Harrabin said green campaigners were angry at Mr Gove's appointment, pointing to his time as education secretary, when he tried to remove climate change from the geography curriculum, and as chief whip, when he reportedly blocked the then environment secretary from important international talks. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said: \\"It is hard to think of many politicians as ill equipped for the role of environment secretary as Michael Gove.\\" But others have welcomed the new minister. One senior farming industry source said they were happy that a \\"big hitter\\" was taking the top job at the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra). \\"Defra has long been a backwater, so at last it's not someone in charge who is being put out to grass,\\" he said. Mr Gove promised to \\"protect our precious environment\\" in his new role.

A skilled horseman and marksman, he brings down the stag swiftly but is snubbed at the after-hunt party. A year later, Fawcett is sent to London to meet with officials of the Royal Geographical Society. The governments of Bolivia and Brazil are nearly at war over the location of their mutual boundary and its direct effect on the region's extremely lucrative rubber trade, and have asked the British government to survey it. Fawcett agrees to lead the survey party to restore his family's good name. Aboard a ship to Brazil, Fawcett meets Corporal Henry Costin, who has knowledge of the Amazon rainforest. At a large rubber plantation in the jungle owned by the Portuguese nobleman Baron de Gondoris, the two meet Corporal Arthur Manley, who tells them that the British government advises against further exploration. Fawcett, with several guides and the Amazonian scout Tadjui, completes the mission. Tadjui tells Fawcett stories about a jungle city covered in gold and full of people. Fawcett dismisses such stories as insane ravings, but discovers highly advanced broken pottery and some small stone statues in the jungle that convince him of the veracity of Tadjui's story.

Option I: Creating a vegetable strainer 1. Attaching wooden sides - This step seems plausible, as attaching wooden frames to the circuit board can be easily accomplished using glue or screws. 2. Sealing the edges with a sealant - A sealant would help hold the structure together and prevent water leakage, contributing to the functionality of the strainer. 3. Drain noodles or rinse vegetables - Circuit boards have many small holes, so this step could not be effective. Components such as capacitors, resistors, and solder on the board may also pose hygiene concerns while making it challenging to clean and maintain. Option II: Creating a hanging jewelry display 1. Painting the circuit board with gold spray paint - It is quite simple to paint a circuit board with spray paint, giving it an aesthetic appearance for a jewelry display. 2.

Lindsay Lohan ships off to her court-mandated rehab fairly soon, and she may already have a gig lined up for when she gets out in August. It seems that she might write about her experiences getting sober for the esteemed literary journal Celebuzz. Yes, Page Six has a source who tells them that Lohan has struck a deal with the website and will then maybe use that momentum to launch her own website, featuring \\"her musings on art, fashion, music and movies.\\" Aha. That sounds like a terrific idea. She'd be like the GOOP of pop culture! Now, none of this is exactly confirmed, but when asked about a rumored meeting between Lohan and the site to discuss ideas, editorial consultant A.J.

Lindsay Lohan might soon become a writer of thoughts and ideas, perhaps a Joan Didion-esque essayist, or a confessional poetess/memoirist like Mary Karr. Really the possibilities are limitless, and therefore unknowable. One thing we do know for certain though is that Lohan will seize this opportunity with gusto, as she's never been one to not follow through on something. We can at least count on that.

For croquet on summer lawns, for upscale lobster bakes, for standing and looking out to sea on cloudy, windswept days feeling like her own little lighthouse, beaming her Taylor Swift beams out onto the water, not repelling ships from rocks, but drawing them in, signaling to them, saying \\"Please, bring me your young men, bring them to my palace of sand of salt.\\" She's willing to pay 17 million to do that, so let's let her do that.

There you were, bickering about whether or not the kids should be fed at the reception or just driven down to McDonald's by Cousin Ricky, while Michael Jordan is dropping millions of dollars on candles. You briefly entertained your parents' suggestion that you not rent chairs for the evening because, \\"Who really wants to sit that much anyway?\\" and meanwhile Michael Jordan hired Usher and Robin Thicke to perform at his wedding. Your guests are still grumbling about your whole \\"semi-open bar\\" thing, while Michael Jordan and his model wife danced happily with the likes of Tiger Woods and Spike Lee. It just doesn't seem fair, does it? And I bet they got to fly first class somewhere nice for their honeymoon, while all you got was Aunt Judy's house in Rehoboth Beach for the week and it's not even that nice there in the spring! Nothing's ever fair in this world, is it. [Us Weekly]      The Netherlands has a new king! After 33 years of rule, Queen Beatrix has abdicated the throne (so she can finally go kill Bill), making her son Willem-Alexander king of all the Netherlands and its various properties elsewhere. This also makes Willem-Alexander's wife Queen Maxima, which is a great and somewhat terrifying name for a queen. They're both popular among the Dutch citizenry, but with a name like Queen Maxima, the people might want to keep an eye on her. You know, just in case young maids start mysteriously disappearing from the countryside or if the army suddenly tries to conquer Belgium or something. Queen Maxima! I can't wait for her arc on Game of Thrones next season. [People]      Kim Kardashian and Kanye West insist that they are not asking for baby gifts, though a bunch of fake registries have recently been spotted online. Instead the couple is asking that people donate money to a children's hospital in Chicago. Which is awfully nice of them. But really, what do they need with baby gifts? They're just gonna dress that kid in E! merch for a while, and give it Kris Humphries's old toys to play with. Kris has been trying to get that stuff back, sending crayon-scrawled notes to the house saying \\"Give me bak my firetruk and Hot Weels or ells\\" but it's so far been to no avail. Thus the divorce proceedings continue. Oh the Westdashian baby! What a wondrous young life it's going to have. What enormous diapers it will have to wear. [TMZ]      Here are some photos of the Olsen twins walking in LAX with Mary-Kate's boyfriend Olivier Sarkozy. Nothing remarkable is happening in any of the snaps, but it's still funny to see Mary-Kate and Olivier together, as they are a very funny couple. And it's fun to see Mary-Kate dressed up as Kung Lao from Mortal Kombat. That's all. I dunno. Go have a chuckle. [Daily Mail]      Catherine Zeta-Jones has checked into a treatment facility to tend to her bipolar II disorder. Her rep says she has \\"proactively checked into a health care facility\\" and that \\"she is committed to periodic care in order to manage her health in an optimum manner.\\" Which, sure, makes perfect sense. Good for her. Hope it goes well. [Us Weekly]      Want to add to this story? Let us know in comments or send an email to the author at rlawson at theatlantic dot com.

Airlines improved their performance last year, with fewer lost bags and bumped passengers due to overbooking and more on-time arrivals, but travelers were still dissatisfied, according to an annual study of airline quality.      Complaints to the Department of Transportation about airline performance went up a whopping 28 percent in 2010, the study said.      A precise cause for the spike in consumer disenchantment is hard to nail down, but it's most likely due to changes in the way airlines are doing business, said Dean Headley, co-author of the report, which is based on Transportation Department data.      The number of air travelers is increasing, but there are fewer flights and fewer seats available. So flights are more crowded, and it's tougher to rebook when a flight is canceled.      \\"They are trying to match supply and demand _ the number of seats available to the number of people demanding seats _ a lot closer so they don't fly empty seats, which is expensive for the airlines,\\" said Headley, an associate professor of marketing at Wichita State University's W. Frank Barton School of Business.      That increases the chances that some passengers are going to be unhappy because mismatches between passengers and seats available usually are managed to the airline's advantage, he said.      \\"Even though airlines are vocal about saying they want to please the customer, when it comes right down to it, they're going to make money first,\\" Headley said.      There were 1.22 complaints per 100,000 passengers last year, compared with less than 1 per 100,000 in 2009.      An overall ranking of the nation's 16 largest airlines based on their combined performance in four categories _ on-time arrivals, mishandled baggage, denied boardings, complaints _ was coming out at 9:30 a.m. EDT Monday.      The department doesn't keep records on the number of flight cancellations, but the biggest category of complaints was \\"flight problems,\\" which includes cancellations and delays.      Industry officials had predicted that cancellations would increase as a result of new federal rules that bar airlines from keeping passengers waiting in planes longer than three hours without giving them a chance to get off. Such \\"tarmac strandings\\" have plummeted since the rules, which include fines of as much as 27,500 per passenger per violation, took effect.      Headley said it's hard to know if there were more cancellations, and if so, whether they were due to the rules or other factors such as storms.      Southwest Airlines maintained its ranking as the airline with the lowest consumer complaint rate, 0.27 per 100,000 passengers in 2010. Delta had the worst rate again, 2 per 100,000 passengers.      Four of every eight domestic flights arrived on time last year, a slight increase from 2009. Over the past 20 years, on-time performance has ranged from a high of 82.5 percent in 1991 to a low of 72.6 percent in 2000.      Eleven airlines improved in this category last year, and eight had an on-time arrival percentage over 80 percent. Hawaiian Airlines was the best, at 92 percent. Comair, a regional airline, was last at 73 percent.      Last year's rate of 3.5 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers was the best in the two decades that the study has been produced. This rate peaked in 2007 at 7.01 mishandled bags. After that, many airlines began charging for checked baggage. That, in turn, has reduced the number of bags passengers are checking.      Low-cost carrier AirTran had the best baggage handling rate, 1.6 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers; American Eagle had the worst, 7.15.      The worst year for involuntary denied boardings, which are mostly due to overbooking, was in 2009 when they reached 1.19 per 10,000 passengers. That rate was down slightly last year, to 1.08.      American Eagle had the highest rate, at 4 per 10,000 passengers. Jet Blue, which has a policy against overbooking, had the lowest, 0.01.      The ratings are based on statistics for airlines that carry at least 1 percent of the passengers who flew domestically last year. The research is sponsored by Purdue University in Indiana, and by Wichita State University in Kansas.      ___      Online:      Study site: http://www.aqr.aero      Federal Aviation Administration: http://www.faa.gov      Bureau of Transportation Statistics: http://www.bts.gov ||||| This will appear next to all of your comments      This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Despite improvements in airline performance, including fewer lost bags and bumped passengers due to overbooking, traveler dissatisfaction increased in 2010 with complaints to the Department of Transportation rising by 28%.

Tropical Storm Ernesto moves toward pass along coast of Honduras TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras – Tropical Storm Ernesto's forward movement slowed a bit early Monday as it headed for an expected close pass along Honduras' northern coast after dropping heavy rains on Jamaica without causing serious problems. The storm passed to the south of Jamaica, where authorities said rains fell over much of the island, particularly its eastern areas. Rain and wind began tapering off Sunday evening, but the government urged islanders to remain alert during the night and said fishermen should remain in safe harbors. Ernesto hasn't made any direct hits on land since entering the Caribbean early Saturday, and the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was predicted to stay offshore while swirling past Honduras by Monday night. Many Jamaicans stocked up on food and water before the storm made itself felt on their island, but few seemed worried. Daniel Edwards, who was bailing out his small wooden fishing boat next to a dilapidated dock in Port Royal, a small fishing village, said he wasn't overly concerned by the storm. \\"It's not much of a muchness,\\" the veteran fisherman said. Forecasters said Ernesto could bring rain to the coast of Honduras on Monday. It is then expected to grow to near-hurricane force before moving ashore near the Belize-Mexico border early Wednesday and eventually passing into the southern Gulf of Mexico. A tropical storm warning was issued early Monday for the coast of Honduras, from the border with Nicaragua westward to Punta Sal, including the Bay Islands. A tropical storm watch was in effect for the main island of Grand Cayman in the Cayman Islands to the north of Ernesto. A Cayman government statement urged Grand Cayman residents to monitor the storm but said it was not likely to have serious effects on the British Caribbean territory. Also, Mexico has issued a hurricane watch Monday for the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. The U.S. hurricane center said Ernesto was centered about 145 miles (235 kilometers) east of Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Nicaragua-Honduras border early Monday. It had maximum sustained winds near 50 mph (85 kph) and was moving westward at 12 mph (19 kph). Far out in the Atlantic, Florence had weakened to a tropical depression Monday with maximum sustained winds near 35 (55 kph). Additional weakening is forecast and the U.S. National Hurricane Center says Florence was expected to degenerate within the next few days. Florence was centered about 1,610 miles (2,590 kilometers) east of the Northern Leeward Islands. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1.

We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 646: o = -64600 / 646 When we calculate this, we get: o = -100 So the solution to the math problem is: o = -100"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. Why was the boy upset?  A. because his grandmother was in the hospital  B. not enough information  C. he saw a deceased Santa Claus  D. he thought he would no longer get any presents A:","output":"The boy was upset for two primary reasons: C. he saw a deceased Santa Claus and D. he thought he would no longer get any presents.  Let's break down how these reasons contributed to the boy's emotional state.  C. He saw a deceased Santa Claus: The young boy, being only 7-8 years old, was likely very fond of the concept of Santa Claus and believed in his existence. In his mind, Santa Claus was a magical, benevolent figure that brought joy and happiness every holiday season. Seeing Santa's lifeless body with medical equipment attached and the costume cut up would undoubtedly be traumatic and distressing for a child. This sight shattered the boy's innocent perception of Santa Claus, and the tragedy of such an influential figure's death would have left the child devastated. D. He thought he would no longer get any presents: Additionally, the child's belief in Santa Claus directly tied to his understanding of how Christmas gifts were distributed. Since he saw Santa dead, he naturally assumed that there would be no one to deliver presents, resulting in him not receiving any gifts for Christmas. This aspect added to his distress and disappointment, overwhelming the young boy with sadness and worry. While one could argue that reasons A. because his grandmother was in the hospital could be a contributing factor in the boy's emotional state, it's important to consider the context and focus of the story. In this narration, the main issue lies in the boy's exposure to the harsh reality of the emergency room, particularly witnessing the deceased Santa, which resulted in his emotional upheaval about his understanding of Christmas and Santa Claus. The grandmother's hospitalization, while concerning, is not the primary focus of this situation, as the mother insisted the child could handle visiting the hospital. So, although the boy's grandmother being in the hospital may have been an underlying reason for his distress, the story emphasizes his reaction to the deceased Santa and the perceived consequences on his Christmas experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What artist's painting got funding for its restoration after it was feared it would soon be beyond repair?  Etty had used experimental techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem made worse by the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century there were a number of unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff determined that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting would soon be beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore the surface of the painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas was added to the back of the painting, and the three layers were glued together.In 2006 the repaired painting was moved back from the conservation studios to the Manchester Art Gallery. The Gallery Nine section of the MAG was converted into a temporary studio, open to the public to watch the final retouching work until it was completed in 2010, and The Sirens and Ulysses currently hangs in Gallery Three.

The time and money that doctors spend on their medical education is probably one reason for this problem. A visit to a doctor's office costs from 15 to 50 dollars. It's so expensive. Many people in the United States think that doctors are overpaid. However, most doctors disagree. They say that they were asked to study medicine for a long time. Tuition for many years of medical education costs a lot of money. Doctors say that it is necessary for most medical students to borrow money from the bank to pay their tuition. Because their money must be repaid to the bank, young doctors need to receive a lot of money for their work. So they charge people high prices for medical care. Therefore the cost of medical care in America is high. Because high tuition is one cause of high costs, one way to lower costs would be to have medical school that are free or have low tuition.

In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole.  Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean. The idea for the expedition had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that a specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole. Nansen supervised the construction of a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work. Fram's drift and Nansen's sledge journey proved conclusively that there were no significant land..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The precise geographic name of the pole Nansen and Johansen left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges to make for is the geographical North Pole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer from: [A]. no [B]. yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"The two questions are not exactly the same, but they are related. They both convey the interest in learning quickly and efficiently. However, the first question emphasizes gaining the most knowledge in the shortest time, while the second question focuses on the individual's approach to accelerating their learning. In order to answer the questions thoroughly, I will provide suggestions on how to learn the most in the shortest time, as well as personal strategies for learning faster. 1. How to learn the most in the shortest time:     a. Focus on one topic at a time: Concentrate on a single subject instead of multitasking. This will allow you to absorb more information in a shorter time span.     b. Utilize effective learning techniques: Techniques such as active learning, retrieval practice, spaced repetition, and the Pomodoro technique can aid in understanding and retaining information better.     c. Break tasks into smaller, manageable parts: Breaking tasks into smaller goals can promote a sense of achievement and help you retain information more efficiently.     d. Make use of available resources: Utilize various tools, online courses, books, or expert opinions that are readily accessible.     e. Apply learnt knowledge in real-life situations: This practical application of knowledge can help solidify your understanding.     f. Learn from other experts: Collaborate with or observe others in their respective fields to learn from their expertise. 2. How to learn faster:     a. Identify your learning style: Determine whether you prefer to learn visually, aurally, kinesthetically, or through a mix of these styles. Then, tailor your learning experiences to match.     b. Stay organized: Keep an organized workspace and utilize specific tools to help you stay organized, such as to-do lists, schedules, or a calendar.     c. Minimize distractions: Allocate a quiet space for learning and reduce any potential distractions.     d. Establish a routine: Consistent study habits, practice sessions, or reading times will significantly improve learning retention.     e. Get rest and take breaks: Sleep and break times are essential for resting the mind, retaining information, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  In conclusion, both questions emphasize the importance of efficient learning, though one asks for methods to acquire more knowledge within a short time frame, and the other seeks personal strategies for accelerating learning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Celtic have been handed a sensational Champions League reprieve after UEFA ruled Legia Warsaw fielded an ineligible player against the Scottish champions. Henning Berg's side had advanced to the play-off round after winning the home and away legs on a convincing 6-1 aggregate. But a UEFA disciplinary meeting convened before the European draws in Nyon decided Celtic should be awarded a 3-0 second leg victory - and advance on away goals - after Legia fielded defender Bartosz Bereszynski for the final three minutes of Wednesday night's win in Edinburgh. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Ronny Delia following Celtic's defeat on Wednesday. Reprieve? UEFA have launched an investigation into Celtic's Champions League defeat to Legia Warsaw. Suspended: Defender Bartosz Bereszynski came of for the final few minutes of the game. Going through? Bereszynski celebrates with team-mates as Legia Warsaw beat Celtic. Bartosz Bereszynski is a Polish international who has won two caps for his country. He started his career at Lech Poznan in 2009 before joining Legia Warsaw in 2013. The 22-year-old was suspended for the match having picked up a three match ban last season after being sent off against Apallon in the Europa League. He could have served two matches of his suspension in the second round against St Patrick's but Legia failed to register the defender for those matches allowing  Berg to choose from his full compliment of 25 players. News began to filter out for Uefa headquarters after the Legia chairman tweeted 'I failed' ahead of the official announcement. Red carded against Cypriots Appollon Limassol in a Europa League game last season Bereszynski was supposed to serve his suspension in UEFA competition this season. Unregistered for the second qualifying win over St Patrick's Athletic, however, the first opportunity to serve his ban came with during the Celtic tie. His late appearance as a substitute in the second leg was reported to the governing body by the UEFA match delegate leading to his eligibility being investigated. After being reinstated into the competition, Celtic were drawn against Maribor in the play-off round. Legia are likely to fight the decision after spokeswoman Elizabeth Kus said: 'This is the result of a misunderstanding. We have already seen comments appear which threaten us with expulsion, but this is absurd. UEFA have only asked us to explain.' Heat is on: Deila (left) sitting beside assistants John Collins and John Kennedy has suffered an horrendous start as Celtic boss following the Hoops failure to reach the group stage. Legia Warsaw midfielder Ondrej Duda gave a scathing assessment of Celtic's performance after the first leg, he said: 'St Patrick's playerd a lot tougher against us than Celtic. They gave us a very tough game in Warsaw. 'With Celtic, we didn't know what to expect, but we were expected to easily beat the Irish side, which we did, but only after a big fright and a good performance away. Fortunately, we regained our composure and we are now on the right track.' In an incredible twist this is the second time in three years Celtic have gained a UEFA reprieve following an ineligibility row. In September 2011 Swiss club FC Sion were expelled from the Europa League for fielding ineligible players. Sion won the qualifying tie 3-1 on aggregate, but following an appeal from Celtic, UEFA awarded the Parkhead club a 3-0 victory for each of the home and away legs of the tie which sent them into the group stages. A UEFA statement said: 'Legia have been sanctioned for fielding an ineligible player (article 18 of the UEFA Champions League regulations and article 21 of the Disciplinary Regulations). The match has been declared as forfeit meaning Legia Warszawa have lost the match 3-0. 'As a consequence, Celtic have qualified for the UEFA Champions League play-offs on away goals (agg: 4-4) and Legia will compete in the UEFA Europa League play-offs. 'In addition the player Bartosz Bereszynski has been suspended for one additional UEFA competition match for which he would be otherwise eligible. This suspension shall be added to the remaining two match suspension which the player still has to serve in accordance with the Control and Disciplinary Body decision of 13 February 2014.' Hopeful: Celtic fans, pictured ahead of Wednesday's night clash at Murrayfield, will be hoping for a reprieve. Celtic will now be among the seeded teams for Friday's draw. Legia Warsaw have five days within which to lodge an appeal, and a statement on the Polish's club website indicated they had requested UEFA's reasoning for the ruling before making a decision. Celtic benefited from an ineligibility ruling during the 2011-12 season when they were reinstated into the Europa League group stages despite a qualifying defeat by Sion. The Swiss side were ruled to have fielded five ineligible players after breaching a FIFA transfer ban and failed to reverse the decision during a lengthy legal battle. Legia chairman Dariusz Mioduski vowed to challenge UEFA's decision. He wrote on Twitter: 'Today, the sport lost behind closed doors. We made a mistake, sorry, but the penalty is disproportionate. Stay with us. We fight on.' Highlights:","output":"Celtic's soccer team got a second chance to play in the Champions League because their opponents, Legia Warsaw, made a mistake. Legia Warsaw let a player named Bartosz Bereszynski play in the game when he was not allowed to. Because of this, Celtic got a 3-0 victory for that game and was allowed to continue in the competition. This is the second time in three years that Celtic has gotten a second chance like this.

In the context of human reproduction, the \\"enough soil\\" represents a suitable environment in the uterus for implantation, growth, and development of the zygote, embryo, and ultimately the fetus. To analyze the potential direct or indirect effects of this perturbation on the overall human reproduction process, let's first understand the normal process and the importance of proper implantation. When fertilization occurs, the sperm and egg meet in the woman's fallopian tube and form a zygote. The zygote travels through the fallopian tube and eventually reaches the uterus. The lining of the uterus, called the endometrium, is crucial for the implantation of the zygote. The endometrium undergoes changes during the menstrual cycle to prepare for potential implantation, and when the zygote implants, this lining provides nutrition and support for the developing embryo. If the perturbation hypothesis were to occur and the zygote were unable to implant in the endometrium, several direct and indirect effects could take place: 1. Failure of implantation: Without implantation, the zygote cannot receive the necessary support and nutrition from the endometrium. As a result, it will not develop further and eventually be expelled from the body during menstruation. This can be considered a direct effect of the perturbation. 2. Hormonal imbalance: Implantation is a crucial event that triggers a series of hormonal changes in the woman's body. One such hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), is produced after implantation, and it helps maintain endometrium thickness, prevents menstruation, and supports early embryo development. Without implantation, hCG levels will not rise, the endometrium may not be maintained, and the overall hormonal balance of the woman may be disrupted. This is a potential indirect effect of the perturbation. 3. Emotional and psychological effects: If a couple is trying to conceive but fails due to unsuccessful implantation, this can lead to emotional distress and frustration, which can impact their overall well-being and further complicate their reproductive journey. These psychological effects can be considered indirect consequences of the perturbation. 4. Reproductive intervention: In some cases, failure of implantation may prompt couples to seek fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intrauterine insemination (IUI), in order to conceive. These treatments may carry their own risks and potential complications, which could be considered indirect effects of the perturbation hypothesis. In summary, failure of the zygote to implant in the endometrium, as suggested by the perturbation hypothesis, would have significant direct and indirect effects on the human reproduction process. The direct effect is the inability of the zygote to develop, while indirect effects include hormonal imbalances, emotional distress, and potential reproductive intervention. Proper implantation is, therefore, crucial for successful reproduction and the subsequent growth and development of a human being."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His response to \\"Siamese incursions\\" would launch the centuries-long Burmese-Siamese Wars between Burma and Siam. Siamese sources deny that Siam began the hostilities; rather, it was Burma's attempt to expand its territory eastwards taking advantage of a political crisis in Ayutthaya that started the hostilities.  The Burmese king sent a sizeable force  led by Gen. Saw Lagun Ein of Martaban to drive out the Siamese forces from Ye and Tavoy in late 1547. Saw Lagun Ein's forces defeated Siamese forces led by the governor of Kanchanaburi, and retook down to Tavoy. Tabinshwehti was not satisfied, and planned an invasion of Siam itself. Next year, near the end of the rainy season on 14 October 1548, , 12,000 strong Toungoo forces led by Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung invaded Siam via the Three Pagodas Pass. The Burmese forces overcame Siamese defences, and advanced to the capital city of Ayutthaya. But they could not take the heavily fortified city. One month into the siege, in January 1549, Siamese counterattacks broke the siege, and drove back the invasion force. On retreat, the Burmese tried to take Kamphaeng Phet, but it too was well defended by Portuguese mercenaries. Fortunately for the Burmese, they caught two important Siamese nobles  in some open fighting, and negotiated a safe retreat in exchange for the nobles in February 1549. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many months after the October invasion did the Burmese retreat?","output":"The Burmese invasion started in October and they retreated in February. If you think about it like a timeline, we have November, December, and January as full months that passed after the invasion in October. Then, when February comes around, that's when they decide to retreat. So that makes about 4 months after the invasion in October that the Burmese decided to retreat. Just like when you wait for your birthday to come after several months, the Burmese waited for a few months before they decided to leave."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information:  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - In fashion, midriff is a term for the human abdomen. The midriff is exposed when wearing a crop top or some forms of swimwear. The cholis worn by Indian women exposes a thin section of midriff, usually 3 to 4 inches.  - Satin is a weave that typically has a glossy surface and a dull back. The satin weave is characterized by four or more fill or weft yarns floating over a warp yarn or vice versa, four warp yarns floating over a single weft yarn. Floats are missed interfacings, where the warp yarn lies on top of the weft in a warp-faced satin and where the weft yarn lies on top of the warp yarns in weft-faced satins. These floats explain the even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, the light reflecting is not scattered as much by the fibres, which have fewer tucks. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which warp yarns are \\"floated\\" over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins. If a fabric is formed with a satin weave using filament fibres such as silk, nylon, or polyester, the corresponding fabric is termed a \\"satin\\", although some definitions insist that the fabric be made from silk. If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen.  - Fashion is a popular style or practice, especially in clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, body, or furniture. Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which a person dresses. It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers. Because the more technical term \\"costume\\" is regularly linked to the term \\"fashion\\", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear, while \\"fashion\\" generally means clothing, including the study of it. Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous.  - Lingerie are women's undergarments, and may imply their being fashionable and alluring.  - A crop top (also cropped top, belly shirt, half shirt, midriff shirt, midriff top, tummy top, short shirt, and cutoff shirt) is a top, the lower part of which is high enough to expose the waist, navel, or some of the midriff. The cropping of a top in this manner is generally limited to female garments. Bikinis and sports bras are generally not regarded as crop tops.  - A camisole is a sleeveless undergarment for women, normally extending to the waist. The camisole is usually made of satin, nylon, or cotton.  - Undergarments are items of clothing worn beneath outer clothes, usually in direct contact with the skin, although they may comprise more than a single layer. They serve to keep outer garments from being soiled or damaged by bodily excretions, to lessen the friction of outerwear against the skin, to shape the body, and to provide concealment or support for parts of it. In cold weather, long underwear is sometimes worn to provide additional warmth. Special types of undergarments have religious significance. Some items of clothing are designed as undergarments, while others, such as T-shirts and certain types of shorts, are appropriate both as undergarments and as outer clothing. If made of suitable material or textile, some undergarments can serve as nightwear or swimsuits, and some are intended for sexual attraction or visual appeal.  - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear.  - Nylon is a generic designation for a family of synthetic polymers, more specifically aliphatic or semi-aromatic polyamides. They can be melt-processed into fibers, films or shapes. The first example of nylon (nylon 6,6) was produced on February 28, 1935, by Wallace Carothers at DuPont's research facility at the DuPont Experimental Station. Nylon polymers have found significant commercial applications in fibers (apparel, flooring and rubber reinforcement), in shapes (molded parts for cars, electrical equipment, etc.), and in films (mostly for food packaging).<ref name=\\"Materials/Polyamide\\"></ref>  - A bustier ( alternately bustiere ) is a form - fitting garment for women , which is traditionally worn as lingerie . Its primary purpose is to push up the bust by tightening against the upper midriff and forcing the breasts up , while gently shaping the waist . Nowadays , it might also be worn as a push - up bra under a low - backed dress , or as a camisole for outerwear . The bustier can also be worn as a half - slip under sheer upper garments if a bold display of the midriff is not desired . A bustier resembles a basque , but it is shorter . It reaches down only to the ribs or waist . Modern bustiers are often made with mesh panels rather than the traditional boning .  - A choli (Hindi Nepali: , , , \\"ravike\\" Tamil: , Telugu: (ravike), although choli is the preferred word Telugu Kannada: ) is a midriff-baring blouse or upper garment in the Indian sari costume worn in India, southern Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and other countries where the sari is worn. It is also part of the ghagra choli costume of India.   - Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus \\"Gossypium\\" in the family of \\"Malvaceae\\". The fiber is almost pure cellulose. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will tend to increase the dispersal of the seeds.

This will be the standard Perry must meet. He will have to take the political risk of laying out details.\\" By Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images Iowa State Fair: GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry, right, campaigns on Monday. By Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images Iowa State Fair: GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry, right, campaigns on Monday. Ramesh Ponnuru and Rich Lowry, on National Review Online: \\"(Perry) gets an automatic entrée into the top tier and an excellent chance to become Mitt Romney's chief competitor, if not himself the front-runner. Besides Michele Bachmann, he's the only current officeholder among the top candidates. There's no arguing with his experience as governor the last 10 years of one of the country's most populous and economically dynamic states. He has a natural narrative as the outsider who has succeeded in addressing the nation's foremost problem — jobs. … He's a down-the-line conservative with a no-holds-barred combativeness when both substantive purity and a hard-line affect are highly prized by the party's grassroots.\\" Reihan Salam, on The Daily (iPad app): \\"At the heart of Perry's candidacy is the claim that he is responsible for Texas' relative economic health, including the fact that his state has an unemployment rate of 8.2% as opposed to the national rate of 9.2%. Democrats have attacked Perry's jobs record, claiming that (a) Perry is not responsible for Texas' success, and that (b) many of the jobs that have been created under his watch are low-wage 'McJobs' that don't merit kudos. These attacks will fall flat, regardless of merit, and Romney and Bachmann would do well not to parrot them. But there are other legitimate questions. … Conservatives have rightly condemned 'crony capitalism,' in which corporate insiders secure sweetheart deals from government. If Perry's Emerging Technology Fund and HPV vaccination requirements aren't prime examples, he should explain why.\\" Jeff Greenfield, in Politico: \\"Perry has been nothing but blunt about his disdain for Washington; about his view of Social Security and Medicare — probably the two federal programs that have the biggest impact on the lives of most Americans — as 'Ponzi schemes.' As a political matter, Perry himself has some tough questions to answer. … The larger issue is how deep the disdain for all things Washington has grown. To argue that the federal government has grown too large and too distant is one thing; Robert F. Kennedy, for example, made this argument often during his last years. To argue that there is nothing of moment that Washington should be doing marks a version of that argument that is nothing short of astonishing.\\" Ruben Navarette, Jr., on CNN.com: \\"If you want to compare Perry to someone, try Bill Clinton. Like the former president, Perry is the kind of candidate everyday Americans can relate to. He has abundant political skills. He is affable, charming and a great campaigner.

It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\".  - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea.  - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover.  - A University Royal Naval Unit (URNU) is a Royal Navy training establishment connected to a university, or a number of universities concentrated in one area. There are 15 URNUs nationwide in the UK, and each URNU has land-based facilities near the university in question, up to four training officers (members of the Royal Naval Reserve) and, with the exception of Devon, a dedicated training vessel (an \\"Archer\\"-class P2000 fast patrol boat).  - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world.

Therefore, the Archer-class patrol vessel is a type of patrol boat."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Think about the ideals, values, and moral attributes that are important to you.  These might include being a good friend or being healthy. Values and ideals are the ideas about life that you think you need to excel. They are different from goals in that goals are more concrete actions that can be completed. The first step is to figure out what excelling at life means to you, as well as for your values and the kind of life you want to have.  It may take time to sort through all of these questions and to decide what excelling at life truly means for you.  Try to create the broadest possible definition of excelling in life: short-term, long-term, big dreams and small successes.  Get a journal or notebook that you dedicate solely to your new vision of your life and how you want to see yourself succeed. Start by making a list of all the ways you could excel at life, whether they are realistic or not.  Write down your highest aspirations all the way down to simple things like doing the dishes every day. You may find that your definition of excelling at life can start with making small changes every day, whether it has to do with your personal health, finances, career goals, family, romance, personality traits such as being more kind, or nurturing your friendships. Look at your list of the ways you can excel. Then look at your list of values and ideals. Begin to figure out how they match up. Which goals accentuate your views about life and the kind of person you want to be? Start to group the ways you want to excel into similar categories, such as career goals, hobby goals, health goals, family and friendship goals. Then group these into long-term and short-term goals. You might have a health goal of being able to weight-lift 300 pounds, or you might have a career goal of becoming a journalist, or you might want to wash the dishes every night. Now that you have started to get clear on what excelling means for you, start prioritizing your goals.  Which ones are long-term goals that will make you feel like you are excelling at life?  Which goals can you practice on a daily basis in order to feel like you are living your life in a positive direction?  Excelling at life can be as simple as interacting with people with kindness, being a more organized person, investigating bigger life changes like a career change, or making an effort to spend more time with your family and friends. The most important part of defining what excelling at life is for you is that it resonates with who you are as an authentic person and what kind of life you want to live. Your journal will become your personal source for focus and inspiration.  Perhaps you have people in your life who inspire you because of their attitudes, strength, and perseverance. Find a picture of them or something that reminds you of them, and paste it in your journal. Use your role models to inspire you and remind you of what you aspire to be. You can also consider famous people, such as musicians or athletes, who inspire you because of their life, their actions, or that you can look up to and admire. For example, the Dalai Lama has been a symbol of peace for decades, even under great adversity.  You don’t have to become the Dalai Lama to remind yourself of his strength and attitude. This reminder can help you stay focused on the kind of person you want to be and the life you want to live. Think of these people as inspirational tools.

California Answer:","output":"Title: Golden State Secrets Setting: California, United States Plot: Step 1: Introduce the main character and family.  The story revolves around the Thompson family, consisting of parents Michael and Susan, their teenage children Emily and Jake, and their dog, Max. They live in a comfortable suburban home in a picturesque California town. Step 2: Establish the family's relationships and routines. The Thompson family appears to live a typical suburban life. Michael works as an architect while Susan is a successful lawyer. Emily, an aspiring artist, frequently clashes with her more conventional parents, while Jake, an awkward yet brilliant teenager, becomes increasingly engrossed in the study of local history. Step 3: Introduce a mysterious subplot. As Jake delves deeper into the town's history-driven by a school project-he inadvertently uncovers evidence of a dark secret regarding a prominent family who once resided in their very home. The previous family vanished under mysterious circumstances, and their tragic story has never been truly resolved. Step 4: Kickstart the family's journey. As strange occurrences begin to plague the Thompson's home and the surrounding area, Jake shares his findings with his skeptical family. They embark on a journey to unravel the truth behind the tragedy that befell the previous family, searching for hidden clues, seeking out the few remaining witnesses, and uncovering long-buried secrets. Step 5: Escalate tension and danger. As the Thompson family moves closer to the truth, their lives become increasingly jeopardized. At every turn, they are met with danger, resistance, and fear from those who wish for the secrets to remain hidden. Emily's artistic skills and Jake's historical knowledge prove invaluable in deciphering the enigmatic history surrounding their home. Step 6: Reveal the dark truth. The family's investigation leads them to the shocking revelation that the previous family's patriarch was involved in criminal activities and had made a dangerous enemy. Facing severe consequences, the previous family was forced to flee, leaving their mansion and life behind in an attempt to save themselves. Step 7: Resolve the conflict and restore peace. The Thompson family members put themselves in the line of duty; they work together to expose the truth, bring justice to the previous family, and confront the dangerous forces that had disrupted their once idyllic suburban life. By doing so, they solve the mystery and restore peace to their town, becoming local heroes in the process. Step 8: Conclude the story with emotional growth. The Thompson family emerges from their harrowing adventure stronger and more united than ever before. The experience allows them to appreciate each other's differences and celebrate the bonds that keep them together. As life returns to normal, they cherish the memories and lessons learned in their journey through Golden State Secrets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Add punctuation to the following sentence: Photos hold the precious memory of you","output":"The sentence you've provided, \\"Photos hold the precious memory of you\\", already contains correct punctuation. Here's why: 1. \\"Photos\\" - This is the subject of the sentence, which is plural. No punctuation is required. 2. \\"hold\\" - This is the verb of the sentence, connecting the subject \\"Photos\\" to the object. No punctuation is required. 3. \\"The precious memory of you\\" - This is the object of the sentence “memory“, further qualified by the two descriptors \\"precious\\" and \\"of you\\". No punctuation is required between the descriptors and the object.  The sentence ends with an appropriate punctuation - the full stop/period. However, if you want to add additional punctuation for stylistic purposes, or provide emphasis, you might consider the sentence: \\"Photos, hold the precious memory of you.\\" But, note that this transforms the sentence into an imperative statement, as if you are instructing the photos to hold the memory. Alternatively, if this sentence is part of a dialog where we need to indicate the sentiment of the person, punctuations can be used such as: \\"Photos hold the precious memory of you...\\" The ellipsis at the end suggests that there's more left unsaid or that the speaker is lost in thought.

Abstract: PURPOSE To define copy number alterations and gene expression signatures underlying pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG).     PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a high-resolution analysis of genomic imbalances in 78 de novo pediatric HGGs, including seven diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, and 10 HGGs arising in children who received cranial irradiation for a previous cancer using single nucleotide polymorphism microarray analysis. Gene expression was analyzed with gene expression microarrays for 53 tumors. Results were compared with publicly available data from adult tumors.     RESULTS Significant differences in copy number alterations distinguish childhood and adult glioblastoma. PDGFRA was the predominant target of focal amplification in childhood HGG, including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, and gene expression analyses supported an important role for deregulated PDGFRalpha signaling in pediatric HGG. No IDH1 hotspot mutations were found in pediatric tumors, highlighting molecular differences with adult secondary glioblastoma. Pediatric and adult glioblastomas were clearly distinguished by frequent gain of chromosome 1q (30% v 9%, respectively) and lower frequency of chromosome 7 gain (13% v 74%, respectively) and 10q loss (35% v 80%, respectively). PDGFRA amplification and 1q gain occurred at significantly higher frequency in irradiation-induced tumors, suggesting that these are initiating events in childhood gliomagenesis. A subset of pediatric HGGs showed minimal copy number changes.     CONCLUSION Integrated molecular profiling showed substantial differences in the molecular features underlying pediatric and adult HGG, indicating that findings in adult tumors cannot be simply extrapolated to younger patients. PDGFRalpha may be a useful target for pediatric HGG, including diffuse pontine gliomas..

Deep Purple released 4 songs in the year 1984.","output":"Based on the information provided regarding the Shades 1968-1998 4 CD-Box-Set by Deep Purple, we cannot definitively conclude that Deep Purple released 4 songs in the year 1984. The box set covers a wide range of songs and material from Deep Purple's career spanning 1968 to 1998, but it does not necessarily document every song or release from the band during that period.  To assess the conclusion that Deep Purple released 4 songs in 1984, it would be necessary to analyze the band's specific releases from that year, including album releases, singles, and any other related material. Given that the band has a long and prolific history, it is certainly possible that they released multiple songs in 1984, but we cannot determine the exact number of songs released in that year based on the information provided about the Shades 1968-1998 box set alone. Furthermore, the box set comprises rare edits, singles, and remastered versions of their biggest hits, but it may not include every single song or release from their extensive and varied discography. Therefore, the box set is not an exhaustive resource for identifying all songs released by Deep Purple in a specific year. In order to accurately determine how many songs Deep Purple released in 1984, it would be best to consult the band's official discography or other comprehensive resources with detailed information on their releases from that time period.

Available options: 1). yes. 2). it is not possible to tell. 3). no.","output":"3). No. The hypothesis \\"Most people are too drunk to finish all 24 questions.\\" is not necessarily true based on the provided premise.  It's important to clarify what the MAST (Michigan Alcohol-Screening Test) is meant to do. The purpose of the MAST is not to measure immediate intoxication or determine whether a person is drunk at the moment, such as in a roadside test, but rather aims to screen for alcohol abuse and actual dependence. This means that its effectiveness and application would be utilized over a more extended period, evaluating an individual's pattern of behavior related to alcohol consumption. The MAST comprises 24 yes/no questions, which are intended to offer insight into possible problematic consumption patterns based on the patient's past and present behavior. These questions address various fields, including adverse health effects, legal repercussions, family concerns, and more stemming from the individual's relationship with alcohol. The goal is not to evaluate their current mental clarity or direct sobriety, but to assess their overall lifestyles and choices related to alcohol use. Therefore, it is not necessarily relevant how intoxicated an individual is when he or she takes the test. Even if a participant is under the influence during the test administration, it's the pattern of alcohol use and its impact on their lifestyle that is evaluated, not their immediate intoxication level. Further, it would be incorrect to assume that 'most' individuals undergoing such a test are too impaired to complete it accurately. Tests like the MAST are usually administered within controlled environments like clinics, hospitals, addiction treatment centers, etc., under the supervision of medical professionals. This makes it unlikely that the majority taking the test would be too intoxicated to complete it. In conclusion, the MAST aims to screen potential alcohol abuse and dependence primarily based on an individual's life choices and behaviors around alcohol use, rather than their immediate sobriety at the time of test administration. Thus, the hypothesis is not accurate based on the premise provided."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you're given a statement and three sentences as choices.

I moved my wet clothing from the suitcase to the laundry bag, and as a result, the  Pick your answer from: 1. suitcase became heavy.; 2. bag became heavy.;","output":"2. bag became heavy. As the wet clothing was transferred from the suitcase to the laundry bag, the weight distribution shifted between the two containers. Since wet clothes are heavier than dry ones due to the additional water weight, this transfer significantly increased the laundry bag's weight. In this scenario, the laundry bag becoming heavy is a direct consequence of the mover's action. Meanwhile, the suitcase would become lighter as the wet clothing is removed, so it is not a valid conclusion in this case. To further understand this, let's break down the process step by step: 1. The individual had wet clothing inside the suitcase. Wet clothing tends to be heavier because the fabric absorbs and retains water, making it denser and more massive. Keeping wet items within the suitcase can also damage other belongings and cause unpleasant odors. 2. The person decided to move the wet clothing from the suitcase to a laundry bag. This decision effectively separates the wet items from dry ones, preventing damage to the other contents and stopping the spread of any unwanted odors. 3. As the wet clothing was moved to the laundry bag, the weight of each container began to change. The suitcase would become lighter, as it no longer needs to bear the burden of the wet clothes. Conversely, the laundry bag would take on the bulk of the mass, as it receives the clothes that were once in the suitcase. 4. The end result of this process is the laundry bag becoming heavy, as it now carries the full weight of the wet clothing. The suitcase, on the other hand, would experience a reduction in heft, since it no longer contains the water-laden items. So, based on the provided options, the correct answer is: \\"2. bag became heavy,\\" as it accurately reflects the transfer of weight that occurs when moving wet clothing from a suitcase to a laundry bag."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie Title: Out of Bounds Out of Bounds takes an interesting premise and quickly loses its footing, resulting in a tedious, lackluster viewing experience. The film heavily relies on clichéd tropes, having the audience guess each move while it struggles to maintain any semblance of originality. The underdeveloped characters are wholly unlikable and one-dimensional, which severely hinders any attempt at an emotional connection. It's hard to care for their fate when they come across as mere caricatures. Additionally, the dialogue is stilted and downright cringeworthy, distracting from any potentially engaging plot points. Furthermore, the directing fails to elevate the material, as the pacing drags and meanders, leaving the viewer disengaged throughout. Uninspired visuals contribute to an overall bland atmosphere, making it difficult to appreciate any artistic aspect in Out of Bounds.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   In other cases, individuals may appear similar although they are not members of the same species. For example, even though bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) are both birds and eagles, each belongs to a separate species group (Figure 18.10). If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize the egg of a bald eagle with the sperm of an African fish eagle and a chick did hatch, that offspring, called a hybrid (a cross between two species), would probably be infertile—unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity. Different species may have different genes that are active in development; therefore, it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions. Thus, even though hybridization may take place, the two species still remain separate.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Who does Pete ask if he's seen a guy that he can't see?, using the article: Donald Duck is doing some camouflage painting on a cannon with yellow, green, and red stripes and black dots (based on the colors of the Flag of Lithuania with bullet holes in it). Sergeant Pete sees it and scolds Donald, explaining that it needs to painted so it can't be seen.  Pete then demands that Donald re-paint the cannon to make it \\"hard to see\\".  Obliging to the sergeant's orders, Donald walks to the \\"Experimental Laboratory: Camouflage Corps\\", disregarding the 'keep out' sign, and walks in. He finds some \\"invisible paint\\", which he tests with his finger, and uses it to paint the cannon. When Pete returns, he is shocked to find the cannon seemingly gone, believing it to be stolen.  But of course it isn't stolen, as the sergeant finds out the hard way by bonking his head on the underside of the cannon and discovering Donald inside.  Angered that Donald painted the cannon too invisible to see, Pete blows hard into one end of the barrel, sending Donald out the other end and into the bucket of invisible paint.  When Donald runs away, Pete finds out Donald has become invisible after seeing Donald's footprints on the ground.  Donald then swims across a lake, but the invisible paint doesn't come off. Pete continues to chase Donald through a field of flowers, until he accidentally throws some of the flowers on Donald, revealing his outline.  Pete spots Donald and tries to catch him, but he gets away again.  However, this gives Pete an idea to find Donald.  When the General drives up, Pete's antics, including jumping around a tree while singing \\"Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush\\" and throwing flowers, convinces the General that he is acting odd, especially after he asks the General \\"did you see a little guy that you can't see?\\"  The invisible Donald then puts a cactus down Pete's pants, making him scream in pain and jump around like a madman, making the General wonder what is going on with Pete., what would be the answer ?

It's made up of 118 tiny islands in the Adriatic Sea. The area, however, may be in over its head. But now scientists have a new plan to save the city. Because the city was built on soft soil, it has been sinking under the pressure of its own weight. Scientists estimate that Venice sinks at a rate of nearly 2 inches every 100 years. Rising sea levels could make Venice go under even faster, some experts say. Earth's temperature is slowly increasing. That is causing sea ice to melt, which makes the world's waters rise, they say. To keep the city afloat, experts want to pump about 40 billion gallons of sea water beneath Venice. The liquid would expand the sand under the city, which would help support the islands, explains lead scientist Giuseppe Gambolati. Experts are rushing to save Venice because of its rich history. The city was once a strong sea power. \\"Many famous artists and opera singers have come from Venice. Some of the world's greatest paintings can be found on the city's museum walls,\\" explains Melissa Conn, who is a director of Save Venice Inc. While scientists work to get their water-pumping plan approved, Venice's residents go about their normal routines. When the tide rolls in, the locals have ways of keeping everyone dry. Cafe owners move tables to higher ground, and hotels pass out high boots to guests. Still, dealing with the rising water does not give the city's residents a sinking feeling, just ask Erla Zwingle. She has lived in Venice for 17 years. \\"There has always been high water in Venice.\\" Zwingle told WR News. \\"If high water really were a serious problem, people wouldn't be still living here.\\" What's the main reason Venice is sinking? A) Its population is rising. B) Its buildings are too weighty. C) The soil it was built on is not solid. D) Its underground water is being overused. A:","output":"The main reason Venice is sinking is C) The soil it was built on is not solid. Venice was constructed on soft, marshy soil, which is not capable of supporting the city's weight over time. This has caused the city to gradually sink at a rate of approximately 2 inches every 100 years. Additionally, rising sea levels attributed to global warming and melting sea ice exacerbate the situation, threatening to submerge the city even faster. To combat the sinking, experts have proposed a plan to pump about 40 billion gallons of sea water beneath Venice. This would expand the sand under the city and provide better support for the islands. The intention is to preserve Venice, a city with immense historical and cultural significance, known for its contributions to the arts, opera, and maritime strength. In the meantime, local residents and businesses adapt to the rising waters and continue with their routines. They employ various methods to keep people and spaces dry during high tide, highlighting the resilience of the Venetian people. However, the urgency to save Venice and protect its heritage remains a primary concern for scientists and experts in the field."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. Andrea believes that: - grand canal issues - Bridge issue - not enough information - waterway issue Answer:","output":"Andrea believes that there are several issues related to the construction of the Rialto Bridge, such as the challenges posed by the Grand Canal, the structural concerns of the bridge, limited information on the best way to build the bridge, and the need to accommodate the waterway for boats to pass underneath. His design, which featured three arches, was rejected because it would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Antonio Da Ponte's design, which was ultimately chosen, addressed these concerns by providing a more practical and functional solution for the Rialto Bridge."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Solve this instance: Article: A glass a day keeps obesity at bay.Alcohol has always been thought to cause weight gain because of its high sugar content,but new research suggests a glass a day could form part of a diet.Looking at past studies they found that,while heavy drinkers do put on weight;those who drink _ can actually lose weight. A spokesman for the research team at Navarro University in Spain says,\\"Light to moderate alcohol intake,especially of wine,may be more likely to protect against,rather than promote,weight gain\\".The International Scientific Forum on Alcohol Research reviewed the findings and agreed with most of the conclusions,particularly that current data do not clearly indicate if moderate drinking increases weight. Boston University's Dr.Harvey Finkel found that the biologic mechanisms relating alcohol to changes in body weight are not properly understood.His team pointed out the strong protective effects of moderate drinking on the risk of getting conditions like diabetes ,which relate to increasing obesity.Some studies suggest that even very obese people may be at lower risk of diabetes if they are moderate drinkers. The group says alcohol provides calories that are quickly absorbed into the body and are not stored in fat,and that this process could explain the differences in its effects from those of other foods.They agree that future research should be directed towards assessing the roles of different types of alcoholic drinks,taking into consideration drinking patterns and including the past tendency of participants to gain weight. For now there is little evidence that consuming small to moderate amounts of alcohol on a regular basis increases one's risk of becoming obese.What's more,a study three years ago suggested that resveratrol,a compound present in grapes and red wine,destroys fat cells.

A: Answer:","output":"The device that you are referring to is known as a battery. A battery is an electrochemical cell or a series of cells connected in either series or parallel configuration that produces an electric current by converting stored chemical energy into electrical energy. The electrochemical cell consists of two electrodes (an anode and a cathode) and an electrolyte solution that facilitates the flow of ions between the electrodes. In a battery, the chemical reactions occurring at the anode and cathode cause electrons to build up at the anode, creating a potential difference between the two electrodes. When an electrical load (such as a light bulb or a motor) is connected to the battery, electrons flow from the anode to the cathode through the external circuit, providing power to the load. Batteries come in various sizes and types, such as disposable (primary) batteries like alkaline or zinc-carbon batteries, and rechargeable (secondary) batteries like lithium-ion, nickel-cadmium, or lead-acid batteries. They are commonly used in portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, and various industrial applications, among others."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: with grooming scissors and tweezers. Use a pair of grooming scissors to trim back any eyebrow hairs that are noticeably longer than the rest. Then, use tweezers to pluck out any hairs that are rooted outside the natural contour of your eyebrows.  If your eyebrows are particularly bushy, comb through them before trimming so the hairs are lying properly. Or, wet your fingers a bit and smooth the eyebrows into place. You can keep plucking if you want to further thin out the natural look of your eyebrows, but that’s up to you. Use the grooming scissors that come with a typical grooming kit (along with tweezers, nail clippers, etc.), not the full-size scissors you’d use for a haircut. If you have any stray hairs growing off of the outside of your ear, either pluck them out with tweezers or cut them down as short as you can with grooming scissors. Remove each hair with a firm, quick yank of the tweezers, or pull each hair taut with the tweezers, then hold the scissors parallel to the flesh of your ear and cut the hair off at the base.  Use tweezers to yank out any visible hairs growing from inside your ear canal. This will hurt a bit, but you can reduce the pain by gripping the hair shaft firmly with your tweezers and pulling quickly and firmly. Never stick grooming scissors or any other sharp object into your ears. Only pluck hairs from the inside of your ear if they’re visible outside your ear. Pull any protruding nose hairs in each nostril taut with your tweezers, then hold the scissors parallel to your nostril opening and cut each hair off as short as you can. Do not stick the scissors up into your nose to trim the hairs. Also, don’t pluck hairs from out of your nose—any minor bleeding may lead to an infection.  Alternatively, you can purchase an electric nose hair trimmer. Models vary, but generally you'll just turn it on and stick the rounded trimmer into each nostril. Don't stick it farther up your nose than directed. Pluck or trim any rogue hairs growing on the top or side of your nose. If you’re going for a clean-shaven look, use a manual razor. Soften your skin and open your pores by showering or washing your face, then massage in a healthy coating of shaving cream. Shave in the direction of hair growth and rinse the blade often with clean water. Finish by rinsing your face with cool water, patting it dry, and applying an aftershave lotion or balm.  Use a clean, sharp razor every time you shave. If the blade is getting dull or full of gunk, replace it. If you want to keep a tidy beard, use a grooming trimmer instead. Adjust the blade setting to your desired length setting and glide the trimmer over your facial hair in even, smooth strokes. If you have sensitive skin on your face that gets easily irritated by shaving, keep in mind that the same will likely happen if you shave other areas of your body. In this case, you may want to trim your body hair instead of shaving it. If you're shaving your face, just include the front of your neck in the process. Shaving the back of your neck can be a bit trickier. Either use a handheld mirror in one hand and the razor in the other, or find someone who's willing to give you a quick neck shave. If you plan to shave your back (which is also much easier with a partner), you can include the back of your neck in that process.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Tara Ann VanDerveer (born June 26, 1953) is an American basketball coach who has been the head women's basketball coach at Stanford University since 1985. Designated the Setsuko Ishiyama Director of Women's Basketball, VanDerveer led the Stanford Cardinal to two NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championships: in 1990 and 1992. She stepped away from the Stanford program for a year to serve as the U.S. national team head coach at the 1996 Olympic Games. VanDerveer is the 1990 Naismith National Coach of the Year and a ten-time Pac-12 Coach of the Year. VanDerveer was born on June 26, 1953, to Dunbar and Rita VanDerveer, who named their first child \\"Tara\\" after the plantation in Gone with the Wind. She was born in Melrose, Massachusetts, a part of Greater Boston, but grew up in a small town in West Hill, near Schenectady, New York. Her parents were interested in a well-rounded education. Her father was studying for a doctorate at the school now known as the University at Albany. He took the family to Chautauqua in the summer, where she immersed in arts as well as sports. At the age of ten, her parents bought her a flute, and arranged for lessons. Two years later, one of the premier flutists in the world was staying in Chautauqua, and her father arranged for lessons with this distinguished teacher. Although she learned to play, she did not enjoy the experience, and gave up the flute in ninth grade. The love of music stayed with her though, and in later years she would take up the piano.  There were no sports teams for girls when she was in high school, but she played a number of sports including basketball, in rec leagues and pickup. When she was younger, she played with both boys and girls. As she entered her high school years, the girls dropped out for other interests, so she was more apt to play with boys. To help make sure she would be chosen, she bought the best basketball she could afford, so if the boys wanted to play with her basketball, they would have to pick her.  Her father wasn't completely supportive of her basketball interest, calling her in from the neighbor's basketball hoop, telling her, \\"Basketball won't take you anywhere. Come in and do your algebra.\\" Tara was equally certain that algebra wasn't going to take her anywhere. Her family moved to Niagara Falls in her sophomore year in high school. The house in West Hill had a gravel driveway, making a basketball hoop impractical, but when her parents got her a hoop for Christmas when they were in Niagara Falls. By then, she thought she was too old for basketball, although she would take it up again after she transferred to Buffalo Seminary, an all-girls college preparatory school, in her junior year. She ended up earning a place in the Buffalo Seminary's Athletic Hall of Fame.

Question: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep.

They believe that if the U.S. does not take action now, China and other countries will continue to pose a threat to American jobs, not only in the steel and aluminum sectors but also in other industries along the supply chain.

Jewish synagogues Congregation Sons of Israel and Chabad Lubavitch of Briarcliff Manor & Ossining are in Chilmark.Saint Mary's Episcopal Church, founded in 1839 by William Creighton as Saint Mary's Church, Beechwood, is Briarcliff Manor's oldest church; it was reincorporated in 1945 as Saint Mary's Church of Scarborough. The granite church was built by local stonemasons and paid for by Creighton's wealthy neighbors, including Commodore Matthew Perry, James Watson Webb, William Aspinwall, and Ambrose Kingsland. The church is in near-original condition, with a design based on the 14th-century Gothic St. Mary's parish church in Scarborough, England and the only church with a complete set of William Jay Bolton stained-glass windows. The church, built in 1851, is a contributing property to the National Register-listed Scarborough Historic District.

Read things all the time. This will make your vocabulary better and it will also help you learn grammar and slang.  Read comics. An easy option, if you don't want to read children's books, is to read comic books or comics instead. You can buy many English language comic books in bookstores and online, or you can read free comics online (these are usually called webcomics). Read books you've read before. If you already know a little bit about what happens, then you will have an easier time guessing and understanding the words. Read the newspaper. Newspapers are a good way to learn the basics of a language, because they usually have very good grammar and are written to be easy to understand. You can find online versions of many good English language newspapers, like the New York Times or The Guardian. Watching movies will also help you improve your English, by helping you to hear what it sounds like and also helping you to learn new words. You can start watching with subtitles on, but you will learn more with the subtitles off. Once you have a basic vocabulary, try to keep the subtitles off and focus on listening for the words you do know and guessing the words you don't know from what is happening on the screen. MMOs are video games that you play online with other people. You can choose to play with people in English-speaking countries, which will give you the chance to talk with them and learn from them. Try playing Guild Wars, World of Warcraft, or The Elder Scrolls Online. Pen-pals are people trying to learn your language that you write letters (or emails) to and they write back. You write half of your letter in your native language so that they can practice and half in English so that you can practice. You can talk about whatever you want! There are many websites that can help you find an online pen-pal.

Morris A:","output":"Title: Dirty Hands in the Race for Change Step 1: Introduction Justify: Establish the premise and main characters Plot Introduction: Dirty Hands in the Race for Change is a political drama set in a small fictional town called Brooksville. The story centers around Morris, the town's mayor, who is caught between opposing forces as he tries to clean up the town's politics. Morris, a good-hearted public servant, is adamant about running a clean campaign for his re-election bid. However, he faces tough opposition from Dan, his underhanded adversary who's willing to employ dirty tactics to hinder Morris's progress. Step 2: Conflict Justify: Introduce the conflict that drives the story Conflict Introduction: As the election season starts, both campaigns are in full swing. Morris's campaign team is entirely focused on being transparent and sharing their plans for the town, while Dan's team plays dirty tricks, such as running fake news smears against Morris and spreading rumors. Morris's campaign manager, Sarah, must find ways to expose the underhanded tactics, all while maintaining their position on clean, transparent politics. Step 3: Rising Action Justify: Develop the story with increasing complications and dilemmas Rising Action: As the tension between the two campaigns grows, Morris finds himself in a moral dilemma. He contemplates whether to confront Dan directly or continue down the path of a clean campaign. Meanwhile, Sarah digs deeper and uncovers connections between Dan and a corrupt local businessman who has been funding his campaign. As Morris is about to hold a press conference to expose Dan's connection to the businessman, he's blackmailed by an anonymous source with damaging information about his past. Step 4: Climax Justify: Create the most intense, emotional, or suspenseful moment in the story Climax: In a pivotal scene, Morris defies the blackmailer and publicly admits to a mistake he made in his youth. Ignoring the potential damage to his campaign, Morris decides to expose the truth about Dan's relationship with the corrupt businessman, ensuring that the voters have all the information they need to make an informed decision. Step 5: Falling Action Justify: Resolve the main conflict and bring the story toward a resolution Falling Action: In the aftermath of the press conference, Morris's honesty and transparency resonate with the townspeople. The public backlash against Dan's underhanded tactics forces him to publicly apologize and withdraw from the race. Morris's campaign gains momentum, and he wins the election by a significant margin. Step 6: Conclusion Justify: Finalize the story with a resolution and reflection on the events Conclusion: With a renewed sense of responsibility and commitment to honest politics, Morris is re-elected as mayor of Brooksville.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Parts of a Typical Rib The posterior end of a typical rib is called the head of the rib (see Figure 7.27). This region articulates primarily with the costal facet located on the body of the same numbered thoracic vertebra and to a lesser degree, with the costal facet located on the body of the next higher vertebra. Lateral to the head is the narrowed neck of the rib. A small bump on the posterior rib surface is the tubercle of the rib, which articulates with the facet located on the transverse process of the same numbered vertebra. The remainder of the rib is the body of the rib (shaft). Just lateral to the tubercle is the angle of the rib, the point at which the rib has its greatest degree of curvature. The angles of the ribs form the most posterior extent of the thoracic cage. In the anatomical position, the angles align with the medial border of the scapula.

The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women’s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said “Whatever doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger”. How did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I’d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped. The twins are 37 now.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? unforced","output":"The phrase \\"unforced\\" is generally considered to be positive. However, the interpretation of this phrase can depend on the context in which it is used and the subject matter being discussed. To better understand the positive implications of the word \\"unforced,\\" let us examine its meaning and potential applications. \\"Unforced\\" is an adjective typically used to describe something that occurs naturally, without being prompted or compelled. It implies that the action, decision, or behavior in question is genuinely spontaneous and arises from an individual's preferences, natural inclinations, or genuine intentions. This spontaneous quality is usually seen as a positive aspect since it suggests authenticity and a lack of contrived effort or pretense. Some common contexts where \\"unforced\\" is viewed as a positive aspect include: 1. Communication and interpersonal relationships: An unforced conversation is typically seen as more honest, genuine, and enjoyable than a conversation that seems forced or overly structured. Similarly, unforced gestures of affection and friendship indicate that a person is acting based on their true feelings, rather than for ulterior motives. 2. Art and creativity: In the context of artistic expression, unforced creativity is often valued over calculated or formulaic approaches. When a piece of art or music is considered unforced, it means that the artist has created it spontaneously and intuitively, allowing their own distinctive style to shine through. 3. Sports and competitions: Athletes who display unforced skills are often admired for their natural talents and ease of movement. A player is said to have an unforced style if they can perform difficult maneuvers effortlessly, without appearing to exert much effort. This is in contrast to a forced or labored performance, which may seem less skilled or elegant. 4. Decision-making and problem-solving: Unforced decisions often indicate that someone has carefully considered their choices and acted based on their best judgment, rather than simply following external pressures or expectations. In some cases, \\"unforced\\" can also be used as part of negative expressions, such as \\"unforced errors\\" in sports. However, these instances are relatively rare, and the negative connotation arises from the context and the addition of the word \\"error,\\" rather than from the term \\"unforced\\" itself. In general, using \\"unforced\\" to describe actions, behaviors, or decisions is likely to convey positive sentiments about those actions' spontaneity, authenticity, and genuineness."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight.

At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers.

A:","output":"No, \\"The tags contain electronically stored information.\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question \\"How is an RFID tag powered?\\".  A detailed answer to the question is: RFID tags are primarily powered in two ways: passive and active. I. Passive RFID tags do not have an internal power source. Instead, they draw power from the electromagnetic field created by the RFID reader when it emits radio waves. This energy activates the integrated circuit within the tag, which modulates the radio waves and sends the stored information back to the reader. II. Active RFID tags have their own built-in power source, typically a small battery. This power source allows active tags to emit a constant signal, making them more reliable and effective over longer distances. However, their operational life is limited by the battery lifespan.

Math Problem Solve -334*k = -341*k + 49 for k.","output":"To solve the equation -334*k = -341*k + 49 for k, follow these steps: 1. Start with the given equation:    -334*k = -341*k + 49 2. To isolate the variable k, we want to get all the terms with k on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side. Add 341*k to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -341*k term on the right side:    -334*k + 341*k = -341*k + 341*k + 49 3. Simplify both sides of the equation:     7*k = 49 4. Now, to solve for k, divide both sides of the equation by 7:     (7*k) / 7 = 49 / 7 5. Simplify and solve for k:     k = 7 So, k = 7 is the solution to the equation -334*k = -341*k + 49."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He said to himself, \\"She's not going to give this galvanized cadaver up, that's plain. Wild horses can't pull her away from him. I've done my share; it's for Sellers to take an innings, now.\\" So he sent this message to New York:  \\"Come back. Hire special train. She's going to marry the materializee.\\"  Meantime a note came to Rossmore Towers to say that the Earl of Rossmore had just arrived from England, and would do himself the pleasure of calling in the evening. Sally said to herself, \\"It is a pity he didn't stop in New York; but it's no matter; he can go up to-morrow and see my father. He has come over here to tomahawk papa, very likely--or buy out his claim. This thing would have excited me, a while back; but it has only one interest for me now, and only one value. I can say to--to-- Spine, Spiny, Spinal--I don't like any form of that name!--I can say to him to-morrow, 'Don't try to keep it up any more, or I shall have to tell you whom I have been talking with last night, and then you will be embarrassed.'\\"  Tracy couldn't know he was to be invited for the morrow, or he might have waited. As it was, he was too miserable to wait any longer; for his last hope--a letter--had failed him. It was fully due to-day; it had not come. Had his father really flung him away? It looked so. It was not like his father, but it surely looked so. His father was a rather tough nut, in truth, but had never been so with his son--still, this implacable silence had a calamitous look.

Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name.

Peace and Prosperity: After years of government propaganda predicting the worst atrocities, most Japanese civilians were surprised at the warmth and friendliness of the occupying forces. The postwar period began, however, with millions of displaced people homeless and starving. To counter a perceived communist threat from the Soviet Union, the US quickly set to work reconstructing the economy by transforming Japan's institutions and devising a new pacifist constitution. Article 9 renounced Japan's right to maintain armed forces, although the ambiguous wording was later taken to permit the creati on of a \\"self-defense\\" force. The zaibatsu conglomerates that had proved so instrumental in boosting Japan's militarism were disbanded, later to re-emerge as the keiretsu trading conglomerates that dominated the economy once again. The entire economy received a massive jump-start with the outbreak of the Korean War, with Japan ironically becoming the chief local supplier for an army it had battled so furiously just a few years earlier. The occupation lasted until 1952, having already planted the seeds for Japan's future stunning economic success. Economic output was back to prewar levels, and British auto companies provided the support needed to get Japan's auto industry back on its feet. Japanese companies then enthusiastically imported any Western technologies they could get their hands on. This included transistor technology — invented in the US but then considered to have only limited applications — for the surreal sum of 25,000. It was Japan that produced the world's first transistor radio. The electronic technology spurt that followed is now legendary. Parliamentary democracy finally came into its own, albeit with distinctly Japanese characteristics reflecting the dislike of debate and confrontation and the group-oriented preference for maintaining the appearance of harmony at all times. The government, through the powerful Finance Ministry and Ministry of International Trade and Industry, generously supported favored private corporations: first shipping, then cars, then electronics firms basked in the warmth of the government's loving attentions. Japan overtook Britain economically in 1964. By the end of the decade, Japan's was the third largest economy in the world — less then two decades after the war had left the country in ruins. Prosperity was not without its own problems: pollution caused by \\"dirty\\" industries, a high incidence of stomach ulcers (even suicides) among schoolchildren pressured by over-ambitious parents, and the awkward questions of what to do about nuclear energy. The famous coziness among politicians, bureaucrats, and private companies, together with the strong cultural emphasis on relationship-building and a lack of transparency and accountability, eventually led to corrupt practices of endemic proportions.

Combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation: 0 = -5*a - 25 Step 2: Isolate the variable (a). To isolate a, you need to get rid of the -5 next to it. Since -5 is multiplied by a, you will divide both sides of the equation by -5 to cancel it out and isolate a: 0 / -5 = (-5*a - 25) / -5 Step 3: Perform the division on both sides of the equation. Divide both the constant term and the term with the variable by -5: 0 = a + 5 Step 4: Solve for a. Now, you need to eliminate the constant 5 on the right side of the equation. Since 5 is added to a, you will subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to cancel it out and solve for a: a = 0 - 5 a = -5 So the answer to the equation 0 = -5*a - 5 - 20 is a = -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Now, I have a new situation: Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight.  Answer this question please: Which group has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0? Answer:","output":"Group Yellow has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0. Step 1: Identify the energy consumption of both groups. - Group Brown consumed an extra 3,500 Calories a day for 3 months. - Group Yellow maintained a normal diet. Step 2: Understand the effects of excess energy consumption on the body. - According to the background, an extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. Step 3: Analyze the potential weight gain for Group Brown. - Over the course of 3 months (90 days), Group Brown consumed an extra 3,500 Calories x 90 days = 315,000 extra Calories. Step 4: Calculate the potential fat storage for Group Brown. - With the extra 315,000 Calories, Group Brown could potentially store 315,000 Calories / 3,500 Calories per pound = 90 pounds (40.8 kg) of body fat. Step 5: Assess the risk of obesity for both groups. - Since Group Brown gained a lot of weight due to their excessive calorie intake, they would have a higher likelihood of increasing their BMI and potentially crossing the threshold for obesity (BMI of 30.0 kg/m² or greater). - Group Yellow, who maintained a normal diet, would have a lower risk of increasing their BMI and crossing the obesity threshold. Based on this analysis, Group Yellow would have a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0 compared to Group Brown, as they consumed a normal diet while Group Brown consumed excessive calories, leading to significant weight gain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Today there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700 there was no policeman in London at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night, and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago, London started to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves who stole money in the streets that people had to stay in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called \\"Bow Street Runners\\" because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force was started with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. There was no policewoman in London until 1920. Today, London police are quite well paid and only a few police officers still ride horses. Perhaps the London Police Force's greatest achievement   is to meet changing  conditions and provide excellent police service  .

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the title of the song whose central rift is in NWOBHM fashion?, using the article: Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity...., what would be the answer ?

Plot title: The Addams Family Movie plot: Gomez Addams laments the 25-year absence of his brother Fester, who disappeared after the two had a falling-out. Gomez's lawyer Tully Alford owes money to loan shark Abigail Craven, and notices that her son Gordon closely resembles Fester. Tully proposes that Gordon pose as Fester to infiltrate the Addams household and find the hidden vault where they keep their vast riches. Tully and his wife Margaret attend a sÃ©ance at the Addams home led by Grandmama in which the family tries to contact Fester's spirit. Gordon arrives, posing as Fester, while Abigail poses as psychiatrist Dr. Pinder-Schloss and tells the family that Fester had been lost in the Bermuda Triangle for the past 25 years. Gomez, overjoyed to have Fester back, takes him to the family vault to view home movies from their childhood. Gordon learns the reason for the brothers' falling-out: Gomez was jealous of Fester's success with women, and wooed the conjoined twins Flora and Fauna Amor away from him out of envy. Gomez starts to suspect that \\"Fester\\" is an impostor when he is unable to recall important details about their past. Gordon attempts to return to the vault, but is unable to get past a booby trap.

The official position is that uniform personal appearance and grooming contribute to discipline and a sense of camaraderie. See options at the end. Can we conclude that can i have a beard in the marines? Possible answers: (A). no; (B). yes;","output":"(A). no In the United States Marine Corps, having a beard is generally not permitted due to multiple factors that influence the rules and regulations governing the personal appearance of service members. These factors include hygiene, the necessity of a proper seal when using protective masks in the case of a chemical weapon attack, and the importance of uniform personal appearance to maintain discipline and build a sense of camaraderie among Marines. First and foremost, the issue of hygiene is a critical concern in the armed forces. Beards can harbor bacteria and dirt, which can lead to skin infections and other health problems. This is especially important in combat situations where maintaining cleanliness and optimal health is essential for the effectiveness and safety of service members. In addition, facial hair can interfere with the proper fitting and sealing of a protective mask, which is crucial in protecting Marines from chemical and biological threats. Another factor contributing to the prohibition of beards in the Marine Corps is the significance of uniform personal appearance in fostering discipline and a sense of camaraderie among servicemen and women. The enforcement of grooming standards fosters an environment of professionalism, order, and unity among Marines. There are, however, some limited exemptions made on the basis of religious accommodation. In these cases, individuals can apply for a waiver to grow a beard as a reflection of their religious beliefs, provided that it does not interfere with their ability to perform their duties, including wearing a protective mask if required. It is important to note that obtaining such a waiver is not guaranteed, and the decision rests on the assessment of the relevant authorities concerning the individual's specific situation. In conclusion, barring any limited exceptions for religious accommodation, having a beard in the United States Marine Corps is generally not allowed. The strict regulations on personal appearance, including the prohibition of beards, serve to promote hygiene, ensure the proper fitting of protective gear, and uphold discipline and camaraderie among service members."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The distance between point A(-1, 4) and the center O(0, b) should be equal to the distance between point B(3, 2) and the center O(0, b) because they both lie on the circle. Thus, we have sqrt{(0 - (-1))^2 + (b - 4)^2} = sqrt{(0 - 3)^2 + (b - 2)^2}.  Squaring both sides of the equation we get 1 + (b - 4)^2 = 9 + (b - 2)^2.  Let's expand and simplify these equations: 1 + b^2 - 8b + 16 = 9 + b^2 - 4b + 4.  Simplifying further, -8b + 17 = -4b + 13.  Bringing like terms to one side gives us -8b + 4b = 13 - 17 implies -4b = -4.  So, b = 1. Therefore, the center of the circle is at the point O(0, 1). The radius of the circle, r, is equal to the distance from O to either point A or B. Using point A, we get r = sqrt{(0 - (-1))^2 + (1 - 4)^2} = sqrt{1 + 9} = sqrt{10}.  Hence, the equation of the circle, with the center at (0, 1) and radius sqrt{10}, is given by x^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 10.

Since G is a cycle with an odd number of vertices, it has a chromatic number of 3, meaning it requires 3 colors to be properly colored.     - These graphs can be arbitrarily large by choosing sufficiently large k, ensuring they meet size constraints for any given positive integer N. 2. **Extending to Larger Chromatic Numbers:**    - If the chromatic number n > 3, we need to construct a more complicated graph.     - Let H be a complete graph (also called a clique) with n-3 vertices. In a complete graph of size n-3, each vertex is connected to every other vertex, and thus, it requires n-3 distinct colors for a proper coloring.    - Construct a new graph J by connecting every vertex in G to every vertex in H. This graph J includes all vertices and edges of G and H, and additional edges joining each vertex in G to each vertex in H. 3. **Chromatic Number of J:**    - In J, the (n-3) vertices in the complete graph H require n-3 colors.    - Since G is an odd cycle, it requires 3 colors.     - Thus, the entire graph J needs n colors because n-3 colors are used in H, and the remaining 3 colors are required for G. 4. **Effect of Removing a Vertex from J:**    - We now consider the effect of removing any vertex from J. There are two cases:      1. **Removing a Vertex from G:**         - After removing a vertex from the cycle G, G is no longer a cycle but becomes a path.         - A path of vertices, regardless of being even or odd, can be colored with 2 colors.         - The complete graph H still requires n-3 colors.         - Therefore, only (n-3) + 2 = n-1 colors are needed to properly color the graph after removal of a vertex from G.      2. **Removing a Vertex from H:**         - Removing a vertex from H reduces the number of vertices in H to n-4. The chromatic number of this reduced complete graph becomes n-4 because a complete graph with n-4 vertices requires n-4 colors.         - The cycle G still needs 3 colors.         - Therefore, the total number of colors needed is (n-4) + 3 = n-1 colors for properly coloring the graph after one vertex is removed from H. 5. **Conclusion:**    - In both cases, removing any vertex results in the chromatic number of J decreasing from n to n-1.    - Therefore, we have constructed graphs for any chromatic number n > 2 and any positive integer N such that removing any vertex decreases the chromatic number. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Let ( Z ) be the integers.

It is known that a circumscribed circle can be drawn around any regular polygon (as proved in Kiselev's geometry textbooks for convex polygons; this remains true for star-shaped polygons as well). The vertices of the polygon divide the circle into equal arcs. 2. **Notation and Initial Setup**:    Let AB be any side of a regular polygon Phi. Consider the smaller arc subtended by chord AB, containing k vertices A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k (excluding A and B). 3. **Counting Intersections**:    Since two sides emanate from each vertex, the side AB intersects 2k other sides. Therefore, the number k must be the same for all regular polygons of the same type. 4. **Geometry of Polygons Phi_1 and Phi_2**:    Let Phi_1 and Phi_2 be regular n-gons of the same type. From the above considerations, the sides of both polygons subtend the same arc in the corresponding circumscribed circles. Consequently, transforming circle C_1 to circle C_2 leads to Phi_1 transforming into a polygon equal to Phi_2. Hence, regular polygons of the same type are similar. 5. **Considering Polyhedra T_1 and T_2**:    Let T_1 and T_2 be two regular polyhedra of the same combinatorial type, where faces and angles are of the same kind. The faces of one polyhedron are similar to the faces of the other. Thus, linear angles in both polyhedra are equal. Denote these angles by alpha. 6. **Analyzing Polyhedral Angles**:    Consider polyhedral angles at vertices A_1 and A_2 of polyhedra T_1 and T_2, respectively. To show these angles are equal, pass planes through the centers O_1 and O_2 of the polyhedra perpendicular to O_1A_1 and O_2A_2. In the sections with the faces of the polyhedral angles, these planes give regular polygons of the same type, leading us to two regular pyramids with similar bases and equal flat angles at the vertices.    Let a_1 and a_2 be the lateral edges of the obtained pyramids, b_1 and b_2 be the sides of their bases, and r_1 and r_2 be the radii of the circumscribed circles around these bases. Given that the sides b_1 and b_2 subtend equal arcs, we have:         b_1 = 2r_1 sinleft(frac{pi}{n}(k+1)right)         Similarly,         b_2 = 2r_2 sinleft(frac{pi}{n}(k+1)right)     Thus, the ratios of the radii to the lateral edges are the same:         frac{r_1}{a_1} = frac{r_2}{a_2}  7. **Equating Angles**:    If gamma_1 and gamma_2 are the angles formed by the lateral edges of the pyramids with the base plane:         cos(gamma_1) = frac{r_1}{a_1}      cos(gamma_2) = frac{r_2}{a_2}         Therefore,         gamma_1 = gamma_2  8. **Conclusion**:    By aligning the bases of the pyramids through a similarity transformation, their lateral edges also coincide, and the polyhedral angles A_1 and A_2 coincide. Hence, polyhedra T_1 and T_2 have equal polyhedral angles. Consequently, the similarity of the faces ensures the similarity of the polyhedra T_1 and T_2.    blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The monotonic increasing interval of the function y=log_{frac{1}{2}}(x^2+x+6) is (　　).

The inequality can be rearranged to highlight the relationship between a and x:    [    ae^{ax+1} < ln x - 1.    ]    This step involves recognizing that the function g(t) = t + e^t is monotonically increasing, which allows us to compare the terms involving a and x directly. 4.

So, when Rowan rows downstream, the time ( t_d ) is given by: [ t_d = frac{d}{v + c} ] We know that ( t_d = 2 ) hours, so: [ 2 = frac{d}{9.75 + c} ] When Rowan rows upstream, the time ( t_u ) is given by: [ t_u = frac{d}{v - c} ] We know that ( t_u = 4 ) hours, so: [ 4 = frac{d}{9.75 - c} ] Now we have two equations: 1. ( 2(9.75 + c) = d ) 2. ( 4(9.75 - c) = d ) Since both expressions equal ( d ), we can set them equal to each other: [ 2(9.75 + c) = 4(9.75 - c) ] Expanding both sides: [ 19.5 + 2c = 39 - 4c ] Adding ( 4c ) to both sides and subtracting ( 19.5 ) from both sides: [ 6c = 19.5 ] Dividing both sides by 6: [ c = frac{19.5}{6} ] [ c = 3.25 ] Now that we have the speed of the current, we can find the distance ( d ) using the downstream time equation: [ 2 = frac{d}{9.75 + 3.25} ] [ 2 = frac{d}{13} ] Multiplying both sides by 13: [ d = 2 times 13 ] [ d = 26 ] So, Rowan can row boxed{26}  kilometers downstream."},{"instruction":"This word sounds the same as a festive dance event.

We will use a specific sequence and analyze the possible moves and the ultimate outcome. Consider the sequence ( 0, 1, ldots, 2014 ). We aim to show how to convert this sequence into a constant sequence where every term equals 1007. Here is how we achieve it step-by-step: 1. **Identify the Opposites and Their Meaning**:    For our sequence, any two numbers whose arithmetic mean is 1007 are called opposites. Also, 1007 is considered its own opposite. 2. **Case 1: First Move Does Not Involve 1007**:    - Suppose the initial move involves changing two numbers, (a) and (b), to their arithmetic mean (c = frac{a + b}{2}) for both.    - **If ( a ) and ( b ) are Opposites**:      - Their average is 1007 by definition.      - Subsequent steps involve operating on other pairs of opposites until only the constant sequence remains.    - **If ( a ) and ( b ) are not Opposites**:      - Let ( a' ) and ( b' ) be the opposites of ( a ) and ( b ), respectively. Thus, (a', b') are distinct and not equal to (1007).      - First, transform (a) and (b) to (c), then operate on (a') and (b') to get (c' = 2014 - c). 3. **Detailed Steps for Non-Opposite Case**:    - **Initial Setup**:      [      begin{array}{cccc}      c & c & a' & b'       end{array}      ]      - Compute the new pairs:      [      a' = 2014 - a, quad b' = 2014 - b       ]      - Average the opposites:      [      a' + b' = 4034 - (a + b) implies c' = frac{4034 - (a + b)}{2}      ]    - **Sequence Transformation**:      [      begin{array}{cccc}      c & c & c' & c'       1007 & c & 1007 & c'       1007 & 1007 & 1007 & 1007       end{array}      ] 4. **Complete the Remaining 1005 Operations**:    - Each pair of remaining numbers can now be operated on to form 1007. Since every transformed number is operated with its opposite until reaching the constant sequence of 1007. 5. **Case 2: First Move Involves 1007 and Some (a)**:    - Suppose (a) and (1007) are selected. Let (a') be the opposite of (a). 6. **Detailed Operations**:    - **Initial Setup**:      [      begin{array}{ccccc}      frac{a + 1007}{2} & frac{a + 1007}{2} & a' & k & k'       end{array}      ]    - Following the next transformations:      [      begin{array}{ccccc}      frac{a + 1007}{2} & frac{a + 1007}{2} & frac{a' + 1007}{2} & frac{a' + 1007}{2} & 1007       1007 & frac{a + 1007}{2} & 1007 & frac{a' + 1007}{2} & 1007       end{array}      ]      Continue until all values turn to 1007. # Conclusion: For the sequence (0, 1, ldots, 2014), we have shown that it is possible, through a sequence of carefully chosen operations, to transform the entire sequence into a constant sequence with all values equal to 1007.

Here, each letter appears exactly three times, and the condition is satisfied.    - For any letter (i), the sequence (i ldots i ldots i) does not enclose another pair of identical letters. 4. **Maximal Length Calculation**:    - Since each of the (n) letters appears exactly three times, the maximal length of the sequence is (3n). Thus, the maximal possible length of a *word* is (3n). # Part (b) 1. **Counting the Number of Words**:    - We need to count the number of distinct sequences of maximal length (3n) that satisfy the given condition. 2. **Permutations of Letters**:    - We can permute the (n) letters in any order. There are (n!) ways to permute (n) letters. 3. **Structure of the Sequence**:    - Given a specific permutation of the letters, we need to determine the number of valid sequences.    - For a fixed permutation, consider the sequence starting with (111). The next letter must be (22) to avoid enclosing another pair of identical letters. This pattern continues. 4. **Inductive Hypothesis**:    - Let (f(n)) be the number of valid sequences for (n) letters.    - We calculate (f(1) = 1), (f(2) = 2), and (f(3) = 4) by hand.    - We conjecture that (f(n) = 2^{n-1}). 5. **Inductive Proof**:    - Assume (f(n-1) = 2^{n-2}).    - For (n) letters, remove the three (1)'s. The remaining sequence is a valid sequence of length (3(n-1)), which must start with (22).    - The original sequence can start with (11122) or (112122), ensuring the condition is met.    - Thus, the number of valid sequences for (n) letters is (2 times f(n-1) = 2 times 2^{n-2} = 2^{n-1}). 6. **Total Number of Words**:    - Considering all permutations of the (n) letters, the total number of words is (n! times 2^{n-1}).

Notice that ( m ) is a product of six factors. For ( m ) to be positive, the number of negative factors must be even. 1. **Determine the conditions for ( m ) to be positive**:    - If ( n ) is greater than 3003, all six factors will be positive, hence ( m ) will be positive.    - If ( n ) is less than 1001, all six factors will be negative, and since the product of six negative numbers is positive, ( m ) will again be positive. 2. **Analyze the case when ( n < 1001 )**:    - In this scenario, each term ( n - 1001 ), ( n - 2001 ), etc., has an absolute value of at least 1000.

Part (a): Flux through the lateral surface of the cylinder The cylinder is defined by x^2 + y^2 leq R^2, |z| leq H. We use the divergence theorem (Gauss-Ostrogradsky theorem), which states: iint_{S} vec{r} cdot vec{n} , dS = iiint_{V} operatorname{div} vec{r} , dV, where operatorname{div} vec{r} = nabla cdot vec{r}. First, we calculate the divergence of vec{r}: operatorname{div} vec{r} = frac{partial x}{partial x} + frac{partial y}{partial y} + frac{partial z}{partial z} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.  Now, let V be the volume of the cylinder. We perform the volume integral: iiint_{V} operatorname{div} vec{r} , dV = iiint_{V} 3 , dV = 3 iiint_{x^2 + y^2 leq R^2, |z| leq H} dx , dy , dz.

By the divergence theorem, the flux through the entire surface of the cylinder is equal to 6 pi R^2 H. To find the flux through the lateral surface only, notice that the flux through the top and bottom circular bases cancel each other because the vectors are symmetric about z = 0. Therefore, iint_{S_{text{lateral}}} vec{r} cdot vec{n} , dS = 3 pi R^2 H.  Thus, the flux through the lateral surface of the cylinder is: boxed{6 pi R^2 H}.   Part (b): Flux through the lateral surface of the cone The cone is defined by x^2 + y^2 leq 4z^2 and z in [0,1]. The surface integral we need to calculate is: iint_{S} vec{r} cdot vec{n} , dS.  For part (b), we directly evaluate the surface integral since the divergence theorem approach might not be as straightforward due to the geometry involved.

Then for all a_1 + cdots + a_n = 0, f(a_1) + cdots + f(a_n) have the same sign.    **Proof**:    Suppose a_1 + cdots + a_n = 0 and b_1 + cdots + b_n = 0. Assume f(a_1) + cdots + f(a_n) > 0 and f(b_1) + cdots + f(b_n) < 0. Let A = f(a_1) + cdots + f(a_n) and B = -(f(b_1) + cdots + f(b_n)).

Is it possible, after a certain number of minutes, for all the birds to be gathered on the same tree?","output":"1. **Initial Setup:**    Consider the six trees positioned at the vertices of a regular hexagon. Each tree initially has one bird. 2. **Invariant Introduction:**    To determine whether all birds can eventually be grouped on a single tree, we consider an invariant. An invariant is a property that remains unchanged despite the birds' movements over time. We look for a property involving the configuration of birds that does not change no matter how the birds move. 3. **Choosing the Invariant:**    We'll focus on an equilateral triangle formed by choosing three non-adjacent vertices of the hexagon. This triangle initially contains three birds since each chosen vertex houses one bird. 4. **Analyzing Bird Movements:**    Each minute, two birds simultaneously move to one of their neighboring trees (vertices). We analyze how this movement affects the number of birds within the chosen equilateral triangle:    - **Case 1:** Both birds start within the triangle. Since they are moving to their neighboring trees, they must leave the triangle, reducing the count of birds in the triangle by 2.    - **Case 2:** Neither bird starts within the triangle. Both birds move from trees outside the triangle, thus the number of birds within the triangle increases by 2.    - **Case 3:** One bird starts within the triangle, and the other starts outside. They exchange positions, so the total number of birds within the triangle remains unchanged. 5. **Invariant Property:**    We observe that the number of birds on the equilateral triangle can increase by 2, decrease by 2, or remain unchanged in any given move. Thus, the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of birds inside the triangle does not change over time. 6. **Initial Parity Check:**    Initially, the number of birds on the triangle is 3, which is odd. 7. **Conclusion on Parity:**    Since the number of birds within the triangle was initially odd and the parity remains invariant through any number of moves, the number of birds within this triangle can never be an even number like 0 or 6. 8. **Final Conclusion:**    For all birds to be grouped on a single tree, the number of birds in any such triangle would have to be 0 (empty) or 6, contradicting the invariant that maintains the odd parity count.

The formula for combinations is {C}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. Applying this formula, we get the total number of ways to select 3 students from 5 as {C}_{5}^{3} = frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = frac{5 times 4}{2} = 10. 2. **Determine the number of ways A and B can both be selected along with one other student**: Since A and B must both be selected, we only need to choose 1 more student from the remaining 3 students. Again, using the combination formula, we find the number of ways to choose 1 student from 3 as {C}_{3}^{1} = frac{3!}{1!(3-1)!} = 3. 3. **Calculate the probability that both A and B are selected**: The probability is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. The favorable outcomes are the scenarios where both A and B are selected, and the total outcomes are all the possible ways to select 3 students from 5.

Combining or reversing friends and non-friends scenarios gives symmetric results. 3. **Calculating Structural Variants**:    - **For 1 friend each**: Configurations are identical to forming disjoint couple pairs. As there are an odd number of friends, one person remains friendless which isn't allowed.    - **For 2 friends each**: Three disjoint groups, each forming a triangle possible.

This transformation bounds t within the interval [-frac{1}{2},1] because the cosine function achieves its maximum value of 1 and minimum value of -frac{1}{2} within the given domain for x. 2. **Expression Simplification**: The function in terms of t becomes f(t)={(1+t)}^{2023}+{(1-t)}^{2023}. By applying the binomial theorem, this simplifies to 2+2{C}_{2023}^{2}{t}^{2}+2{C}_{2023}^{4}{t}^{4}+cdots+2{C}_{2023}^{2022}{t}^{2022}. This simplification reveals that f(t) is an even function, which means f(t)=f(-t). 3. **Analysis of f(t)**: Since f(t) is even, we can focus on the interval tin [0,1] without loss of generality. Within this interval, f(t) is monotonically increasing because each term in the expanded form of f(t) increases as t increases from 0 to 1. 4. **Finding the Range of f(t)**:     - The minimum value of f(t) occurs at t=0, which gives f(t)_{min }=f(0)=2.    - The maximum value of f(t) occurs at t=1, which gives f(t)_{max}=f(1)={2}^{2023}. 5. **Conclusion**: The range of the function y=left(1+cos xright)^{2023}+left(1-cos xright)^{2023}, given x∈[-frac{2π}{3},frac{2π}{3}], is therefore [2,2^{2023}].

This process involves manipulating the equation to isolate a perfect square trinomial on one side.  Starting with the given equation: [y = -3x^2 - 6x] We factor out the coefficient of x^2 from the first two terms: [y = -3(x^2 + 2x)] To complete the square, we add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of x, which is (2/2)^2 = 1, inside the parenthesis. However, since we are factoring out -3, we add -3 cdot 1 inside the parenthesis and add 3 outside to keep the equation balanced: [y = -3(x^2 + 2x + 1) + 3] This simplifies to: [y = -3(x + 1)^2 + 3] Now, to find the focus of the parabola, we consider the general form of a parabola and the fact that the focus is equidistant from any point on the parabola to the directrix. For a parabola described by y = -3x^2, the focus is along the axis of symmetry, which in this case is the y-axis, so the focus has the form (0, f).  Let's consider a point (x, -3x^2) on the parabola y = -3x^2 and denote the focus by (0, f) and the directrix by y = d. The distance squared from a point (x, -3x^2) on the parabola to the focus (0, f) is given by: [PF^2 = x^2 + (-3x^2 - f)^2] Similarly, the distance squared from the point to the directrix y = d is: [PQ^2 = (-3x^2 - d)^2] Since the point is equidistant from the focus and the directrix, we have: [x^2 + (-3x^2 - f)^2 = (-3x^2 - d)^2] Expanding and simplifying both sides, we obtain: [x^2 + 9x^4 + 6fx^2 + f^2 = 9x^4 + 6dx^2 + d^2] Matching coefficients, we find that: begin{align*} 1 + 6f &= 6d,  f^2 &= d^2. end{align*} From the first equation, we can solve for d - f = frac{1}{6}. Given that f^2 = d^2, it implies f = d or f = -d. Since f cannot equal d (as they are on opposite sides of the parabola), we conclude f = -d. Substituting this into -2f = frac{1}{6}, we solve for f to get f = -frac{1}{12}. Therefore, the focus of the parabola y = -3x^2 is at (0, -frac{1}{12}). To adjust for the shifts applied to the original parabola y = -3x^2 - 6x, we shift the focus left by 1 unit and up by 3 units, resulting in the focus of the given parabola being at boxed{left( -1, frac{35}{12} right)}."},{"instruction":"Let  h ge 3  be an integer and  X  the set of all positive integers that are greater than or equal to  2h .

A can complete the work in 45 days, so A's work rate is W/45 work per day. B can complete the work in 40 days, so B's work rate is W/40 work per day. When A and B work together, their combined work rate is (W/45 + W/40) work per day. Let's denote the number of days A worked together with B by x.

Show that it is possible to draw ( n ) nonintersecting line segments, each connecting a blue point to a red point, in such a way that each point is used exactly once.","output":"1. **Initial Step and Base Case:**     We begin by reasoning through strong induction on ( n ).     - **Base Case ( n = 1 ):**              For ( n = 1 ), the problem states that we have 2 points, one blue and one red. Connecting these two points with a single segment trivially satisfies the conditions of the problem. Thus, the statement holds for ( n = 1 ). 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**         Suppose that for some ( n geq 1 ), the statement is true for all values ( k ) where ( 1 le k < n ). This means that if we have ( k ) blue points and ( k ) red points with ( 1 le k < n ), it is possible to draw ( k ) non-intersecting segments each connecting a blue point to a red point. 3. **Inductive Step:**         We need to prove that the statement holds for ( n ).     - Consider ( n ) blue points and ( n ) red points in the plane, ensuring no three points are collinear. 4. **Convex Hull Argument:**         - Take the convex hull of the ( 2n ) points. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that contains all ( 2n ) points.          - **Case 1: Convex Hull Contains Two Points of Different Colors:**                  If there are two consecutive points ( B ) and ( R ) on the convex hull's boundary that are of different colors (say ( B ) is blue and ( R ) is red), we can connect them with a segment ( overline{BR} ). This segment will be part of the convex hull and thus will not intersect any other segment inside the convex hull. This effectively reduces the problem to ( n - 1 ), to which the inductive hypothesis can be applied.     - **Case 2: All Points on the Convex Hull are the Same Color:**                  Suppose all points on the convex hull are blue. Let's arrange the points such that any straight horizontal line passing through these points will cross exactly one point at each level (no two points share the same y-coordinate).                  - As we draw a horizontal line from top to bottom, eventually, the highest point ( A_{1} ) (which is blue) and the lowest point ( A_{2n} ) (which is also blue) will be crossed.                  - Once the line passes just below ( A_{1} ), there will be one extra blue point in the upper half above the line.                  - Conversely, right before the line reaches ( A_{2n} ), an extra red point must have appeared in the lower half below the line.         During this process, there must be a position where the number of blue points equals the number of red points on either side of the horizontal line.          We can now split the set of ( 2n ) points into two subsets each containing equal numbers of blue and red points by this line, ensuring that no two points of the same subset lie on opposite sides of the line. 5. **Application of the Inductive Hypothesis:**     - Now, each subset of ( n ) points on either side fulfills the condition of having equal numbers of blue and red points. By the inductive hypothesis, we can apply the result recursively to each subset.     - This will give us ( n ) non-crossing segments within each subset that satisfy the problem conditions. **Conclusion:** By induction, we have shown that the statement holds for any ( n geq 1 ). Thus, it is always possible to draw ( n ) non-intersecting segments each connecting a blue point to a red point, using each point exactly once.

Now, we know that the expansion will have n + 1 = 9 terms, and by using the symmetric property of binomial coefficients, the middle term when n is an even number will have the greatest binomial coefficient. Therefore, the 5th term will have the maximum binomial coefficient since the terms are symmetric about the middle. The 5th term, T_5, is given by: T_5 = binom{8}{4}(3x)^{8-4} left(-frac{1}{3x}right)^4 = binom{8}{4} cdot 3^4 cdot x^4 cdot left(-frac{1}{3}right)^4 cdot x^{-4}.

The term with the maximum binomial coefficient (not accounting for the sign) is: T_5 = 70 x^4 cdot x^{-4} = boxed{70}.  (2) To find the constant term, we examine the general term, T_{r+1}, of the binomial expansion: T_{r+1} = binom{8}{r} (3x)^{8-r} left(-frac{1}{3x}right)^{r} = binom{8}{r} cdot 3^{8-r} cdot (-1)^{r} cdot x^{8-r} cdot 3^{-r} cdot x^{-r}. Simplifying, we get: T_{r+1} = binom{8}{r} cdot 3^{8-r} cdot (-1)^{r} cdot 3^{-r} cdot x^{8-2r}. For T_{r+1} to be a constant term, the power of x must be zero: 8 - 2r = 0, Solving for r yields: r = 4. Now, we can determine the constant term, which is T_{4+1} = T_5: T_5 = binom{8}{4} cdot 3^{8-4} cdot (-1)^4 cdot 3^{-4} = binom{8}{4} cdot 3^{4} cdot 3^{-4}, which simplifies to: T_5 = binom{8}{4} cdot 1 = 70.

The teachers distinguish the children but do not distinguish the trees: two configurations are considered identical if one can be converted into the other by swapping the trees (along with the corresponding groups) or by rotating each group around its tree. In how many ways can the children be divided into groups?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We have 5 children and 2 identical trees (with corresponding identical circles around them). We need to partition the children into two groups where each group has at least one child, and the circles around the trees can be rearranged with respect to each other. 2. **Number of Ways to Partition the Children into Two Non-Empty Groups:**    We need to count the ways to partition the 5 children into two non-empty groups. We use the binomial coefficient and sum the relevant terms:    [    text{Total ways} = binom{5}{1} + binom{5}{2} + binom{5}{3} + binom{5}{4}    ]    Calculating each term:    [    binom{5}{1} = 5    ]    [    binom{5}{2} = 10    ]    [    binom{5}{3} = 10    ]    [    binom{5}{4} = 5    ]    So, the total number of ways to partition is:    [    5 + 10 + 10 + 5 = 30    ] 3. **Correcting for Identical Trees:**    Each partition of children can be divided between two circles in two equivalent ways since the circles are identical. Thus, we have counted each arrangement twice. Therefore, we divide by 2:    [    frac{30}{2} = 15    ] 4. **Arranging the Children around the Trees in a Circle:**    Each group of children around a tree can form a circle. For a group of size ( k ), the number of unique circular arrangements is ((k-1)!). Considering all possible group sizes again:    - For a group of size ( k ), the other group has ( 5-k ). The product of arrangements around both trees must be considered as:      [      (k-1)! times (5-k-1)!      ]    Now we sum the arrangements for each partition:    - For partition (1, 4):      [      0! times 3! = 1 times 6 = 6      ]    - For partition (2, 3):      [      1! times 2! = 1 times 2 = 2      ]    - For partition (3, 2):      [      2! times 1! = 2 times 1 = 2      ]    - For partition (4, 1):      [      3! times 0! = 6 times 1 = 6      ]        This summing:    [    6 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 16    ] 5. **Multiplying by Number of Partitions:**    Each of the 15 partitions can be arranged in those 16 different ways:    [    15 times 16 = 240    ]    However, this number still requires negotiation about rotations and the fact that they can swap around:    As stated in the initial steps, the rotations are unique for each set due to the nondistinguishable trees, meaning the factor 2 should have been factored in still higher.

Consider the sums of three consecutive numbers and four consecutive numbers: - The sum of three consecutive numbers: (a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2}) - The sum of four consecutive numbers: (a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} + a_{i+3})  Step 2: Summation Conditions for Positivity and Negativity Given the conditions: - The sum of any three consecutive numbers is positive:   [   a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} > 0 quad forall , 1 leq i leq 13   ] - The sum of any four consecutive numbers is negative:   [   a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} + a_{i+3} < 0 quad forall , 1 leq i leq 12   ]  Step 3: Deriving Consequences from the Conditions Let's analyze the implications of these conditions. Firstly, consider the sums of groups of three consecutive numbers: - (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 > 0) - (a_2 + a_3 + a_4 > 0) - (a_3 + a_4 + a_5 > 0) - ... If we add up the sums of the four sets of three consecutive numbers (specifically from (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) to (a_{12} + a_{13} + a_{14})): [ (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) + (a_2 + a_3 + a_4) + cdots + (a_{12} + a_{13} + a_{14}) > 0 ] This summation includes (a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{13}) three times and each of (a_1, a_{14}, a_{15}) once: [ 3(a_2 + a_3 + cdots + a_{13}) + a_1 + a_{14} + a_{15} > 0 ]  Step 4: Contradiction with Sum of Four Consecutive Numbers Now, consider four sets of consecutive numbers: - (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 < 0) - (a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 < 0) - ... Adding these inequalities up (specifically from (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4) to (a_{9} + a_{10} + a_{11} + a_{12})): [ (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4) + (a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5) + cdots + (a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11} + a_{12}) < 0 ] This sum includes (a_2, a_3, cdots, a_{11}) three times and each of (a_1, a_{4}, a_{8}, a_{12}) twice: [ (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{12}) < 0 ]  Conclusion We have summed all numbers from both conditions, revealing an inconsistency. If the sum of any three consecutive numbers is positive and the sum of any four consecutive numbers is negative, adding all such sums shows that positive sums and negative sums overlap in a range where a solution is not possible due to their conflicting nature.

Expanding (2z+b)^2 gives us: [ (2z+b)^2 = 4z^2 + 4bz + b^2 ] Comparing this with our original quadratic expression, we see that 4bz should be equal to -20z, which implies that b = -5.

Combine the two transformed expressions:    [    3^{3n+2} + 5 cdot 2^{3n+1} = 9 cdot 27^n + 10 cdot 8^n    ] 4.

Using induction, we find that (Q_{(n+1)(i+1)} = Q_{ni}Q_{n(i+1)}) has length:      [      binom{n-1}{i-1} + binom{n-1}{i} = binom{n}{i}      ]      as needed. (blacksquare) 3. **Define Operation**:    For any finite sequence (A = (x_1, x_2, dots, x_n)) (where all the (x_i) are positive integers), define the operation:    [    hat{A} = (1, 2, dots, x_1, 1, 2, dots, x_2, dots, 1, 2, dots, x_n)    ]    Then, of course, we have (hat{A}hat{B} = hat{AB}). 4. **Claim 2**: (Q_{ni} = hat{Q_{(n-1)i}}) for (n ge 2) and (1 le i le n-1).    - **Proof**: We use induction on (n). This is trivial for (i = 1) because (Q_{n1} = Q_{(n-1)1} = (1)). This also implies the truth of the claim for (n = 2). For (n > 2), (1 < i < n), we find by the induction hypothesis:      [      Q_{ni} = Q_{(n-1)(i-1)}Q_{(n-1)i} = hat{Q_{(n-2)(i-1)}}hat{Q_{(n-2)i}} = hat{Q_{(n-1)i}}      ]      (blacksquare) 5. **Claim 3**: The (j)-th term from the left in (Q_{ni}) is a 1 if and only if the (j)-th term from the right in (Q_{n(n+1-i)}) is not a 1 ((n ge 2)).    - **Proof**: Inducting on (n), starting from the trivial (n = 2), we note that either (i = 1) or (i = n), in which case we are done based on the definition, or else we have (Q_{ni} = Q_{(n-1)(i-1)}Q_{(n-1)i}) and (Q_{n(n+1-i)} = Q_{(n-1)(n-i)}Q_{(n-1)(n+1-i)}). In the latter case, the (j)-th term from the left in (Q_{ni}) is either in the part (Q_{(n-1)(i-1)}), or it is in (Q_{(n-1)i}). Because of Claim 1, we notice that (Q_{(n-1)(n+1-i)}) is just as long as (Q_{(n-1)(i-1)}), so the (j)-th term from the left in (Q_{ni}) and the (j)-th term from the right in (Q_{n(n+1-i)}) coincide with either the (j)-th term from the left in (Q_{(n-1)(i-1)}) and from the right in (Q_{(n-1)(n+i-1)}), or the (j^*)-th term (for some (j^*)) from the left in (Q_{(n-1)i}) and from the right in (Q_{(n-1)(n-i)}). In both cases, we are done because of the induction hypothesis. (blacksquare) 6. **Claim 4**: (R_n = Q_{n1}Q_{n2}dots Q_{nn}).    - **Proof**: This is trivial for (n = 1). Proceeding by induction and using the definition of (R_n) and also Claim 2, we see that:      [      R_n = hat{R_{n-1}}Q_{nn} = hat{Q_{(n-1)1}}hat{Q_{(n-1)2}}dotshat{Q_{(n-1)(n-1)}}Q_{nn} = Q_{n1}Q_{n2}dots Q_{n(n-1)}Q_{nn}      ]      (blacksquare) 7. **Final Step**:    Now take the (k)-th term from the right in (R_n). Using the identity of Claim 4, we see that this is inside some sequence (Q_{ni}), at place number (j) (from the left). Because of Claim 1, this implies:    [    k = binom{n-1}{0} + binom{n-1}{1} + dots + binom{n-1}{i-2} + j = binom{n-1}{n-1} + binom{n-1}{n-2} + dots + binom{n-1}{n+1-i} + j    ]    Hence, using Claim 1 again, we find that the (k)-th term from the right in (R_n) is none other than the (j)-th term from the right in (Q_{n(n+1-i)}). By Claim 3, this implies the statement of the problem.
