When a geqslant 0, for x in (-infty, 1), we have f'(x) < 0. When x in (1, +infty), we have f'(x) > 0. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically decreasing in (-infty, 1) and monotonically increasing in (1, +infty). When a < 0, setting f'(x) = 0 yields x = 1 and x = ln (-a). (i) If a < -e, for x in (-infty, 1), we have f'(x) > 0. For x in (1, ln (-a)), we have f'(x) < 0, and for x in (ln (-a), +infty), we have f'(x) > 0. Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing in (-infty, 1) and (ln (-a), +infty), and monotonically decreasing in (1, ln (-a)).

For x in (ln (-a), 1), we have f'(x) < 0, and for x in (1, +infty), we have f'(x) > 0.

(2) Let g(x) = f(x) - kx + 2 = (x-2)e^{x} + frac{1}{2}x^2 - x -kx + 2, and consequently, we find g'(x) = (x-1)e^{x} + x - 1 - k. Define h(x) = (x-1)e^{x} + x - 1 - k, and its first derivative is h'(x) = xe^{x} + 1. For x geqslant 0, since h'(x) = xe^{x} + 1 > 0, h(x) is monotonically increasing. Therefore, h(x) geqslant h(0) = -2-k, which implies g'(x) geqslant -2 - k. (i) For k leqslant -2, it holds that g'(x) geqslant 0, and so g(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). Since g(0) = 0, the inequality f(x) geqslant kx - 2 is always satisfied. (ii) For k > -2, g'(x) = 0 has a solution at some x_0. This implies that g'(x) < 0 for x in (0, x_0), making g(x) decrease in this interval. As x enters (x_0, +infty), g'(x) > 0, making g(x) increase again. However, g(x_0) < g(0) = 0, which means, for x geqslant 0, f(x) geqslant kx - 2 does not always hold.

Therefore, the first two digits can only be 20, 21, 22, 23.    - However, the digits must be distinct and in increasing order. The combination 20 and 21 cannot be used because they would require repeating the digit 0 or 1 which is not allowed in increasing order.    - The combination 22 is also not possible as it repeats the digit 2.    - Thus, the only viable option for the first two digits is 23. 2. **Determine the possible values for the third and fourth digits:**    - Since the digits must be distinct and greater than 3 (to ensure they are in increasing order after 23), the third digit can be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.    - The fourth digit must be greater than the third digit and at most 9. 3. **Count the combinations for each choice of the third digit:**    - If the third digit is 4, the fourth digit can be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Then: 1. **New Selling Price**: The new selling price per item becomes (60 + x) yuan. 2. **Sales Volume**: The sales volume adjusts to (300 - 10x) items/week. 3. **Profit per Item**: Profit per item is now (60 + x - 40) = (x + 20) yuan. 4. **Total Profit, y_{1}**: The total profit can be calculated as:    [    y_{1} = (x + 20) times (300 - 10x) = -10x^2 + 100x + 6000    ] 5. **Range of x**: Since sales volume cannot be negative, 300 - 10x geqslant 0, leading to x leqslant 30.

When he arrives there, he will have been gone from the Park Office 32 minutes altogether. If he had walked to the Lake Park restaurant from the Park office before taking the 15minute walk to Hidden Lake, with the wind blowing in the same direction as his walk to Hidden Lake, how long is the walk from Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant?","output":"Let's denote the time it takes Dante to walk to Hidden Lake without any wind as ( T ). When the wind is in his favor, it reduces his walking time by 20%, so the time it takes him to walk to Hidden Lake with the wind in his favor is ( 0.8T ). Given that it takes him 15 minutes with the wind in his favor, we can write: [ 0.8T = 15 ] [ T = frac{15}{0.8} ] [ T = 18.75 text{ minutes} ] Now, when walking back to the Park Office with the wind against him, it increases his walking time by 25%.

Since he has been gone for 32 minutes altogether, the time he spent walking to the Lake Park restaurant must be ( 32 - 22 = 10 ) minutes. However, this 10 minutes includes the time with the wind in his favor, which is a 20% reduction of the time it would take without any wind.

Let's analyze the situation step-by-step. 1. **Understanding the probabilities when there is one advisor**:     - With one advisor, say with a probability (p) of being correct, King Arthur will follow the correct advice with probability (p). 2. **Understanding the probabilities when there are two advisors**:     - If both advisors give the same answer, they are either both correct or both incorrect.         - Both advisors are correct: This occurs with probability (p^2) because each advisor has a probability (p) of being correct.         - Both advisors are incorrect: This occurs with probability (q^2) where (q = 1 - p). 3. **Probability distribution for different outcomes**:     - Both advisors give the correct answer: The king follows their advice with certainty (p^2 times 1).     - Both advisors give the incorrect answer: The king follows their incorrect advice with certainty (q^2 times 1).     - One advisor gives a correct answer and the other gives an incorrect answer: This occurs with probability (2pq). Since King Arthur flips a coin, he follows the correct advice with probability (frac{1}{2}).

Therefore, one can be fired without affecting the decision-making accuracy of King Arthur. 8. **Considering Merlin’s strategic answer**:     - Merlin must consider the impact of his response on his job security. Persifal is honest and would say the optimal solution is to fire one of them because it doesn’t decrease the probability of making correct decisions.     - Merlin, thinking about minimizing his chance of being fired, would realize his optimal strategy aligns with being honest, as the correct answer is evident. 9. **Likelihood of being fired**:     - Since Merlin would say the same as Persifal (to fire one), the chance of Merlin being the one fired would be based on a coin flip if King Arthur decides to follow through with the dismissal.

Denote K, L, N, and S as the feet of the perpendiculars from A and D to BM and CM respectively (see figure). 2. Since angle AKM = angle ANM = 90^circ, points A, K, N, and M lie on a circle. This is because any quadrilateral where a pair of opposite angles are right angles is inscribed in a circle. 3. Similarly, since angle DLS = angle DSM = 90^circ, points D, L, S, and M lie on a circle.  4. Next, consider the equality of the inscribed angles  angle AMB and angle DMC based on the congruence of sides AB and CD. Specifically: [ angle AMB = angle DMC ] since the angles subtend the same arcs respectively on the circumcircle of the trapezoid. 5.

Steven has 55 acres in total, with 15 acres on hilly terrain. This leaves 40 acres of flat and dry farmland. At a rate of 10 acres per day, it would take him: 40 acres / 10 acres per day = 4 days to plow the flat and dry farmland. Now, let's calculate the time it takes to plow the hilly terrain. His efficiency drops by 30% on hilly terrain, so he can only plow 70% of the 10 acres he can usually plow on flat terrain. 70% of 10 acres = 0.7 * 10 = 7 acres per day. So, for the 15 acres of hilly terrain, it would take him: 15 acres / 7 acres per day = 2.14 days.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to mow the grassland. Steven can mow 12 acres per day in sunny weather. He has 30 acres of grassland to mow, with 5 days of rain during the mowing period. First, let's calculate the mowing on rainy days. On rainy days, his efficiency decreases by 40%, so he can only mow 60% of the 12 acres he can usually mow in sunny weather. 60% of 12 acres = 0.6 * 12 = 7.2 acres per day (which matches the given information). For the 5 rainy days, he can mow: 5 days * 7.2 acres per day = 36 acres. However, he only has 30 acres of grassland, so he will finish mowing before the 5 rainy days are up. Since he can mow 7.2 acres per day in the rain, it will take him: 30 acres / 7.2 acres per day = 4.17 days. Again, since he can't work a fraction of a day, we'll round up to the nearest whole day, which means it will take him 5 days to mow the grassland, with the assumption that all mowing days are rainy, which is the worst-case scenario.

Prove that [sum_{(a,b)in S}a=frac{1}{2}sum_{(a,b)in S}b.] Proposed by Uwe Leck, Germany","output":"1. **Define the problem and set up initial conditions:**    Let ( p = 2017 ) and consider the set ( S ) of all ordered pairs ((a, b)) of integers such that ( 0 < 2a < 2b < 2017 ) and ( a^2 + b^2 ) is a multiple of ( 2017 ). We need to prove that:    [    sum_{(a,b) in S} a = frac{1}{2} sum_{(a,b) in S} b.    ] 2. **Existence and uniqueness of ( b ) for a given ( a ):**    Since ( 2017 ) is a prime congruent to ( 1 mod 4 ), there exists an integer ( k ) such that ( k^2 equiv -1 pmod{2017} ). For any ( a in {1, ldots, frac{p-1}{2}} ), we can find ( b in {1, ldots, frac{p-1}{2}} ) such that ( b equiv pm ka pmod{2017} ) and ( 0 < b < frac{p-1}{2} ). This ensures ( a^2 + b^2 equiv 0 pmod{2017} ). 3. **Uniqueness of ( b ):**    Assume there are two such ( b ), say ( b_1 ) and ( b_2 ). Then:    [    b_1^2 equiv b_2^2 pmod{2017}.    ]    This implies:    [    2017 mid (b_1 - b_2)(b_1 + b_2).    ]    Since ( 0 < b_1 + b_2 < 2017 ), it must be that ( 2017 mid b_1 - b_2 ), hence ( b_1 = b_2 ). This proves the uniqueness of ( b ) for each ( a ). 4. **Define the set ( S_a ):**    Let:    [    S_a = {a mid exists b : (a, b) in S}.    ]    We will show that the map ( a rightarrow b - a ) is a bijection from ( S_a ) to itself. 5. **Bijection proof:**    Note that:    [    (b - a)^2 + (b + a)^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2) equiv 0 pmod{2017}.    ]    If ( a + b > frac{p-1}{2} ), then ( 0 < 2017 - (a + b) leq frac{p-1}{2} ). Since ( (a + b)^2 equiv (2017 - (a + b))^2 pmod{2017} ), it follows that ( b - a in S_a ). 6. **Injectivity of the map:**    Assume ( a_1, a_2 in S_a ) and ( (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2) in S ) such that ( b_1 - a_1 = b_2 - a_2 ). Then:    [    b_1^2 + a_1^2 - 2a_1b_1 = b_2^2 + a_2^2 - 2a_2b_2.    ]    This implies:    [    a_1b_1 equiv a_2b_2 pmod{2017}.    ]    Since ( b_1 equiv pm ka_1 ) and ( b_2 equiv pm ka_2 pmod{2017} ), we have:    [    ka_1^2 equiv pm ka_2^2 pmod{2017}.    ]    If ( a_1^2 equiv -a_2^2 pmod{2017} ), then ( 2017 mid a_1^2 + a_2^2 ), and by uniqueness, ( b_1 = a_2 ) and ( b_2 = a_1 ), which gives ( a_1 = a_2 ). If ( a_1^2 equiv a_2^2 pmod{2017} ), then ( 2017 mid a_1^2 - a_2^2 ), and ( a_1 = a_2 ). This proves injectivity. 7. **Conclusion:**    Since the map ( a rightarrow b - a ) is injective and maps from a finite set to itself, it is also a bijection. Therefore, the sums can be rewritten as:    [    sum_{(a,b) in S} a = sum_{(a,b) in S} (b - a).    ]    By the above, it follows that both sides equal:    [    sum_{a in S_a} a.    ]    This solves the problem.

(2) At what price per kilogram should the supermarket set the selling price so that the profit from selling the rice reaches 1800?  (3) At what price per kilogram should the selling price be set to maximize the daily profit? What is the maximum profit?","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Function Relationship Between y and x Given the linear relationship between the quantity of rice sold per day y (in kilograms) and the selling price per kilogram x (in dollars), we can express this relationship as y = kx + b. We have two conditions: 1. When x = 5, y = 950. 2. When x = 6, y = 900. Plugging these conditions into the linear equation gives us two equations: - 5k + b = 950 - 6k + b = 900 Subtracting the second equation from the first gives: - (5k + b) - (6k + b) = 950 - 900 - -k = 50 - k = -50 Substituting k = -50 into 5k + b = 950: - 5(-50) + b = 950 - -250 + b = 950 - b = 1200 Therefore, the function relationship between y and x is y = -50x + 1200 for 4 leq x leq 7.  Part 2: Selling Price for 1800 Profit Given the profit per kilogram is (x - 4) dollars and the quantity sold is y = -50x + 1200, the total profit equation is: - (x - 4)(-50x + 1200) = 1800 Expanding and solving for x: - -50x^2 + 1200x + 200x - 4800 = 1800 - -50x^2 + 1400x - 6600 = 0 - Dividing by -50: - x^2 - 28x + 132 = 0 Solving this quadratic equation, we find that x_1 = 22 (which we discard since it's outside the price range) and x_2 = 6. Therefore, the supermarket should set the selling price at boxed{6} dollars per kilogram to achieve a profit of 1800 per day.  Part 3: Maximum Daily Profit The profit W is given by: - W = (x - 4)(-50x + 1200) - Simplifying, W = -50x^2 + 1400x - 4800 - Further simplification, W = -50(x^2 - 28x + 96) - Completing the square, W = -50(x - 14)^2 + 5000 Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative (-50), the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum value at the vertex. The vertex occurs at x = 14, but since the selling price must be between 4 and 7, we consider the maximum value within this range at x = 7. Substituting x = 7 into the profit equation: - W_{text{max}} = -50(7 - 14)^2 + 5000 - W_{text{max}} = -50(-7)^2 + 5000 - W_{text{max}} = -50(49) + 5000 - W_{text{max}} = -2450 + 5000 - W_{text{max}} = 2550 Therefore, to maximize the daily profit, the selling price should be set at boxed{7} dollars per kilogram, resulting in a maximum profit of boxed{2550} dollars."},{"instruction":"A man can row a boat at 9 kmph in still water.

However, following the initial solution provided: Given B={x|x^{2}+4x-5leqslant 0}, and interpreting the solution as provided, we consider B as {x|-5leqslant xleqslant 1} for the sake of following the provided solution steps closely. Next, we consider set A: A={x|-3 lt x lt 2} To find the intersection Acap B, we look for the values that are common to both sets. Given the corrected understanding of B, and following the initial solution's steps: - The interval for A is (-3, 2). - The interval for B, as per the provided solution, is interpreted as (-5, 1]. The intersection of these two sets, Acap B, is the set of values that satisfy both conditions, which is (-3, 1].

Therefore, the student partakes in  binom{N}{3}, let's use combination where each task is uniquely solved.    - We arrive at the calculation where total problem-solvings need divided by per student contribution.    - Each student contributes to 3 tasks (on a unique base):      [      S cdot 3 geq 6000       ]      Simplifying:      [      S geq frac{6000}{3} = 2000      ] 7. **Conclusion:**    - This analysis shows that the least number of students such that no student solves all six problems, and each problem being solved at least (the targeted number comparative):      - Through confirmation of assumptions and necessary conditions specified previously, we arrive at our minimum eligible count.

Should the radius be increased or decreased to reduce the difference in the sums, while keeping the number of intersected squares constant?","output":"To solve this problem, we have been given a situation where a circle of radius ( r = 1.9 ) units is drawn in the middle of an inner square on a chessboard with unit-length sides. We need to determine whether to increase or decrease the radius to balance the length of the arcs that fall on light and dark squares, while ensuring the number of such squares intersected remains unchanged.  I. First Solution: 1. **Establish the Circle's Geometric Properties**:    Select the center O of our circle to be the center of a light square. The circle intersects 16 squares, alternating between light and dark. 2. **Consider Symmetry**:    By symmetry, any arc within one dark square can be mirrored to cover all similar such intersections, thanks to the chessboard's periodic structure. Thus, analyze one such intersection. 3. **Circle Segments and Distance Constraints**:    The circle does not intersect adjacent dark squares because their farthest vertices from O would be at ( sqrt{1.5^2 + 0.5^2} = sqrt{2.5} < 1.6 < 1.9 ).    However, the circle crosses into four nearby light squares and then into the adjacent dark squares, given the distance to the fourth vertex is ( sqrt{1.5^2 + 1.5^2} = sqrt{4.5} > 2 > 1.9 ). 4. **Angular Analysis**:    Denote the entry and exit points in a dark square as A and B, and the angles ( alpha ) and ( beta ) that lines ( OA ) and ( OB ) make with the horizontal through O. Hence, the arc in the dark square subtends an angle ( beta - alpha ).    Summing over all 8 dark arcs, their total central angle is ( 8(beta - alpha) ), implying the light arcs’ total angle is ( 360^circ - 8(beta - alpha) ). 5. **Comparing Angles**:    To check ( beta - alpha ):    [    cos beta = frac{1.5}{1.9} = 0.7895 quad text{(approximated)},    ]    [    sin alpha = frac{0.5}{1.9} = 0.2632 quad text{(approximated)}.    ]    Taken frounding direction ensures smaller ( beta ) and larger ( alpha ), leading to:    [    beta > 37^circ 51' quad text{and} quad alpha < 15^circ 16'.    ]    Therefore:    [    beta - alpha > 37^circ 51' - 15^circ 16' = 22^circ 35'.    ] 6. **Implication**:    Since ( beta - alpha ) is greater than ( 22.5^circ ), the dark arcs (sums) are longer. To balance the lengths, decrease ( r ) so ( cos beta ) increases and ( beta ) decreases while ( sin alpha ) and ( alpha ) increase.  Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Decrease } r} ]  II. Second Solution: 1. **Find Critical Radius**:    Use the angle requirement ( beta - alpha = 22^circ 30' ):    [    sin (beta - alpha) = sin beta cos alpha - cos beta sin alpha = sin 22^circ 30' = sqrt{frac{1 - cos 45^circ}{2}} = sqrt{frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{4}}.    ] 2. **Reformulate in Terms of ( r )**:    Let ( sin alpha = frac{1}{2r} = z ).

Solving this inequality, we find  frac {8}{5}leqslant y_{0}leqslant 2 Rightarrow 0leqslant x_{0}leqslant frac {6}{5}. Now let's enhance the solution with a more detailed explanation: 1. Consider a point P outside the circle O, and a moving point Q on the circle. The angle ∠OPQ reaches its maximum value when PQ is tangent to the circle. 2. If OP becomes longer, the maximum value that ∠OPQ can achieve becomes smaller. This is because sin ∠OPQ= frac {Q0}{PO}, and QO is a constant (the radius of the circle). As PO increases, sin ∠OPQ decreases, and consequently, ∠OPQ also decreases since ∠OPQ∈(0, frac {π}{2}). 3. When ∠OPQ=60^{circ} and PQ is tangent to the circle, we know that PO=2. Conversely, when PO > 2, no matter where Q moves on the circle, ∠OPQ < 60^{circ} always holds true. 4. Therefore, the range of P is POleqslant 2, meaning that as long as POleqslant 2, there will always exist a point Q such that ∠OPQ=60^{circ}. Otherwise, such a point Q would not exist. 5.

The pedal triangle of a point (P) with respect to a given triangle (ABC) is the triangle formed by the perpendiculars from (P) to the sides of (ABC). 3. **Circumcircle and Intersection**:    Consider the circumcircles of the triangles (AB'C'), (BC'A'), and (CA'B'). For any arbitrary triangle (A'B'C'), these circumcircles intersect at a point (P). 4. **Projections and Pedal Triangle**:    Let (A''), (B''), and (C'') be the projections of (P) on (BC), (CA), and (AB) respectively. Angles are crucial:    [    angle A'PB' = angle A''PB'' = 180^circ - angle C    ]    This helps us establish that:    [    angle A''PA' = angle B''PB' = angle C''PC'    ]    Thus, the triangle (A''B''C'') is obtained from (A'B'C') by a homothety (similarity transformation) with a coefficient less than 1, indicating (A''B''C'') is smaller. 5. **Optimal Point (T)**:    Consider a point (T) for which the pedal triangle is equilateral and prove that for any other point (P) the pedal triangle's sides are longer.

Count of odd integers greater than 1 and less than 200:    Total integers between 1 and 199 = 199. Odd integers are half of these plus one, so there are frac{199+1}{2} = 100 odd integers greater than 1 and less than 200. 2. Finding multiples of each odd square:    - Multiples of 9 that are odd between 1 and 199: lfloor frac{199}{9} rfloor = 22 total, so 11 odd multiples (every other multiple).    - Multiples of 25: lfloor frac{199}{25} rfloor = 7 total, so 4 odd multiples.    - Multiples of 49: lfloor frac{199}{49} rfloor = 4 total, so 2 odd multiples.    - Multiples of 81: lfloor frac{199}{81} rfloor = 2 total, so 1 odd multiple.    - Multiples of 121 and multiples of 169: lfloor frac{199}{121} rfloor = 1 and lfloor frac{199}{169} rfloor = 1, respectively, and since both 121 and 169 are odd, each have 1 odd multiple.

Additionally, prove that in an arbitrary tetrahedron, the segments connecting the midpoints of the opposite edges have a common point and are bisected by this point.","output":"To solve the problem of showing that the four segments connecting each vertex of a tetrahedron to the centroid of the opposite face intersect at a single point and each segment is divided by this point in the ratio 3:1, we will use the concept of centroids and barycenters in mechanics. 1. **Assign Unit Masses to the Vertices:**    Place unit masses at each of the vertices of the tetrahedron. Let's denote the vertices of a tetrahedron by ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ). 2. **Barycenter of the System:**    Let ( O ) be the center of mass (centroid) of the entire tetrahedron. The centroid ( O ) of a system of masses positioned at the vertices ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) is given by the average of their coordinates if we assume coordinates. 3. **Centroid of Faces:**    Let ( A_1 ) be the centroid of the face opposite vertex ( A ), which is the face formed by vertices ( B, C, ) and ( D ). Similarly, let ( B_1, C_1, ) and ( D_1 ) be the centroids of the faces opposite vertices ( B, C, ) and ( D ) respectively.  4. **Combined Masses Approach:**    Consider the face opposite ( A ). The masses at vertices ( B, C, ) and ( D ) can be thought of as combined at their centroid ( A_1 ). 5. **Finding the Overall Centroid:**    Since the centroid ( A_1 ) is the average position of the unit masses at ( B, C, ) and ( D ), the tetrahedron's overall centroid ( O ) can be located by considering the weighted average of mass placed at ( A ) and the combined mass at ( A_1 ). This is done according to the principle of the lever (or weighted averages). 6. **Lever Rule Application:**    Using the lever rule, we determine that centroid ( O ) lies on the segment ( AA_1 ) such that the ratio of ( AO ) to ( OA_1 ) is 3:1. Mathematically:    [    AO = 3 times OA_1.    ] 7. **Intersection of All Segments at O:**    By symmetry and the definition of the centroid, repeating similar steps for the vertices ( B, C, ) and ( D ) implies that all four segments ( AA_1, BB_1, CC_1, ) and ( DD_1 ) intersect at the same point ( O ). 8. **Conclusion of Proof:**    Therefore, the center of mass of the tetrahedron ( O ) lies on each of the segments connecting each vertex to the centroid of the opposite face. Additionally, each segment is divided by ( O ) in the ratio ( 3:1 ), counting from the respective vertex.

Start with the general equation for a circle or line in Cartesian coordinates:    [    A(x^2 + y^2) + Bx + Cy + D = 0    ]    where A, B, C, and D are real numbers. 2.

Hence, (|S| = 1616). 2. **Smallest Group Division**:    To ensure that the differences between any two numbers in a group are always prime, we examine compositions of different group sizes.

We are to prove that there are infinitely many perfect squares among the terms of this sequence. 2. Notice that if (a_{n} = m^2 + k) where (1 leq k leq m), then:    [    a_{n+1} = m^2 + k + leftlfloor sqrt{m^2 + k} rightrfloor = m^2 + k + m.    ]    This is because (leftlfloor sqrt{m^2 + k} rightrfloor = m) when (1 leq k leq m). 3. In the next term of the sequence:    [    a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + leftlfloor sqrt{a_{n+1}} rightrfloor = (m^2 + k + m) + m = m^2 + 2m + k.    ] 4. Observe that:    [    m^2 + 2m + k = (m + 1)^2 + k - 1.    ]    Hence, the amount ((k - 1)) above the perfect square ((m+1)^2) has decreased by 1. 5.

Eventually, the value (k - 1) will decrease to 0. When (k - 1 = 0), a perfect square is hit again. Thus (a_s = m^2), and we repeat the process from (a_{s+1} = m^2 + m). 7. Therefore, we specifically identify that if (a_s = m^2), then:    [    a_{s+1} = m^2 + m, quad a_{s + 2m + 1} = (2m)^2 = 4m^2.    ] 8.

The smallest square that can be made with these dimensions would have a side length that is the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 cm and 15 cm.  The LCM of 12 and 15 is 60 cm (since 12 = 2^2 * 3, and 15 = 3 * 5, the LCM is 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 60). So, the side of the square will be 60 cm. Now, we can calculate how many photos are needed to cover this square: The area of the square is 60 cm * 60 cm = 3600 square cm. The area of one photo is 12 cm * 15 cm = 180 square cm. The number of photos needed is the area of the square divided by the area of one photo: 3600 square cm / 180 square cm/photo = 20 photos.

This is a fundamental property of polygons that does not depend on the number of sides. Therefore, the statement that the sum increases with the number of sides is incorrect. Mathematically, for any polygon, if n is the number of sides, the sum of exterior angles is: [ sum text{Exterior Angles} = 360^{circ} ] This shows that the sum is constant and does not increase with n. **Statement B:** According to the exterior angle theorem in triangles, the measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. This is a correct statement and a well-established theorem in geometry. For a triangle with interior angles A, B, and C, if D is an exterior angle adjacent to C, then: [ D = A + B ] This confirms the correctness of statement B. **Statement C:** In a right triangle, there are indeed three altitudes, but they do not all intersect at the right angle vertex. One altitude is the segment from the right angle vertex perpendicular to the hypotenuse, and the other two are the legs themselves, which are perpendicular to each other. Thus, the statement that a right triangle has only one altitude is incorrect. Each altitude corresponds to a vertex, and for a right triangle, they are: 1.

Its light reaches 21 m. What is the area of the plot that is lit by the lamp?","output":"To determine the area of the plot that is lit by the lamp, we need to consider the shape of the lit area. Since the lamp is placed at the corner of the square plot, the lit area will be a quarter-circle with a radius equal to the distance the light reaches, which is 21 m. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since we only have a quarter-circle, we need to divide the area of the full circle by 4. So, the area of the lit portion of the plot is: A_lit = (π * r^2) / 4 A_lit = (π * 21^2) / 4 A_lit = (π * 441) / 4 A_lit = (441π) / 4 Now, we can calculate the numerical value: A_lit ≈ (441 * 3.14159) / 4 A_lit ≈ 1385.44259 / 4 A_lit ≈ 346.3606475 Therefore, the area of the plot that is lit by the lamp is approximately boxed{346.36}  square meters."},{"instruction":"What is the domain of the function v(x) = frac{1}{x^2 + sqrt{x}}~?

This gives us one solution: ((x, y) = (0, 0)). 2. **Sign Considerations:**    - If (xy < 0), then (x^2 + y^2 < 0), which is a contradiction because the sum of squares of integers is always non-negative.

If a_i < 0, it means moving the two pieces at positions |a_i| and |a_i| + 1 to the closest empty squares to their left, while keeping order preserved. 2. **Base Case Verification:**    For the base case n = 3, we write:     T_3 = (1, 4, 1)     This sequence represents the required operations to achieve alternating colors with no gaps. 3. **Hypothesis for General Case ( n geq 4 ):**    We'll assume by induction that this works for a general n. We then consider the case for n + 4 by temporarily ignoring or treating the 2n pieces in a block. 4. **Verification for ( n geq 4 ):**    Consider arrangements as follows:         T_4 = (2, -5, -2, 1)     T_5 = (2, -4, 5, -2, 1)     T_6 = (2, -9, -4, 6, -2, 1)     T_7 = (2, -7, 6, -5, 5, -2, 1)        Each of these sequences conforms to the hypothesis. 5. **Induction Step:**    Assuming our hypothesis holds for n, we prove it for n + 4. For interval (T_n) and extra pieces A's and B's:    - Move the 2 times 4 pieces using the initial steps of T_4:      [      A , overrightarrow{A , A} , A(A , A , cdots , A , B , B , cdots , B) , B, B, B, B       rightarrow A , square , square , A(A , A , cdots , A , B , B , cdots , B) , overleftarrow{B , B} , B , B , A, A       rightarrow A , B , B , A(A , A , cdots , A , B , B , cdots , B) , square , square , B, B , A, A      ]    - We then perform n operations inside the interval (block):      [      A , B , B , A , square , square , (B , A , B , A cdots B , A) , B , B , A, A       rightarrow A , B(B , A cdots) rightarrow (alternating arrangement).      ] 6. **Conclusion:**    Following such structured operations, it can be concluded that the pieces are rearranged into a perfectly alternating sequence without any gaps. To conclude our proof, we rely on the prior steps ensuring that our operations efficiently realize the transition to the alternate arrangement satisfying the given condition.

A wise man can see an inspector only if the inspector is in the neighboring car or two cars away. At each station, every wise man can move via the platform no more than three cars (for example, from car 7, a wise man can run to any car from 4 to 10 and board it). What is the maximum number of wise men that can ensure they never end up in the same car as an inspector, no matter how the inspectors move? (No other information about the inspectors is available besides that stated in the problem, and the wise men agree on a strategy in advance.)","output":"1. **Initial Assumptions and Setup:**    - There are 100 wise men and a train with 12 cars.    - Two controllers board cars 1 and 2 at the first station.    - After the fourth station, one of the controllers moves to the adjacent car in a sequential manner.    - Each wise man can move to a car that is at most three cars away at each station. 2. **Determine the Maximum Number of Uncaught Wise Men:**    - Wise men can only be caught if a controller is in the same car.    - If we spread the wise men such that no more than 9 are in each car, then the total number of uncaught wise men can't be more than 9 times 11 + 8 = 107.    - Hence, there must be at least two cars with at least 9 wise men each.        Let's analyze this step by step:    [    9 , text{wise men in one car} + 9 , text{wise men in another } + (8 times 11) = 9 + 9 + 88 = 106 < 100    ]    Thus, if there are at least two cars with 9 wise men, we can deduce that  18 wise men can be caught. 3. **Optimizing Wise Men's Strategy:**    - At the initial placement, each wise man has the possibility of moving to another car up to 3 cars away.    - We consider a car \\"safe\\" if, during the first move of the controllers, there are no controllers in that or any adjacent cars.    - Wise men should aim to move to such safe cars whenever controllers move. 4. **Steps to Distribute the Wise Men:**    - Each wise man initially assesses their safety before and after controller moves.    - If they're in a non-safe car, they should move to a car that becomes safe after controllers' moves.        For a step-by-step distribution:    - If a wise man starts in car \`k neq 1\`, he checks car \`k+2\` for controllers and moves accordingly to car \`k+3\` or \`k+4\` if deemed safe.    - In car 1:      - If a controller is found in car 2, the wise man uses analogous moves as described above.      - If a controller is in car 3 or unseen cars, subsequent steps determine the next safe car movement.        For wise men in cars 3, 4, and so on:    [    k = 1 Rightarrow text{Move to } k+3 text{ if k+2 is not safe}    ] 5. **General Case During Controllers' Moves:**    - Define active and passive controllers and ensure wise men continue to observe and move strategically.    - If necessary, wise men wait for controllers to move and get to safe cars in the following turns. 6. **Conclusion:**    - Ideally, we distribute wise men into different cars, ensuring no car has more than the safe number.    - With the keen observation and appropriate moves, wise men can ensure the maximum uncaught number of them.

With these two points, calculate the midpoint, likely the center of the ellipse. This midpoint is given by the average of the x and y-coordinates: [ left(frac{-1 + 7}{2}, frac{5+5}{2}right) = left(frac{6}{2}, frac{10}{2}right) = (3, 5). ] Next, define the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes. The distance between (-1, 5) and (7, 5): [ sqrt{(7 - (-1))^2 + (5 - 5)^2} = sqrt{8^2 + 0^2} = 8, ] which must be divided by 2 for the length of the semi-major axis: 8/2 = 4. Now, calculate the distance of the third point (2, -4) to the center (3, 5). This measurement gives us the semi-minor axis: [ sqrt{(3 - 2)^2 + (5 - (-4))^2} = sqrt{1^2 + 9^2} = sqrt{82}. ] Thus, the length of the semi-minor axis is sqrt{82}, a more complex evaluation than typical ellipses due to the altered orientation. Using the ellipse property for the distance between the foci, known as 2c where c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2}: [ c = sqrt{4^2 - sqrt{82}} = sqrt{16 - sqrt{82}}, ] and [ 2c = 2sqrt{16 - sqrt{82}}. ] Conclusion: The distance between the foci of the ellipse is boxed{2sqrt{16 - sqrt{82}}}."},{"instruction":"Lenny bought 20 boxes of pens.

Given ( a < 0 ), the polynomial remains negative for all ( x ). 3. **Ensuring ( c < 0 )**:    - Because the quadratic polynomial is negative for all values of ( x ), even at ( x = 0 ), ( c ) must be negative (since ( c ) is the value of the polynomial at ( x = 0 )). 4. **If ( b > 0 )**:    - If ( b > 0 ), then (frac{b}{a}) must be negative because ( a < 0 ).    - Additionally, since ( c < 0 ), (frac{c}{a}) will be positive.    - Therefore, (frac{b}{a}) being negative and (frac{c}{a} + 1) positive (because (frac{c}{a}) overcomes ( -1)), it is immediately clear that the inequality (frac{b}{a} < frac{c}{a} + 1) holds. 5. **If ( b leq 0 )**:    - We explore the situation where ( b leq 0 ).    - We aim to show that ( b leq c + a ).

The sum of its digits is ( 1 + 8 = 9 ), and ( 18 div 9 = 2 ), so ( 18 ) is divisible by its sum of digits.    - For ( n = 3 ), consider the number ( 189 ). The sum of its digits is ( 1 + 8 + 9 = 18 ), and ( 189 div 18 = 10.5 ), so we need a different example. Instead, consider ( 198 ). The sum of its digits is ( 1 + 9 + 8 = 18 ), and ( 198 div 18 = 11 ), so ( 198 ) is divisible by its sum of digits. 2. **General Case for Larger ( n ):**    - For ( n leq 17 ), we can construct numbers where the sum of digits is a multiple of 9. For example, the number ( 111...111 ) (with ( n ) ones) has a sum of digits equal to ( n ). If ( n ) is a multiple of 9, then ( 111...111 ) is divisible by ( n ). If ( n ) is not a multiple of 9, we can adjust the digits slightly to make the sum a multiple of 9.    - For ( n > 17 ), we can use the hint provided. For example, for ( n = 20 ), consider the number ( 33333444444444133312 ). The sum of its digits is ( 3 cdot 5 + 4 cdot 8 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 15 + 32 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 57 ). We need to ensure that the sum of digits is a divisor of the number. We can construct such numbers by ensuring the sum of digits is a power of 2 or 3 or a combination of these. 3. **Constructing the Number:**    - For any ( n ), we can construct a number ( z ) such that its sum of digits is a divisor of ( z ). For example, for ( n = 20 ), the number ( 33333444444444133312 ) has a sum of digits ( 64 ), and ( 33333444444444133312 ) is divisible by ( 64 ). 4. **General Construction:**    - For any ( n ), we can construct a number ( z ) by ensuring the sum of its digits is a divisor of ( z ). This can be done by choosing digits such that their sum is a power of 2 or 3 or a combination of these, ensuring divisibility. Therefore, for every positive integer ( n ), there exists an ( n )-digit number ( z ) with none of its digits being ( 0 ) and such that ( z ) is divisible by its sum of digits.

First, let's find out the net increase per second. There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in one day is: 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 86,400 seconds/day Given that the net increase in population per day is 259,200 people, we can find the net increase per second by dividing the daily net increase by the number of seconds in a day: 259,200 people/day / 86,400 seconds/day = 3 people/second This means that the population increases by 3 people every second, on average. Now, we know that the birth rate is 7 people every two seconds. To find the death rate, we need to calculate the number of people who die every two seconds to result in a net increase of 3 people per second. Since there are 7 births every two seconds, and we want a net increase of 3 people per second, we can set up the following equation: Births every two seconds - Deaths every two seconds = Net increase every two seconds 7 people/2 seconds - Deaths every two seconds = 3 people/second * 2 seconds 7 - Deaths every two seconds = 6 Deaths every two seconds = 7 - 6 Deaths every two seconds = 1 Therefore, boxed{1}  person dies every two seconds in the city."},{"instruction":"A pentagon is created by placing an isosceles right triangle on top of a rectangle.

Recall that inversion with respect to a circle with center ( O ) and radius ( R ) maps a point ( A ) to a point ( A' ) such that ( OA cdot OA' = R^2 ). 3. **Analyze the result of the inversion**:    - The circles that touch at point ( P ) are tangent to the inversion circle, which means they will map to each other under the inversion.    - The original given circle will map to itself because it is orthogonal to the inversion circle at their points of tangency. Orthogonality in the context of circles under inversion preserves the circles' structure. 4. **Implications of the inversion**:    - Since the original circle remains invariant and maps to itself, all the tangents from ( X ) to the original circle have the same length.     - Hence, the distance ( XP ) equals the radius of the inversion circle and also equals the tangent segment from ( X ) to the given circle. 5. **Determine the locus of ( X )**:    - Because ( X ) is a point from which equal-length tangents are drawn to the given circle, ( X ) must lie on the radical axis of point ( P ) and the given circle. The radical axis is the locus of points that have equal power with respect to the two circles defined by their radii and center distances. 6. **Conclusion**:    Any point ( X ) satisfying the above properties must lie on the line known as the radical axis of the given circle and point ( P ). This is because this line represents points that have equal tangents' lengths to both the original circle and the inversion circle.

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hour * (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 54 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 54 * 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 54000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 15 m/s Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the total distance covered by the train while passing the bridge using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The time taken to pass the bridge is given as 33.333333333333336 seconds.

This results in two equations from the coefficients of x and the constant terms: 1. 1 - A = -A - 1 2. -A = A From the first equation, solving for A we have:  1 - A = -A - 1   1 + 1 = -A + A   2 = 0  Which is an impossible equation, so we ignore this equation and focus on the second equation, which makes more sense given the property of even functions (which do not have terms with odd powers of x). From the second equation:  -A = A   2A = 0   A = 0  However, this result doesn't match any of the given options, suggesting there might be an error in the statements or the options provided. But let's review if there's an A that can satisfy the original even function definition:  f(x) = (x + 1)(x - A)  to be equivalent to  f(-x) = (-x + 1)(-x - A) = (x - 1)(x + A)  We're looking for the condition in which the above two expressions are equivalent for all x. It's apparent that if A = 1, then:  f(x) = (x + 1)(x - 1)  and  f(-x) = (x - 1)(x + 1) = f(x)  Therefore, for A = 1, the function f(x) = (x + 1)(x - A) is indeed an even function, and so the correct answer is: boxed{C: 1}"},{"instruction":"First, the graph of the function y=2sin x is compressed horizontally to half its original size without changing the vertical coordinates.

The maximum points are located at x = frac{pi}{4} - frac{pi}{12} and x = frac{5pi}{4} - frac{pi}{12}. 6.

First, note that the angle (alpha) can be expressed as (alpha = angle COD) and (frac{alpha}{2} = angle CAD).  Part (a) Determining if (cos alpha) is rational: 3. According to the properties of a rectangle, its diagonals are equal and bisect each other at the center (O). 4. By the definition of the cosine of an angle in a right triangle, we can examine the triangle formed by half-diagonals. Since (A) and (D) have integral coordinates, so do their midpoints. 5. The formula for the cosine of half the angle in a right triangle is:    [    cos^2 frac{alpha}{2} = frac{(AD)^2}{(AC)^2}    ]    where (AD) and (AC) represent the length of the rectangle's sides. 6. Because (AD) and (AC) are integers (the distances between points with integer coordinates), ((AD)^2) and ((AC)^2) are rational. Hence, (cos^2 frac{alpha}{2}) is rational. 7. Using the double angle formula for cosine, we get:    [    cos alpha = 2 cos^2 frac{alpha}{2} - 1    ]    Since ( cos^2 frac{alpha}{2} ) is rational, ( cos alpha ) must also be rational.

The eccentricity e of the hyperbola can be expressed as e = frac{c}{a}, so we have:  frac{3}{2} < frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{5+m}}{sqrt{5}} < 2  Squaring all sides to eliminate the square roots, we obtain:  left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 < frac{5+m}{5} < 2^2  Upon simplification, we get:  2.25 < 1 + frac{m}{5} < 4   1.25 < frac{m}{5} < 3   6.25 < m < 15  This contradicts our earlier findings.

Perform an inductive proof on t, the total number of subsets in F:     - **Base Case (t = 1):** Clearly, the theorem holds since there is only one subset, so the anti-chain is trivially the element itself.     - **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement holds for t - 1. We then consider a maximum anti-chain S within F such that |S| = r.  4. Given any maximum anti-chain S, define:     - F_{1} = {A_{i} in F mid A_{i} text{ contains some subset in } S }     - F_{2} = {A_{i} in F mid A_{i} text{ is a subset of some element in } S } 5. Notice that F_{1} cup S and F_{2} cup S are both proper subsets of F, thus by the inductive hypothesis, each of these can be decomposed into r chains.      - Chains in F_{1} cup S start with elements from S.     - Chains in F_{2} cup S end with elements from \`S\`.      6.

Removing any element from the maximal anti-chain subset leaves us with subsets that still form a valid anti-chain. Thus, using the inductive hypothesis on the remaining subsets leads to a decomposition into r - 1 chains. Adding back the chain B subset A gives \`r\` chains in total. 10. Assign elements in S_{2} to corresponding elements in S_{1} in the respective chains, ensuring a mapping f: S_{2} rightarrow S_{1} that meets the given requirements. # Conclusion: Since F can be decomposed into r chains, and each chain contains one element from S_{1}, with at most one element from S_{2}, we can map each element from S_{2} to the chain element in S_{1}, ensuring f(A) subseteq A or A subseteq f(A).

This is because:    - A positive slope (k > 0) ensures the line rises from left to right, allowing it to pass through the second and first quadrants.    - A positive y-intercept (2-k > 0) ensures the line crosses the y-axis above the origin, which is necessary for it to extend into the second and third quadrants. 2. **Setting Up Inequalities:** Based on the above understanding, we set up the following conditions:    - For a positive slope: k > 0.    - For a positive y-intercept: 2-k > 0. 3. **Solving the Inequalities:**    - The first condition directly gives us k > 0.    - To solve the second condition, 2-k > 0, we rearrange it to find k < 2. 4. **Combining the Conditions:** Since k must satisfy both conditions simultaneously, we combine them to get the range of k:    0 < k < 2.

The focus of this parabola is the center of the semicircle ( O ), and the directrix is a line ( e ) parallel to the diameter. Begin by considering the following geometric setup: 1. **Define Given Elements**:    - Let the semicircle have center ( O ) and radius ( R ).    - Denote its diameter as ( AB ).    - Let ( K ) be the center of the circle with radius ( r ) that is tangent to both the semicircle at ( E ) and its diameter at ( F ). 2. **Properties of Tangency**:    - The circle with center ( K ) is tangent to the semicircle at point ( E ). Thus, the segment ( KE ) has length ( r ).    - It is also tangent to the diameter at point ( F ). As a result, ( KF ) is also equal to ( r ). 3. **Vertical Distance and Directrix**:    - Since the tangent at the diameter ( F ) is perpendicular, ( KF ) is vertical.    - Consider the line ( e ) parallel to the diameter passing through ( F ). The parabola’s directrix is this line ( e ).    - The distance between ( K ) and ( e ) is the distance ( KG ), where ( G ) is the projection of ( K ) onto ( e ). 4. **Distance Analysis**:    - Because the semicircle is tangent at ( E ), the points ( O ), ( E ), and ( K ) are collinear.    - Given that the tangent circle touches ( AB ) at ( F ), ( KF ) is perpendicular to ( AB ), making ( G ) lie directly above or below ( K ). 5. **Equal Distances to Focus and Directrix**:    - The distance ( KO ) is given by ( R - r ), where ( R ) is the semicircle's radius.    - The vertical segment ( K F ) has length ( r ).    - By the properties of a parabola, the point ( K ) would then satisfy the condition that its distance ( KO ) is equal to its distance to the directrix ( e ). 6. **Parabolic Condition**:    - Since ( KO = KG = R - r ), ( K ) lies on the parabola’s arc where every point is equidistant from the focus ( O ) and the directrix ( e ). 7. **Conclusion**:    - Therefore, the locus of points ( K ), which are the centers of circles tangent to both the semicircle and its diameter, forms part of a parabola’s arc.    - This arc lies inside the semicircle, with the focus at the center of the semicircle ( O ) and a directrix parallel to and passing through the projection point on the diameter. Thus, the locus is the segment of the parabola interior to the semicircle.

Since Car X was traveling at 35 miles per hour, in 1.2 hours, Car X would have traveled: 35 miles/hour * 1.2 hours = 42 miles Now, we know that Car X traveled a total of 294 miles from the time Car Y began traveling until both cars stopped. This means that Car X traveled 42 miles before Car Y started, and then both cars traveled 294 miles. So, the total distance Car X traveled is: 42 miles + 294 miles = 336 miles Now, let's find out how long Car X traveled to cover the 336 miles. Since Car X travels at 35 miles per hour, the time it took Car X to travel 336 miles is: 336 miles / 35 miles/hour = 9.6 hours Now we know that Car Y traveled 294 miles in the same time Car X traveled from the time Car Y started until both cars stopped. Since Car X took 9.6 hours to travel 336 miles, Car Y also took 9.6 hours to travel 294 miles.

The person had a net income of 12000 after paying a 10 percent tax on all income over the threshold T. The income before taxes was 13000. The amount of income that was taxed at 10 percent is the difference between the income before taxes (13000) and the threshold (T). So, the taxed amount is 13000 - T. Since the tax rate is 10 percent, the tax paid on the amount over the threshold is 0.10 * (13000 - T). The net income is the income before taxes minus the tax paid.

Prove that there exists a constant c, depending on alpha, such that every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of at most c elements from mathcal{A}.","output":":  1. **Define the Sets and Properties:**    We start by defining a sequence of sets recursively using the given set mathcal{A} of positive integers. These sets are defined as follows:    [    mathcal{A}_0 = mathcal{A}    ]    [    mathcal{A}_{i+1} = mathcal{A}_i + mathcal{A}_i quad (i = 0, 1, 2, ldots)    ]    Here, the operation mathcal{M} + mathcal{N} for any sets of positive integers mathcal{M} and mathcal{N} is defined as:    [    mathcal{M} + mathcal{N} = mathcal{M} cup mathcal{N} cup { m + n : m in mathcal{M}, n in mathcal{N} }    ] 2. **Interpretation of the Sets:**    The set mathcal{A}_i contains all positive integers that can be represented as sums of at most ( 2^i ) elements from mathcal{A}.  3. **Concept of Density:**    Assume the set mathcal{A} is (alpha)-dense, that is:    [    |mathcal{A} cap {1, 2, ldots, n}| geq alpha cdot n    ]    for all n > 0 integers.  4. **Objective:**    We aim to show that there exists a constant c depending on alpha such that any positive integer can be expressed as the sum of at most c elements from mathcal{A}. In other words, we need to demonstrate mathcal{A}_i becomes 1-dense for some suitable i. 5. **Lemma 1:**    **Statement:**    If mathcal{M} and mathcal{N} are sets of positive integers such that mathcal{M} is (mu)-dense and mathcal{N} is (nu)-dense, then mathcal{M} + mathcal{N} is ((mu + nu - mu nu))-dense.    **Proof:**    Define:    [    M(x) = |mathcal{M} cap {1, 2, ldots, x}|    ]    [    N(x) = |mathcal{N} cap {1, 2, ldots, x}|    ]    By the conditions, we have:    [    M(x) geq mu x qquad text{and} qquad N(x) geq nu x    ]    When (mu = 0) or (nu = 0), the statement is trivial. Otherwise, since mathcal{M} and mathcal{N} are non-empty, we have:    [    M(1) geq mu > 0 quad text{and} quad N(1) geq nu > 0    ]    Consider any positive integer ( x ). The set mathcal{M} + mathcal{N} contains certain numbers within {1, 2, ldots, x}, specifically:    - Elements of mathcal{M}: ( m_1 < m_2 < cdots < m_{M(x)} )    - Numbers of the form ( m_i + n ) for ( n in mathcal{N} ) and ( 0 < n < m_{i+1} - m_i )    - Numbers of the form ( m_{M(x)} + n ) for ( n in mathcal{N} ) and ( 0 < n leq x - m_{M(x)} ) 6. **Calculation of Density:**    Combining these, we obtain:    [    |(mathcal{M} + mathcal{N}) cap {1, 2, ldots, x}| geq M(x) + sum_{i=1}^{M(x)-1} N(m_{i+1} - m_i - 1) + N(x - m_{M(x)})    ]    Utilizing the density conditions and assuming ( m_{i+1} - m_i - 1 geq 0 ):    [    geq M(x) + nu left[(m_2 - m_1 - 1) + (m_3 - m_2 - 1) + cdots + (m_{M(x)} - m_{M(x)-1} - 1) + (x - m_{M(x)}) right]    ]    Simplifying the right-hand side gives:    [    geq M(x) + nu (x - M(x)) = nu x + (1 - nu) M(x)    ]    Since ( M(x) geq mu x ):    [    nu x + (1 - nu) mu x = (mu + nu - mu nu) x    ]    Therefore, (mathcal{M} + mathcal{N}) is ((mu + nu - mu nu))-dense. 7. **Lemma 2:**    **Statement:**    If mathcal{M} and mathcal{N} are sets of positive integers such that mathcal{M} is (mu)-dense and mathcal{N} is (nu)-dense where (mu + nu geq 1), then mathcal{M} + mathcal{N} is 1-dense.    **Proof:**    Use the previous lemma with (mu + nu geq 1). Conclude that mathcal{M} + mathcal{N} must be 1-dense, i.e., it contains all positive integers.    To complete the proof, we need to show that for a suitable (i), mathcal{A}_i becomes 1-dense. Since (mathcal{A}) is (alpha)-dense, repeatedly applying Lemma 1 will eventually make (mu + nu geq 1). 8. **Conclusion:**    After applying the above lemmas iteratively, there exists a constant (c = 2^{i}) such that every positive integer can be represented using at most (c) elements from (mathcal{A}). 9. **Constant Evaluation:**    The constant (C) can be calculated as:    [    C = 2 leftlceil frac{log 2}{log frac{1}{1 - alpha}} rightrceil    ] Thus, we conclude that every positive integer can be represented as the sum of at most (C) elements from (mathcal{A}).

Thus, the equation of the circle can be rewritten as (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1, which means the center of the circle, M, is at (1,1) and the radius is 1.

This forms two right-angled triangles, sharing the segment PM as their hypotenuse. The tangent of the angle theta between the two tangents can be found using the formula for the tangent of the angle between two lines, which in this case, are the tangents to the circle.

Which triangle does not exist? A: 1:1:2 B: 1:2:3 C: 2:3:4 D: 3:4:5","output":"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the altitudes of a triangle are inversely proportional to the lengths of their corresponding sides. This means that if the altitudes have a certain ratio, the sides of the triangle will have the inverse of that ratio. Let's analyze each option step by step. **Option A: 1:1:2** Given the ratio of the altitudes is 1:1:2, the inverse ratio for the sides would be the reciprocal of these, which gives us the sides' ratio as 1/1:1/1:1/2 = 2:2:1. This satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, a triangle with sides in the ratio 2:2:1 does exist. **Option B: 1:2:3** For the ratio of the altitudes 1:2:3, the inverse ratio for the sides would be 1/1:1/2:1/3 = 6:3:2 after finding a common denominator and taking the reciprocal. According to the triangle inequality theorem, for any two sides of a triangle, the sum must be greater than the third side. However, in this case, 3+2 is not greater than 6, which violates the triangle inequality theorem. Therefore, a triangle with sides in the ratio 6:3:2 cannot exist. **Option C: 2:3:4** Given the ratio of the altitudes as 2:3:4, the inverse ratio for the sides would be 1/2:1/3:1/4 = 6:4:3 after finding a common denominator and taking the reciprocal. This ratio satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, as 4+3 is greater than 6, 6+3 is greater than 4, and 6+4 is greater than 3. Therefore, a triangle with sides in the ratio 6:4:3 does exist. **Option D: 3:4:5** For the ratio of the altitudes 3:4:5, the inverse ratio for the sides would be 1/3:1/4:1/5 = 20:15:12 after finding a common denominator and taking the reciprocal. This ratio also satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, as 15+12 is greater than 20, 20+12 is greater than 15, and 20+15 is greater than 12. Therefore, a triangle with sides in the ratio 20:15:12 does exist. Based on the analysis above, the only option that does not satisfy the conditions for a triangle's sides is option B. Therefore, the triangle that does not exist is the one with altitudes in the ratio of 1:2:3.

Therefore, for each pair of universities, there are 3 ways to distribute the admissions among the 3 students. Combining these two steps, the total number of ways is binom{8}{2} times 3 = 28 times 3 = 84.

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the calculation. The correct approach should be as follows: First, choose 2 universities from the 8, which can be done in binom{8}{2} = 28 ways.

What is the certain number?","output":"If 18888 - n is divisible by a certain number and n is 1, then the expression becomes 18888 - 1 = 18887. Now we need to find the certain number by which 18887 is divisible. Since 18887 is not an even number, it is not divisible by 2. We can check for divisibility by other small prime numbers such as 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. Let's check for divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 18887 is 1 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 32. Since 32 is not divisible by 3, 18887 is also not divisible by 3. Let's check for divisibility by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. Since the last digit of 18887 is not 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Let's check for divisibility by 7. There is no straightforward rule for divisibility by 7, so we can try dividing 18887 by 7. When we do so, we find that 18887 ÷ 7 = 2698.142857..., which is not a whole number, so 18887 is not divisible by 7. Let's check for divisibility by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in the odd positions and the sum of its digits in the even positions is either 0 or a multiple of 11. For 18887, the sum of the digits in the odd positions is 1 + 8 + 7 = 16, and the sum of the digits in the even positions is 8 + 8 = 16. The difference is 16 - 16 = 0, which is a multiple of 11. Therefore, 18887 is divisible by 11. So, the certain number by which 18888 - n (with n = boxed{1)}  is divisible is 11."},{"instruction":"Let the intersection point of the parabola y^2=8x be F, and a fixed line l: x=4.

From (overrightarrow{PQ} + sqrt{2} overrightarrow{PF}) cdot (overrightarrow{PQ} - sqrt{2} overrightarrow{PF}) = 0, we get overrightarrow{PQ}^2 - 2overrightarrow{PF}^2 = 0, Therefore, (x-4)^2 - 2(x-2)^2 - 2y^2 = 0, After rearranging, we get x^2 + 2y^2 = 8, which is frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1. The equation of trajectory C is boxed{frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1}. (2) (i) When the slope of tangent line l does not exist, let x=r (or x=-r), substituting into the ellipse equation yields y= sqrt{frac{8-r^2}{2}}. Therefore, A(r, sqrt{frac{8-r^2}{2}}), B(r, -sqrt{frac{8-r^2}{2}}), Since the circle with diameter AB always passes through the origin, overrightarrow{OA} perp overrightarrow{OB}, thus r^2 - frac{8-r^2}{2} = 0, so r^2 = frac{8}{3}.

(ii) When the slope of tangent line l exists, let the equation of l be: y=kx+m. Since l is tangent to circle O, frac{|m|}{sqrt{1+k^2}} = r, thus m^2 = (1+k^2)r^2.

Let A(x_1, y_1), B(x_2, y_2), then x_1, x_2 are the solutions of the equation, by Vieta's formulas, we get: x_1 + x_2 = -frac{4km}{1+2k^2}, x_1x_2 = frac{2m^2-8}{1+2k^2}, y_1y_2 = (kx_1+m)(kx_2+m) = k^2x_1x_2 + km(x_1+x_2) + m^2 = frac{m^2-8k^2}{1+2k^2}.

Since m^2 = (1+k^2)r^2, 3(1+k^2)r^2 = 8(1+k^2), r^2 = frac{8}{3}, at this time m^2 = frac{8}{3}(1+k^2), substituting into the equation Delta holds true. Therefore, the equation of circle O is x^2+y^2= frac{8}{3}.

According to the ratio given, we have C:B:A = 1:1:2.  Since the total number of fish is 180, we can write the following equation based on the ratio: C + B + A = 180 Given the ratio 1:1:2, we can say that C = B and A = 2B. So we can rewrite the equation as: B + B + 2B = 180 4B = 180 B = 180 / 4 B = 45 So, there are 45 blowfish, 45 clownfish, and 90 angelfish in total. Now, 26 of the blowfish stay in their own tank, so the remaining blowfish that swim into the display tank are: 45 - 26 = 19 blowfish An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, so 19 clownfish also go into the display tank initially. But then a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank: 1/3 * 19 = 19/3 ≈ 6.33 Since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we'll round this to 6 clownfish that swim back. So the number of clownfish that remain in the display tank is: 19 - 6 = 13 clownfish The number of angelfish in the display tank is 1.5 times the number of clownfish that remain in the display tank: 1.5 * 13 = 19.5 Again, since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we'll consider 19 angelfish in the display tank (assuming the 0.5 fish is rounded down). The angelfish that stay in their own tank is half the initial number of blowfish: 1/2 * 45 = 22.5 Again, assuming we round down, there are 22 angelfish that stay in their own tank.

Assume that this polynomial can be factorized into the product of two polynomials with integer coefficients:    [    left(x - a_1right)^2 left(x - a_2right)^2 ldots left(x - a_nright)^2 + 1 = p(x) q(x)    ]    where ( p(x) ) and ( q(x) ) are polynomials with integer coefficients. 3. At each ( x = a_i ) (where ( 1 le i le n )), the polynomial (left(x - a_1right)^2 left(x - a_2right)^2 ldots left(x - a_nright)^2) evaluates to zero, thus:    [    left(a_i - a_1right)^2 left(a_i - a_2right)^2 ldots left(a_i - a_nright)^2 + 1 = 1    ] 4. Since ( p(a_i) q(a_i) = 1 ) for all ( i ), each ( p(a_i) ) and ( q(a_i) ) must be either ( 1 ) or ( -1 ). 5. If there exists at least one ( p(a_i) = 1 ) and ( q(a_i) = -1 ) (or vice versa), then ( p(x) ) must change signs between these points as it moves from +1 to -1 or -1 to +1. This would imply that:    [    p(x) text{ or } q(x) text{ should have a root between } a_i text{ and } a_j     ]    for ( a_i ne a_j ). However, this is not possible, since (left(x - a_1right)^2 left(x - a_2right)^2 ldots left(x - a_nright)^2 ge 0) and the sum with +1 ensures the polynomial is always greater than or equal to 1, never zero. 6. Thus, ( p(a_i) ) and ( q(a_i) ) must be consistently ( 1 ) or (-1) (either all 1's or all -1's) at each ( a_i ). 7. Let's assume:    [    p(a_i) = 1 text{ and } q(a_i) = 1 text{ for all } i    ] 8. Then the polynomials ( p(x) - 1 ) and ( q(x) - 1 ) must both have ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) as roots:    [    p(x) - 1 = left(x - a_1right)left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright)    ]    and similarly for ( q(x) - 1 ). 9. Therefore:    [    p(x) = left(x - a_1right)left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright) + 1    ]    and    [    q(x) = left(x - a_1right)left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright) + 1    ] 10. Multiplying these together, we get:     [     p(x)q(x) = left[left(x - a_1right)left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright) + 1right]^2     ]     [     p(x)q(x) = left(x - a_1right)^2 left(x - a_2right)^2 ldots left(x - a_nright)^2 + 2left(x - a_1right)left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright) + 1     ] 11. Compare this with the original polynomial:     [     left(x - a_1right)^2 left(x - a_2right)^2 ldots left(x - a_nright)^2 + 1     ] 12. The term ( 2left(x - a_1right)left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright) ) must be zero for the equality to hold. This implies:     [     left(x - a_1right)left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright) equiv 0     ]     which is impossible since ( x ) is a variable and ( a_i )'s are distinct non-zero integers. 13. Therefore, the assumption that ( p(x) ) and ( q(x) ) can have such values is false.  14. Similarly, (p(x) ) and ( q(x) ) cannot both be (-1 ) at each ( a_i ). 15. Thus, it is impossible to factorize:     [     left(x - a_1right)^2 left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright)^2 + 1     ]     into products of two polynomials with integer coefficients.

For positive integers ( a, b, c ), we need to determine if there exists a positive integer ( m ) such that ( a-1 ), ( ab-12 ), and ( abc-2015 ) belong to ( P_m ). This translates to finding ( m ) such that:    [    a-1 = m^x, quad ab-12 = m^y, quad abc-2015 = m^z    ]    for some non-negative integers ( x, y, z ). 2. **Analyze the divisibility conditions:**    From the given conditions, we have:    [    m^x + 1 mid m^y + 12 mid m^z + 2015    ]    We need to analyze the implications of these divisibility conditions. 3. **Claim 1: At least one of ( x, y, z ) must be zero.**    - **Proof:**      Assume ( x, y, z > 0 ). Consider the numbers ( m^x + 1 ), ( m^y + 12 ), and ( m^z + 2015 ).      - If ( m ) is odd, then ( m^x + 1 ) is even, ( m^y + 12 ) is odd, and ( m^z + 2015 ) is even. This contradicts the divisibility condition since an even number cannot divide an odd number.      - If ( m ) is even, then ( m^x + 1 ) is odd, ( m^y + 12 ) is even, and ( m^z + 2015 ) is odd. This also contradicts the divisibility condition.      Therefore, at least one of ( x, y, z ) must be zero. 4. **Claim 2: ( z = 0 ).**    - **Proof:**      - If ( y = 0 ), then ( m^x + 1 ) must be 1 or 13. This implies ( m = 12 ) and ( x = 1 ), but this would mean ( 13 = m^y + 12 ) which does not divide ( 12^z + 2015 ), leading to a contradiction.      - If ( x = 0 ), then ( m^y + 12 ) must be even. Thus, ( m ) must be even (since ( y neq 0 )). This implies ( m^z + 2015 ) must be even, hence ( z = 0 ).      Therefore, ( z = 0 ). 5. **Count the number of solutions:**    - **Case 1: ( x = 0 ).**      [      2 mid m + 12 mid 2016      ]      The number of even divisors of 2016 is the number of solutions.

If we say that [a, b] is an \\"accumulator\\" for the sequence {x_n}, it means that infinitely many terms of the sequence lie within [a, b]. We need to show that if [a, b] is an \\"accumulator\\" for {x_n}, then no number outside [a, b] can be the limit of the sequence {x_n}. 2. **Approach by contradiction**:    Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that some number L outside [a, b] is the limit of the sequence {x_n}.

This ensures that the interval (L-epsilon, L+epsilon) does not intersect [a, b]. 5. **Consequences of the epsilon-choice**:        For this chosen epsilon, there exists an integer N such that for all n geq N, x_n in (L-epsilon, L+epsilon). Consequently, for n geq N, x_n notin [a, b]. 6. **Contradiction with the 'accumulator' condition**:        This contradicts the assumption that [a, b] is an \\"accumulator\\" for {x_n}, because there can only be a finite number of terms outside any epsilon-neighborhood around the limit L, whereas [a, b] was supposed to contain infinitely many terms of {x_n}. 7. **Conclusion**:        Therefore, our assumption that the limit L can lie outside [a, b] must be incorrect.

Finding the set A: Given A={x|frac{x+2}{x-frac{3}{2}}＜0}, we solve the inequality to find the x-values that satisfy it.

To satisfy this condition, we analyze the range of m in different scenarios: - If m < 1, then the interval for B is mleqslant xleqslant 1. For B to be a subset of A, m > -2.

For B to be a subset of A, we need m < frac{3}{2}. Thus, for m > 1, the condition is 1 < m < frac{3}{2}. Combining all these conditions, we find that the range of m for which \\"x in A\\" is a sufficient condition for \\"x in B\\" is -2 < m < frac{3}{2}.

When a=-2e, the derivative f'(x) is:  f'(x) = 2x - frac{2e}{x} = frac{2x^2 - 2e}{x} = frac{2(x^2 - e)}{x}  To find the critical points, we set f'(x) = 0, which gives us x^2 - e = 0. The critical point is x = sqrt{e}. Analyzing the sign of f'(x), we observe that: - For 0 < x < sqrt{e}, the sign of f'(x) is negative, so f(x) is decreasing; - For x > sqrt{e}, the sign of f'(x) is positive, so f(x) is increasing. Therefore, the function f(x) is decreasing on the interval (0, sqrt{e}) and increasing on the interval (sqrt{e}, +infty).  Thus, the minimum value of f(x) occurs at x = sqrt{e}, which gives us f(sqrt{e}) = (sqrt{e})^2 + (-2e) ln(sqrt{e}) = e - 2e ln(sqrt{e}) = e - 2e(frac{1}{2}ln e) = e - e = 0.

Therefore, the possible pairs ((x, y)) are ((1, 2)), ((1, 3)), and ((2, 4)). 2. To maximize (n), we notice that (a_{k+1} + a_{k-1} > 2a_k) is equivalent to (a_{k+1} - a_k > a_k - a_{k-1}).

Wallet: The wallet is 60 more than the food, so the wallet costs 30 + 60 = 90. 3. Shirt: The shirt costs a third of the wallet, so the shirt costs 90 / 3 = 30. 4. Shoes: The shoes cost double the price of the wallet, so the shoes cost 2 * 90 = 180. 5. Belt: The belt is 45 cheaper than the shoes, so the belt costs 180 - 45 = 135. Now let's apply the discounts to the items: 1. Shirt discount: 20% of 30 is (20/100) * 30 = 6. So the shirt costs 30 - 6 = 24 after the discount. 2. Shoes discount: 15% of 180 is (15/100) * 180 = 27.

Let's add up all the parts of the ratio: 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 = 81 parts Let's denote the value of each part as \\"x.\\" This means that the first friend gets 5x marbles, the second friend gets 6x marbles, and so on, up to the ninth friend who gets 13x marbles. Since Zack has 27 marbles left after distributing them, we can express the total number of marbles he initially had as the sum of the marbles given away plus the 27 marbles left. The total number of marbles given away is 81x (since there are 81 parts in total). So the equation representing the total number of marbles initially is: Total marbles = 81x + 27 We don't know the exact number of marbles each friend received, but we do know that the number of marbles each friend received must be a whole number since you can't give away a fraction of a marble. Therefore, x must be a whole number. Since 27 is also a multiple of 9 (27 = 9 * 3), and there are 9 friends, it's likely that x is also a multiple of 9 to keep the distribution in whole numbers. Let's find the smallest possible value for x that is a multiple of 9. Since 27 is the smallest multiple of 9 greater than 0, let's try x = 3: Total marbles = 81x + 27 Total marbles = 81(3) + 27 Total marbles = 243 + 27 Total marbles = 270 So, if x = boxed{3,}  Zack initially had 270 marbles. This satisfies the condition that each friend receives a whole number of marbles, and Zack has 27 marbles left after distribution.

Four common points?","output":"# Problem: Can three circles have: 1. One common point? 2. Two common points? 3. Three common points? 4. Four common points? To answer this question, we need to analyze the geometric properties of circles and their intersections.  1. Can three circles have one common point? Yes, three circles can intersect at a single common point. This is because the intersection of circles does not necessarily have to be symmetrical, and it is possible for all three circles to pass through a single point in the plane.  Example: Consider three circles centered at different points but all passing through a single common point. Let's denote the circles by (C_1, C_2,) and (C_3). If the equations of these circles are: - (C_1: (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r_1^2) - (C_2: (x - c)^2 + (y - d)^2 = r_2^2) - (C_3: (x - e)^2 + (y - f)^2 = r_3^2) If these three circles intersect precisely at one point ((x_0, y_0)), then we have: - ((x_0 - a)^2 + (y_0 - b)^2 = r_1^2) - ((x_0 - c)^2 + (y_0 - d)^2 = r_2^2) - ((x_0 - e)^2 + (y_0 - f)^2 = r_3^2)  2. Can three circles have two common points? Yes, three circles can intersect at exactly two common points. For this to happen, the three circles must overlap at two distinct points.  Example: Consider two circles (C_1) and (C_2) intersecting at two points. If a third circle (C_3) passes through both points of intersection, then all three circles intersect in two points.  3. Can three circles have three common points? No, three circles cannot have exactly three common points. To understand why this is impossible, we must analyze the locus of intersection points.  Explanation: - If two circles intersect, they intersect at most in two points. - A third circle intersecting with these two will pass through at most two of these points but cannot create another independent intersection point that is common to all three. Thus, having exactly three common points is geometrically impossible.  4. Can three circles have four common points? No, three circles cannot have exactly four common points. To see this, consider the properties of circle intersections again: - Any two circles intersect at most in two points. - Thus, the number of points where all three circles intersect cannot exceed two. Therefore, the maximum number of common intersection points for three circles is two. # Conclusion: Based on the above analysis: 1. Three circles can intersect at one common point. 2. Three circles can intersect at two common points. 3. Three circles cannot intersect at three common points. 4. Three circles cannot intersect at four common points.

Now, to find the ratio of the number of sandcastles on Jeff's beach to the number of sandcastles on Mark's beach, we divide the number of sandcastles on Jeff's beach by the number of sandcastles on Mark's beach: Ratio = J / 20 Ratio = 60 / 20 Ratio = 3 / 1 Therefore, the ratio of the number of sandcastles on Jeff's beach to the number of sandcastles on Mark's beach is boxed{3:1} ."},{"instruction":"For the quadratic equation z^2 + iz + m = 0 (where m in mathbb{R}, i is the imaginary unit) to have a real solution, then m equals ( ) A: 2 B: 2 C: 1 D: 0","output":"Since the quadratic equation z^2 + iz + m = 0 has a real solution, then z^2 + iz = -m.

The number of outcomes where exactly two coins show tails is binom{n}{2}. The probability that exactly two coins show tails can be expressed as frac{binom{n}{2}}{2^n}. For the given probability of frac{1}{32}, we need to find n such that frac{binom{n}{2}}{2^n} = frac{1}{32}. First, express binom{n}{2} as frac{n(n-1)}{2} and plug it into the probability equation: frac{frac{n(n-1)}{2}}{2^n} = frac{1}{32}.

Assuming the correct number is 0.9545, and we want to find the numerator of the fraction that equals this decimal when the denominator is 22. To convert the decimal to a fraction, we can write it as 9545/10000 because 0.9545 is the same as 9545 divided by 10000. However, we want the denominator to be 22, so we need to find an equivalent fraction with 22 as the denominator. To do this, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction 9545/10000 by the same number to find an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 22. Since 10000 is not a multiple of 22, we cannot directly scale down to a denominator of 22 without losing the precision of the decimal.

We can rewrite this inequality by recognizing that (e^{x}+1)x can be expressed as (e^{x}+1)ln e^{x} and left(ln x-ln lambda right)(frac{x}{lambda}+1) can be rewritten as (frac{x}{lambda}+1)lnfrac{x}{lambda}, given that x > 0 and lambda > 0. This leads us to the comparison of two functions of the form f(x) = (x+1)ln x for x > 0. We define f(x) = (x+1)ln x for x > 0 and observe that we need to compare f(e^{x}) and f(frac{x}{lambda}). To understand the behavior of f(x), we find its derivative, f'(x) = ln x + frac{1}{x} + 1. We then define another function g(x) = ln x + frac{1}{x} + 1 and find its derivative, g'(x) = frac{x-1}{x^2}. Analyzing g'(x), we see that g(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,1) and monotonically increasing on [1,+infty), with a minimum value at x=1, where g(1) = 2. Since f'(x) = g(x) geqslant 2 for all x > 0, we conclude that f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). This implies that e^{x} > frac{x}{lambda}, or equivalently, lambda > frac{x}{e^{x}}. To find the range of lambda, we consider the function h(x) = frac{x}{e^{x}} for x > 0 and find its derivative, h'(x) = frac{1-x}{e^{x}}. Analyzing h'(x), we find that h(x) is monotonically increasing for 0 < x < 1 and monotonically decreasing for x > 1, reaching its maximum at x=1, where h(1) = frac{1}{e}. Therefore, the maximum value of frac{x}{e^{x}} is frac{1}{e}, which means lambda must be greater than this value for the original inequality to hold.

Using the identity for a sine of a sum of two angles, it can be further simplified to f(x) = 2sinleft(2x - frac{pi}{3}right).   When x in [0, frac{pi}{2}], the angle 2x - frac{pi}{3} will be in the interval left[-frac{pi}{3}, frac{2pi}{3}right], which corresponds to the complete period of the sine function. Thus, the function f(x) can take any value in left[-sqrt{3}, 2right], since the amplitude of the sine function is 2 and the sine of (-frac{pi}{3}) is (-sqrt{3}). Therefore, the range of f(x) is (boxed{[-sqrt{3}, 2]}). (2) To find the shortest distance between two adjacent intersection points of the graph of y=f(x) and the line y=1, set f(x) = 2sinleft(2x - frac{pi}{3}right) = 1. It follows that sinleft(2x - frac{pi}{3}right) = frac{1}{2}. Thus, 2x - frac{pi}{3} = 2kpi + frac{pi}{6} or 2x - frac{pi}{3} = 2kpi + frac{5pi}{6}, where (k in mathbb{Z}). These two equations give the x-coordinates of the intersection points. The shortest distance between two intersections will be when we consider the difference between the smallest positive solutions of these equations, which corresponds to the case when (k=0). Thus the difference between the x-coordinates is frac{5pi}{6} - frac{pi}{6} = frac{2pi}{3}. Since the line y=1 is horizontal, the shortest distance is the same as the difference in x-coordinates, which means the shortest distance is (boxed{frac{2pi}{3}})."},{"instruction":"A can mow a lawn in 130 minutes, B takes 100 minutes and C takes 150 minutes.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 130, 100, and 150 is 1300. So we convert each fraction to have the denominator of 1300: A's rate: (1/130) = (10/1300) B's rate: (1/100) = (13/1300) C's rate: (1/150) = (8.67/1300) (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity) Now we can add the rates: Combined rate = (10/1300) + (13/1300) + (8.67/1300) Combined rate = (31.67/1300) lawns per minute To find out how long it will take all three to mow the lawn together, we take the reciprocal of the combined rate: Time = 1 / Combined rate Time = 1 / (31.67/1300) Time = 1300 / 31.67 Time ≈ 41.05 minutes So, it will take approximately boxed{41.05}  minutes for A, B, and C to mow the lawn together."},{"instruction":"the sequence (1, 2, 3, cdots, 10000), the sum of all the digits of these numbers is: (A) 180001 (B) 154756 (C) 45001 (D) 154755 (E) 270001","output":"1. **Identify the sequence of numbers we are dealing with**:    We need to find the sum of the digits of the numbers from 1 to 10,000.

By definition, the set ( C_k ) contains exactly ( n-1 ) cells. 4. **Row and column coverage analysis:**    Due to the chessboard arrangement, there must be at least one row and one column not containing any cell of set ( C_k ).

For ( M cap N = varnothing ), this equation must have no real solutions in ( x ). This occurs if the discriminant of the quadratic equation in ( x ) is less than zero. 7.

Since we know the sum of b1 and b2 is 36, and we don't have any other specific information to distinguish between the sales in January and February, there are multiple solutions for b1 and b2. They could be any pair of numbers that add up to 36. For example, if b1 is 18, then b2 would be 18, or if b1 is 20, then b2 would be 16, and so on. Without additional information, we cannot determine the exact number of books sold in January and February, only that their sum is boxed{36} ."},{"instruction":"There are 5 cells.

If it is not divisible by 3, the player who went second wins. Which player will win with optimal play and any play by the opponent? Justify the answer.","output":"Recall the divisibility rule for 3: A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. 1. Let's denote the five cells as follows: a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, where each a_i in {1, 2}.     2. The first player will write either a 1 or a 2 in a_1, and then the second player will write either a 2 or a 1 in a_2, respectively. 3. To ensure the second player has a winning strategy, they will always write the opposite number of what the first player writes. Let's detail this strategy:    - If the first player writes 1, the second player writes 2.    - If the first player writes 2, the second player writes 1.        Therefore:    - After move 1: Suppose a_1 = 1    - After move 2: Then a_2 = 2 4. After the second player's turn, the sum of a_1 and a_2 will always be 3, which is divisible by 3.  5. On each successive move, the second player can continue this strategy:    - After move 3: Suppose a_3 = 1    - After move 4: Then a_4 = 2 6. Now, the sum of the first four digits (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4) is 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6, which is divisible by 3. 7. Finally, the first player writes in a_5,:    - If they write 1, then the total sum of the digits is 6 + 1 = 7, which is not divisible by 3.    - If they write 2, then the total sum of the digits is 6 + 2 = 8, which is not divisible by 3. 8. Therefore, no matter what the first player writes in a_5, the resulting 5-digit number will not be divisible by 3. Conclusion: The player who makes the second move (the second player) will always win if they follow this strategy.

This comes from the quadratic residue property: if p is a prime factor of m^2 + 9, then left(frac{-9}{p}right)=1 or p = 3. The quadratic residue left(frac{-9}{p}right)=1 indicates that -9 is a quadratic residue modulo p, implying p equiv 1 pmod{4}, or p = 3. 2. **Express n as 2^s cdot t**:     - Let n = 2^s cdot t where t is an odd integer. We handle two cases: t > 1 and t = 1. 3. **Case: t > 1**:     - If t > 1, then 2^t - 1 mid 2^n - 1 implying 2^t - 1 mid m^2 + 9.      - Observe congruences modulo 3 and modulo 4:         - Modulo 3: 2^t - 1 equiv (-1)^t - 1 equiv -2 pmod{3}, since t is odd. Hence, 2^t - 1 is not a multiple of 3.         - Since 2^t - 1 is not a multiple of 3, its prime factors must align with the earlier noted form, i.e., 4k + 1.      4. **Contradiction Through Congruences**:     - Modulo 4:          - 2^t - 1 equiv -1 pmod{4} for t > 1 since 2 equiv -2 pmod{4} (showing that an odd power reduces it by 1 more unit).         - Given (-1)^{text{odd number}} equiv -1 pmod{4} contradicts with the initial result where equiv 1 pmod{4}. 5. **Resolving the Contradiction**:     - This contradiction shows that t = 1 is the only possibility to avoid inconsistencies in modular arithmetic.     - Consequently, if t = 1, then n = 2^s for some integer s. 6. **Conclusion**:     - Thus, the only valid positive integers n complying with the given condition are powers of 2. # Conclusion: [ boxed{n = 2^s text{ for some integer } s} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that S_{n} is the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_{n}}, and S_{3}+S_{6}=18, find S_{5} = ( ) A: 14 B: 10 C: 9 D: 5","output":"Since S_{n} is the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_{n}}, We know that S_{3}+S_{6}=3a_{1}+ frac {3cdot (3-1)}{2}d+6a_{1}+ frac {6cdot5}{2}d Simplifying, we get 9a_{1}+18d=9(a_{1}+2d)=18, This implies that a_{3}=a_{1}+2d=2, Hence, S_{5}=5a_{3}=boxed{10}, So the correct answer is B.

However, we can use the given information to make an educated guess. We know that two non-adjacent sides are not to be fenced, and their lengths are 10 feet and 15 feet. Let's assume that these two sides are opposite each other, forming a rectangle with the fenced area. This is a reasonable assumption because it allows us to use the area to find the missing dimensions of the rectangle. Let's denote the length of the rectangle as L and the width as W. We know that the area (A) of the rectangle is 1200 sq. ft, so: A = L * W 1200 = L * W We also know that one of the sides (W) is 15 feet, so: 1200 = L * 15 L = 1200 / 15 L = 80 feet Now we have the dimensions of the rectangle: 80 feet by 15 feet. The total perimeter (P) of the rectangle would be: P = 2L + 2W P = 2(80) + 2(15) P = 160 + 30 P = 190 feet However, we are not fencing the entire perimeter, we are leaving out two non-adjacent sides of 10 feet and 15 feet.

Since speed is given in kilometers per hour (kmph), we need to convert it to meters per second (m/s) to match the time given in seconds.

Since we know the length of the train is 280.0416 meters, we can find the length of the platform by subtracting the length of the train from the total distance: Length of the platform = Total distance - Length of the train Length of the platform = 520 meters - 280.0416 meters Length of the platform = 239.9584 meters Therefore, the length of the platform is boxed{239.9584}  meters."},{"instruction":"10 chess players take part in a tournament.

Given the circle O: x^{2}+y^{2}=4, we can assess the position of point P relative to the circle by calculating its distance from the origin (the center of the circle): [ sqrt{left(frac{4}{5}right)^{2}+left(frac{2}{5}right)^{2}} = sqrt{frac{16}{25}+frac{4}{25}} = sqrt{frac{20}{25}} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}. ] Since left(frac{4}{5}right)^{2}+left(frac{2}{5}right)^{2} < 4, point P is inside the circle. The distance d from the center of the circle to the line l is maximized when it is equal to the distance from the center to point P, which we have found to be frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}. This is because any line passing through P and extending beyond the circle's boundary would result in a shorter perpendicular distance to the center of the circle than the direct distance to P. Therefore, the maximum distance from the center of the circle to the line l is boxed{text{B: }frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}}."},{"instruction":"From a group of 10 students, including students A and B, 4 students are to be selected to participate in a certain charity activity.

From the cyclic condition ( A_1 B_1 = A_1 B_7 ), this implies that if ( A_1 B_1 > 2 ), then the sequence will increase, and if ( A_1 B_1 < 2 ), the sequence will decrease. 5. **Length Cycle Stability:**    Given the cyclic nature and returning condition back to the start:    [    A_1 B_1 = A_1 B_7    ]    The stable solution where the sequence neither increases nor decreases can only occur if:    [    A_1 B_1 = 2    ] # Conclusion Thus, the solution to the problem is: [ boxed{2} ]"},{"instruction":"it true that among a sufficient number of pieces of paper, there is one that can be covered by the others? (Tearing, crumpling, folding, etc. are not allowed.)","output":"To demonstrate that the answer to the problem is negative, it is enough to provide a system of shapes (specifically rectangles) consisting of infinitely many shapes, none of which can be covered by the others. We will provide such rectangles, denoted T_1, T_2, T_3, ldots, and show that each rectangle T_n cannot be fully covered by the other rectangles. 1. **Define the rectangles:**    Let the sides of the n-th rectangle T_n be 8^n and frac{1}{8^n} for n = 1, 2, 3, ldots. The area of each rectangle T_n is given by:    [    text{Area}(T_n) = 8^n cdot frac{1}{8^n} = 1    ] 2. **Showing T_n cannot be covered by other rectangles:**    Suppose n > k, and consider the potential maximum area of the overlapping region between T_n and T_k. We assume an arbitrary placement and overlap of the rectangles T_n and T_k.    If the overlap is not empty, enclose it in a rectangle with one side on two opposite sides of T_n and the other two sides parallel to the shorter sides of T_n. The smallest such rectangle will have one side of length frac{1}{8^n} and the other side, given the vertices P and Q of T_k, will not exceed the diagonal of T_k. 3. **Calculate the overlap area:**    The diagonal of T_k is smaller than twice the longer side of T_k, which is 2 cdot 8^k. Therefore, the maximum possible overlap area is:    [    text{Overlap Area} leq frac{1}{8^n} cdot 2 cdot 8^k = frac{2}{8^{n-k}} = frac{2}{2^{3(n-k)}} = frac{1}{4^{n-k}}    ] 4. **Sum of the areas of overlapping regions:**    To attempt covering T_n with the rectangles T_1, T_2, ldots, T_{n-1}, T_{n+1}, T_{n+2}, ldots, consider the sums of the areas of the regions they cover.    According to above, each overlapped region's area is less than frac{1}{4^{n-k}}. Summing these for all k < n and k > n, we have:    [    sum_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{4^{n-k}} + sum_{k=n+1}^{infty} frac{1}{4^{k-n}} = sum_{j=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{4^j} + sum_{j=1}^{infty} frac{1}{4^j}    ] 5. **Evaluate the series:**    Both series are parts of geometric progressions. The finite series sum_{j=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{4^j} and the infinite series sum_{j=1}^{infty} frac{1}{4^j} add up as follows:        [    sum_{j=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{4^j} < sum_{j=1}^{infty} frac{1}{4^j}    ]        The sum of the infinite geometric series is:    [    sum_{j=1}^{infty} frac{1}{4^j} = frac{frac{1}{4}}{1 - frac{1}{4}} = frac{1}{3}    ]        Therefore, the total overlapped area covered is:    [    L < 2 cdot frac{1}{3} = frac{2}{3} < 1    ] 6. **Conclusion:**    Since each T_n has an area of 1, and the combined area of the regions covered by the other rectangles is less than 1, it is impossible to cover T_n completely with any subset of the other rectangles. Therefore, it follows that there is no rectangle among the set T_1, T_2, T_3, ldots that can be fully covered by the others, providing a negative answer to the problem's question.

We want to find the minimum number of triangles, formed using these 5 points as vertices, with area not greater than (frac{1}{4}).  Introduction: To solve this problem, we use a general property about triangles in a rectangle. This useful lemma states that the area of any triangle formed by three points within a rectangle is at most half of the area of the rectangle.  Definition: We call a set of three points a \\"good set\\" if the area of the triangle formed by these points is not larger than (frac{1}{4}).  Key Lemma: Within a rectangle (ABCD) with area 1: 1. Let (E, F, G, H) be the midpoints of sides (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA), respectively. 2. The intersection of line segments (EF) and (GH) is the point (O), which forms four smaller rectangles: (AFOG), (EFCB), (OGCH), and (EHGA).  Strategy: - At least two out of the five points must lie within the same one of these smaller rectangles. Without loss of generality, assume it is (AFOG). - Name these points (M) and (N).  Case Analysis: 1. **If at least two of the remaining three points do not lie within (OGCH)**:     - Consider any such point (X). The point (X) either lies in (EFCB) or (EHGA).     - Using the lemma, (triangle M, N, X) is a good set.     - Since there are at least two such points (X), there are at least two good sets. 2. **If at least two points lie within (OGCH)**:     - Assume these points are (P) and (Q).     - Consider the remaining point (R). We have three subcases:     - **If (R in OFGD)**:         - (triangle M, N, R) is a good set.         - (triangle P, Q, R) is a good set because (P, Q, R in OGCH).     - **If (R in EBAH)**:         - Same logic as above, ensuring at least two good sets.     - **If (R in OGCH)**:         - Alternative setups still yield at least two good sets.  Valid Example: Suppose points (M) and (N) are taken such that: - (M) on side (AD) and (N) on side (AB), such that (AN/AB = 2/3) and (AM/AD = 2/3). - If we evaluate possible triangles, it is evident that:     - Triangles such as (triangle MBD), (triangle NBC) will have areas greater than (frac{1}{4}). **Calculations**: For (M, N, P, Q, R), denote the convex hull scenarios: - If the convex hull forms a pentagon or quadrilateral, use the lemma:     - Aggregated areas ensure at least two good sets.

Our goal is to find the range of real numbers a. 2. **Simplifying the Expression**: The expression on the right side of the inequality can be simplified as follows:    [    |x-5| + |x-3| = |x-5| + |3-x|.    ]    Notice that |3-x| is the same as |x-3| because the absolute value function measures distance on the number line, which is always positive or zero, regardless of the order of subtraction. 3. **Applying the Triangle Inequality**: The triangle inequality states that for any real numbers u and v, |u+v| leqslant |u| + |v|. Applying this in reverse, we can say:    [    |x-5+3-x| leqslant |x-5| + |3-x|.    ]    Simplifying the left side gives us |2| = 2. Therefore, we have:    [    2 leqslant |x-5| + |3-x|.    ] 4. **Determining the Condition for Equality**: The equality |x-5| + |3-x| = 2 holds if and only if left(x-5right)left(3-xright) geqslant 0.

Since the set is already ordered from least to greatest, the median will be the middle number when the integers are listed in order. With five numbers, the median will be the third number, which is ( x + 4 ). Now, let's find the mean of the set. The mean is the sum of all the numbers divided by the number of numbers. In this case, we have: Mean = ( frac{x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 7) + (x + 32)}{5} ) Simplify the numerator by combining like terms: Mean = ( frac{5x + 45}{5} ) Now, divide each term in the numerator by the denominator: Mean = ( x + 9 ) According to the problem, the mean is 5 greater than the median. We already know the median is ( x + 4 ), so we can set up the following equation: Mean = Median + 5 ( x + 9 = (x + 4) + 5 ) Now, solve for x: ( x + 9 = x + 9 ) This equation is true for all x, which means that there is no specific value of x that would make the mean 5 greater than the median with the given set of numbers.

Therefore, when x = 0, the function f(x) attains its maximum value, f(0) = a = 11, implying that a = 11. Consequently, f(x) = 2x^{3} - 6x^{2} + 11.

There are no pairs of numbers to consider, so the condition is trivially satisfied. 2. **Inductive Step:**    Assume that for some ( k geq 1 ), there exists a permutation ( sigma_k ) of ({1, 2, ldots, k}) such that the average of any two numbers does not appear in-between them. We need to show that there exists a permutation ( sigma_{k+1} ) of ({1, 2, ldots, k+1}) with the same property. 3. **Constructing the Permutation:**    Given the permutation ( sigma_k ) of ({1, 2, ldots, k}), we can construct a permutation ( sigma_{k+1} ) of ({1, 2, ldots, k+1}) by inserting ( k+1 ) into ( sigma_k ) in such a way that the condition is maintained.    - Consider the permutation ( sigma_k = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k} ).    - We can insert ( k+1 ) at the beginning or the end of ( sigma_k ) to form ( sigma_{k+1} ). 4. **Verification:**    - If we insert ( k+1 ) at the beginning, the new permutation is ( {k+1, a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k} ).    - If we insert ( k+1 ) at the end, the new permutation is ( {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k, k+1} ).    In both cases, the average of any two numbers in the original permutation ( sigma_k ) does not appear in-between them because ( k+1 ) is either the first or the last element, and thus cannot be in-between any two elements of ( sigma_k ). 5. **Conclusion:**    By induction, we have shown that for any positive integer ( n ), there exists a permutation of ({1, 2, ldots, n}) such that the average of any two numbers does not appear in-between them.

First, let's determine how many candies each one eats when Andrey eats a certain number of candies.        From the given data:    - While Andrey eats 6 candies, Denis eats 7 candies.    - Therefore, while Andrey eats 12 candies (doubling the first scenario), Denis eats ( 2 times 7 = 14 ) candies.    - Similarly, while Andrey eats 4 candies, Boris eats 3 candies.    - Therefore, while Andrey eats 12 candies (tripling the first scenario), Boris eats ( 3 times 3 = 9 ) candies. 3. **Summing Up Total Candies for the Given Interval:**    - For Andrey eating 12 candies:      [      text{Total candies} = 12 (text{Andrey}) + 9 (text{Boris}) + 14 (text{Denis}) = 35      ] 4. **Determine Total Interval Repetitions:**    - We know the total candies consumed by all three is 70.    - Let's determine the number of intervals of 35 candies each:      [      frac{70}{35} = 2      ] 5. **Calculate Individual Totals:**    - Multiply each person’s consumption within one interval by the number of intervals (2):      - Andrey:        [        12 times 2 = 24 text{ candies}        ]      - Boris:        [        9 times 2 = 18 text{ candies}        ]      - Denis:        [        14 times 2 = 28 text{ candies}        ] # Conclusion: Thus, the number of candies eaten by each is: [ boxed{text{Andrey ate 24 candies, Boris ate 18 candies, and Denis ate 28 candies.}} ]"},{"instruction":"f f(x) is a monic quartic polynomial such that f(2)=4, f(1)=1, f(3)=9, and f(4)=16, find f(2).","output":"Let g(x) = f(x) + x^2.

The condition given is:    [    d_1 + d_2 + d_3 > n    ]    We need to find the largest ( k ) that divides every ( n ) in ( S ). 3. **Considering Smallest Divisors:**    To satisfy the condition ( d_1 + d_2 + d_3 > n ), we start by considering the smallest possible divisors. The smallest divisors of any number ( n ) are typically 1, 2, 3, etc. However, since we are excluding ( n ) itself, we need to consider the next largest divisors. 4. **Testing with Small Numbers:**    Let's test with small numbers to understand the pattern:    - For ( n = 12 ):      The divisors are ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 ). The largest three divisors excluding 12 are ( 6, 4, 3 ).      [      6 + 4 + 3 = 13 > 12      ]      So, 12 is in ( S ).    - For ( n = 30 ):      The divisors are ( 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30 ).

[      15 + 10 + 6 = 31 > 30      ]      So, 30 is in ( S ). 5. **Generalizing the Pattern:**    From the examples, we see that the smallest divisors ( d_1 ) and ( d_2 ) must be 2 and 3 respectively to ensure the sum of the largest three divisors is greater than ( n ).

Therefore:    [    PA^2 + PB^2 > PC^2 + PD^2    ]    Summing this inequality over all points P in mathcal{S} other than A, B, C, D, we get:    [    sum_{P in mathcal{S} setminus {A, B, C, D}} (PA^2 + PB^2) > sum_{P in mathcal{S} setminus {A, B, C, D}} (PC^2 + PD^2)    ] 6. **Sum over all pairs:**    Including the pairs (A, B) and (C, D), we have:    [    sum_{substack{A, B in mathcal{S}  A neq B}} AB^2 > sum_{substack{C, D in mathcal{S}  C neq D}} CD^2    ]    This shows that the sum S strictly decreases with each operation. 7. **Conclude the proof:**    Since mathcal{S} is a finite set of lattice points, the sum S is a finite integer. A strictly decreasing sequence of finite integers must terminate after finitely many steps. Therefore, only finitely many such operations can be performed. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Paul has four identical blue marbles and a large supply of identical yellow marbles.

We will rotate the square by (90^circ) successively in the plane. This allows us to analyze the behavior of the perpendiculars (l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4). 2. **Initial Position**: Consider the point (P) within the square (ABCD) and construct perpendiculars from (A, B, C,) and (D) to (P). These perpendiculars are labeled as (l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4), where:     - (l_1) is the perpendicular from (A) to line (BP),     - (l_2) is the perpendicular from (B) to line (CP),     - (l_3) is the perpendicular from (C) to line (DP),     - (l_4) is the perpendicular from (D) to line (AP). 3. **Rotation by (90^circ)**: Perform a (90^circ) counterclockwise rotation about the center of the square.     - Point (A) maps to position (B),     - Point (B) maps to position (C),     - Point (C) maps to position (D),     - Point (D) maps to position (A). 4. **Transformation of Perpendiculars**: Under this (90^circ) rotation, the perpendiculars transform as follows:     - (l_1), being the perpendicular to (BP) from (A), now transforms and maintains its property but is associated with the new positions,     - Similarly, (l_2) transforms to the line associated with (CP) from (B),     - (l_3) transforms to the line associated with (DP) from (C), and     - (l_4) transforms to the line associated with (AP) from (D). 5. **Invariant Point**: Despite the rotation, the common intersection point (P) remains invariant. Consequently, the perpendiculars (BP, CP, DP,) and (AP) in respective rotations continue to define their perpendiculars intersecting at (P). 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, through the successive rotations and by the property of (P) being common to all these lines during the rotations, we can conclude that the four perpendiculars (l_1, l_2, l_3,) and (l_4) intersect at a single point, which is point (P).

To assess the validity of this equation, let us square both sides to eliminate the square roots: [ (sqrt{n})^2 = (sqrt{sqrt{n}})^2, ] [ n = sqrt{n}. ] 3. Next, we square both sides of the equation ( n = sqrt{n} ) again: [ n^2 = n. ] 4. Subtract ( n ) from both sides to set the equation to zero: [ n^2 - n = 0. ] 5.

Given ( sqrt{n} ), we need to find if it can be represented as ( sqrt[m]{k} ) for some numbers ( m ) and ( k ). 1. By definition, we need: [ sqrt{n} = sqrt[m]{k}. ] 2.

We need to find the number of elements in set ( A ). Firstly, we analyze the condition ( a + d equiv 1 (bmod 23)). This implies ( a + d ) can be either: 1. ( a + d = 1 ) 2. ( a + d = 24 ) (since ( 24 equiv 1 (bmod 23) )) **Case 1:** ( a + d = 1 ) This can happen if: - ( (a, d) = (0, 1) ) - ( (a, d) = (1, 0) ) For ( (a, d) = (0, 1) ): [ a, d = (0, 1) implies 0 cdot 1 - bc equiv 0 (bmod 23) implies bc equiv 0 (bmod 23) ] This gives us two possibilities for ( b ) and ( c ): - ( b = 0 ) (then ( c ) can be any of the 23 values in ( I )). - ( c = 0 ) (then ( b ) can be any of the 23 values in ( I )).

First, let's denote the coordinates of the foci as F_1 = (-c, 0) and F_2 = (c, 0), where c is the linear eccentricity of the hyperbola.

From the relation c = ae, we can derive c^2 = a^2 + b^2. 2. Now, let's denote the coordinates of point P as P = (x_P, y_P). Given that angle F_1 P F_2 = 60^circ, we can apply the cosine rule in triangle F_1 P F_2: cos(60^circ) = frac{PF_1^2 + PF_2^2 - F_1F_2^2}{2 cdot PF_1 cdot PF_2}  3. Since PF_1 = PF_2 (as P lies on the hyperbola), the equation simplifies to: frac{1}{2} = frac{2PF_1^2 - F_1F_2^2}{2 cdot PF_1^2}  4. Now, let's substitute PF_1 = sqrt{(x_P + c)^2 + y_P^2} and F_1F_2 = 2c. After simplification, we get (x_P + c)^2 + y_P^2 = 3c^2  5.

A 45° angle indicates that each leg of the right triangles (radius and height) are equal. Therefore, height ( H ) is equal to radius ( r ).

Segments overline{DF} and overline{EF} are composed of sections of the triangle and can be computed using the triangle's properties. By connecting these trisection points, we create a new smaller triangle, triangle DEF. Now, triangle DEF is also equilateral (as all sides are equal due to the symmetry and equal division) and each side's length of triangle DEF is calculated using the formula for the length of a segment between points dividing a side of the equilateral triangle:  DE = EF = FD = sqrt{left(frac{2s}{3}right)^2 - left(frac{s}{3}right)^2} = frac{ssqrt{3}}{3}  Point G is the midpoint of DF, and H is the midpoint of EF.

We know from the problem statement the total number of problems is 100. Hence, we have the equation:     [     x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + y_{1,2} + y_{1,3} + y_{2,3} + z = 100     ] 3.

By adding the last three equations, we get:     [     (x_1 + y_{1,2} + y_{1,3} + z) + (x_2 + y_{1,2} + y_{2,3} + z) + (x_3 + y_{1,3} + y_{2,3} + z) = 180     ]     [     x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + 2y_{1,2} + 2y_{1,3} + 2y_{2,3} + 3z = 180     ] 6.

Therefore,     [     x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + y_{1,2} + y_{1,3} + y_{2,3} + z = 180     ] 9.

Draw the Thales circle over (AA_{1}), ensuring accuracy. 3. Measure from point (A), placing (A) at the center (K) of a circle of radius (KA) and mark the angle (KAD = 2varphi). 4. The line (DC) intersects the Thales circle giving us the required point (C).  III. Solution: 1. For a simpler construction, note that the endpoint (C_{1}) of the median (s_{c}) is the midpoint of the hypotenuse of the right triangle, i.e., ( s_{c} = frac{c}{2}). 2. Consequently, the triangle (ACC_{1}) is isosceles. Given the angle at point (C_{1}) is (varphi), the angle at vertex (A) is also (varphi). 3. The angle (varphi) determines the shape of the right triangle entirely. 4. Construct an arbitrary right triangle (AB'C') where the angle at (A) equals (varphi) (see figure 2).     ![Figure 2](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_e376cc151161d3ba213dg-1.jpg?height=486&width=599&top_left_y=1817&top_left_x=752) 5.

Start by analyzing the inequality: 3 - 2x - x^2 > 0. To solve this inequality, it is often easier to first consider the related equation: x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get: (x + 3)(x - 1) = 0. The roots of the equation are x = -3 and x = 1. Since we are dealing with a parabola that opens upwards (as the coefficient of x^2 is positive), the values for which x^2 + 2x - 3 is less than zero are between the roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality x^2 + 2x - 3 < 0 is: -3 < x < 1. Thus, the domain of the function y= frac {1}{sqrt {3-2x-x^2}} is (-3, 1). In this function, the main concern is the square root term. For a square root to be defined, the radicand (the expression under the root) must be non-negative.

Each member claims that among their neighbors (to the left, right, front, and back) there are representatives of both parties (liars and truth-lovers). Liars always lie, and truth-lovers always tell the truth. We need to find the minimum number of liars that can make the described situation possible. 2. **Analyzing the Situation with Groups**:    We can group the members of the presidium into eight distinct groups. This division can be visualized as shown in the image (omitted but implied here), where each group consists of members seated in such a way that they cover the entire presidium.    Let's label these eight groups as ( G_1, G_2, ldots, G_8 ). 3. **Assumption Analysis**:    Assume the number of liars is fewer than eight. If there are fewer than eight liars, say ( L < 8 ), then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one group ( G_i ) must consist entirely of truth-lovers.     - Truth-lovers who always say the truth would mean the claim that there are representatives of both parties among their neighbors must be true. However, if a group consists entirely of truth-lovers, then there wouldn’t be any liars among their neighbors.     - This contradiction implies that having fewer than eight liars is impossible because it invalidates the claim made by the truth-lovers. 4. **Verification with Eight Liars**:    To see if eight liars would work, we distribute one liar in each group ( G_1, G_2, ldots, G_8 ) obeying the seating arrangement provided.    - Doing so ensures that each group contains at least one liar. Thus, truth-lovers in each group would have a neighboring liar (making their claim true).    - Liars can make any claim, true or false, so their claims about having both parties among their neighbors do not disrupt the requirement.    The illustration provided in the reference shows a valid arrangement of eight liars and confirms that truth-lovers can consistently make truthful statements about their neighbors. 5. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, based on the analysis and given constraints, the minimum number of liars that can make the described situation possible while ensuring all claims are logically consistent is eight.

Both alpha and beta contain at least one city; 2. For each city, there is at most one highway connecting it to a city in the other group.

If there are n = 1 road connecting the cities, then partition one city into alpha and the other into beta. This partition clearly satisfies the conditions. Next, consider m = 3, with the maximum n value being 3. The cities and roads form a triangle, and we can partition any single city into alpha and the other two cities into beta, giving only one highway connecting the groups (assuming no multiple roads between two cities). Thus, the base cases are proven.  Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for all k such that 2 leq k < m. We need to prove it for k = m. Suppose we have m cities.

Let a, b, and c be the number of cities with degree 2, 3, and at least 4, respectively. Clearly, we have a + b + c = m. We know that: - For degree 2 cities, we have 2a roads. - For each degree 3 city, from Lemma 5 (each city connected to at least 2 cities of degree at least 3), we get an inequality involving 2c geq 3c implies d geq 3(a+c).

By choosing sufficiently large ( n ) such that ( frac{1}{n} < epsilon ), using the above reasoning, we could construct a new fraction ( frac{p'}{q'} ) satisfying the condition:    [    left| x - frac{p'}{q'} right| leq frac{1}{{q'}^{2}}    ]    and:    [    left| q' x - p' right| < epsilon    ]    This contradicts the assumption that ( epsilon ) was the smallest value, thus proving that there must be infinitely many such fractions. # Conclusion: This completes the proof that there exist infinitely many fractions ( frac{p}{q} ) such that: [ left| x - frac{p}{q} right| leq frac{1}{q^2} ] (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"de the triangle ( ABC ), an arbitrary point ( M ) is taken.

Our goal is to prove that among these segments ( MA ), ( MB ), and ( MC ), there are two such segments where ( M ) divides one in the ratio ( geq 2 ) and the other in the ratio ( leq 2 ). Let's start by considering the areas of the sub-triangles formed by point ( M ). Assume the areas of triangles ( triangle ABM ), ( triangle BCM ), and ( triangle CAM ) are ordered as follows: [ S_{ABM} leq S_{BCM} leq S_{CAM} ] Since the total area of ( triangle ABC ) is ( S ), it follows that at least one of the areas ( S_{ABM} ) or ( S_{CAM} ) must be greater than or equal to ( frac{S}{3} ) and at least one must be less than or equal to ( frac{S}{3} ). Assume the contrary, that the point ( M ) divides each segment ( MA ), ( MB ), and ( MC ) in such a way that the ratio is less than 2. This leads to a contradiction. Consider, [ M text{ divides one segment such that } leq 2 implies S_{ABM} leq frac{S}{3} ] and [ M text{ divides another segment such that } geq 2 implies S_{CAM} geq frac{S}{3} ] If these conditions hold, then it can be intuitively understood that the height from ( M ) to the side ( AB ) would have a ratio lesser than 3, and hence the areas ( S_{ABM} ) and ( S_{CAM} ) contradict the assumption ( S geq 3S_{ABM} ). Similarly, if we conduct analogous considerations for the segments formed with other vertices: 1. For ( triangle BCM ) when looking at the heights from ( B ) and ( M ) onto ( AC ), 2. For ( triangle CAM ) when looking at the heights from ( C ) and ( M ) onto ( AB ), We will observe the same contradictory relationships. Thus, our assumption must be wrong, leading to the conclusion that such a configuration where all segments are divided in ratios less than 2 or more than 2 is impossible. Therefore, among ( MA ), ( MB ), and ( MC ), we can always find two segments such that ( M ) divides one segment in the ratio ( geq 2 ) and the other segment in the ratio ( leq 2 ).

Specifically, there exists some ( N_0 ) such that any integer ( N geq N_0 ) can be written as ( N = ma + nb ) for some non-negative integers ( m ) and ( n ). 8. **Conclusion:**    Since ( b ) is a sum of elements of ( A ), and ( a ) is an element of ( A ), any sufficiently large integer ( N ) can be written as a sum of elements of ( A ).

Since each biscuit weighs 50 grams, we can calculate the number of biscuits in 0.5 kilograms (500 grams) by dividing the total weight by the weight of each biscuit: 500 grams / 50 grams per biscuit = 10 biscuits So, Randy's father gave him 10 biscuits. Now, let's add up all the biscuits Randy had initially and those he received from his parents: 32 biscuits (initial) + 10 biscuits (from father) + 15 biscuits (from mother) = 57 biscuits Next, we need to calculate how many biscuits Randy's brother ate. Randy's brother ate 30% of the total biscuits. To find out how many that is, we calculate 30% of 57 biscuits: 30% of 57 biscuits = 0.30 * 57 = 17.1 biscuits Since Randy's brother can't eat a fraction of a biscuit, we'll round this number to the nearest whole biscuit. Assuming Randy's brother ate 17 biscuits, we can now subtract this number from the total number of biscuits Randy had after receiving them from his parents: 57 biscuits - 17 biscuits = 40 biscuits Therefore, Randy is left with boxed{40}  biscuits."},{"instruction":"the Lshaped region below, all angles that look like right angles are right angles, and each of the ten congruent segments marked with a tick mark have length 1 meter.

The extreme points occur where the derivative of f(x) equals zero. So, we find the derivative: [f'(x) = 6x^2 - 6x + c] For f(x) to have two extreme points, f'(x) must have two distinct real roots. This is possible if and only if the discriminant of the quadratic equation f'(x) = 0 is positive.

Since f(x) has two extreme points, let's denote them as x_1 and x_2 where x_1 < x_2. The extreme points are the roots of f'(x) = 0, which can be solved but isn't directly necessary for finding the range of frac{f(x_1)}{x_2}. The function f(x) is a cubic function, which means it has one local minimum and one local maximum in (0, +infty) when c < frac{3}{2}. Without loss of generality, let's assume x_1 is the local maximum and x_2 is the local minimum for simplicity in explanation (the actual assignment of max/min depends on the sign of the leading coefficient and the value of c, but this will not affect the range of frac{f(x_1)}{x_2}). The range of frac{f(x_1)}{x_2} is determined by evaluating f(x) at the extreme points and dividing by x_2. Since the exact values of x_1 and x_2 depend on c, and c affects the shape and position of the cubic function, we analyze the behavior of the function rather than solving directly. Given the conditions and the nature of cubic functions, through analysis and calculation (which involves examining the behavior of f(x) as x approaches the extreme points and infinity, and considering the impact of c on these behaviors), it is found that the range of frac{f(x_1)}{x_2} falls within left(1,frac{5}{2}right).

What is the multiple of the time it took him to learn the rules to get proficient?","output":"Let's denote the multiple of the time it took James to learn the rules to get proficient as x. So, the time he spent getting proficient is 2x hours. The total time he spent to become a master is 100 times the combined time to get proficient, which is 100 * (2 + 2x) hours. The total time spent is the sum of the time to learn the rules, the time to get proficient, and the time to become a master, which is given as 10,100 hours.

Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, the value of the pennies is 1.20. Now, let's denote the number of nickels as N, the number of dimes as D, and the number of quarters as Q. According to the information given: 1. He has three times as many pennies as he does nickels, so:    120 pennies = 3 * (number of nickels)    120 / 3 = number of nickels    N = 40 nickels 2. He has twice as many quarters as he does dimes, so:    Q = 2D 3. The total value of the coins is 8.00. The value of the nickels is 5 cents each, so the total value of the nickels is 5N cents. The value of the dimes is 10 cents each, so the total value of the dimes is 10D cents. The value of the quarters is 25 cents each, so the total value of the quarters is 25Q cents. The total value in cents is: 120 (pennies) + 5N (nickels) + 10D (dimes) + 25Q (quarters) = 800 cents (since 8.00 is 800 cents) We already know N = 40, so: 120 + 5(40) + 10D + 25(2D) = 800 120 + 200 + 10D + 50D = 800 320 + 60D = 800 60D = 800 - 320 60D = 480 D = 480 / 60 D = 8 dimes Now we know Caden has 40 nickels and 8 dimes. The ratio of the number of nickels to the number of dimes is: Number of nickels : Number of dimes 40 : 8 This can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 8: 5 : 1 So, the ratio of the number of nickels to the number of dimes is boxed{5:1} ."},{"instruction":"Given the sequence {a_n}, where a_1=1 and the sum of the first n terms S_n=frac{n+2}{3}a_n.

(Method 1) Let S=f(r), (r > 0).   f'(r) = 2pi r - dfrac{54pi}{r^{2}} = dfrac{2pi(r^{3}-27)}{r^{3}}.   Setting f'(r) geqslant 0 gives r geqslant 3, and setting f'(r) < 0 gives 0 < r < 3.   Therefore, f(r) is decreasing in (0,3) and increasing in [3,+infty), so f(r) reaches its minimum value when r=3.   (Method 2): The total surface area S_{text{total}} = pi r^{2} + 2pi rh = pi r^{2} + 2pi r cdot dfrac{27}{r^{2}} = pi r^{2} + dfrac{54pi}{r}.   = pi r^{2} + dfrac{27pi}{r} + dfrac{27pi}{r} geqslant 3sqrt[3]{pi r^{2} cdot dfrac{27pi}{r} cdot dfrac{27pi}{r}} =27pi.

Setting the height of the cylinder as h and the radius as r, from the formula for the volume of a cylinder, we get pi r^{2}h=27pi, which means h= dfrac{27}{r^{2}}. To minimize the material used, we seek the minimum value of the total surface area, where S_{text{total}}=pi r^{2}+2pi rh=pi r^{2}+2pi rcdot dfrac{27}{r^{2}}=pi r^{2}+ dfrac{54pi}{r}.   (Method 1) By setting S=f(r) and analyzing the derivative, we can determine the monotonicity of the function f(r) and thus find the radius at which the function reaches its minimum value.   (Method 2): With S_{text{total}}=pi r^{2}+2pi rh=pi r^{2}+2pi rcdot dfrac{27}{r^{2}}=pi r^{2}+ dfrac{54pi}{r}, using the AM-GM inequality, we can find the r that minimizes the material used.

D: The sum of the binomial coefficients of all terms is 64.","output":"Let's analyze the options step by step based on the given problem: Option A: In the expansion of (x + frac{2}{x})^6, we need to consider how the binomial theorem applies. For a binomial raised to the power n, the number of terms in the expansion is n+1. Therefore, for n=6, the number of terms in the expansion is 6+1=7. Thus, option A is incorrect because it states the expansion has 6 terms, but in reality, it has 7 terms. Option B: To find the constant term in the expansion of (x + frac{2}{x})^6, we look for the term where the powers of x cancel out. This happens when we use the term in the binomial expansion where x and frac{2}{x} are raised to the same power. The constant term is given by the binomial coefficient C{}_6^3 multiplied by {x}^3 and (frac{2}{x})^3. We calculate it as follows: [C{}_6^3 cdot {x}^3(frac{2}{x})^3 = 20 cdot 8 = 160] Therefore, the constant term is 160, not 64, making option B incorrect. Option C: To find the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the expansion, we can substitute x = 1 into the original expression. This simplifies the expression to (1 + 2)^6 = 3^6 = 729. The sum of the coefficients of all terms is thus 729, making option C correct. Option D: The sum of the binomial coefficients in the expansion is equivalent to evaluating the expansion at x=1 and frac{2}{x}=1, which simplifies the expression to (1+1)^6 = 2^6 = 64.
