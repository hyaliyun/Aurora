This will help him make a connection between you and good things, but, in particular, it will reinforce that good things happen when he isn't exhibiting shy behavior. This is called positive reinforcement, and it is very effective and highly recommended for shy dogs. Be sure to accompany treats with praise. If you notice your dog is shy around other dogs, find a very friendly and easygoing dog with whom to socialize your dog. Introduce the two dogs very briefly at first—at a distance—and monitor the interaction on leashes. Re-introduce the dogs daily, building up the time spent together. Consider positive progressive agility or obedience training as another good place to meet new dogs and situations. There are several ways to build trust with dogs who have experienced past trauma, which is important to helping your dog stop exhibiting shy behavior. If you have a dog that is showing signs of trauma, do your best to build trust with the dog to minimize shyness. Trauma can result from many different circumstances, including mistreatment or abuse, time spent living feral, or even life in a so-called puppy mill, where the dog may be bred repeatedly but not receive love from humans. Speak calmly, but do not pet the dog.  Allow the dog time to adjust to his surroundings. He may mark territory — even inside — but be patient and careful with discipline.  Traumatized dogs may benefit from having a quiet place all to themselves indoors. If you have other pets, you should expose the traumatized animal to them carefully, but make sure the quiet space is off-limits to other pets. Desensitize traumatized dogs to individuals they are shy around by having those people feed and play with him or her while you ignore the dog.

Background: One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6]  Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7]  With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7]  Paragraph: Town A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B took them to an ecological site where they wouldn't affect ground water and spread disease.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which town is experiencing less bad odor?","output":"Based on the provided information, Town B is likely experiencing less bad odor. This is because Town B has been disposing of their biomedical waste at an ecological site designed to properly handle such waste, rather than a regular dump site like Town A. The proper disposal at an ecological site helps prevent contamination of groundwater and the spread of diseases, which could lead to health hazards that cause bad odors. In comparison, Town A's conventional disposal method in a regular dump site is more likely to contribute to negative impacts, such as mosquitoes and bad odors, due to the potential blockage of the drainage system and subsequent flooding in the streets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is a premise: If the firm has not made a sound business case, or has been unable to deliver on one or more of the business case factors, it faces a very real prospect of failure-the customer may walk away. Here is a hypothesis: The firm might fail if it can't show stockholders that it performs well. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"In order to determine if the conclusion is true, we must analyze the premise and the hypothesis separately, and then examine their relationship. Premise: \\"If the firm has not made a sound business case, or has been unable to deliver on one or more of the business case factors, it faces a very real prospect of failure-the customer may walk away.\\" In this premise, we can understand that the firm's likelihood of failing is contingent upon its ability to make and execute a sound business case. The consequence of not doing so is that customers (who provide revenue and profits for the firm) might decide to leave, negatively impacting the firm's performance. Hypothesis: \\"The firm might fail if it can't show stockholders that it performs well.\\" In this hypothesis, we see a potential cause of failure for the firm is the inability to demonstrate strong performance to its stockholders. Stockholders, unlike the customers mentioned in the premise, are investors in the firm and have a vested interest in the company's performance. If a firm's performance is poor, stockholders might lose confidence, leading to a decrease in stock prices or reluctance to continue supporting the firm, which could consequently lead to failure. Now let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise mainly deals with the firm's ability to make and deliver a sound business case to maintain its customer base, whereas the hypothesis focuses on the importance of showing strong performance to stockholders. Both factors are crucial for the firm's overall success, but they target different audiences (customers vs. stockholders) and there isn't a direct causal relationship between them. However, it is important to consider that there could be some overlap between the premise and the hypothesis. A sound business case might assist the firm in demonstrating strong performance to stockholders, as a well-executed business case can lead to increased revenues, profitability, market share, or any number of factors that indicate success to investors. Conversely, if the firm were to suffer from customer attrition after neglecting its business case, such performance could be reflected in the company's stock prices, which stockholders would undoubtedly notice. In summary, while there isn't a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, there are indirect connections that could potentially link the two. If the firm's inability to make a sound business case results in poor financial outcomes and threatens its viability, it could also affect perceptions among stockholders, thereby leading to potential failure. However, it's essential to recognize that the premise and the hypothesis each contribute to different aspects of a firm's success and should be viewed through these separate lenses. As such, it would be overly simplistic to conclude that if the premise is true, so is the hypothesis. Both premises should rather be interpreted as components within a broader context of factors impacting the viability and potential for failure in a firm."},{"instruction":"Question: Who takes Jenny into a cave?

Yes, the statement \\"On 14 January 1858, an Italian refugee from Britain called Orsini attempted to assassinate Napoleon III with a bomb made in England.\\" is a good answer to the question \\"How did Orsini try to assassinate Napoleon?\\".  This answer provides the essential information related to the event, including the date of the assassination attempt (14 January 1858), the identity of the person attempting the assassination (Orsini, an Italian refugee in Britain), the target (Napoleon III), and the means by which the assassination was attempted (using a bomb made in England).  However, the statement could be expanded to provide a more thorough and detailed answer. For instance: On 14 January 1858, Felice Orsini, an Italian refugee and revolutionary who had sought asylum in Britain, attempted to assassinate Emperor Napoleon III of France. Orsini hoped that Napoleon's death would lead to a more favorable political climate for Italian unification, as Napoleon III was seen as an obstacle to the process. Orsini and his accomplices targeted Napoleon III as he and Empress Eugénie were on their way to the Paris Opera. To carry out the assassination attempt, they used devices known as \\"Orsini bombs\\" - a type of hand grenade specifically designed for the plot. These bombs were manufactured in England, reflecting Orsini's connections with the British radical movement. That evening, Orsini and his accomplices threw three bombs at Napoleon III's carriage as it approached the opera house. While the attack caused significant destruction, killing eight people, and injuring over a hundred, Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie narrowly escaped harm. Although the assassination attempt failed, it had important consequences. The incident strained relations between France and Britain due to the bomb's English origins, and it also served as a catalyst for increased French support in Italian unification efforts. Therefore, while the initial statement is a good answer to the question, the inclusion of additional details about Orsini's motivations, the method of attack, and the consequences of the assassination attempt can provide an even more comprehensive understanding of the event."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Would you eat a ready meal from the fridge rather than cook by yourself? Have you been doing Internet shopping rather than going to the stores? What can't you be bothered to do? A study into how lazy British people are has found more than half of the adults are so idle   that they'd catch the lift rather than climb two flights of stairs. Just over 2,000 people were quizzed by independent researchers at Nuffield Health, Britain's largest health center. The results were extremely surprising. About one in six people questioned said if their remote control was broken, they would continue watching the same channel rather than get up. More than one third of those questioned said they would not run to catch a bus. Worryingly, of the 654 respondents with children, 64% said they were often too tired to play with them. This led the report to conclude that it's no wonder that one in six children in the UK are classified as obese (very fat) before they start school. Dr Sarah Dauncey, medical director of Nuffield Health, said, \\"People need to get fitter, not just for their own sake, but for the sake of their families, friends and evidently (;) their pets too.\\" \\"If we don't start to take control of this problem, a whole generation will become too unfit to perform even the most fundamental tasks.\\" And Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, was shamed as the most idle city in the UK, with 75% questioned admitting they do not get enough exercise, followed closely by Birmingham and Southampton, both with 67%. The results bring serious challenges for the National Health Service, where obesity-related illnesses such as heart disease and cancer have been on a steady increase for the past 40 years and are costing billions of pounds every year. Question: How does the author convince the readers?

You are presented with the question \\"What can cause golf clubs to repel each other?\\" and the following answer choices:  - electrically  - friction  - layers of fat  - water  - fire  - repellant  - magnetism  - heat energy  Now knowing that magnetism can cause objects to repel each other and drop metal objects such as golf clubs, and backpacks, choose the best answer. Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What can cause golf clubs to repel each other?\\" is magnetism.  Magnetism is a fundamental force that occurs due to the motion of electric charges. It can attract or repel objects depending on the orientation of the magnetic fields. In golf clubs specifically, magnetism can play a role in repelling clubs when they contain ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, which respond to magnetic fields accordingly. However, it is important to note that not all golf clubs are made of ferromagnetic materials, and the overall magnetic effect would depend on the specific materials used in their construction. Let's analyze the other answer choices to understand why magnetism is the best answer: 1. Electrically: While electrostatic forces can cause objects to attract or repel each other based on their charge, golf clubs are not prone to accumulating significant electric charge, making this an unlikely cause for repulsion. 2. Friction: Friction is a force that resists the relative motion between two surfaces in contact. It does not cause objects to repel one another. 3. Layers of fat: Fat is not present in golf clubs and would not be a factor in repulsion. 4. Water: Water can create resistance when objects are submerged in it, but it does not inherently cause objects to repel one another. 5. Fire: Fire is a chemical reaction that generates light and heat energy. It is not responsible for causing objects to repel each other. 6. Repellant: Repellants can be applied to surfaces to prevent them from sticking together or minimize friction, for example, water-repellent coatings. However, they do not directly cause objects to repel each other. 7. Heat energy: Heat energy is a form of energy that flows between objects with different temperatures. Although it can result in the expansion of some materials, it would not cause golf clubs to repel each other in a typical scenario. As demonstrated, magnetism is the most plausible answer out of the provided choices, as it is a known force that can cause objects, including certain golf clubs, to repel each other. However, it is important to note that the repulsion effect would depend on the specific materials and construction of the golf clubs involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In mathematics, a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element. The operation satisfies four conditions called the group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operation, but the abstract formalization of the group axioms, detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation, applies much more widely. It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in abstract algebra and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects. The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.  Groups share a fundamental kinship with the notion of symmetry. For example, a symmetry group encodes symmetry features of a geometrical object: the group consists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other. Lie groups are the symmetry groups used in the Standard Model of particle physics; Point groups are used to help understand symmetry phenomena in molecular chemistry; and Poincaré groups can express the physical symmetry underlying special relativity.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: -  You inhale - Your diaphragm moves down - Your lungs have more room - Your lungs fill with air - You exhale - Your diaphragm moves back up - Carbon dioxide is exhaled The answer is:","output":"The final step of this process is the dispersion of the exhaled carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. To understand the entire breathing process in detail, let's break it down step-by-step: 1. Inhaling: The process begins with inhalation, which is the act of drawing in air and oxygen through your nose and mouth into your respiratory system. This is done by expanding your ribs and contracting your diaphragm – a dome-shaped muscle located at the base of your lungs. 2. Diaphragm movement: As you inhale, the diaphragm moves downward, increasing the volume of your thoracic cavity (the space in your chest). This movement creates a vacuum, leading to a decrease in pressure within your lungs. 3. Lungs have more room: With the diaphragm contracted and moved downward, your lungs have more space to expand. This increase in volume facilitates the flow of air into the lungs. 4. Lungs fill with air: As air flows into your lungs, it moves through your trachea and branches out into smaller and smaller airways called bronchi and bronchioles. Eventually, the air reaches tiny air sacs called alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. 5. Exhaling: After oxygen has been absorbed in the alveoli, your body prepares to exhale. During this process, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles (muscles between the ribs) relax, causing the lungs to contract and decrease in volume. 6. Diaphragm moves back up: As a result of this contraction, the diaphragm moves back upward into its original position, further compressing the lungs and exerting pressure on the air inside. 7. Carbon dioxide is exhaled: With increased pressure in the lungs, your body releases carbon dioxide – a waste product generated from cellular respiration – through the same airways it entered. The carbon dioxide eventually exits your body through your nose and mouth as you exhale. 8. Carbon dioxide dispersion (final step): The exhaled carbon dioxide disperses into the atmosphere, and the entire process repeats itself. In essence, the final step of this process is the dispersion of the exhaled carbon dioxide into the air, which maintains the gaseous balance, ensures proper functioning of bodily processes, and sustains life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat.

The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers.

Lovecraft, with notable direct references to The Shadow Over Innsmouth and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus.  It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \\"Fade to Black\\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \\"One\\" on ...And Justice for All.\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of \\"Leper Messiah\\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told.

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (English:  chy-KOF-skee; Russian: Пётр Ильи́ч Чайко́вский, tr. Pyótr Ilʹyích Chaykóvskiy, IPA: [pʲɵtr ɪlʲˈjitɕ tɕɪjˈkofskʲɪj] (listen); 7 May 1840 [O.S. 25 April] – 6 November [O.S. 25 October] 1893), was a Russian composer of the romantic period, whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity...

Tweet:back is in total bits today : can barely move  why why why","output":"The sentiment of the given tweet appears to be negative.  There are a few key factors contributing to this negative sentiment. 1. The person is describing a physical ailment or discomfort they are experiencing. The phrase \\"back is in total bits today\\" implies that the person is suffering from severe back pain. Back pain usually leads to a negative emotional state, as it can hinder one's movement, limit daily activities, and significantly affect their quality of life. 2. The use of an emoticon \\":\\" at the end of the tweet indicates disappointment or unhappiness from the writer. Emoticons are often used to express emotions, and this particular symbol usually denotes a negative sentiment. 3. The repetition of the word \\"why\\" emphasizes the frustration and confusion the person is feeling in response to their physical discomfort. This adds to the overall negative tone of the tweet, as it creates the impression that the person is seeking reasons for their suffering, which they evidently cannot find. 4. The phrase \\"can barely move\\" mirrors the writer's helplessness and conveys physical limitation, which further enhances the negative sentiment of the tweet. In summary, the tweet reflects a negative sentiment due to a combination of the writer's physical pain, emotional frustration, and a sense of helplessness. This sentiment is reinforced by the choice of words and the inclusion of an emoticon, which together create a gloomy and unhappy tone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Story of the World's Most Famous Disco . In the mid to late 1970s, disco music was king and everyone enjoyed going to the clubs and dancing the night away.  In this story of New York's world-famous Studio 54, the story is told through the eyes of Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe), a young man from New Jersey who manages to get onto the guest list and into the very exclusive club.  A gas station attendant by day, Shane soon finds himself as one of the regulars and manages to secure himself a job at the club as a bus boy/bartender.    Shane befriends two of the club's workers, Greg Randazzo (Brechin Meyer) and his wife Anita (Salma Hayek).  They invite Shane to move in to their apartment, but Greg soon suspects that Shane and Anita are having an affair.  Shane actually has fallen for Julie Black (Neve Campbell), another regular.  A soap opera star, Shane is intrigued by her beauty and is immediately drawn to her.  After a while, the two begin a relationship.    Meanwhile, Steve Rubell, played magnificently by Mike Myers, has been laundering money from the club.  Each night, he sends bags full of money out with the trash to be picked up and taken away, out of sight of the I.R.S.  This scam goes on for quite some time until finally the I.R.S. finds out about Rubell's operation and raids the club.    Shane, spurned in the end by Julie, eventually leaves 54 to become a college student and restaurant manager.  Steve Rubell is sentenced to 18 months in prison and is forced to sell 54 in a plea agreement. He is allowed to remain as a \\"consultant\\" to the new ownership, and he also throws a big party at the club's re-opening, attended by Shane, Greg, and Anita.    Studio 54 was indeed the king of the discos.  Celebrities from all over the world, including Andy Warhol and Truman Capote, were regular visitors to the club.  The music was loud, and sex and drugs were freely available. Unfortunately, 54 never really regained its prominence after its re-opening, and it closed down for good in 1986.  Steve Rubell died in 1989 at age 45.      This movie does an excellent job of showcasing the very famous club, right down to the throngs of people who begged to get in each night.  The acting in the film is very good, but Mike Myers stands out above the rest.  His superb portrayal of the eccentric but troubled Steve Rubell is the highlight of the film.    Having grown up in the 70s, I remember reading about Studio 54 and what a fantastic place it was.  This movie shows both the bright and dark sides of the famous disco.  I recommend this movie highly.  If you're a child of the 70s like me, then you'll remember the disco music and the almost surreal essence that 54 had.

Does quartz pizoelectric effect reduce the electrons and hence reduce the mass of it over a period of usage? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"The two questions are not inquiring about the same information. They are discussing different topics. I'll address each question one by one. 1. Can voicemail work when there's no power? Step 1: Identify the factors affecting voicemail functionality Voicemail is a service that records and stores incoming voice messages when a user is unable to answer their phone. It relies on electricity, telecommunication networks, and data storage. Step 2: Determine the effect of power loss on each factor - Electricity: No power means electronic devices like smartphones, landline phones, and voicemail servers may not function. - Telecommunication networks: Power outages can affect communications infrastructure like cell towers and landlines if they have no alternative power source. - Data storage: Voicemail messages are typically stored on servers, which require electricity to function. Step 3: Assess the overall impact of power loss on voicemail functionality If there's no power and the necessary infrastructure isn't able to function due to this, voicemail will not work. However, in some cases, backup generators or batteries may provide temporary power to some components, allowing voicemail to continue functioning for a limited time during power outages. 2. Does the quartz piezoelectric effect reduce the electrons and hence reduce the mass of it over a period of usage? Step 1: Understand the piezoelectric effect in quartz The piezoelectric effect refers to the generation of an electric charge in response to mechanical stress (like pressure or vibration) in certain materials, including quartz. When quartz experiences mechanical stress, some of its electrons can be displaced, creating an electric potential across the material. Step 2: Analyze the effect on electrons and mass The piezoelectric effect involves a shifting of electrons within the quartz crystal, but it does not result in the material losing electrons. The electrons are still part of the material, they are simply displaced temporarily. Step 3: Conclude the impact on mass Since the piezoelectric effect does not lead to a loss of electrons, it does not reduce the mass of the quartz crystal over a period of usage. In conclusion, the two questions are discussing different topics: voicemail functionality during power outages and the piezoelectric effect's impact on quartz mass.

The justices on Monday unanimously reversed an appellate ruling that had blocked the execution of 67-year-old inmate Vernon Madison.      The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled that Madison is incompetent to be executed because he doesn’t understand his death sentence or remember what he did after suffering multiple strokes.      The Supreme Court said in an unsigned opinion that testimony shows Madison “recognizes that he will be put to death as punishment for the murder he was found to have committed.”      Madison was convicted in the 1985 killing of Mobile Police Officer Julius Schulte, who had responded to a domestic call involving Madison. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday removed an obstacle to Alabama's efforts to execute a convicted killer who is in declining health, ruling the inmate knows he will be put to death as punishment.      The justices unanimously reversed an appellate ruling that had blocked the execution of Vernon Madison, who was convicted of killing a police officer in 1985.      Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said his office would seek an execution date for Madison.      The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled that Madison, 67, is incompetent to be executed because he has suffered from strokes and doesn't understand his death sentence or remember what he did.      The Supreme Court said in an unsigned opinion that testimony shows Madison \\"recognizes that he will be put to death as punishment for the murder he was found to have committed,\\" even if he doesn't remember the killing itself.      The court noted that federal courts' review of Madison's case is constrained because of a 1996 law that was intended to limit federal judges' second-guessing of state court decisions. State courts upheld Madison's death sentence, and the Supreme Court, applying the 1996 law, said those decisions should be respected.      \\"Under that deferential standard, Madison's claim ... must fail,\\" the court wrote.      The justices have never ruled on whether someone who doesn't remember their crime can be executed.      Madison was convicted of killing Mobile police Officer Julius Schulte, who had responded to a domestic call involving Madison. Prosecutors said Madison crept up and shot Schulte in the back of the head as he sat in his police car.      Madison has been on death row \\"nearly half his life,\\" Justice Stephen Breyer noted in a separate opinion in which he renewed his call for the court to consider the constitutionality of the death penalty.      Attorneys from the Equal Justice Initiative who are representing Madison argued that his health declined during his decades on death row and that strokes and dementia have left him frequently confused and disoriented. The Equal Justice Initiative is a Montgomery, Alabama-based nonprofit organization that represents prisoners in need, including those on death row.      The appellate court in May halted Madison's execution seven hours before he was scheduled to die by lethal injection. A divided U.S. Supreme Court maintained the stay. ||||| The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled Alabama can execute a death row inmate who claimed to be mentally incompetent and was granted a stay in 2016.      Vernon Madison, 66, is one of Alabama's longest-serving death row inmates. He was convicted in the April 1985 slaying of Mobile police officer Cpl. Julius Schulte.      In May 2016, Madison was set to die by lethal injection, but hours after the scheduled execution the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling upholding a lower court's stay.      Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously reversed that decision, meaning Madison is competent and can be executed. \\"More than 30 years ago, Vernon Madison crept up behind police officer Julius Schulte and shot him twice in the head at close range,\\" the ruling states.      Madison faced a state competency hearing before his execution, where he claimed several strokes he recently suffered affected his mental status and made him unable to remember his crimes or remember that he was on death row. The trial court denied Madison's petition, and said the execution could proceed.      But then the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Madison was incompetent and he could not be executed.      \\"Testimony from each of the psychologists who examined Madison supported the court's finding that Madison understands both that he was tried and imprisoned for murder and that Alabama will put him to death as punishment for that crime,\\" Monday's ruling states.      The nation's highest court has never ruled in about executions involving someone who doesn't remember his crime.      Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in a dissenting opinion about the issues surrounding executions. \\"...we may face ever more instances of state efforts to execute prisoners suffering the diseases and infirmities of old age. And we may well have to consider the ways in which lengthy periods of imprisonment between death sentence and execution can deepen the cruelty of the death penalty while at the same time undermining its penological rationale.\\"      Madison was convicted and sentenced to death in both 1985 and 1990, but both times an appellate court sent the case back-- first for a violation involving race-based jury selection, and then based on improper testimony from an expert witness for the prosecution. In 1994, Madison was tried for a third time and convicted.      The jury recommended a life sentence, but the judge overrode the recommendation and sentenced him to death. Earlier this year, the state legislature threw out the judicial override law, but kept the rule allowing juries to send prisoners to death on a 10-2 vote.      Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said Monday in a press release, \\"Today's unanimous decision of the Supreme Court confirms the State's argument that Vernon Madison is competent to be executed for the murder he committed more than 30 years ago.\\"      He said, \\"The Supreme Court correctly overturned the federal appeals court ruling blocking Madison's execution on the grounds he did not remember the crime he committed due to health reasons. Accordingly, the State will pursue a new execution date as soon as possible...Hopefully, the Supreme Court's wisdom will continue to prevail and allow Alabama executions to go forward.\\"      Attorneys from the Equal Justice Initiative are representing Madison.      Angie Setzer, a lawyer who works with the program, said, \\"The U.S. Supreme Court expressly did not decide whether it is appropriate for the State of Alabama to execute Mr. Madison, rather the Court ruled that relief under the restrictions governing federal habeas review is not appropriate. We are reviewing next steps in light of this ruling.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"The US Supreme Court has unanimously reversed an appellate ruling and determined that Vernon Madison, a 67-year-old death row inmate in declining health, is competent to be executed, claiming he \\"recognizes that he will be put to death as punishment for the murder he was found to have committed\\", despite suffering from strokes and dementia. Previously, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Madison was incompetent to be executed as he did not understand his death sentence or remember what he did.

Their living room window is shattered by 125 miles an hour winds. Troy rushed to Donald and sat anxiously on the edge of his bed. He did his best to calm his mother, and she had to comfort him. Soon water was seeping into the single floor house. Quickly it rose from ankle level to leg level. At Donald's insistence, they pushed their way through the water --- now chest high --- toward the front door. When they fought their way into the living room, water rose to their chins.  It was a struggle for the boy and mother to stay afloat. In a total panic, desperate to hold on to something, Troy caught a curtain rod. She was breathing hard, shouting that she couldn't swim.

Yangon River -  The Yangon River (also known as Rangoon River or Hlaing River) is formed by the confluence of the Pegu and Myitmaka rivers and is a marine estuary that runs from Yangon(also known as Rangoon) emptying into the Gulf of Martaban of the Andaman Sea. The channel is navigable by ocean-going vessels and thus plays a critical role in the economy of Burma.The Twante Canal connects the Yangon River with the Irrawaddy Delta or Ayeyarwady Delta once known as 'the rice bowl of Asia'. Answer:","output":"The category for the text about the Yangon River is 'natural place'. This is the best-suited classification because the text primarily describes a geographic feature, the Yangon River. The Yangon River, also known as the Rangoon River or Hlaing River, is clearly a natural formation, as it is formed by the confluence of the Pegu and Myitmaka rivers. Also, the fact that it is a marine estuary that runs from Yangon and empties into the Gulf of Martaban of the Andaman Sea further qualifies it as a natural geographical feature. Thus, the noun phrase 'Yangon River' does not pertain to any of the other options such as company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work.  Furthermore, phrases like 'the channel is navigable by ocean-going vessels' and 'plays a critical role in the economy of Burma' do not change this classification, although they do highlight the river's importance to human activities such as transportation and economy. Basing on these attributes, we can sum it up that the Yangon River is a natural place that has been integral not only to the geographic landscape but also to various aspects of human life.  The other information about the Twante Canal connecting the Yangon River with the Irrawaddy Delta, once known as 'the rice bowl of Asia', further emphasises the river's significant role in the geography and agricultural economy of the region, all of which coalesce to reaffirm its categorization as a 'natural place'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - geology  - methodology  - biology  - taxonomy  A: A:","output":"The science that is concerned with naming and grouping organisms is called Taxonomy. Taxonomy is a branch of biology that deals with the classification, naming, identification, and description of organisms, both living and extinct, in an ordered manner. It primarily aims to organize and systematize the vast array of known organisms, making it easier for biologists and researchers to study and understand the complex relationships between them. In the process of classification, organisms are identified, named, and placed into various groups or taxa, based on their similarities and differences. Taxonomy was first proposed by Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish biologist, in the 18th century. He is often considered the \\"Father of Taxonomy\\" and developed the framework for the binomial naming system that we still use today. This system assigns a two-part scientific name to each organism, where the first part represents the genus and the second part represents the species. The primary basis of these names is Latin, allowing for universal communication among scientists worldwide. The classification and grouping within Taxonomy involve a hierarchical system comprising several levels, known as taxonomic ranks. These ranks include Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species. Each higher rank represents a more generalized category, whereas lower ranks represent more specific groupings. For example, species is the most specific rank, and every single species falls under a unique combination of genus, family, order, etc. There are different methods and approaches to the classification of organisms within Taxonomy. The traditional approach, known as phenetics, primarily focuses on morphological similarities and differences among organisms. In contrast, the cladistic approach relies on shared derived characteristics that reveal the evolutionary relationships between organisms. The use of molecular biology and genetics techniques like DNA barcoding and genomic analysis has added a new dimension to the field, allowing for more accurate identification and classification of organisms. Taxonomy not only helps in organizing and understanding the relationships between various organisms but also plays a crucial role in biodiversity conservation and evaluation. By identifying and categorizing organisms, it becomes easier for researchers to assess the impact of environmental changes, ecological interactions, and human activities on various species and ecosystems. This knowledge can then be used to inform conservation strategies and policies for the maintenance and preservation of global biodiversity. In summary, Taxonomy is the science concerned with naming and grouping organisms. It plays a vital role in understanding the relationships among different species and helps conserve biodiversity by providing a systematic framework for organizing the vast array of living creatures on Earth. Among the choices provided, geology refers to the study of the Earth and its processes, methodology is the study or set of methods used in a particular field, and biology is the broader branch of science that encompasses the study of life and living organisms, while taxonomy specifically deals with the classification and naming of these organisms."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: If two objects have the same mass, the object with the higher temperature has greater thermal energy.

Answer:","output":"The missing first step in this process is: \\"Blood enters the kidney via the renal artery.\\" This is the beginning of the process, as kidneys function to cleanse the blood of waste products and excess substances. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the steps: 1. Blood enters the kidney via the renal artery: This arterial blood is rich in oxygen and nutrients, but also carries waste products from metabolism.  2. Nephrons in the kidney filter the blood: Each kidney contains around a million tiny filtration units called nephrons. They are the functional units of the kidneys, removing waste substances from the blood, while keeping the things the body needs. 3. The waste that is filtered out mixes with water to form urine: Waste substances that were filtered out from the blood, such as urea and creatinine, along with excess ions and water, become urine.  4. Ureters carry urine out of the kidneys: Once formed, urine travels down the ureters, which are tubes that connect each kidney to the bladder.

Plot title: Oscar Movie plot: In the prologue, gangster Angelo \\"Snaps\\" Provolone promises his dying father (Kirk Douglas) that he will give up a life of crime, and instead \\"go straight\\". A month later, Snaps awakes at his mansion and begins his important morning. He has a meeting with several prominent bankers, as he hopes to donate a large sum of cash and join the bankâs board of trustees, thereby having an honest job and keeping his word to his father. Anthony Rossano, Snaps's young, good-natured accountant, arrives at the mansion and tells his boss that heâs in love, asks for a 250% raise, then tells Snaps the true love he speaks of is actually \\"Snaps's daughter.\\" Snaps is furious, does not want his daughter marrying Anthony and goes to talk to his daughter, Lisa. Lisa is the only child of Snaps and Sofia, a spoiled daughter whose dreams of seeing the worldâs great sights run into a roadblock because of her overly protective father. Wishing to move out of the house, she lies to her parents (at the suggestion of the maid, Nora) and claims to be pregnant. Snaps, believing the father to be Anthony (as he wants to marry \\"Snaps's daughter\\"), is shocked when Lisa says the father is Oscar, the former chauffeur who is now serving overseas in the military. Things get even more complicated when Anthony learns that Theresa, the woman he fell in love with, is not actually Snaps' daughter as she had claimed to be. Before Anthony can catch on, Snaps tricks him into agreeing to marry his actual daughter, Lisa, who is supposedly pregnant but without a husband.

Here are some reviews for a movie: 1. The film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits, headed by Christopher Plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil Uncle Ralph I've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work. 2. There's a bevy of hiss-worthy baddies to pick up the dramatic slack, beginning with Plummer's wonderfully nefarious Uncle Ralph. 3. Any film version of Nicholas Nickelby that casts Nathan Lane as theatrical impresario Vincent Crummles and Barry Humphries (in his Dame Edna drag incarnation) as Mrs. Crummles is clearly a Dickens of a departure from Masterpiece Theatre-dom. 4. McGrath's Nicholas Nickleby is never very complex, but it is snappy and entertaining in a way that feels true to Dickens' love of a ripping yarn. 5. Any movie that tries to cram an entire Dickens novel into just over 2 hours is destined to be imperfect. Nevertheless, writer/director Douglas McGrath makes a valiant effort that focuses on fun. 6. Although Nicholas Nickleby occasionally evidences a simplicity that resembles a Junior Scholastic production, the movie's enthusiasm is contagious. 7. A beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps Dickens evergreen: the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions. 8. The project honors [Dickens'] passionate voice, and the strong ensemble cast sees us through a few tonal shifts. 9. Armed with McGrath's apt Dickens distillation, the illustrious ensemble strain mightily and eventually salvage Nicholas Nickleby from the poor man's Heath Ledger at its center. 10. Tedious, plodding and unimaginative. What was the overall consensus about the movie?","output":"The overall consensus about the movie Nicholas Nickleby is generally positive, with most reviews praising various aspects of the film. The film is especially commended for its strong ensemble cast, including Christopher Plummer's performance as the complexly evil Uncle Ralph, as well as Nathan Lane and Barry Humphries' roles as the theatrical Crummles couple. The unique and creative cast choices were appreciated for their departure from the typical Masterpiece Theatre-style adaptations of Dickens' work. Moreover, the adaptation by writer/director Douglas McGrath is praised for its focus on fun and entertainment, capturing the spirit of Dickens' love for a ripping yarn. Although some reviews mention the challenges of fitting an entire Dickens novel into just over 2 hours, McGrath's efforts are acknowledged as valiant, with the movie's enthusiasm being contagious. The movie is considered an homage to Dickens' work, with a beguiling evocation of the emotions and passionate voice of the author, despite some tonal shifts and its occasional simplicity resembling a Junior Scholastic production. However, there are some negative reviews that mention the film as tedious, plodding, and unimaginative, most likely due to the adaptation's inherent limitations. In summary, the overall consensus of Nicholas Nickleby is mainly positive, with praise for its imaginative cast, entertaining nature, and Dickensian spirit, although there are a few detractors who felt it was not a perfect adaptation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In the Middle Ages, the Church and the worldly authorities were closely related. Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle (doctrine of the two kingdoms). The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way. Luther's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably. The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and, if necessary, to vote for his dismissal (Treatise On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call, install and dismiss teachers, as testified in Scripture; 1523). Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen (church elders, presbyters) in his representative church government. The Huguenots added regional synods and a national synod, whose members were elected by the congregations, to Calvin's system of church self-government. This system was taken over by the other reformed churches.

Between 1519 and 1523 there was a succession of heavy battles and smaller skirmishes, in the course of which many towns and villages were devastated. After futile sieges of the defences of Calenberg and Hildesheim by troops from Hildesheim or Brunswick as well as numerous trails of devastation and plundering by both sides against the civilian population, the two sides finally met on 28 June 1519 at the Battle of Soltau . The Hildesheim army scored an emphatic victory against the Brunswick-Welf troops, killing some 3,500 men and capturing one of their leaders, Eric of Calenberg, as well as many of the nobles. This signalled the end of the opening phase of the war. However, an appeal to the newly elected emperor, Charles V, who had a good relationship with Wolfenbüttel, saw the situation entirely reversed at a political level. The ruling imposed by Charles V provided for the surrender of all conquered territory and release of all the prisoners, and thus ruled very much against the Hildesheim side. Because it was ignored by the bishop and his allies, the emperor's decision was followed in 1522 by the imposition of an imperial ban, the execution of which was assigned to the princes of Wolfenbüttel and Calenberg. Whilst Henry of Lüneburg had already gone into exile in France in 1520 having transferred the reins of power to his sons and in doing so keeping the Principality of Lüneburg out of the subsequent conflict, there were renewed military clashes between the Hildesheim prince-bishop and his opponents that were not finally resolved  until the so-called 'field peace'  of 15 October 1521. Hildesheim had won militarily, but lost politically.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials?  Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and...

(March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Chickens are being prepared for a meal. A chicken escapes, and an armed gang chases after it in a favela called the Cidade de Deus (\\"City of God\\"). The chicken stops between the gang and a young man named Rocket (BuscapÃ©), who believes the gang wants to kill him. A flashback traces Rocket, the narrator, back to the late 1960s. In the 1960s, the favela is a newly built housing project far from the centre of Rio de Janeiro, with little access to electricity and water. Three impoverished, amateur thieves known as the \\"Tender Trio\\" â Shaggy, Clipper, and Goose â rob and loot business owners; Goose is Rocket's brother. The thieves split part of the loot with the citizens of the City and are protected by them in return. Several younger boys idolize the trio, and one, Li'l Dice (Dadinho), convinces them to hold up a motel and rob its occupants. The gang resolves not to kill anyone and tells Li'l Dice to serve as lookout. They give him a gun and tell him to fire a warning shot if the police arrive, but an unsatisfied Li'l Dice fires a warning shot mid-robbery and guns down the motel inhabitants once the gang have run off. The massacre brings police attention, forcing the trio to split up: Clipper joins the church, Shaggy is shot by the police while trying to escape the favela, and Goose is shot by Li'l Dice after taking the thieving boy's money while Li'l Dice's friend Benny (BenÃ©) watches. Some years later in the 1970s, the favela has transformed into an urban jungle. Rocket has joined a group of young hippies. He enjoys photography and likes one girl, Angelica, but his attempts to get close to her are ruined by a gang of petty criminal kids known as \\"The Runts\\".

Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.  - Introducing The Beau Brummels is the debut album by American pop rock band the Beau Brummels. It was produced by Sly Stone, lead singer of Sly & the Family Stone. Unlike with most other debut albums of the era, ten of the twelve songs on this album are originals. The album peaked at number 24 on the U.S. \\"Billboard\\" 200 albums chart in 1965.  - Country rock is subgenre of popular music, formed from the fusion of rock and country. It was developed by rock musicians who began to record country-flavored records in the late-1960s and early-1970s. These musicians recorded rock records using country themes, vocal styles, and additional instrumentation, most characteristically pedal steel guitars. Country rock began with Bob Dylan and The Byrds, reaching its greatest popularity in the 1970s with artists such as Emmylou Harris, the Eagles, Michael Nesmith, Poco and Pure Prairie League. Country rock also influenced artists in other genres, including The Band, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, and George Harrison's solo work. It also played a part in the development of Southern rock.  - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs.  - The British Invasion was a phenomenon that occurred in the mid-1960s when rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom, as well as other aspects of British culture, became popular in the United States, and significant to the rising \\"counterculture\\" on both sides of the Atlantic. Pop and rock groups such as the Beatles, the Dave Clark Five, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, Herman's Hermits, and the Animals were at the forefront of the invasion.  - A disc jockey (abbreviated DJ, D.J. or deejay) is a person who mixes recorded music as it is playing. Originally, the \\"disc\\" in \\"disc jockey\\" referred to gramophone records, but now \\"DJ\\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any sources, including cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files on a CDJ or laptop. DJs typically perform for a live or broadcast audience, but DJs also create mixes that are recorded for later sale and distribution.  - Sal Valentino (born Salvatore Willard Spampinato, September 8, 1942) is an American rock musician, singer and songwriter, best known as lead singer of The Beau Brummels, subsequently becoming a songwriter as well. The band released a pair of top 20 U.S. hit singles in 1965, \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" and \\"Just a Little.\\" He later fronted another band, Stoneground, which produced three albums in the early 1970s. After reuniting on numerous occasions with the Beau Brummels, Valentino began a solo career, releasing his latest album, \\"Every Now and Then\\", in 2008.  - The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.  - \`\` Just a Little '' is a song by American rock group The Beau Brummels . The song is included on the band 's debut album , Introducing the Beau Brummels , and was released as its second single , following \`\` Laugh , Laugh '' . \`\` Just a Little '' became the band 's highest - charting U.S. single , peaking at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1965 . It also reached the top 10 of the charts in Canada and Australia . Written by guitarist Ron Elliott with frequent collaborator Bob Durand , the song was produced by Sylvester Stewart , later known as Sly Stone . A live version of the song recorded during a 1974 concert was released on the band 's 2000 Live ! album . \`\` Just a Little '' has been covered by such artists as The Young Rascals , Them , Nils Lofgren , The Smithereens , and Frank Black .  - Beat music, British beat, or Merseybeat (after bands from Liverpool and nearby areas beside the River Mersey) is a pop and rock music genre that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s. Beat music is a fusion of rock and roll (mainly Chuck Berry guitar style and the midtempo beat of artists like Buddy Holly), doo-wop, skiffle and R&B. The genre provided many of the bands responsible for the British Invasion of the American pop charts starting in 1964, and provided the model for many important developments in pop and rock music, including the format of the rock group around lead, rhythm and bass guitars with drums.  - Sly Stone (born Sylvester Stewart, March 15, 1943, Denton, Texas) is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer, most famous for his role as frontman for Sly and the Family Stone, a band which played a critical role in the development of soul, funk, rock, and psychedelia in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1993, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the group.  - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" is a song by American rock group The Beau Brummels, written by guitarist Ron Elliott and produced by Sylvester Stewart, later known as Sly Stone. Released in December 1964 as the band's debut single, the song reached number 15 on the U.S. \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 chart the following February. \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" was the first hit single to come out of the emerging San Francisco music scene in response to the British Invasion.  The song was later included on the band's first full-length album, \\"Introducing the Beau Brummels\\", released in April 1965.   - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.  - Autumn Records was a 1960s San Francisco-based pop record label. Among the notable acts on its roster was The Beau Brummels, a band who released a pair of top 20 singles, \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" and \\"Just a Little\\".  - The Beau Brummels were an American rock band. Formed in San Francisco in 1964, the band's original lineup included Sal Valentino (lead vocals), Ron Elliott (lead guitar), Ron Meagher (bass guitar), Declan Mulligan (rhythm guitar, bass, harmonica), and John Petersen (drums). They were discovered by local disc jockeys who were looking to sign acts to their new label, Autumn Records, where Sylvester Stewartlater known as Sly Stoneproduced the group's early recording sessions. Initially, the band's musical style blended beat music and folk music and typically drew comparisons to the Beatles, while their later work incorporated other music genres such as psychedelic rock and country rock.

While both sentences acknowledge that the subject believes in Tuppence's nobility, they differ in the subjects' willingness to express and share these thoughts with others. The first sentence communicates the subject's open admiration for Tuppence, while the second sentence reflects a more reserved perspective.

If the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved but the power is greatly reduced. If the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired.  The size of aperture that can be used also depends on the size and quality of the optics. To use a very small pinhole, one must use a focusing lens with a low f-number, and ideally the lens should not add significant aberrations to the beam. The design of such a lens becomes increasingly more difficult as the f-number decreases.  Paragraph: David needs to purchase a camera for his photography class.

This article: James Barton Longacre (August 11, 1794 – January 1, 1869) was an American portraitist and engraver, and the fourth Chief Engraver of the United States Mint from 1844 until his death. Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century. Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm.  He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844. In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre.  Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained.  Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict. In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece.  In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.  Longacre's coins are generally well-regarded today, although they have been criticized for lack of artistic... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who portrayed the leading men of his day?, what is it ?","output":"The last name of the person who portrayed the leading men of his day is Longacre.

Over the years, their bond had only grown stronger, fueled by their shared interests and unique quirks. As Christine picked up her blue pen, she thought about what news she had to share with Betty. She began her letter with the typical pleasantries, asking how Betty and her family were doing, and mentioning the latest in her own life. Slowly, she transitioned to writing about the most pressing issue at the moment -- the fundraiser event they were both planning for their local community center. Step by step, Christine detailed the progress they had made, including securing the venue, contacting sponsors, and organizing the event schedule. She made sure to praise Betty for her work on coordinating the volunteers and for her creativity in designing the event posters. On Betty's end, she carefully read Christine's letter with a smile on her face, feeling proud of what they had accomplished together. As always, she made sure her trusty eraser was nearby while she composed her response. With her pencil, she shared her excitement for the event and commended Christine on her exceptional organizational skills. Betty also provided updates on her own end and mentioned that the local newspaper wanted to interview both of them about their successful collaboration. Even though planning the fundraiser had been an enormous task, the best friends relished the opportunity to work together to bring something positive to their community. They knew that each idea they discussed, each decision they made, and every problem they solved, only deepened their friendship. As they exchanged letters over the coming weeks, their conversations stretched beyond the fundraiser, sharing personal anecdotes and stories of their daily lives. They wrote about their neighbors, their families, and even their pets. Each letter was a new chapter in their ongoing story, and an affectionate reminder of the special bond that connected them.

Bill, McQueen began studying acting in New York at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse. Reportedly, he delivered his first dialogue on a theatre stage in a 1952 play produced by Yiddish theatre star Molly Picon. McQueen's character spoke one brief line: \\"Alts iz farloyrn.\\" (\\"All is lost.\\"). During this time, he also studied acting with Stella Adler in whose class he met Gia Scala.  McQueen began to earn money by competing in weekend motorcycle races at Long Island City Raceway and purchased the first of many motorcycles, a Harley-Davidson and Triumph. He soon became an excellent racer, and went home each weekend with about 100 in winnings (equivalent to 900 in 2017). He appeared as a musical judge in an episode of ABC's Jukebox Jury, that aired in the 1953-1954 season.  McQueen had minor roles in productions including Peg o' My Heart, The Member of the Wedding, and Two Fingers of Pride. He made his Broadway debut in 1955 in the play A Hatful of Rain, starring Ben Gazzara.  In late 1955, at the age of 25, McQueen left New York and headed for California, where he moved into a house on Vestal Avenue in the Echo Park area, seeking acting jobs in Hollywood. When McQueen appeared in a two-part television Westinghouse Studio One presentation entitled The Defenders, Hollywood manager Hilly Elkins (who managed McQueen's first wife, Neile) took note of him and decided that B-movies would be a good place for the young actor to make his mark. He landed his first film role in a bit part in Somebody Up There Likes Me, directed by Robert Wise and starring Paul Newman. McQueen was subsequently hired for the films Never Love a Stranger, The Blob (his first leading role) which depicts a flesh eating amoeba-like space creature, and The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery.  McQueen's first breakout role came on television. He appeared on Dale Robertson's NBC western series, Tales of Wells Fargo. Elkins, then McQueen's manager, successfully lobbied Vincent M. Fennelly, producer of the western series Trackdown, to have McQueen read for the part of bounty hunter Josh Randall in a Trackdown episode. McQueen appeared as Randall in the episode, cast opposite series lead and old New York motorcycle racing buddy Robert Culp. McQueen then filmed the pilot episode, which became the series titled Wanted: Dead or Alive, which aired on CBS in September 1958.  In 1971 McQueen starred in the poorly received auto-racing drama Le Mans. Then came Junior Bonner in 1972, a story of an aging rodeo rider. He worked for director Sam Peckinpah again with the leading role in The Getaway, where he met future wife Ali MacGraw. He followed this with a physically demanding role as a Devil's Island prisoner in 1973's Papillon, featuring Dustin Hoffman as his character's tragic sidekick.  In 1973 The Rolling Stones referred to McQueen in the song \\"Star Star\\" from the album Goats Head Soup for which an amused McQueen reportedly gave personal permission. The lines were \\"Star , star , star , star  star/ Yes you are, yes you are, yes you are/Yeah, Ali MacGraw got mad with you/For givin' head to Steve McQueen\\".  By the time of The Getaway, McQueen was the world's highest-paid actor, but after 1974's The Towering Inferno, co-starring with his long-time professional rival Paul Newman and reuniting him with Dunaway, became a tremendous box-office success, McQueen all but disappeared from the public eye, to focus on motorcycle racing and traveling around the country in a motor home and on his vintage Indian motorcycles. He did not return to acting until 1978 with An Enemy of the People, playing against type as a bearded, bespectacled 19th-century doctor in this adaptation of a Henrik Ibsen play. The film was never properly released theatrically.  His last two films were loosely based on true stories: Tom Horn, a Western adventure about a former Army scout-turned professional gunman who worked for the big cattle ranchers hunting down rustlers, and later hanged for murder in the shooting death of a sheepherder, and The Hunter, an urban action movie about a modern-day bounty hunter, both released in 1980.  In 1998 director Paul Street created a commercial for the Ford Puma. Footage was shot in modern-day San Francisco, set to the theme music from Bullitt. Archive footage of McQueen was used to digitally superimpose him driving and exiting the car in settings reminiscent of the film. The Puma shares the same number plate of the classic fastback Mustang used in Bullitt, and as he parks in the garage (next to the Mustang), he pauses and looks meaningfully at a motorcycle tucked in the corner, similar to that used in The Great Escape.  In 2005, Ford used his likeness again, in a commercial for the 2005 Mustang. In the commercial, a farmer builds a winding racetrack, which he circles in the 2005 Mustang. Out of the cornfield comes Steve McQueen. The farmer tosses his keys to McQueen, who drives off in the new Mustang. McQueen's likeness was created using a body double (Dan Holsten) and digital editing. Ford secured the rights to McQueen's likeness from the actor's estate licensing agent, GreenLight, for an undisclosed sum.  At the Detroit Auto Show in January 2018, Ford unveiled the new 2019 Mustang Bullitt. The company called on McQueen's granddaughter, actress Molly McQueen, to make the announcement. After a brief rundown of the tribute car's particulars, a short film was shown in which Molly was introduced to the actual Bullitt Mustang, a 1968 Mustang Fastback with a 390 cubic-inch engine and a four-speed manual gearbox. That car has been in possession of the same family since 1974 and hidden away from the public until now, when it was driven out from under the press stand and up the center aisle of Ford's booth to much fanfare.

In May, Indian food safety authorities banned the production and sale of Maggi amid claims they contained dangerously high levels of lead. The ban was overturned in the Bombay High Court in August. Nestle India's new boss, Suresh Narayanan, has told the BBC the tests which were carried out on the noodles were \\"highly unreliable\\". Nestle had to destroy 400 million packets of Maggi products and stop production in the wake of the tests. The product recall cost the company 67m (Â£44.5m). Filming on a remote Indian hillside last week, my colleague got a bit over-excited when she thought she'd glimpsed a packet of Maggi noodles in a cafe - like a  mirage in the desert. She was wrong. The ban applied there too. But when a product has 80% market share it's perhaps no wonder it resonates with so many people. Nestle India's marketing campaign over the last few months has been playing on that popularity - using lines like \\"We Miss You Too\\". Now we'll see if the brand's confidence in its customers is reciprocated as they get the chance to buy it once again. A company statement on Monday said it had been \\"a challenging period for the Nestle organisation and therefore, there is a feeling of satisfaction at bringing back Maggi noodles to the market\\". Mr Narayanan was brought in to handle the crisis from Nestle's unit in the Philippines and is the first Indian-born head of Nestle India in decades. He told the BBC the labs which tested the noodles \\"had not been accredited\\". He said that meant they could have been missing the right systems or people qualified to carry out such tests, as well as equipment. India's government is suing Nestle for 100m over allegedly misleading Maggi adverts, a case which Mr Narayanan said was based on bad tests. Fresh tests mandated by an Indian court found last month that the lead content in Maggi noodles was at a safe level. Nestle was also criticised for what was seen as a slow reaction to the crisis. Mr Narayanan, who took over at the start of August, said the company had not reviewed the sequence of events yet, but that during the crisis Nestle had been talking to the regulator. Nestle's efforts to get across its point of view \\"did not work\\" and \\"unfortunately, things went out of hand\\", he said. The company is planning a consumer helpline and says it will be more active on social media. What was that article about?","output":"This article is about Maggi noodles, which were banned in India because they were thought to have too much lead in them.

Ms Marion took her to several vets and ended up spending US10,000 (A13,598) to have Pearl placed in ICU, according to CBS North Carolina. To help their teacher, five of Ms Marion’s students set up a lemonade stand, complete with baked goods, to assist with medical costs. “We wanted to help Ms. Marion and Pearl,” one of the second-grade students said. They were able to raise US120 (A163) towards medical costs, a touching gesture which was admired by Ms Marion. The students raised US120 for Pearl's surgeries. (CBS North Carolina) “One of the major things I like to impart on them is being compassionate about animals and empathy and these girls have clearly proven that they’ve gotten my message,” Ms Marion said. A GoFundMe page for Pearl has raised over US5,000 (A6800) towards its US8,000 (A10,900) target.

And its delicious taste makes it popular with all members of the family as a beverage. Carrot juice is one of the richest sources of vitamin A that can be used in the daily diet. Lack   of vitamin A can cause dryness and damage to the skin, nails and hair. Drinking carrot juice to increase the vitamin A in the diet is said to be good for many parts of the body, including the bones and teeth. Drinking carrot juice is thought to be extremely helpful to the liver  , because vitamin A helps to clean the liver and reduce fat in it. And it is suggested that drinking carrot juice should be done regularly, rather than just from time to time. Drinking carrot juice is also thought to improve the eyesight because of the vitamin A in the juice. Lack of vitamin A can lead to night blindness, which can be very dangerous, especially when the person is driving a car. An easy way to find out if you are lacking in vitamin A is to walk from a bright room into a dark room. Your eyes may have some trouble in getting used to the change of light if you are lacking in vitamin A. How can you make carrot juice? Wash some carrots well in cold water.

The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat.

Born in Ireland, Saint Colman's early life is shrouded in limited historical information. However, his later life and contributions to the religious community have made him a venerated figure in the Roman Catholic Church. Colmán devoted his life to spreading the teachings of Christianity, while also living the life of a simple monk in the hallowed realms of monasteries. Recognized for his steadfastness and commitment to his faith, he played a crucial role in the Irish monastic movement. Consequently, this led to the establishment of several monastic institutions and the deepening of faith among the Irish people. One such monastery was at Kilroot, where Saint Colmán took charge as the spiritual leader and abbot. Under his guidance, the Kilroot monastery flourished as a center of spirituality and learning. Many individuals—both religious and secular—came to seek wisdom and knowledge under its roof. As an influential and well-respected figure, Saint Colmán is known to have interacted with several other saints and religious leaders of his time. They included the likes of Saint Ailbe, founder and first bishop of Emly, and Saint David, the patron saint of Wales. In the latter part of his life, Saint Colmán continued to dedicate himself to religious practices, including prayer, teachings, and caring for the spiritual needs of his fellow monks and laypeople. Ultimately, he passed away in Ireland, leaving behind a lasting impact on the religious ethos of the nation. Today, Saint Colmán is venerated in Roman Catholicism with his feast day celebrated on the 16th of October. His selfless contributions to the Church and unwavering dedication to his faith have inspired countless generations of believers. As a result, the legacy of Saint Colmán of Kilroot continues to be remembered and celebrated by those who cherish the values and teachings he embodied."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When he returned to Studio A on July 29, he was backed by the same musicians with Harvey Brooks on bass replacing Joe Macho and his producer had changed from Tom Wilson to Bob Johnston.

Brazil's starting striker Hulk has left the team's training session with an apparent muscle injury in his left leg. Hulk, who started alongside Neymar and Fred in the tournament opener against Croatia, practiced for less than 15 minutes on Sunday when he felt something in his leg and left the field. He was walking without a limp, but then sat down on a bench and lowered his head in apparent dismay. A few moments later, he went to the locker room accompanied by one of the team's doctors.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it.  I am facing a new situation today: Michael has become bored with his passive life style, and has decided to take up weight lifting as a hobby. He begins to exercise with weights several times a week. Michael's brother, Robert, isn't as motivated as Michael though. Robert decides to continue being mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who will increase the size of their muscles less? Answer:","output":"Based on the knowledge from the background article, Robert will increase the size of his muscles less compared to Michael. This is because Robert exercises with weights only every couple of months, which is not sufficient to maintain or build muscle strength and size. On the other hand, Michael has decided to take up weight lifting as a hobby and exercises with weights several times a week. This consistent and regular workout routine helps increase muscle size and strength. Remember the principle mentioned in the article \\"use it or lose it.\\" Michael's more active lifestyle will result in greater muscle development, while Robert's mostly inactive lifestyle will contribute less to muscle growth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which military leader had a spaniel called Rommel?","output":"British Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, also known as Monty, had a spaniel dog named Rommel. Montgomery was a prominent military leader during World War II, and he played a significant role in the North African campaign, commanding the 8th Army. He is best known for his victories at the Battle of El Alamein, the Normandy landings, and later on as an influential figure in the military during the final stages of the war, until his retirement in 1958. Naming his dog Rommel was quite an interesting choice on Montgomery's part since the name comes from German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, one of Germany's most respected and skilled military leaders during World War II. Erwin Rommel earned the nickname \\"Desert Fox\\" for his tactical prowess and strategic abilities in the North African theater, fighting against Montgomery's forces. The fact that Montgomery named his dog after his adversary in the North African theater is actually a subtle sign of respect and admiration for his enemy. This act showcased the mutual respect that military leaders may have for each other, even in the midst of conflict. At the same time, the gesture added a lighthearted and somewhat humorous aspect to their rivalry. Montgomery's spaniel, Rommel, accompanied him through many of his campaigns. The dog reportedly had access to Montgomery's personal aircraft and even took part in official meetings. Monty and Rommel's relationship also underlines the role played by pets during times of war by providing companionship, comfort, and emotional support to their military owners. In conclusion, British Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, a notable military leader during World War II, had a spaniel dog named Rommel, which he named after his respected adversary on the German side, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. This gesture of naming his pet after an enemy commander highlighted not just the camaraderie and mutual respect between rival military leaders but also served to remind us of the softer and more human side of such individuals. Furthermore, the bond between Monty and his spaniel Rommel portrayed the importance of pets as loyal companions during times of conflict and hardship."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The incident, on a flight from Barcelona to Stansted on Friday, was recorded by a fellow passenger and shared on social media.      Many people said Ryanair should have removed the man from the flight and threatened to boycott the airline.      Ryanair said it \\"will not tolerate unruly behaviour like this\\".      It has referred the matter to Essex Police.      'Loud and aggressive'      In the film - viewed on Facebook more than 1.8 million times - the man can be heard being racially abusive to the woman and threatening to \\"push\\" her to another seat.      He also shouts at her: \\"Don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow.\\"      After a flight attendant intervenes, the woman says she wants to sit with her daughter and tells the man he \\"stinks\\". She says of the passenger: \\"Kick him out\\".      Her daughter has told The Huffington Post the row started because her mother, 77, has arthritis and it took some time for her to move out of the way for the man to get into his seat.      David Lawrence, who filmed what happened, told BBC Radio 5 Live: \\"Everything was calm, we were getting ready to take off. And then a man came on board and arrived at his seat, then spoke very harshly to a woman sitting in the aisle seat.      \\"That was what got my attention as it was very loud and very aggressive. He started to shout at the woman, saying 'get out of the way', 'move your feet', 'you shouldn't be sitting here'.\\"      Image copyright PA Image caption Ryanair said it \\"would be taking the matter further\\"      Mr Lawrence said no attendants initially came over. The woman's daughter, who had been sitting elsewhere, arrived and \\"an argument started\\", he said.      \\"He pushed past the woman and went to his seat,\\" he said, adding that what's seen in the video then unfolded - describing it as the \\"most disgusting exchange of racial slurs and foul language\\".      The woman's daughter said she had taken her mother, a Windrush Generation migrant who came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s, on holiday to mark a year since the death of her husband.      She told The Huffington Post: \\"I know that if I was behaving like he was - or any other black person for that matter - police would have been called and we would have been kicked off the flight.\\"      She added: \\"Mum's really feeling upset and very stressed about this situation, on top of the grief she's already experiencing. As for me, I'm upset about the whole thing too - the fact that the passenger wasn't taken off the plane and how the situation was dealt with.\\"      'Horrible situation'      One young man, seated in the row behind the people filmed in the video, intervened by telling the man who was shouting to stop. He has been praised for his actions.      A Ryanair attendant says to the man: \\"Don't be so rude, you have to calm down.\\" He then tells the older man he is going to refer the incident to his supervisor, to which the man replies: \\"I'm alright.\\"      \\"I am so shocked,\\" Mr Lawrence said. \\"There was no response [from most other passengers]. No-one said anything. The young man who actually intervened... he was compelled to step forward.\\"      Mr Lawrence said it was a \\"horrible, horrible situation\\" and that he was \\"shocked\\" that Ryanair \\"allowed something like this just to go unchecked\\".      Shadow transport minister Karl Turner was among those to tweet about the incident, saying he would raise \\"the tendency of airlines to ignore this kind of behaviour\\".      He also said \\"he should have been removed from the flight and handed over to the police\\".      Critics of the incident and how it was handled said the man should have been removed - rather than the woman herself moving seats.      Ryanair told the BBC: \\"We operate strict guidelines for disruptive passengers and we will not tolerate unruly behaviour like this.      \\"We will be taking this matter further and disruptive or abusive behaviour like this will result in passengers being banned from travel.\\"      Essex Police said on Sunday: \\"This incident, which we were made aware of this morning, is believed to have taken place on a plane at Barcelona Airport.      \\"Essex Police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported. We are working closely with Ryanair and the Spanish authorities on the investigation.\\"      It asked anyone with information to call 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.      The Department for Transport said \\"everyone should be able to enjoy a safe and calm journey without their flight being spoilt by a disruptive minority\\".      The DfT said it would work with airlines and airports \\"to look at what more can be done to deal with disruptive passengers\\". ||||| David Lawrence had just settled into Seat 22F on a Ryanair flight Thursday when he heard a commotion brewing on the other side of the plane.      A few rows behind him, a gray-haired man with dark-rimmed glasses was yelling at a black woman seated along the aisle.      “I heard this man shouting at this woman, saying, ‘You’re in my way. Get out! I don’t want you here next to me!’ ” Lawrence told The Washington Post in a phone interview Sunday. “I couldn’t believe what I heard.\\"      Lawrence grabbed his phone and started to record the encounter, which took place before a scheduled flight from Barcelona to London Stansted Airport. By then, the woman’s daughter had come up and confronted the man.      \\"She said, ‘Who are you talking to? Don’t shout at her. That’s my mother; she’s disabled,’ \\" Lawrence recalled, noting that the woman’s mother had boarded the plane in a wheelchair. “He then was saying, ‘I don’t care.’ \\"      In the video, the man can be heard yelling back at the woman’s daughter as other passengers continue shuffling down the aisle. A male flight attendant with his back to Lawrence’s camera apparently attempts to calm the situation, to little effect.      “I tell you, I hope somebody sits there,” the man tells the woman in the aisle seat, gesturing toward the empty middle seat between them. “'Cause I don’t want to sit next to your— ...\\"      The rest of the sentence is unclear, though he appears to call her “sickly,” “fat” and “ugly. ”      The flight attendant then asks the woman whether she would like to sit elsewhere.      [How a flight diverted by the nor’easter became a 9-hour bus ride — and left two travelers hospitalized]      “Put her to another seat!” the male passenger shouts, before turning to the woman. “I tell you this. If you don’t go to another seat, I’ll put you to another seat!”      The woman says something back at him, prompting the man to retort angrily: “Don’t talk to me in a f--ing foreign language, you stupid ugly cow!” and then “ugly black bastard.”      Surrounding passengers had mixed reactions to the scene. One man, wearing a black T-shirt and sitting in the row directly behind them, physically tried to intervene, sticking his hand between the seats in front of him and telling the irate passenger to keep his voice down.      “Stop,” the man in the black shirt pleads. “There’s no need for that at all. Just stop. It’s really easy to close your mouth. ”      Lawrence, while recording the video, can be heard saying, “Throw him off the flight. Throw him off the flight. Get rid of him!”      Eventually, the woman asked to sit next to her daughter and, visibly fed up, started to move out of the row.      To his surprise, Lawrence said, the flight took off shortly afterward, with no apparent repercussions for the male passenger, who effectively enjoyed “extra leg room” in a row to himself.      “I thought the flight attendant was going to call someone and escort the man off the flight,” Lawrence told The Post. “They moved the woman instead of moving him. That was shocking to me.”      THIS IS THE Ryanair passenger that was ALLOWED to racially and physically abuse an elderly woman and then WALK AWAY... Posted by David Lawrence on Friday, October 19, 2018      Frustrated, he decided to upload his video to Facebook the following day.      “It was just so disturbing,” Lawrence said. “Because there was no response from the other passengers on the flight at the time, I thought, ‘Okay, well, somebody needs to know what happened here.’ That’s why I kept the video running and captured as much as I could.\\"      Over the weekend, the video garnered nearly 3 million views and has been shared tens of thousands of times. Lawrence later uploaded the video to YouTube, where it has more than 100,000 views.      Scores of commenters expressed outrage over how the matter was handled and demanded to know why Ryanair’s flight crew didn’t remove the male passenger before the plane took off.      Ryanair said in an emailed statement that they had reported the incident to Essex Police. \\"As this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further,” it said.      “We operate strict guidelines for disruptive passengers, and we will not tolerate unruly behavior like this,” Ryanair told BBC News. “We will be taking this matter further, and disruptive or abusive behavior like this will result in passengers being banned from travel.”      Essex Police confirmed to BuzzFeed News that it was investigating the matter and encouraged people with information to contact them.      “Essex Police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported,” the police department told the news site. “We are working closely with Ryanair and the Spanish authorities on the investigation. ”      Statement: We are aware of this video and have reported this matter to Essex Police — Ryanair (@Ryanair) October 21, 2018      On Monday, the woman, Delsie Gayle, told ITV that she and her daughter were returning from a vacation to mark the anniversary of the death of Gayle’s husband. The racist encounter has left her feeling depressed.      “I feel very low,\\" the 77-year-old retiree said. “He paid fare to go on holiday and and I paid mine so why does he abuse me due to the color of my skin?”      Gayle, who said she has not had contact with Ryanair since the incident, added that “He do it with me and he gets away, he’ll do it to somebody else.\\"      The woman’s unnamed daughter told HuffPost UK that her mother immigrated to Britain from Jamaica in the 1960s.      Lawrence, 56, told The Post that he spoke with the woman and her daughter after the flight and said they were both disappointed and disgusted. His parents also were part of the “Windrush generation,” immigrants who moved from the Caribbean to Britain from 1948 to 1971, so he said he could understand why the woman agreed to switch seats rather than escalate the situation.      “The racism they suffered on a daily basis is historic. Our parents have learned over the years — because they have never received any kind of justice — they’ve just learned to live with it,” Lawrence said. “They kind of have this attitude, like, ‘Well, what can we do?’ sort of thing. The lady was like, this has happened so many times. I just want to go home. ”      Lawrence has since posted multiple times about the incident on social media, urging people to put pressure on Ryanair for turning “a blind eye to racial discrimination.”      The airline’s acknowledgment of his video was hardly a sufficient apology, he said.      “It’s not good enough,” Lawrence said. “It certainly falls so short of what we expect an airline to provide for, in terms of protecting their customers. It’s shameful. It’s shameful. ”      Read more:      Limo involved in New York crash that killed 20 had failed prior inspection, records show      Boeing 737 flies into brick wall — and just keeps going      A man tried to board a flight wearing everything he packed. British Airways gave him the boot. ||||| An elderly black woman who was racially abused by a fellow passenger on a Ryanair flight is a Windrush generation migrant who was returning from a holiday to mark the anniversary of her husband’s death, her daughter has told HuffPost UK.      The woman’s daughter says she will never fly Ryanair again, and she believes that if it had been a black person behaving in that way “police would have been called and we would have been kicked off of the flight.”      In the shocking video, captured by fellow passenger David Lawrence, a man can be heard referring to Mrs Gayle, a 77-year-old pensioner from East London, as an “ugly black bastard”. He appears to be refusing to sit next to her and threatening to “push” her if she does not sit elsewhere.      The video begins with a noisy row over seating, in which Mrs Gayle’s daughter can be seen arguing loudly with the man. Moments later, when the elderly woman speaks with a Jamaican accent, the man replies “don’t talk to me in a fucking foreign language, you stupid, ugly cow.”      Eventually, Mrs Gayle is seen asking to be moved, while the man remains in his seat. He can then be heard telling the flight attendant, “I’m alright, now she’s gone.” Passengers can be seen intervening, with one asking for the elderly man to be taken off the flight.      The incident took place just before the flight - FR9015 - was scheduled to leave from Barcelona for London Stansted on Friday afternoon. Ryanair have now said the incident has been reported to Essex police. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"An elderly black woman was racially abused by a fellow passenger on a Ryanair flight. The incident occurred before the flight from Barcelona to London Stansted Airport, and the footage recorded by another passenger has gone viral on social media. The woman was a Windrush generation migrant, and she was returning from a holiday to mark the anniversary of her husband's death. Ryanair has reported the incident to Essex Police and said it does not tolerate unruly behavior. Some critics feel the airline mishandled the incident by moving the abused woman to another seat instead of removing the man from the flight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat so the mixture simmers. Cook the syrup until the sugar dissolves. Refrigerate this syrup till it's cold.  It will only take a few minutes for the sugar to dissolve and create a syrup. This should make about 1/4 cup of simple syrup. Always be careful when handling hot sugar syrup since it could burn you. Wash 1 1/4 cups of strawberries and cut off the stems. Put them in a blender with 2 tablespoons of your cold simple syrup. Blend the berries and syrup until you have a smooth strawberry puree. If you'd like to leave a few chunks of strawberry for your drinks, simply pulse the berries and syrup until you have the consistency you'd like. Transfer the strawberry puree to a tall serving pitcher. Add 2 1/2 ounces of freshly squeezed lime juice, 1 ounce of orange liqueur (like Triple Sec) and 2 ounces of tequila. Stir this mixture to combine it. Taste the mixture and add more simple syrup if you'd like it sweeter. Add ice to the pitcher and stir the margaritas to chill them. Or you can pour the margarita mixture into a martini shaker. Add ice to the shaker and shake the margaritas until the sides of the shaker are cold. Avoid letting the margaritas sit in the shakers with the ice too long. The ice will begin to melt and will dilute your drinks. Fill your glasses with crushed ice or ice cubes. Pour the margaritas into your glasses. This recipe should make two margaritas. Garnish the margaritas with thinly sliced limes or strawberries and serve them immediately. Have straws available for serving. Choose thin cocktail straws since this will make the drink last longer than if you use large smoothie-sized straws.

Here are the options:   A). yes  B). it is not possible to tell  C). no Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"C). no It is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise states that once a company buys a particular software, it becomes less likely to switch content providers. This suggests that, after purchasing a specific software, companies tend to stick with their current content provider, possibly due to the costs associated with switching, the potential benefits of maintaining a consistent relationship with an existing content provider, or the features and integrations offered by the software that encourage sticking with the same content provider. However, the hypothesis makes a more extreme assertion that there are no instances where a person would want to switch content providers. The premise does not provide enough information to conclude that there would never be any circumstances where someone would want to switch content providers. The two statements are not equivalent in their strength or scope – the premise provides a claim about companies' likelihood to switch content providers, while the hypothesis states an absolute assertion about people never wanting to switch content providers. There could be several reasons why a person might want to switch content providers, such as better pricing, better content quality, improved customer service, or innovative features from a competing content provider.

At the opening of his latest exhibition, Colorful World in the Eyes of Sean Chen, at the National Museum of China recently, the artist told his story. Chen left China for Australia in 1986 to seek artistic freedom, and like many new immigrants then, he had little money in his pocket. To make ends meet, he drew portraits of people in the street. Every day, he saw people buy ice cream from a shop. Chen couldn't help wondering: \\"It must taste great, that's why so many people buy it.\\" But he didn't buy one for himself because he had to save money to support his studies. After four months of painting there and watching people eat ice cream, Chen didn't resist the temptation --- he bought an ice cream. \\"The first bite took me to heaven,\\" Chen recalls while laughing. \\"You know, as a poor young man in a new country, an ice cream was too expensive then.\\" Since then, he kept the taste of the ice cream in his heart and included the happy feelings in his paintings, which turn out to be colorful and sweet. His current exhibition is part of his nationwide tour that began at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing in 2011. He plans to take his artworks to 24 cities around China by 2016. The exhibition at the National Art Museum of China will last until April 22. After the exhibition tour, he will sell his works through an auction , and all the money will be donated to protection of the environment in China. \\"The natural environment of New Zealand has inspired my artwork and brought me enjoyment.

Choice A may work as well, but it could potentially cause more damage to your skin. Here's a detailed process to safely remove a splinter from your palm based on the steps outlined in choice B: 1. Clean the area: Before attempting to remove the splinter, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. This will help prevent infection and reduce the risk of introducing more contaminants into the area. 2. Prepare the tools: Prepare a pair of fine-point tweezers and a sharp knife, such as a sewing needle or a pin. Sterilize the tips of these tools using rubbing alcohol or by holding them in a flame for a few seconds. 3. Inspect the splinter: Examine the splinter carefully to determine its size, depth, and direction. If it's a large splinter that's easily visible, you can use the tweezers and a sharp knife to remove it. If it's a smaller splinter lodged beneath the skin, you can use the tape method instead. 4. Removing the splinter:    a. For a large splinter:        i. Use the sharp knife or needle to gently open the skin around the splinter, if necessary. Make sure you don't push the splinter further into the skin.        ii. Carefully grasp the splinter with the tweezers, ensuring you have a secure grip on the splinter.        iii. Slowly and gently pull the splinter out in the direction it entered the skin. Don't pull against the direction in which the splinter entered, as this may cause it to break.        iv. Once the splinter is removed, clean the area with soap and water, and then apply an antibiotic ointment to prevent infection. Cover the wound with a non-stick sterile bandage.    b. For smaller splinters:        i. Cut a piece of duct tape or adhesive tape, large enough to cover the area with the splinter.        ii. Press the tape onto the affected area, ensuring it adheres firmly to the skin. Leave the tape on for about 5 minutes to allow it to adhere to the splinter.        iii. Remove the tape by quickly and firmly pulling it off in the direction opposite to which the splinter entered. This should lift the splinter out of the skin.        iv. Check the area to ensure the splinter has been removed. If it still remains, repeat the process or try the tweezers method.        v. Clean the area with soap and water, and apply an antibiotic ointment to prevent infection. Cover the wound with a non-stick sterile bandage if necessary. By following these steps, you should be able to successfully and safely remove a splinter from your palm without causing further damage or pain. Remember to monitor the wound in the following days to ensure it's healing properly and there are no signs of infection. If the wound doesn't heal or becomes infected, seek medical attention."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Think about healthy foods you like that can replace your past unhealthy comfort foods. Look up healthy recipe swaps for your favorite dishes so you won't feel so restricted. Eating something fried might taste good today, but it might not feel so good the next morning. Your stomach will start to feel full if you slow down as you eat. Have a conversation with someone, or put the fork down between bites, to allow your stomach to tell your brain you are getting full. Be aware of what you plan to eat, and read the nutrition labels to be sure you are eating what you planned. Some packaging can be misleading for marketing purposes, so looking at the nutrition label is essential. Some foods are more pleasant than others, no doubt. Take control of experiencing new foods by removing the words “I can’t eat that”, and instead say “I don’t eat that”. By changing how you talk about food, it puts you in control of choosing foods you do not routinely eat. Instead of talking about the foods you can no longer have, talk about all of the foods your are adding in like fruit, vegetables, lean proteins, etc. Shifting your mindset from restriction to addition can make a big difference. Eat breakfast, plan ahead so you know what you will eat when you get hungry, avoid over-eating which can happen when watching TV, and eat the healthy food choices first. Other routines that can help include eating smaller meals, or snacks, throughout the day instead of 3 larger meals. The scale can help you to tweak your plan if you need to, and to stay on track with meeting your goal. What you can see in your cabinet, or can easily reach for, may not always be the best choice. Keep fruit on the counter and chopped veggies in the fridge. Easy access to healthy choices can help avoid unhealthy snacking. Get rid of the cookies and ice cream. Having the tempting foods within reach can pull you away from your plan. Smaller plates can help with portion control, decreasing the number of calories you consume at mealtime. Always eat off a plate as opposed to out of a box, bag or carton. You can pre-portion out servings of snack foods and leave them in your pantry to prevent over eating from the container. Grocery stores also have a lot of pre-portioned options. People that get enough sleep burn up to 5% more calories at rest than people that do not get a good night’s sleep. Plus, getting the sleep you need increases the amount of fat you lose compared to people that sleep less than 6 hours each night. Life happens. Weddings, covered dish dinners, birthday parties, game-day snacks, or a night out on the town can all involve eating, or drinking, calories that are not in your plan.  Think about what you could have done differently, and plan ahead so you will be ready for those challenging events next time.  Avoid the \\"all or nothing\\" mentality. Just because you messed up once, doesn't mean you can spiral out of control and have anything else you want. It happened, move on and don't be so hard on yourself. Talking to your friends and family about your weight loss plan can help you stay focused on your goal. You may have a friend that will want to join you in losing weight. Support groups are also available that can provide encouragement, as well as personal tips on struggles they encounter.

A six-year-old girl was given bread and jam instead of a hot school dinner for two days because her mum was just £4 in arrears. Hazel Lebby, 37, says she was shocked to discover her daughter Hannah had twice been denied a lunch and has now threatened to take her child out of the school. St Thomas’s School in Mitcham, Wimbledon, said it needed to take drastic action after parents racked up £1,730 in unpaid dinner meals last year. Furious: Hazel Lebby, 37, was shocked to discover her daughter Hannah, 6, was given bread and jam instead of a hot school dinner for two days. Mrs Lebby said: 'I was supposed to pay it on Monday but my car broke down so I totally forgot about having to sort it out. 'Then the next morning I woke up with a leak. My carpet was soaking wet. I managed to get her to school on time but had to come back home and sort out the leak. 'I would never in a million years think they would refuse a child dinner because I’m a couple of days late. No one had made an attempt to phone me and tell me my daughter had not been having a dinner. 'The only reason I found out was because my daughter let it out.' Mrs Lebby, from Mitcham, works for the catering company that provides the school’s dinners at another school. She received a text from the school to say that because she was in arrears by £4 there 'may not' be a school lunch for her child today. Big bill: St Thomas's School in Mitcham, Wimbledon, said it needed to take drastic action after parents racked up £1,730 in unpaid dinner meals last year. Her daughter was given a substitute of two slices of bread and jam for two days. She has since made an official complaint to Merton Council and has said she does not want her daughter to return to the school. She said: 'I personally feel if they can make a child feel like that then I really don’t want her to go there at all. 'You don’t take it out on a child. All they had to do was pick up the phone and say we have noticed you are in arrears and your child will not be getting a dinner. I would have picked her up or brought down some lunch.' But the school has defended the decision and the need to take drastic action following the large bill which was racked up on unpaid dinner meals last year. Headteacher David Feasey said: 'We are liable for those arrears and if parents don’t pay we have to foot the bill and it’s taking money away from resources we could be spending on the children. 'Sometimes people experience difficulties and we can work around that.' However, he did say he would 'look into' the wording of the text message to make it clear to parents whether their child would be refused a school lunch. He added: 'It’s a parent’s responsibility to make sure their child is fed, not the schools. It’s a service we provide but it has to be paid for.'

Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter.  Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed.  Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.

How is \\"Our company sorts scrap metal and compresses it into bales to be sold to secondary metal producers.\\" said in French?","output":"\\"Notre entreprise trie les métaux de récupération et les compresse en balles pour les vendre à des producteurs de métaux secondaires.\\" Here is the sentence broken down for better understanding: 1. \\"Notre entreprise\\" - This means 'Our company'. 'Notre' means 'our' in French and 'entreprise' is the term used for a business organization or a company. 2. \\"trie les métaux de récupération\\" - This translates to 'sorts scrap metal'. 'Trie' is the verb 'to sort' in French, 'les métaux' means 'the metals', and 'de récupération' is a phrase often used to refer to recycled or scrap material. 3. \\"et les compresse en balles\\" - This part of the sentence means 'and compresses it into bales'. 'Et' means 'and', 'les' refers back to the metals, 'compresse' is the verb 'to compress' and 'en balles' means 'into bales'. 4. \\"pour les vendre à des producteurs de métaux secondaires\\" - Finally, this phrase translates to 'to be sold to secondary metal producers'. 'Pour' means 'to' or 'for', 'les vendre' means 'sell them', 'à' means 'to', 'des' is a partitive article often translated as 'some' or 'any', but in this context, it's more accurate to think of it as part of the indefinite plural phrase 'producteurs de métaux secondaires' which means 'secondary metal producers'. This is a precise translation that maintains the business tone of the original sentence. The phrase conveys that the company is involved in waste management and recycling, specifically in the sorting and processing of scrap metal for sale to businesses that use recycled metal in their production processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: Axelrod: We'll keep pounding outside spending and foreign money      The White House will keep up its assault on outside spending by conservative groups and will continue to press the case about the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's foreign money, despite hints of retreat on the latter issue, senior adviser David Axelrod told me in an interview this afternoon.      Axelrod also took a shot at the fact-checkers at multiple news orgs who have concluded there is no evidence for the White House's broadside at the Chamber, suggesting fact-checkers should be \\"directing their ire\\" at the Chamber, rather than \\"in the wrong direction.\\"      \\"The fact that these front groups are spending hundreds of millions of dollars from undisclosed sources on attack ads to influence these elections is a serious issue and we're going to continue to raise it,\\" Axelrod told me.      He added: \\"As we've said from the beginning, the prospect that foreign controlled companies might somehow be involved, this was opened up in the Citizens United debate, and it continues to be a concern.\\"      Axelrod allowed that the debate over the Chamber's foreign money was a distraction from the larger issue of anonymous money flooding the midterms. But when pressed on whether the White House and DNC had erred by pressing the foreign cash angle, moving the debate in that direction, he demurred, blaming Republicans and conservative groups.      \\"The debate is being directed that way as a kind of misdirection play by Karl and others who obviously don't want the focus on where their 150 million or 200 million is coming from,\\" Axelrod said.      Asked to respond to commentators who claim the issue is a political loser at a time when voters are focused on the economy, Axelrod insisted the issue is beginning to work in Dems' favor.      \\"The phenomenon is beginning to be unmasked,\\" he said. \\"That's what makes Karl and others so nervous. They thought they could operate under cloak of darkness and now a bright light is being shone.\\"      Axelrod also claimed that the White House was equally opposed to undisclosed money funding the relatively small amount of Chamber ads supporting Dems who opposed health reform, though he refused to call on the Chamber to pull those spots.      \\"I am for them disclosing where their money comes from whether the ads are for Democrats or Republicans,\\" Axelrod said. \\"Under the reform law we supported and the Republicans blocked, organizations would have to disclose the sources of their funding whether they're supporting Dems or Republicans.\\"      Many news orgs have concluded there's no evidence that any foreign Chamber money is funding elections here. But Axelrod pushed back, asking why news orgs aren't more irked by the Chamber's lack of disclosure.      \\"The whole point of disclosure is that you don't really know whether people are complying with the rules unless you know what they're doing,\\" he said. \\"Do any of the fact checkers have access to the fund that the chamber is using to pay for its 75 million in political activity? If they don't, it seems to me they're directing their ire in the wrong direction.\\"       ||||| Summary      Democrats, from President Barack Obama on down, are trying to turn an evidence-free allegation into a major campaign theme, claiming that foreign corporations are \\"stealing our democracy\\" with secret, illegal contributions funneled through the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It’s a claim with little basis in fact.      The Democratic National Committee released a TV ad over the weekend claiming: \\"It appears they’ve even taken secret foreign money to influence our elections.\\"      President Obama said last week that \\"one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign sources.\\"      The liberal group MoveOn.org is claiming, without any qualification, that \\"[f]oreign corporations are funding some of the 75 million the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is spending to defeat Democrats.\\"      The chamber says it does receive money from foreign sources, but that it amounts to only a small fraction of the chamber’s 200 million budget. The chamber says none of the foreign money is used in its ads, and no evidence has been produced to show otherwise. Federal Election Commission opinions state that organizations taking in foreign money may make political donations legally, so long as they have \\"a reasonable accounting method\\" to keep foreign money separate and have enough money from U.S. sources to cover the donations.      Analysis      As we reported last week in an Ask FactCheck item on this subject, the claim that money from foreign corporations is funding Chamber of Commerce attack ads originated with a Democratic-leaning organization headed by John Podesta, former chief of staff for President Bill Clinton. That report noted that the chamber took in foreign dues and then said that the chamber is \\"likely skirting longstanding campaign finance law\\" against foreign spending in U.S. elections. The word \\"likely\\" made clear the author was engaging in speculation, which the chamber flatly denied. Tita Freeman, the chamber’s vice president of communications and strategy, told us that money the chamber takes in from foreign corporations \\"is not used for political ads.\\"      Now others have challenged the claim. The New York Times reported:      New York Times, Oct. 8: [T]here is little evidence that what the chamber does in collecting overseas dues is improper or even unusual, according to both liberal and conservative election-law lawyers and campaign finance documents. In fact, the controversy over the Chamber of Commerce financing may say more about the Washington spin cycle — where an Internet blog posting can be quickly picked up by like-minded groups and become political fodder for the president himself — than it does about the vagaries of campaign finance.      The Times reported, for example, that U.S. subsidiaries of corporations based overseas have set up more than 160 political action committees. The Federal Election Commission states that this is perfectly legal so long as U.S. residents make the decisions and provide all the funds. The Times also noted that groups such as the AFL-CIO and the Sierra Club also have international affiliations. The AFL-CIO has pledged to spend 53 million on the midterm elections, mainly supporting Democrats.      Nevertheless, the Democratic National Committee repeated the foreign-money claim in an ad it released to weekend news shows. It was played on CBS’ \\"Face the Nation.\\"      [TET ]            Democratic National Committee Ad:      \\"Stealing Democracy\\"      Announcer: Karl Rove, Ed Gillespie: They’re Bush cronies. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce: They’re shills for big business. And they’re stealing our democracy. Spending millions from secret donors to elect Republicans to do their bidding in Congress. It appears they’ve even taken secret foreign money to influence our elections. It’s incredible: Republicans benefiting from secret foreign money. Tell the Bush crowd and the Chamber of Commerce: Stop stealing our democracy.      [/TET]      The ad claims that \\"it appears\\" Republicans have taken \\"secret foreign money\\" to influence elections. \\"It’s incredible: Republicans benefiting from secret foreign money.\\"      On \\"Face the Nation,\\" CBS’ Bob Schieffer noted that the Times had quoted the chamber’s chief lobbyist as saying that the chamber got less than 100,000 from foreign affiliates, and Schieffer challenged White House Senior Adviser David Axelrod:      CBS’ Schieffer, Oct. 10: But this part about foreign money, that appears to be peanuts, Mister Axelrod, I mean, do you have any evidence that it’s anything other than peanuts? Axelrod: Well, do you have any evidence that it’s not, Bob?      Axelrod said \\"the core of the problem\\" is that the chamber won’t identify the sources of money it is using to fund its ads, except to say that it’s not from foreign sources. It’s true that the chamber won’t release donors — there’s no legal requirement for it to do so — and also won’t discuss the specific accounting methods it uses to keep foreign money separate.      As we reported last week, however, any \\"reasonable accounting method\\" will do, according to the governing advisory opinion issued by the Federal Election Commission.      The FEC, in AO 1992-16, allowed the wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of a Japanese company to make corporate donations to state and local candidates in Hawaii, provided that the U.S. company could show that it had enough funds from its domestic operations to cover the donations.      FEC, AO 1992-16: The [U.S.] subsidiary must be able to demonstrate through a reasonable accounting method that it has sufficient funds in its account, other than funds given or loaned by its foreign national parent, from which the contribution is made.      The FEC reaffirmed that position as recently as 2006, in another advisory opinion stating that domestic subsidiaries of foreign corporations may donate to state and local elections. That was AO 2006-15, which ruled that two U.S. subsidiaries of a Canadian energy company \\"may make corporate donations and disbursements in connection with State and local elections to the extent permitted by State and local law,\\" provided that no foreign nationals decide where the money is given and all funds come from U.S. sources.      The amount of foreign money the chamber takes in is actually somewhat more than 100,000 — though the chamber won’t say how much more. The chamber’s vice president of communications, Tita Freeman, told us that the chamber gets about 100,000 per year through American Chambers of Commerce overseas. That’s the 100,000 that the chief lobbyist was referring to in the Times story, another chamber official confirmed with us. In addition, Freeman said the chamber also receives membership dues directly from foreign corporations, though she would not disclose the amount.      We have at least an inkling: ThinkProgress, which is part of the Democratic-leaning Center for American Progress think tank and which made the initial allegations about the chamber’s foreign money, subsequently published a follow-up: At least 84 foreign companies pay at least 885,000 in dues to the chamber, according to ThinkProgress. Still lacking, though, is any proof that the money is being used in the chamber’s ad campaign.      Guilty Until Proven Innocent      Nevertheless, some Democrats are taking the position that the Chamber of Commerce is guilty of using foreign contributions until proven innocent. MoveOn.org is using this claim in a fundraising appeal, both in e-mail messages and on its website:      MoveOn.org website: Foreign corporations are funding some of the 75 million the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is spending to defeat Democrats this election cycle. Ask the Justice Department to investigate.      Update, Oct. 12: In addition, MoveOn.org Political Action attacked Republican Rep. Mark Kirk, who is running for an Illinois Senate seat, with an ad saying that the chamber was helping \\"Republicans like Mark Kirk\\" and getting money from corporations in \\"countries like China, Russia and India, the same companies that threaten American jobs.\\"      [TET ]      MoveOn.org Political Action ad:      \\"Mark Kirk, Connect the Dots\\"      Announcer: Mark Kirk voted to reward corporations with tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas. Now the Chamber of Commerce is spending over 75 million dollars to help Republicans like Mark Kirk get elected. And where has the chamber been getting some of their money lately? From foreign corporations in countries like China, Russia and India, the same companies that threaten American jobs.      It’s time to connect the dots. Exactly who is Mark Kirk working for? Because it sure isn’t Illinois.      2nd Announcer: MoveOn.org Political Action is responsible for the content of this advertisement.

He has hedged his claim with words like \\"maybe\\" and \\"could.\\"      At a campaign rally for Illinois Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias at Chicago’s Drake Hotel, Obama said:      Obama, Oct. 7: Just this week, we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign sources. So the question for the people of Illinois is, are you going to let special interests from Wall Street and Washington and maybe places beyond our shores come to this state and tell us who our senator should be?      He repeated the claim three days later at a DNC rally in Philadelphia’s Fulton Elementary School Park:      Obama, Oct. 10: [S]pecial interest groups … are spending unlimited amounts of money on attack ads — attacking folks like Patrick Murphy, attacking folks like Joe Sestak — just attacking people without ever disclosing who’s behind all these attack ads. You don’t know. It could be the oil industry. It could be the insurance industry. It could even be foreign-owned corporations. You don’t know because they don’t have to disclose. Now, that’s not just a threat to Democrats — that’s a threat to our democracy.      It’s certainly true that millions are being spent without public disclosure, and that much of the money is coming from corporations taking advantage of a Supreme Court ruling easing restrictions on political spending. But using foreign funds to finance political ads is still a legal violation. Accusing anybody of violating the law is a serious matter requiring serious evidence to back it up. So far Democrats have produced none.      — by Brooks Jackson      Update, Oct. 15: After we posted this article, ThinkProgress published a follow-up to its original piece, this time saying that it had identified at least 84 foreign companies that paid the Chamber at least 885,000 in dues.

We noted the Chamber raises money from foreign-owned businesses for its 501(c)(6) entity, the same account that finances its unprecedented 75 million dollar partisan attack ad campaign. While the Chamber is notoriously secretive, the thrust of our story involved the disclosure of fundraising documents U.S. Chamber staffers had been distributing to solicit foreign (even state-owned) companies to donate directly to the Chamber’s 501(c)(6).      We documented three different ways the Chamber fundraises from foreign corporations: (1) An internal fundraising program called “Business Councils” used to solicit direct, largely foreign contributions to the Chamber, (2) Direct contributions from foreign multinationals like BP, Siemens, and Shell Oil, and (3) From the Chamber’s network of AmCham affiliates, which are foreign chambers of the Chamber composed of American and foreign companies. The Chamber quickly acknowledged that it receives direct, foreign money, but simply replied, “We are not obligated to discuss our internal procedures.” Instead of providing any documentation or proof to demonstrate foreign money is not being used for electioneering purposes, the Chamber launched an aggressive media strategy to first, attack ThinkProgress with petty name-calling and second, to confuse the media by highlighting the Chamber’s relatively minor AmCham fundraising, which the Chamber says (also without documentation) totals “approximately 100,000” from all 115 international AmCham chapters. The Chamber and the media largely ignored ThinkProgress’ revelation about the Chamber’s direct foreign fundraising to its 501(c)(6) used for attack ads.      Yesterday, the Chamber’s chief lobbyist Bruce Josten, who has been spoon-feeding much of the media distortions about our report, went on Fox News (whose parent company donated 1 million to the Chamber recently for its ad campaign) to again try to dilute the issue by dissembling about the Chamber’s fundraising and membership. “We have probably 60 or so foreign multi-national companies in our membership that we have had for decades, many of which have been in the United States for half a century or a century,” said Josten.      The Chamber is being deceptive. In addition to multinational members of the Chamber headquartered abroad (like BP, Shell Oil, and Siemens), a new ThinkProgress investigation has identified at least 84 other foreign companies that actively donate to the Chamber’s 501(c)(6). Below is a chart detailing the annual dues foreign corporations have indicated that they give directly to the Chamber (using information that is publicly available from the Business Council applications and the Chamber’s own websites):      Company Location Money/Level 4G Identity Solutions Hyderabad, India 7,500 A2Z Maintenance & Eng.

The data above reflects information from public sources, and the Chamber likely has many more foreign corporations as dues-paying members — but refuses to divulge any of the funders for their ad campaign. Unfortunately, many reporters in the traditional press covered the Chamber story, but missed the entire point of our reporting. Most reporters (from the New York Times, McClatchy, the Associated Press, etc.) never contacted ThinkProgress, instead opting to only interview Chamber officials.      Here’s how the Chamber’s unusual foreign fundraising operation works. According to this internal Chamber staff chart obtained by ThinkProgress, the Chamber has an international division devoted to promoting free trade and related policy issues. U.S. Chamber staffers, based here in Washington, D.C. with offices in the Chamber’s building at 1615 H Street, create bilateral “Business Councils” fundraising programs to solicit money from foreign corporations in Korea, Egypt, Brazil, Bahrain, India, and other places. For instance, the Chamber’s US-Egypt Business Council directs potential members to wire their checks to the US Chamber of Commerce. The application also notes that checks should be marked “ATTN: Leila Vossoughi.” Vossaoughi is a regular staffer at the Chamber. Promotions to join the Chamber have included promises that foreign firms obtain “access to the US Chamber of Commerce and everything that it does” and pledges to help the foreign firms promote free trade policies in America. All of the staffers who manage the Business Councils work directly for the Chamber. These Business Councils are nothing like the Chamber’s AmChams, which are foreign affiliates of the Chamber composed of American and foreign businesses abroad. Business Councils are based in the Chamber and even hosted on the U.S. Chamber’s website domain. Bylaws from the US-Bahrain Business Council confirm that the money the U.S. Chamber raises from these applications — which welcome foreign-owned businesses — goes into the Chamber’s 501(c)(6). Click below to see one such application:      Again, the information above documents the fact that foreign donations go directly to the Chamber without any intermediary, for instance, through an “AmCham” or another Chamber affiliate organization. The same Chamber account funded by these foreign corporation is running a 75 million attack campaign. In fact, a Chamber spokesperson acknowledged the foreign funds go into the Chamber’s general account. Any responsible reporter should have to note these direct donations given to the Chamber, which the Chamber has refused to discuss. Or, reporters should contact us directly if there is any confusion about our report.      ThinkProgress intern Riley Waggaman contributed to this post. ||||| by Tom Collamore            Having been roundly repudiated in the mainstream media over their allegation that the U.S. Chamber is using money from American Chambers of Commerce abroad (AmChams) to fund political ads, John Podesta and his folks at ThinkProgress have shifted to a new target in their increasingly pitiful attempt to silence the voice of business in the upcoming election--our bilateral business councils.            This allegation is equally false and baseless, not to mention tiresome and desperate.            The U.S. Chamber hosts several business councils, whose purpose is to promote bilateral trade and investment between the two countries. They are run as independent organizations and most members of business councils are not also members of the U.S. Chamber.            For those business councils affiliated with us, their monies are considered \\"restricted funds\\" and are held for use by those business councils. These councils have been around for decades. They have never engaged in political activity--and they never will.            ThinkProgress is grabbing at straws. We look forward to debunking some of their upcoming \\"investigations\\": \\"U.S. Chamber Using Cash From Space Aliens to Fund Political Advertising\\" and \\"U.S. Chamber Producing Counterfeit Currency in its Basement to Pay for Attack Ads.\\"            ThinkProgress, huh? Hurling unfounded allegations for political gain is progress, with a sputtering economy and near 10% unemployment? How about: ThinkRationally? These wild and irresponsible allegations make you wonder who is funding ThinkProgress ... and why.            Now that AP, The New York Times, and FactCheck.org have discredited these attacks, we hope to return to a serious discussion about the issue Americans care most about: job creation. |||||","output":"The White House and senior advisor David Axelrod plan to continue addressing the issue of outside spending by conservative groups, as well as concerns about the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's foreign money. Axelrod believes that the undisclosed sources contributing to these political ads should be scrutinized more heavily by fact-checkers. The concern stems from the potential involvement of foreign-controlled companies in funding campaign ads, which could be a threat to democracy. The Chamber of Commerce claims that only a small fraction of its 200 million budget comes from foreign sources and that none of it is used for ads, but Democrats argue that the possibility of foreign involvement requires sufficient evidence and transparency. Axelrod claims that the exposure of this phenomenon is making their opposition nervous, as they thought they could operate without being noticed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sandor chastises the presiding priest for perpetuating the fear of vampirism, and reminds him that Dracula was destroyed 10 years previously. Sandor visits an inn and warns four English tourists â the Kents â not to visit Karlsbad; they ignore his advice. As night approaches, the Kents find themselves abandoned by their fear-stricken coach driver two kilometres from Karlsbad, in view of a castle. A driverless carriage takes them to the castle, where they find a dining table set for four people and their bags unpacked in the bedrooms. A servant named Klove explains that his master, the late Count Dracula, ordered that the castle should always be ready to welcome strangers. After dinner the Kents settle in their rooms.

Please write a short summary for the following article: These Travel Instagram Accounts Will Inspire Extreme Wanderlust Toronto native Tom Ryaboi—better known by his Instagram handle @roof_topper—has “been on more roofs than Santa Claus,” shooting gorgeous, vertigo-inducing skyline images. He and other rooftoppers worldwide have gained notoriety and sizable followings for Instagramming from buildings, bridges, and other urban sites that are sometimes off limits. They’re part of a bigger trend of Instagrammers who seek out extreme vantage points, whether sharing a selfie taken on the head of Rio de Janeiro’s Christ the Redeemer statue or shooting from the ocean itself as lava enters the water and a wave crests. The artists hail from all ends of the creative spectrum: hipsters who dare to sneak into subway tunnels or abandoned theaters as well as established pros who got their start at magazines. (It’s even been reported that a few pilots have Instagrammed from the cockpit.) “Instagram is the new portfolio,” says National Geographic photographer Chad Copeland, who captures action shots of climbers, skiers, surfers, and divers, as well as hard-to-reach natural landscapes. “When people find you now, it’s through Instagram, and they want to see what you’re doing every day.” Former BMX pro Mike Escamilla was already jumping out of airplanes and breaking world records when he decided to start taking pictures of his feats and posting them on Instagram. And as a storm chaser for KFOR-TV in Oklahoma City, Reed Timmer gets paid to track foul weather, using his Instagram feed as a way to showcase daring photography as much as a public alert system. While some of these photographers still prefer to use high-quality DSLR cameras, it’s the new generation of smartphones and GoPro action cams that has really empowered Instagrammers. GoPro makes it easy to record yourself from any angle in mid-stunt, and the camera functions on smartphones—along with the speed of the networks for uploading images to social media networks—just keep getting better. Ashley McKinney, for one, shoots exclusively with an iPhone 6. Equipment and editing tools are only part of the equation. Some of the most attention-grabbing Instagrams require significant reconnaissance and creative thinking. Ryaboi’s current favorite image features a man slacklining between two buildings, with the CN Tower visible in the distance. “This was something we planned and worked on for several months,” he admits. There are hundreds of such Instagrammers pushing the boundaries of the medium every day. We don’t suggest joining them, but do find it fascinating to explore their images. Start here. The Instagram scene is booming in Hong Kong, where photographer Daniel Lau is based. He shoots with a Canon EOS 700D from tops of bridges, construction sites, even hotels. And his feed features one death-defying vantage point after another, whether his own selfies or the handiwork of his rooftop-photography pals @lawrencedehk, @beerkus, and @sidorovv. “This photo was taken with a Canon EOS 7D by my friend Dex,” he recalls. “We were on that roof under a typhoon signal, hoping to chase the storm. The suspending ledge was even vibrating.” Doesn’t he ever get scared? “No, but I don’t consider what I’m doing to be daredevil stuff,” he says, “because I don’t feel fear doing it.” Countless tourists have snapped photos of Rio de Janeiro’s Christ the Redeemer statue, but native Thiago ML Correa ups the ante. His feed is full of similarly dramatic, sunlit shots from across Brazil, Australia, and South Africa. He’s captured mountaintop yoga poses with his girlfriend, cliff diving near Rio, and hanging from a rock on Pedra da Gávea, the right equipment at the ready. “I use the GoPro Hero4 Black when I’m in the water or climbing, the Canon 60D when I’m doing a planned daredevil shot, and the iPhone 5S when I just want to take a spontaneous photo,” Correa explains. Always the adventurer, Correa grew up cliff diving at a secret spot in Rio’s Urca district. He won’t name it, but says he plans to shoot an image there soon. To get great images of adventurers, you have to be one yourself. National Geographic photographer Chad Copeland learned survival tactics and other important skills during 10 years in the U.S. Air Force. “I have to do what the athletes are doing,” he says. “Sometimes I have to do it better, and then get out in front of them before they do it.” Copeland’s Instagram feed covers “all three realms,” as he puts it—air, land, and sea—everything from BASE jumpers to Icelandic ice caves to surfers. This featured image, shot in Utah’s Zion National Park with a Nikon D4 DSLR with a 24mm, 1.8 lens, shows a climber tackling a formation known as the Zicicle, which freezes only every decade or so. Timing wasn’t the only challenge. “Normally I’d fly my unmanned aircraft, but since drones are illegal in national parks, I had to resort to climbing myself,” he says. David Gamboa was one of the first to embrace the hashtag #Jumpstagram. For his first attempt, he climbed up to one edge of Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown L.A. He shoots primarily on Android devices, rather than popular-with-the-creative-set iPhones. Lately, he uses a Nexus 5 and the first-generation Samsung Galaxy Camera, then edits in the device with VSCO Cam or in Instagram, where he prefers the Rise, Sierra, and Amaro filters. Why not use a DSLR and Adobe Lightroom as so many of his fellow Instagram photographers do? “I like the challenge,” he says. “The creativity it requires for people to shoot from a phone, especially an Android phone, and to push the boundaries of these devices.” This Instagram was taken on a mountain hike path where Gamboa lives in southern California—he’s a marketing major at Cal State Fullerton—and used the tripod-mounted unit’s 10-second timer.

However, we can rely on data provided by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to get an approximate number. As of the latest data available from the 2018-2019 school year, there are approximately 130,930 K-12 schools in the United States. This number can be broken down into the following categories: 1. Public schools:    - Elementary schools: 66,758    - Secondary schools: 24,040    - Combined schools: 10,958    Total public schools: 101,756 2.

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history.  Question: \\"Why are the Dutch no longer a powerful force in the world of trade?\\" Response: \\"The British destroyed the Dutch navy\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct based on the paragraph.

Can you tell me the answer to who are the main characters in the wind in the willows??","output":"\\"The Wind in the Willows\\" is a classic children's novel written by Kenneth Grahame, first published in 1908. The story is set in the idyllic English countryside and revolves around the lives and adventures of four anthropomorphic animal characters. The main characters in \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" are: 1. Ratty (The Water Rat) - Ratty is an easygoing, amiable, and loyal water rat who lives in a cozy home along the riverbank. He is cultured, knowledgeable about local traditions, and has a passion for the river and boating. Ratty represents the refined and content English gentility of the Edwardian era. Throughout the novel, Ratty demonstrates his kindness by reaching out to and helping his friends whenever they need assistance. 2. Mole - Mole is a timid and somewhat naive creature who has lived underground in a burrow most of his life. His adventurous spirit leads him to venture out of his comfortable home to explore the world above ground. Along the way, he forms a strong friendship with Ratty, who takes him under his wing and teaches him about the ways of the river. As Mole's character develops, he becomes more confident and learns to value the importance of friendship and the beauty of the world around him. 3. Toad - Toad is the wealthy, self-centered, and impulsive heir to the grand Toad Hall. He possesses a penchant for fads, which often lands him in trouble. His charismatic and larger-than-life personality often causes him to get carried away with his latest obsessions, from horse-drawn carriages to motor cars. Despite being vain and boastful, Toad is a lovable character for his humor and ability to be humbled by his misadventures. Toad's character represents the humorous and endearing aspect of the book, and he learns the value of true friendship through his encounters with his friends and their willingness to stand by him despite his many flaws. 4. Badger - Badger is a wise, reserved, and reclusive badger who lives deep in the Wild Wood. He is a fatherly figure, highly respected by the other animals, and serves as a grounding influence on the impulsive and occasionally reckless Toad. Although he prefers solitude, Badger offers his help, guidance, and wisdom to his friends whenever they are in need. His character embodies the wisdom and authority that stems from age and experience. Throughout the novel, these four main characters embark on a series of adventures and misadventures, learning valuable lessons along the way. The story's charm and enduring appeal lie in the vivid descriptions of the English countryside, the lively personalities of its characters, and the themes of friendship, respect, and appreciation for the simple joys in life. By exploring the world through the eyes of these anthropomorphic animals, readers of all ages can derive a deeper understanding of the importance of camaraderie, the beauty of nature, and the transformational power of personal growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Insulated material can be used for keeping warm, and an insulated cup with a cover is great for keeping beverages warm. Given these facts, how do you keep a cup hot among the following options: - less water  - electricity  - heat energy  - adding heat  - energy usage  - insulation  - squeeze  - energy A:","output":"Keeping a cup of beverage warm depends primarily on conserving the heat energy that's already inside the cup. Out of the options provided, the best methods include using insulation and adding heat. 1. Insulation: This is one of the most effective methods of maintaining the temperature of your drink. An insulated cup or a thermos can retain heat for a lengthy period of time. Insulating materials reduce the amount of heat that can escape by conduction, convection, and radiation. Vacuum flasks for instance, maximize this principle by having a double wall with a vacuum between them to minimize heat loss. 2. Adding Heat: This method is about continuously supplying heat to the beverage in the cup in order to maintain its temperature. This could be done with things like a heated coaster, a cup warmer, or even a slow cooker. These devices typically use electricity to generate the heat, making your choice of 'electricity' a subset of this option. Energy usage would be involved in both of these methods, since it takes energy to generate heat, and insulation works by reducing the energy (in the form of heat) that's lost to the surrounding environment.  The other options like 'less water', 'squeeze', and 'energy' are less relevant. Less water may technically cool down more slowly, but it's not practical for enjoying a hot beverage. 'Squeeze' wouldn't help to retain heat and might be dangerous. 'Energy' is too vague without specifying what kind of energy or how it's being used, but generally, the term can refer to the energy used in the process of heating or insulation."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1944, Rachel Stein, a Dutch-Jewish singer who had lived in Berlin before the war, is hiding from the Nazi regime in the occupied Netherlands.

Lady Anne Clifford and William Herbert married on June 4, 1630, following the death of his second wife, Mary Talbot. Their marriage was a strategic move, as both families were renowned for their wealth, social standing, and influence in England at the time. However, their relationship was often described as unhappy, and they had no living children together.  William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, was a significant figure in English politics, literature, and patron of the arts during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras. He served as a patron to many famous poets, including William Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Throughout her life, Lady Anne Clifford was known for her intelligence, determination, and steadfastness in defending her legal rights as a noblewoman. She actively pursued her claims to inherited estates and lands, which led her to be involved in several legal disputes and controversies. Eventually, she achieved a significant victory after William Herbert's death in 1630, and went on to fulfill her life-long ambition of restoring and rebuilding her family's estates and castles in northern England.

Summarize this article in one sentence. The vote was originally scheduled for February, but then Nevada set its date for 14 January. Florida Republicans were the first to upset the calendar, when they moved forward their primary to 31 January. Caucuses are town-hall style contests where voters decide which candidates win a group vote. Primaries are more traditional ballot votes. Iowa's caucus and New Hampshire's state primary election are usually the first set of nominating contests, but Nevada and Florida's actions have left New Hampshire with fewer available dates in early 2012. Florida's decision to schedule its ballot before March was in breach of national Republican party rules. But it is Nevada's mid-January date that has \\"exacerbated\\" the scheduling problem for the so-called \\"first in the nation\\" contests, said Iowa Republican party chairman Matt Strawn. Nevada has \\"unnecessarily crowded the January calendar\\", Mr Strawn said, adding: \\"Time remains for Nevada to respect the process, honour tradition and rectify the problem in a way that will restore order to the nomination calendar.\\" Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has backed the move by Nevada Republicans. A Reid aide told the Associated Press news agency that Nevada Democrats would hold their caucus on 14 January too, in solidarity with Nevada Republicans. New Hampshire is now threatening to hold its primary in December, unless Nevada delays its vote. New Hampshire could still leapfrog Iowa's date, but that would now mean scheduling in December around the holiday season. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner has the sole authority in his state to set the primary. Mr Gardner's office told the Des Moines Register that while 10 January has been suggested, the state would not set its primary on that date as long was Nevada was scheduled for later the same week. Correspondents say holding nominating contests so close together prevents candidates from capitalising on their success from one primary to the other, and often favours existing frontrunners. Republican candidate Jon Huntsman has gone as far as focusing his entire campaign on New Hampshire. Mr Huntsman, whose campaign is in financial trouble, says he will boycott the Nevada primary because of the date the state has set. Five Republican candidates have followed suit, leaving former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, Texas Governor Rick Perry and Senator Ron Paul campaigning in the state. But Mr Romney and Mr Perry have the most cash on hand.

Let's analyze the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: \\"He passed but of their sight, straight toward the new hole in the sky.\\" The premise provides information about a situation involving an individual (referred to as \\"he\\") and the movement or action he has taken. The phrase \\"passed but of their sight\\" implies that his movement led to him becoming invisible or out of the line of vision for the observers or witnesses who were aware of his presence. This element highlights the individual's departure and subsequent invisibility to others. The second part of the premise, \\"straight toward the new hole in the sky,\\" describes the direction in which the individual is headed. A \\"hole in the sky\\" can be understood metaphorically or literally, depending on the context of the story. In this case, it is assumed that there is an opening or portal-like existence in the sky, and \\"the new\\" emphasizes that this hole is fresh or a recent development. Importantly, the premise suggests that the individual is directly heading towards this hole in the sky intentionally or purposefully. Hypothesis: \\"He went towards an opening in the sky.\\" The hypothesis is a simplified and direct summary of the core idea found in the premise. It states that the individual is moving towards an opening in the sky, which is the same as the \\"new hole in the sky.\\" The hypothesis disregards the spectators' perception mentioned in the premise (\\"passed but of their sight\\") but retains the central trajectory of the individual's movement. In conclusion, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise as it captures the essential idea of the individual heading towards a hole or opening in the sky. However, it omits the part about the observers losing sight of the individual. Despite this omission, the main concept remains intact, and the hypothesis can be considered as a fair representation of the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer based on context: John, the eldest son of King Manuel I to his second wife  Maria of Aragon, was born in Lisbon on 7 June 1502.  The event was marked by the presentation of Gil Vicente's Visitation Play or the Monologue of the Cowherd  in the queen's chamber. The young prince was sworn heir to the throne in 1503, the year his youngest sister, Isabella of Portugal, Empress Consort of the Holy Roman Empire between 1527 and 1538, was born. John was educated by notable scholars of the time, including the astrologer Tomás de Torres, Diogo de Ortiz, Bishop of Viseu, and Luís Teixeira Lobo, one of the first Portuguese Renaissance humanists, rector of the University of Siena  and Professor of Law at Ferrara . John's chronicler António de Castilho said that, \\"Dom João III faced problems easily, complementing his lack of culture with a practice formation that he always showed during his reign\\" . In 1514, he was given his own house, and a few years later began to help his father in administrative duties. At the age of sixteen, John was chosen to marry his first cousin, the 20-year-old Eleanor of Austria, eldest daughter of Philip the Handsome of Austria-Burgundy and Queen Joanna of Castile, but instead she married his widowed father Manuel. John took deep offence at this: his chroniclers say he became melancholic and was never quite the same. Some historians also claim this was one of the main reasons that John later became fervently religious, giving him name the Pious .

The terms 9*x and -10*x are like terms because they both have the variable x. We'll combine them. -4 = (9*x - 10*x) -4 = (-1*x) Step 2: Isolate the variable x. Now, we have -4 = -1*x. To isolate x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -1. -4 / -1 = (-1*x) / -1 Step 3: Solve for x.

Get out 1½ pounds (680 g) of chicken pieces and place them in the dish with the pineapple juice. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate the chicken in the pineapple juice for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours. Pour 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of cooking oil into a large pot and turn the heat to medium. Peel 1 small onion and dice it into small 1/2-inch (12 mm) pieces. You'll also need to dice 1 medium plum or roma tomato. Mince enough garlic to get 1 teaspoon (2 g). Put the diced onion, tomato, and garlic into the hot oil and stir the vegetables as they cook. Sauté the mixture over medium heat until the onion softens a little and the garlic smells fragrant. This should take about 5 minutes. Stir ¼ teaspoon (0.5 g) of ground black pepper into the vegetable mixture and remove the marinated chicken from the refrigerator. Place the pieces of chicken in the pot in a single layer. Turn the heat up to medium-high and brown the chicken for 3 to 4 minutes. Use tongs to turn the chicken pieces over, so they brown on the other side. This should take another 3 to 4 minutes. Pour the pineapple juice from the marinating dish into the pot with the chicken pieces and vegetables. Heat the mixture over medium-high heat until the pineapple juice boils. Pour in 1 cup (240 ml) of coconut milk and turn the heat down to medium. The liquids in the pot should bubble gently. If you prefer to make a classic pininyahang manok, you could use milk or evaporated milk instead of coconut milk. Put the lid on the pot and let the chicken mixture bubble gently until the chicken pieces are completely cooked. This should take about 40 minutes or until they reach 160 °F (71 °C) with an instant read thermometer. Stir in 1½ tablespoons (22 ml) of fish sauce and the reserved pineapple chunks from the can. Keep simmering the mixture over medium heat for another five minutes. Peel 2 small carrots and use a knife to slice them into 1/2 inch (12 mm) thick diagonal slices. Stir the carrot slices into the pot and simmer the chicken mixture for another 5 minutes. Wash and trim the stems from 1 small red bell pepper and 1 small green bell pepper. Rinse out the seeds and use a knife to slice the peppers into 1-inch (2.5 cm) chunks. Stir the peppers into the pot and simmer the mixture for three more minutes, so the vegetables soften. Once the vegetables soften a little, serve the pininyahang manok while it's still hot. Consider serving the dish with steamed rice, boiled potatoes, or rustic bread. Store the leftover pininyahang manok in an airtight container in the refrigerator for three to four days.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so .","output":"The phrase \\"a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so\\" can be perceived as both positive and negative depending on the individual's personal taste, preferences, and perspective on dark comedy and humor. Let's analyze the phrase in more detail. 1. Positive aspects: For some people, dark comedy is an appealing sub-genre of comedy, which provides a form of entertainment that differs from mainstream humor. Fans of dark comedy appreciate the creative and unconventional ways that sensitive and taboo subjects are portrayed and might celebrate the fact that this type of humor pushes boundaries and breaks social norms. They may consider the sick and demented humor as part of the appeal, making it a positive aspect of the show. The phrase \\"simply to do so\\" may also be seen as a positive feature by some, as it highlights the creators' determination to deliver an edgy and controversial content, despite the potential backlash and negative reactions it might receive. It can be viewed as a form of artistic expression that empowers the artists to challenge societal norms and have a powerful impact on their audience. 2. Negative aspects: On the other hand, some people might perceive the phrase as negative, especially if they find the sick and demented humor tasteless, offensive, or inappropriate. These individuals might be of the opinion that comedy should not exploit dark themes and sensitive issues for laughs, and that such humor is disrespectful or harmful. They could argue that using vulnerable topics in this manner may desensitize people to the seriousness of the issues it portrays, or perpetuate negative stereotypes and misunderstandings. Moreover, the phrase \\"simply to do so\\" could be interpreted negatively by implying that the humor in the dark comedy is unnecessary and lacks a purpose. It may suggest that the creators did not put sufficient thought or consideration into the content's impact and that they prioritized shock value over making a thoughtful commentary on social issues. This could be deemed a negative aspect of the production. In conclusion, whether the phrase is considered positive or negative is largely dependent on personal preferences and perspective. Fans of dark comedy and unconventional humor might view the phrase positively, while those who disapprove of this type of humor or find it offensive will likely perceive it as negative."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Liga in the German football league system. All of the 2. Bundesliga clubs qualify for the DFB-Pokal, the annual German Cup competition. A total of 125 clubs have competed in the 2. Bundesliga since its foundation.  - Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.  - The German football league system, or league pyramid, refers to the hierarchically interconnected league system for the association football in Germany that in the 201617 season consists of 2,235 divisions having 31,645 teams, in which all divisions are bound together by the principle of promotion and relegation. The top three professional levels contain one division each. Below this, the semi-professional and amateur levels have progressively more parallel divisions, which each cover progressively smaller geographic areas. Teams that finish at the top of their division at the end of each season can rise higher in the pyramid, whilst those that finish at the bottom find themselves sinking further down. In theory it is possible for even the lowest local amateur club to rise to the top of the system and become German football champions one day. The number of teams promoted and relegated between the divisions varies, and promotion to the upper levels of the pyramid is usually contingent on meeting additional criteria, especially concerning appropriate facilities and finances.  - The DFL-Supercup or \\"German Super Cup\\" is a one-off football match in Germany that features the winners of the Bundesliga championship and the DFB-Pokal. The DFL-Supercup is run by the Deutsche Fußball Liga (English: German Football League).  - In sports leagues, promotion and relegation is a process where teams are transferred between two divisions based on their performance for the completed season. The best-ranked team(s) in the lower division are \\"promoted\\" to the higher division for the next season, and the worst-ranked team(s) in the higher division are \\"relegated\\" to the lower division for the next season. In some leagues, playoffs or qualifying rounds are also used to determine rankings. This process can continue through several levels of divisions, with teams being exchanged between levels 1 and 2, levels 2 and 3, levels 3 and 4, and so on. During the season, teams that are high enough in the league table that they would qualify for promotion are sometimes said to be in the \\"promotion zone\\", and those at the bottom are in the \\"relegation zone\\" (or, colloquially, the \\"drop zone\\" or \\"facing the drop\\").  - North Rhine-Westphalia (, commonly shortened to NRW) is the most populous state of Germany, with a population of approximately 18 million, and the fourth largest by area.

In gridiron football, the safety (American football) or safety touch (Canadian football) is a scoring play that results in two points (or, in rare cases, one point) being awarded to the scoring team. Safeties can be scored in a number of ways, such as when a ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone or when a foul is committed by the offense in their own end zone. After a safety is scored in American football, the ball is kicked off to the team that scored the safety from the 20-yard line; in Canadian football, the scoring team also has the options of taking control of the ball at their own 35-yard line or kicking off the ball, also at their own 35-yard line. The ability of the scoring team to receive the ball through a kickoff differs from the touchdown and field goal, which require the scoring team to kick the ball off to the scored upon team. Despite being of relatively low point value, safeties can have a significant impact on the result of games, and Brian Burke of Advanced NFL Stats estimated that safeties have a greater abstract value than field goals, despite being worth a point less, due to the field position and reclaimed possession gained off the safety kick. is it possible to get 1 point in football?","output":"Yes, it is possible to get 1 point in football, but it's a very rare occurrence. This additional method of scoring is known as a \\"single point\\" or \\"rouge\\" in Canadian football or a \\"point after touchdown safety\\" or \\"extra point safety\\" in American football. In American football, this rare scoring play can happen during an extra point or two-point conversion attempt (both occur after a touchdown is scored). If the defense manages to gain possession of the ball and then is tackled or runs out of bounds in their own end zone, while possessing the ball, the team that scored the touchdown is awarded one additional point. This scenario is extremely rare because, in most cases, a defensive player who gains possession of the ball during an extra point or two-point conversion attempt will attempt to return it to the other end zone for two points. In Canadian football, a single point or rouge is scored when the kicking team legally kicks the ball into the receiving team's end zone, and the receiving team fails to advance the ball out of the end zone, either by running it out, passing it out, or by the ball being kicked out by the receiving team. The kicking team is awarded one point. This is more common in Canadian football due to the longer and wider field dimensions, as well as different kicking rules that result in more punts and missed field goals potentially scoring a single point. However, it is important to note that while it is technically possible to score a single point in both American and Canadian football, this type of scoring play is very rare and unusual, especially in American football."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Malaysia Airlines to Cut Work Force and Get Almost 2 Billion Bailout BANGKOK — Malaysia Airlines will cut 6,000 jobs, or about 30 percent of its work force, and receive a bailout from the Malaysian government amounting to nearly 2 billion, according to a restructuring plan announced on Friday. Several years of losses at the airline deepened this year after two aircraft disasters — the still unresolved disappearance of Flight 370 over the southern Indian Ocean in March and the downing of Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in July. Azman Mokhtar, the managing director of Khazanah Nasional, the investment arm of the Malaysian government that has a majority stake in the airline, said future state aid of up to 6 billion ringgit, or 1.9 billion, in the airline would come with “strict conditions.” “Success is by no means guaranteed,” he said in statement released by the company. The cash injection is the latest in a long series of bailouts for Malaysia’s state-controlled enterprises. Khazanah said there would be “significant changes to leadership” at Malaysia Airlines and that it would consider “global aviation industry executives” in its search for new talent. The current chief executive, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, will remain as chief executive until July. The government said it would carry out the restructuring by creating a new company with a “right-sized work force and work practices and contracts.” Malaysia Airlines has been burdened in recent years by contracts with politically connected suppliers. The burden — and the risk — of the restructuring plan appears to fall heavily on the airline’s creditors. They will be offered a swap of the airline’s debt for shares of the new company, according to the plan. Among the airline’s largest bondholders is the government employee pension fund known as Kumpulan Wang Persaraan, which, according to Friday’s announcement, agreed to swap 750 million ringgit, or around 240 million, for ordinary shares. The move is likely to be controversial because investors have long assumed that the debts of the state-controlled airline were guaranteed by the government. The plan calls for the airline to move its headquarters to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, about an hour outside the city, from Subang, a suburb closer to Kuala Lumpur. On Thursday, Malaysia Airlines reported in an earnings statement that it had lost 97.6 million in the quarter ended in June — the first financial period to show the effects of the Flight 370 disappearance. The carrier said it expected further losses in the second half of this year, reflecting the additional impact of the Flight 17 incident, after which passenger bookings fell 33 percent. Malaysia Airlines has not posted a yearly profit since 2010. Malaysia Airlines had been on government life support long before being hit with the loss of two planes this year. Saddled with more than 4 billion in debt and cumulative financial losses of about 1.7 billion since 2011, the airline has been increasingly squeezed in recent years by competition from nimbler, low-cost rivals in the region, including AirAsia, founded by the Malaysian billionaire Tony Fernandes. Budget carriers now represent almost 60 percent of the air travel market in Southeast Asia, according to the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation in Sydney, Australia. The flood of new entrants into the Southeast Asian air travel market during the past decade has spurred heavy investment in new routes and new aircraft, a trend with which Malaysia Airlines had sought keep pace. Until the loss of Flight 370, the airline was on course to continue a rapid expansion of capacity in both its domestic and regional networks this year, after a record 29 percent annual increase in passenger traffic in 2013. But though the sharp rise in travel options has been a boon for passengers, analysts say the pace of the industry’s expansion has started to overtake passenger demand. At even the most efficient budget carriers, the number of empty seats has been rising, which has put downward pressure on airfares. On long-distance routes, Malaysia Airlines has also failed to remain competitive, particularly on flights to Europe and the Middle East, where it faces the steady encroachment of full-service carriers from the Gulf. While the airline has already abandoned several money-losing long-distance flights, including some services to North and South America, analysts predict that Malaysia Airlines will need to pare back many of its 80 international destinations. In the past decade, Malaysia Airlines has received more than 1 billion from its controlling shareholder, Khazanah, and undergone at least four previous restructurings. But analysts say those efforts have fallen short of true reform, papering over thorny problems that include a large and aging jet fleet, an overextended route network, an ossified management culture and a bloated, heavily unionized work force of nearly 20,000 employees. “Malaysia Airlines has had big structural problems” for years, said Shakeel Adam, the managing partner of Aviado Partners, a Frankfurt-based consulting firm that specializes in airline restructurings and start-ups. In the past, he said, resistance to job cuts by Malaysia’s unions has been one of the main barriers to improving productivity and lowering operating costs. But this year’s disasters have created a new sense of recognition among Malaysia Airlines staff that this stab at reform could be its last chance. “Now there may be a renewed opportunity to work together, not to save every last job, but to ensure that the airline survives,” Mr. Adam said. He dismissed suggestions that the recent disasters had forever tainted the Malaysia Airlines brand in the eyes of the flying public. “When I hear people talking about a rebranding already, it means they don’t yet understand the nature of restructuring,” he said. “It’s not about changing colors and painting over the wounds.” Thomas Fuller reported from Bangkok, and Nicola Clark from Paris. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Malaysia Airlines is set to cut 6,000 jobs, or about 30% of its workforce, and receive a nearly 2 billion bailout from the Malaysian government, after years of losses were worsened by two aircraft disasters in 2014.

The War Powers Resolution is a federal law purposed to check the president's power to commit the United States to an armed conflict without the consent of Congress. 2. The Resolution states that the U.S. President can send armed forces into action abroad in three scenarios:     a. Declaration of war by Congress     b. Statutory authorization     c. A national emergency created by an attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces Based on the analysis of the text, the U.S. President cannot unilaterally declare war. The President needs the consent of Congress through a declaration of war or statutory authorization. The only exception where the President can act without the consent of Congress is in case of a national emergency resulting from an attack on the United States, its territories, possessions, or armed forces.

Wyler, the agent in charge, finds Cash's pistol on the floor and arrests both Cash and Tango.At their murder trial, the detectives are incriminated by an audio tape, secretly given to Wyler by Requin and verified in court by an audio expert, which appears to reveal them shooting the FBI agent after discussing a drug purchase.

Sokowski recommends that they escape, and provides them with a plan, but Tango refuses to go along with it. When Cash tries to escape, he finds Sokowski murdered and is attacked by prisoners.

A full-time, appointed village manager handles day-to-day community affairs; the first was Max Vogel in 1967. Briarcliff Manor's government operates from the village hall, which houses the Justice Court and offices of the mayor and village manager. As of February 2014, there are 5,531 registered voters in Briarcliff Manor. As of 2017 the village's government employed 69 people full-time, including their building department, planning board, department of public works, the recreation department, the police department, the architectural review advisory committee, and the conservation advisory council. The village government administered a 2017–18 operating budget of approximately 28 million which predominantly went towards public works, police protection, debt service, and recreational facilities and services.Briarcliff Manor maintains a voting custom that dates to at least around 1905. In addition to its customary general election, held at the same day in every municipality in New York, the village has a nonpartisan caucus, a town meeting-style forum to determine officeholders. The system of the People's Caucus is largely unique to the village, and has been described as an extension of the New England town hall concept. The People's Caucus, officially formed in 1946, chooses candidates by majority vote two months before the village election, where the candidates usually run unopposed, turning the election into a formality. The caucus is open to citizens of 18 years or over who have lived in the village for at least a month; voter registration is not required. Voters and candidates do not declare party affiliations, instead candidates present their platforms in early January of each year, and weeks later the caucus meets again to vote.In the Westchester County Board of Legislators, the western portion of Briarcliff Manor (in Ossining) is...

Movie title: No Strings Attached Movie plot: After first meeting at a summer camp as teenagers, Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) run into each other a few times as young adults but never keep in touch. Emma becomes a doctor in Los Angeles, Adam a production assistant for a musical television show. Adam's father Alvin (Kevin Kline), the well-known star of a former hit television comedy series, has begun a romance with Adam's ex-girlfriend, Vanessa (Ophelia Lovibond). Adam finds out, gets drunk and calls the women in his phone seeking a hookup. The next morning, he wakes on a sofa wearing nothing but a small towel. It turns out that he texted Emma and then came to the apartment she shares with some other residentsâPatrice (Greta Gerwig), Shira (Mindy Kaling), and Guy (Guy Branum). Once there, he took off all his clothes and then passed out. Emma leads Adam to her bedroom to retrieve his missing pants and they end up doing the dirty. The two do the dirty again at Adamâs house and before she leaves Adam agrees to her proposal for a casual relationship (as she puts it, using each other for the dirty and nothing else). Adam warns Emma about falling in love with him, but she dismisses the idea and sets ground rules to keep what theyâre doing from becoming too serious. At first things go well, but Adam becomes jealous when Sam (Ben Lawson)âanother residentâseeks her attention. Adam brings Emma a gift (a mix CD) and she rebuffs him, saying they should stop for a while and hook up with other people. But after being apart for two weeks Emma returns to Adam and they continue being sex friends only. Adam's birthday comes along a few months later. He goes out for dinner with Alvin and Vanessa, who announce their plan to have a baby together. Emma berates the other couple while defending Adam. He persuades her to go out together on Valentine's Day. Things fall apart when she becomes too uncomfortable during the date. An angry Emma advises Adam that he should find someone else who wonât hurt him. Adam tells Emma that he loves herâsomething... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"No Strings Attached,\\" as Emma and Adam enter Kate's (Adam's sister) wedding, they attend as friends and guests, attempting to maintain their casual relationship facade. At this point, they both have feelings for each other, but they haven't admitted or expressed those feelings explicitly. The wedding serves as a turning point in their relationship where they begin to confront the depth of emotions for each other. During the wedding, they share some emotional and intimate moments, which makes it difficult for them to keep their relationship strictly casual. It's at the wedding where Adam realizes he's truly in love with Emma, and he later confesses his feelings to her. This confession forces both characters to reevaluate their no-strings-attached arrangement and ultimately paves the way for them to admit their love and decide to give a real relationship a try."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","output":"In Spain, the minimum age to purchase tobacco products is 18 years old. This age limit is enforced by law and applies to both cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, such as snuff, cigars, and rolling tobacco. As part of a nationwide effort to reduce smoking rates and protect minors' health, Spain has implemented strict regulations on the sale and consumption of tobacco products. Some of these include: 1. Identification: Retailers are required to check identification to verify the age of customers before selling tobacco products. Failing to do so can result in fines and penalties for the establishment. 2. Vending machines: Tobacco vending machines are regulated to ensure that they are not accessible to minors. This includes placing them in designated smoking areas, inside establishments where minors are not allowed (such as bars), or operating them through a controlled system activated by the staff. 3. Advertising and promotion: Spain has a ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship. This means that tobacco companies may not advertise their products through traditional media channels, such as television, radio, and print media, or sponsor events. 4. Point-of-sale displays: Retailers must not make tobacco products clearly visible from outside the establishment, and they are required to display prominent health warnings at the point of sale. 5. Public places: Spain has laws in place prohibiting smoking in indoor public spaces, including restaurants, bars, offices, and public transportation. Outdoor smoking restrictions may also apply in certain areas, such as playgrounds, educational institutions, and healthcare facilities. 6. Health warnings: Spanish law requires that tobacco products carry large, graphic health warnings on the packaging. These warnings must cover at least 65% of the front and back of the package, in addition to the textual warning occupying 50% on one side. While the legal age to buy tobacco products in Spain is 18, it's important to remember that smoking can have severe negative effects on one's health, and it's always better to avoid smoking altogether or support those who wish to quit. There are various resources and support groups available, such as the Spanish Association Against Cancer (AECC) and the National Committee for Smoking Prevention (CNPT), to help prevent the initiation of smoking and assist in quitting for those who choose to do so."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer choices: - photomorphism  - phototropism  - photosynthesis  - peachleaf willow  - Conifers  - Exfoliation  - vegetation  - photochromic A:","output":"The correct answer is phototropism. Phototropism is the plant's tendency to grow toward the sun or any light source. This phenomenon is driven by the hormone auxin, which moves within the plant and influences its growth patterns in response to the direction and intensity of light.  Plants exhibit positive phototropism when their stems and leaves grow towards the light source, and negative phototropism when their roots grow away from light. This ensures that the photosynthetic parts of the plant receive adequate sunlight to perform photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This is essential for their growth and development. Now, let's briefly discuss the other terms mentioned in the list of answer choices to give you a better understanding of each one and why they are not the correct answer in this context: 1. Photomorphism: This term is not related to plant growth or movement, and it does not exist in the context of botany. 2. Photosynthesis: This is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. While it is related to a plant's interaction with sunlight, it is not the phenomenon that describes the tendency of plants to grow towards the sun. 3. Peachleaf Willow: This refers to a specific type of willow tree, Salix amygdaloides. It is not a term describing the plant's growth towards the sun. 4. Conifers: These are a group of gymnosperm plants, including pines, cedars, and spruces, that produce seeds in cones. This term refers to a classification of plants and not to the plant's growth towards sunlight. 5. Exfoliation: This is a geological term referring to the process by which layers of rock break away, often due to changes in temperature or moisture. It is not related to plant growth or movement. 6. Vegetation: This term broadly refers to plant life or the collective sum of plant species in a particular environment. It does not specifically describe a plant's growth behavior in relation to sunlight. 7. Photochromic: This term refers to technology, materials, or substances that change color when exposed to light, such as photochromic lenses in eyeglasses that darken upon exposure to sunlight. It does not describe plant growth or behavior in response to sunlight. In conclusion, phototropism is the correct answer as it is the term that specifically describes a plant's tendency to grow towards the sun or any light source. This growth behavior facilitates the process of photosynthesis and contributes to the overall well-being and survival of the plant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Australian wonder mare Black Caviar extended her unbeaten streak to 25 races in some style on Saturday, blowing away her rivals in the TJ Smith Stakes at Sydney's Randwick Racecourse. Her 25th victory was also her 15th at the sports highest level, overtaking the mark of 14 Group 1 wins set by the legendary Kingston Town in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was in 2011 that Black Caviar posted what many consider her greatest-ever performance in this very race, beating Hay List by three lengths after trailing him by the same distance coming into the home straight. On this occasion no such heroics were required. Facing one of her toughest-ever fields, including her old foe Hay List, admittedly not the force he once was, and the in-form Bel Sprinter, Black Caviar's regular rider Luke Nolen had to jockey for position in the early stages as he sought to overcome an unfavorable inside draw. The decisive move came around 300 meters out, when Nolen guided her away from the softer ground by the rail and settled her behind the leaders towards the middle of the track. From there, all Nolen had to do was pull the pin and the six-year-old instantly responded, lengthening away from the rest of the field with her to claim her eight consecutive Group 1 win. All day Sydneysiders had celebrated the presence of one of Australia's most popular sporting heroes. Flags in her trademark salmon and black colors fluttered over Sydney's iconic harbor, while the capacity crowd ensured Randwick Racecourse was filled the rafters. Speaking after the race, Black Caviar's trainer Peter Moody praised the crowd, adding that he was \\"extremely proud\\" of his mare for breaking Kingston Town's record. As Black Caviar was cheered on her way back to the winners' enclosure her jockey noted, \\"You can see what she means to racing. To be part of that -- words escape me.\\" With Black Caviar's form seemingly better than ever despite her age, her connections have hinted that a return to Royal Ascot, scene of her narrowest-ever victory, may be on the cards later this summer before a rendezvous with Frankel in the breeding shed in what would surely be considered the racing world's own royal wedding.

A Cezanne, it sells for a fabulous 515,000, the high point of the auction. When Bonnet's daughter, Nicole (Audrey Hepburn), hears the news on her car radio on her way home from work, she is shocked...and dismayed. The moment she arrives at their elegant old chateau, she runs upstairs calling her father. In his bedroom on the second floor, she opens the door to an antique wardrobe and steps inside, opens a false panel at the back of the wardrobe and climbs a hidden spiral staircase to her father's secret studio in the attic.Bonnet, it turns out, is a forger of fine art...cheerful and charming, but an unrepentant scoundrel. He is putting the finishing touches on his latest project, a flawless rendition of a famous lost Van Gogh. He has even found another painting from the same period, by an unknown artist, and has brushed dirt from the back of that canvas to transfer to his forgery. \\"I doubt if even Van Gogh himself would have gone to such pains with his work,\\" he boasts. \\"He didn't have to, Papa,\\" Nicole retorts, \\"he WAS Van Gogh!\\" She tells him in a tired voice (for what must surely be the thousandth time) that it's a crime to sell fake masterpieces.

Post in California SAN FRANCISCO — Declaring his candidacy for a job whose very power he questioned, Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco said that he was running for lieutenant governor of California on Friday. The announcement, which had been rumored for weeks, came a little more than four months after Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, dropped out of the race for governor in the face of sagging fund-raising and the expected candidacy of Jerry Brown, the state’s attorney general. Mr. Brown formally announced his candidacy last week in what is expected to a bruising and expensive battle for the state’s top job. For the less glamorous No. 2 position, Mr. Newsom said in a statement that he’d initially been unsure as to whether the lieutenant governor’s office was “the right place to lead a reform movement that has the power to shake up Sacramento.” But, he said, he’d been increasingly intrigued by “the broad, informal portfolio” of the position. “Big, bold ideas are the currency of this job and I plan on bringing many to the table,” he said. He’d also likely noticed recent political polls that show him leading the race. Mr. Newsom’s chief opponent in the primary in June will be Janice Hahn, the Los Angeles City councilwoman, who issued a short statement on Friday, citing a column in The San Francisco Chronicle suggesting that Mr. Newsom was becoming a career politician in the mold of former Gov. Gray Davis, who was recalled in 2003. There were signs that Mr. Newsom would be a formidable candidate. He has the backing of several major California politicians, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Another declared Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor – Dean Florez, the State Senate majority leader – dropped out of the race on Friday and threw his support behind Mr. Newsom. “As the African proverb says,” Mr. Florez wrote in a letter to supporters, “when the music changes, so must the dance.” Mr. Newsom, 42, has been a focus of national attention since 2004, when he ordered the city clerk in San Francisco to begin performing same-sex marriages at City Hall. That order, which was later stopped by judicial order, has led to protracted legal battles in the state over gay marriage, including a federal court challenge to Proposition 8, which bans such unions and was passed by California voters in 2008. Still popular in San Francisco — he was easily re-elected in 2007 — Mr. Newsom has been coy about his intentions after abandoning his bid for governor, telling Maureen Dowd, a columnist for The New York Times, in January that he would likely be working as “the clerk of a wine store” soon. Mr. Newsom, who made a tidy fortune in the wine business before entering politics, later said he was joking. Considered a graceful and charismatic speaker, Mr. Newsom has struggled with personal demons, including his admission in 2007 of a drinking problem after revelations of an affair with his campaign manager’s wife. He sought treatment. In 2008, he married Jennifer Siebel, an actress, who gave birth to the couple’s first child — a daughter, Montana — last fall. And while his earlier attempt to win statewide office landed with a thud, Mr. Newsom sounded confident of his chances on Friday. “I’ve learned a lot,” he said, “since my short campaign for governor.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom announces his candidacy for the position of California's lieutenant governor after dropping out of the governor's race due to sagging fundraising.

Nic is an obstetrician, and Jules is a housewife who is starting up a landscape design business. Each has given birth to a child using the same sperm donor. The younger child Laser (Josh Hutcherson) wants to find his sperm donor father but has to be 18 to do so. He implores his 18-year-old sister, Joni (Mia Wasikowska), to contact the sperm bank which identifies Paul (Mark Ruffalo) as the donor. The three meet. Joni is impressed by his bohemian lifestyle, and Paul becomes enthusiastic about being in their lives. Joni swears her brother to secrecy as she does not want to upset their mothers. However, Jules and Nic find out and invite Paul over to dinner. When Jules reveals she has a landscape business, Paul asks her to transform his back garden. Jules agrees, although Nic does not like the idea. While working for Paul, Jules likes that he appreciates her work in contrast to Nic who, Jules feels, never supported her career. Jules impulsively kisses Paul one afternoon, and they end up in bed together, beginning an affair. Jules and the kids start spending more time with Paul. Nic believes Paul undermines her authority over the children by, for example, giving Joni a ride on his motorcycleâwhich Nic has forbiddenâand by suggesting she give Joni more freedom. After a heated argument with Jules, Nic suggests they all have dinner at Paul's house to ease the tension. Nic relaxes and for the first time connects with Paul.

The father Horrify to a fear and poke enemies around you in 68 seconds Add punctuation.","output":"The father, horrified by the fear, took action and started to poke the enemies that were surrounding him, managing to complete this defensive feat within just 68 seconds. In this intense situation, the father unexpectedly found himself surrounded by his foes. His instincts kicked in and he was acutely aware of the rapid pounding of his heart as fear began to set in. Desperate to protect not only himself but also his loved ones, he decided that the only course of action was to launch an immediate counter-attack. The enemies, probably anticipating an easy victory, were caught off guard by the father's sudden burst of aggression. As he lunged at one after another, poking them with surprising force, his enemies began to scatter. Realizing that they may have underestimated their adversary, they tried to regroup, but their confusion and disarray only served to fuel the father's determination. This incredible display of bravery and impromptu strategizing unfolded within a mere 68 seconds - a short span of time that had a tremendous impact on the outcome of the confrontation. Each of the father's carefully aimed pokes served as a powerful reminder to the enemies that they should not have underestimated the power of a protective and determined individual. His actions not only incapacitated his enemies temporarily, but also instilled fear in them, as they were forced to reassess this previously perceived weak target. In this moment, the father was able to prove that one can accomplish great things under pressure if driven by a deep love for family and an unwavering will to survive. Confronting his fear turned out to be the crucial first step, as it allowed him to create an opportunity for escape and, ultimately, ensured the safety of those he held most dear. In this tale of events, punctuation was added to smooth the storyline and provide a pause for effect as well as emphasis: From the father's initial horrified reaction, to the enemies' underestimated approach, through the father's successful counter-attack, and finally to the lasting impact of his bravery; all of these well-punctuated moments crafted an engaging and inspiring narrative."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:Students, political activists and protesters - some as young as 14 - have vanished without a trace, according to a new report by Amnesty International. Many are alleged to have been held for months and often kept blindfolded and handcuffed for the entire period. Egypt's government has denied it uses enforced disappearances and torture. More than 1,000 people have been killed and 40,000 are believed to have been jailed since President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi led the military's overthrow of Mohammed Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected head of state, in 2013. Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Philip Luther, said enforced disappearances had become a \\"key instrument of state policy\\" under Mr Sisi and his Interior Minister, Magdy Abdul Ghaffar, who took office in March 2015. Citing local non-governmental organisations, Amnesty said that on average three to four people per day had been seized, usually when heavily armed security forces led by the National Security Agency (NSA) stormed their homes. Hundreds of people were thought to be held at the NSA's offices, inside the interior ministry's headquarters at Cairo's Lazoughly Square. Mr Luther said the report exposed collusion between the security services and judicial authorities, who he alleged had been \\"prepared to lie to cover their tracks or failed to investigate torture allegations, making them complicit in serious human rights violations\\". One of the cases in the report is that of 14-year-old Mazen Mohamed Abdallah, who was taken from his home in the Nasser City district of Cairo by NSA agents on 30 September and accused of being a member of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood and participating in unauthorised protests. Mazen said that after he denied the charges, interrogators repeatedly raped him with a wooden stick in order to force him to \\"memorise\\" a false confession, applied electric shocks to his genitals and other parts of his body, and threatened to arrest his parents if he retracted the confession. The boy retracted the confession when questioned by a prosecutor, but was still charged and only released from custody on 31 January to await trial, Amnesty said. Another of the cases featured in the report is that of Italian student Giulio Regeni. The 28-year-old Cambridge University PhD student was found dead on a roadside on the outskirts of Cairo in February, his body bearing signs of torture. The Egyptian authorities have denied any involvement in his killing, but Amnesty said its report had found \\"clear similarities\\" between his injuries and those of Egyptians who had died in custody. Following the publication of the report on Wednesday, the Egyptian foreign ministry issued a statement accusing Amnesty of being a \\"non-neutral organisation motivated by political stances aimed at tarnishing the image of Egypt\\". It said the ministry \\"would not comment\\" further, but added that Amnesty's reporting was one-sided and expressed \\"the viewpoints of individuals and parties hostile to the Egyptian state, while ignoring the Egyptian judiciary's handling of these cases\\". Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Amnesty International wrote a report saying that some students and protesters in Egypt, even young ones like 14 years old, are disappearing without anyone knowing where they are. Many of these people might be held by the government and some could be blindfolded and handcuffed for a long time. The government of Egypt says this is not true. A man named Philip Luther from Amnesty International says that this is a big problem that's happening under the current president of Egypt and other important people. Some people are being arrested and taken when security forces with big weapons go into their homes. Some cases in the report about this are very sad, like a 14-year-old boy named Mazen who says he was tortured to make a fake confession. The report also talks about a student from Italy who was found dead with signs of torture. The Egyptian government doesn't agree with this report and says it is one-sided and not fair."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","output":"Quinn would likely feel a mix of emotions following the event.  Step 1: Analyze the Action: To understand how Quinn will feel, it's essential to look at the situation. She was running from the police which implies she may have been involved in illegal activities or was in fear of getting caught for something. Jumping the fence is a desperate action suggesting escapism. Step 2: Emotional Consequence of Fear: The fear of being caught by the police would likely cause anxiety and panic. During the event, her adrenaline would be high, which provokes flight-or-fight response, causing her to experience significant stress. Step 3: Emotional Consequence of Escaping: After successfully jumping the fence, she might feel a sense of relief as the immediate threat is no longer present.  Step 4: Projecting Future Emotions: However, the relief could be short-lived, because the underlying cause of her running still exists.

As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future.

Please answer the following question: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii. It’s a reflection of expanding U.S.-China military ties, despite tensions over Beijing’s construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, some of which have been militarized. \\"We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea. China's landing bomber aircraft at Woody Island has also raised tensions,\\" the Pentagon statement said. \\"We have called on China to remove the military systems immediately and to reverse course on the militarization of disputed South China Sea features,\\" the statement added. \\"We believe these recent deployments and the continued... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the end of the text, how will the public view of China's military change? Options: - they may not be seen as trustworthy - not enough information - they will be seen as breaking their agreement not to militarize the Spratly islands - they may not be asked back to RIMPAC Answer:","output":"After the end of the text, the public view of China's military may change in several ways.  Firstly, they may not be seen as trustworthy, as China is perceived to have destabilized the region through its activities in the South China Sea, which led to their disinvitation from the 2018 RIMPAC exercise. Being disinvited from such a major international maritime exercise could harm China's reputation and raise questions about the country's intentions and trustworthiness in the international community. Secondly, the public may view China as breaking their agreement not to militarize the Spratly Islands. The presence of anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile systems, and electronic jammers, as well as landing bomber aircraft at Woody Island, implies that China has not upheld its commitment to avoid militarization of disputed features in the region. This could further damage China's credibility and create skepticism about its commitments on the global stage. Lastly, China may not be asked back to participate in future RIMPAC exercises as a result of their actions in the South China Sea. The disinvitation to the 2018 RIMPAC exercise serves as an \\"initial\\" response, and it is not specified what other steps may be taken. It can be inferred that there may potentially be more consequences for China's actions, and one such consequence could be exclusion from future RIMPAC exercises. While there might not be enough information to determine the exact public perception of China's military after this text, it is evident that China's actions have raised concerns among the international community, potentially leading to negative perceptions about their trustworthiness, credibility, and possible exclusion from major military exercises like RIMPAC in the future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the fact \\"the Himalayas were formed by rock folding\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"Rocks folded over and over which developed\\"   (a). tall areas;  (b). wet rivers;  (c). large trees;  (d). grassy yards;","output":"The correct answer to the given question or completion \\"Rocks folded over and over which developed\\" is (a). Tall areas. The Himalayas, also referred to as the \\"abode of snow,\\" is an iconic mountain range situated in South Asia, extending for over 2,400 kilometers across the borders of five countries—India, Nepal, Bhutan, China (Tibet), and Pakistan. The Himalayas were formed by rock folding, specifically due to the movement of tectonic plates. Around 225 million years ago, the supercontinent Pangaea began to fracture and divide. Eventually, around 50 million years ago, the Indian Plate started to move northward and collided with the Eurasian Plate. The immense force generated by this extraordinary collision caused the rocks to fold, buckle, and lift, resulting in the formation of magnificent mountains, such as Mount Everest and K2. Slowly but consistently over millions of years, these collisions led to the gradual rise and uplifting of the rocks, thus developing tall areas like towering peaks and deep valleys. The process is ongoing, and the mountain range continues to grow as the Indian Plate is still moving and exerting pressure. It is because of this continuous rock folding and the uplifting of Earth's crust that we have the tall peaks of the Himalayas today. The other options, (b) wet rivers, (c) large trees, and (d) grassy yards, although co-exist with the Himalayan ecosystem, are not the direct result of rock folding. The Himalayas also hold a vital role in climate, biodiversity, and water distribution. The formation of tall areas and mountains influences weather patterns, affecting the distribution of rain and hence supports glacier formation, generating wet rivers. In addition, the elevation gradient and climatic conditions have created a diverse range of ecosystems, resulting in varied habitats ranging from alpine meadows to subtropical rainforests, promoting the growth of large trees as well as grassy yards. Thus, the formation of tall areas directly impacts the features mentioned in options (b), (c), and (d)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Short movie review: the creative animation work  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the short movie review provided, \\"the creative animation work,\\" it is difficult to determine whether the critic has a positive or negative opinion towards the movie. The review is too brief to make a judgment call on the critic's opinion. However, if we are to read into the words used in the review, \\"creative animation work,\\" it can be inferred that the critic appreciates the artistic and innovative efforts made in the animation department. The use of the word \\"creative\\" often implies a sense of originality, which is generally a positive aspect in the realm of art and cinema. In this case, the critic seems to be expressing a positive opinion on the animation aspect of the movie. Nevertheless, the absence of more specific details regarding the movie, such as its storyline, characters, or the overall theme, means that the critic's opinion on the film as a whole remains ambiguous. A review that only touches upon one aspect of the movie may suggest that the critic might not have found the other components of the movie as noteworthy, either positively or negatively. To get a clearer understanding of whether the critic viewed the movie in a positive or negative light, it's crucial to know more about their thoughts on other central elements of the film. For instance, did they like the story, were the characters engaging and well-developed, was the pacing apt, and did they think the movie delivered a powerful message? Even with innovative animation and creative visuals, a movie could still be seen as lacking if these other key components of the movie-watching experience fail to impress or engage the critic. In conclusion, based solely on the short movie review, \\"the creative animation work,\\" it is not possible to accurately determine if the critic's overall opinion of the movie is positive or negative. However, the review does seem to reflect a positive appreciation of the animation efforts put into the film. To gain a better understanding of the critic's stance, more information and a fuller analysis of their thoughts on the movie would be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That's the situation for Brad Gana, a Texas man whose home was washed away in 2008 by Hurricane Ike who continued to make its mortgage payments, before the bank arrived, confiscating whatever items they could get. 'I was shocked when they said they were foreclosing on it,' Brad Gana told investigator Amy Davis, according to KPRC-TV. 'Shocked': Brad Gana says he paid all of his mortgage payments on time, despite no longer having a house to live in after a natural disaster, but his bank still foreclosed on him ' OPTIONS: - Amy Davis is ruthless in their incompetency,' Mr Gana responded. - Bank of America is ruthless in their incompetency,' Mr Gana responded. - Brad Gana is ruthless in their incompetency,' Mr Gana responded. - Daily Mail is ruthless in their incompetency,' Mr Gana responded. - Hurricane Ike is ruthless in their incompetency,' Mr Gana responded. - KPRC-TV is ruthless in their incompetency,' Mr Gana responded. - Texas is ruthless in their incompetency,' Mr Gana responded.","output":"Considering the given options, I choose the ending in which the blame is directed appropriately towards the bank, since they are the ones who foreclosed on the house despite the mortgage payments being made.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the specific suite of rooms that briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by King Edward VIII? , can you please find it?   Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was building the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion was once again plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece designed by Robert Jones and sculpted by Richard Westmacott. It was formerly in the Music Room at the Brighton Pavilion. The ornate clock, known as the Kylin Clock, was made in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, China, in the second half of the 18th century; it has a later movement by Benjamin Vulliamy circa 1820. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre Room behind its glass doors. This is a Chinese-style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary, who, working with the designer Sir Charles Allom, created a more \\"binding\\" Chinese theme in the late 1920s, although the lacquer doors were brought from Brighton in 1873.

In the provided sentence, people are actively engaged in the act of reading a small brochure.

Therefore, since the sentence presents people performing an action that necessitates the ability to read, we can infer that the individuals mentioned belong to a group of people who possess the necessary literacy skills. It is important to note, however, that although the sentence \\"There are a group of people who can read\\" is true, it doesn't convey the full scope of information provided by the original sentence about what those people are specifically doing.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What happens the night after Romulus is crowned? Title: The Last Legion Movie plot: The film is narrated by Ambrosinus, native to Britain, who knows of a legend concerning the sword of Julius Caesar, which was hidden away from evil men. It begins shortly before the coronation of Romulus Augustulus as Emperor in 475. Having traveled through much of the known world in search of Caesar's sword, Ambrosinus has then become the tutor to the young Romulus. A Druid and part of a secret brotherhood protecting the sword, he at times gives the impression he is a magician, but his \\"magic\\" is usually revealed to be simple trickery. One of the running concepts of the movie surrounds the question of whether or not Ambrosinus has any actual magical abilities or simply an illusionist. Romulus's father Orestes rules Rome but is not Emperor himself. On the day before the coronation, Odoacer, commander of the barbarian Goths allied with Rome, demands a third of Italy from Orestes, but is rebuffed. The same day, Romulus meets the general of the Nova Invicta Legion, Aurelianus Caius Antonius, called \\"Aurelius\\". The night after Romulus is crowned, Rome is attacked by the Goths. Most of Aurelius's men, pledged to protect the emperor, are killed, though Aurelius is only stunned and left for dead. Orestes and his wife are killed by Odoacer's lieutenant Wulfila, who captures Romulus. The next day, Odoacer, now ruler of the Western Empire, plans to have Romulus killed. However, Ambrosinus convinces Odoacer to spare the boy. Instead, Romulus is exiled to Capri along with Ambrosinus, guarded by Wulfila and his men. His prison is a villa constructed more than four centuries earlier by the emperor Tiberius. With Ambrosinus's help, Romulus discovers a hidden chamber within the villa. He comes across a statue of Caesar holding the fabled sword, forged by a Chalybian smith after his military campaigns in Britain. Writing near the statue's feet proclaims the sword was made for \\"he who is destined to rule\\". This is interpreted as a prophecy by various characters, and Romulus keeps the weapon.

Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop.

Write some highlights for the following article: To match their skirts, flipflops and everything else in their doll-filled bedrooms, the girls have theirs in pink. The boys, of course, choose blue. But these are not toys, they are real guns — a U.S. gun-maker’s range of .22 calibre, single-shot rifles marketed for young children. The ‘youth model’ of the Crickett firearm, which is sold in a ‘My First Rifle’ range, are snapped up by American parents enthusiastic to introduce children to the joys of gun ownership. The youngest of the gun-toting girls pictured here is just six, the oldest eight. Hayley, six, from Kentucky claims she wants her rifle equipped with telescopic sights as she's afraid of sharks. Eight-year-old Abbey from Ohio wants her .22 caliber rifle in case she ever has to deal with a dinosaur. These portraits of children taken in their homes provide a disturbing insight into U.S. gun culture, a highly controversial subject that was reawakened this week by the fatal shooting of an instructor as he taught a nine-year-old girl to fire an Uzi submachine gun. Charles Vacca, 39, was accidentally shot in the head during a ‘Bullets and Burgers’ day at an outdoor range called The Last Stop in Arizona. He was standing next to the child, who was wearing pink shorts and a braided ponytail, as she fired the lethal weapon in single-shot mode before he told her to switch it to automatic. Yesterday's Daily Mail told the tragic story of how a nine-year-old girl accidentally shot a man dead with an Uzi. His last words, captured on video by her parents, were: ‘All right, full auto.’ The recoil from the gun — which is notorious for rising as it fires — made it jerk back in the girl’s hands, shooting her instructor in the head. The range is one of many throughout America that allow children as young as five to shoot .22 rifles under supervision. Other ranges even offer children’s party packages. Many appalled Americans castigated the girl’s parents for putting such a lethal firearm in her hands, but Arizona prosecutors refused to blame them, saying Mr Vacca was guilty of negligence for failing to keep his hand on the gun and was responsible for his own death. Charles Vacca, 39, left, was accidentally shot dead by the small girl, right, as she fired the Uzi sub machine gun. An almost identical lethal accident happened six years ago. Eight-year-old Christopher Bizilj was firing a 9mm micro Uzi at pumpkins at a gun fair in Massachusetts. The gun kicked back and the boy shot himself in the face and died. Only one state took any action as a result of the boy’s death. Connecticut adopted a law banning anyone under 16 from handling machine guns at shooting ranges. The latest tragedy comes just a month after a new report highlighted the growing number of accidental gun deaths among children. The report, compiled by groups campaigning for tighter firearms controls, claimed that almost two children are killed on average in the U.S. every week, mostly at home. Belgian photographer An-Sofie Kesteleyn took these shocking portraits after being horrified by a news report about a boy of five accidentally shooting dead his two-year-old sister with a Crickett rifle in Kentucky. Seven-year-old Abby, pictured, from Kentucky says she is afraid of both zombies and burglars. Lily, 6, from Louisiana, told photographer An-Sofie Kesteleyn that she was afraid of zombies. Young girls in America even have the opportunity to buy special pink gun cases for their pink rifles. She visited gun shops and ranges to find her subjects and said they were given the rifles by enthusiastic parents: ‘I got the feeling the parents were more into it than the kids,’ she says. ‘The adults were big gun users and wanted the children to learn how to shoot. I thought it was weird.’ She also asked the children what they were scared of that made them want guns. The Cricketts cost from 150 to 225 (£90 to £135) — considerably cheaper than the latest video games consoles — and are sold by a company in Pennsylvania called Keystone Sporting Arms. It sells around 60,000 a year, according to its website, which calls them ‘quality firearms for America’s youth’. It says the pink models have ‘brought more young women to the sport of shooting than ever before’. Matching pink gun cases are available. The website adds that the Crickett rifle is ‘ideally sized for children four to ten years old’. Miss Kesteleyn said the children she photographed were from responsible, well-off or middle-class families. The Crickett website says: ‘Warning: like all firearms this rifle should only be shot by a minor with adult super-vision at all times.’ But that was not enough to stop tragic accidents.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The best time to work out varies from person to person, as it depends on individual preferences, daily schedules, and body rhythms. Both morning and evening workouts have their own advantages and some potential drawbacks. Let's consider these factors to determine which may be more suitable for you. Morning workouts: Pros: 1. Kick-starts your metabolism: Exercising in the morning can jump-start your metabolism, allowing you to burn more calories throughout the day. 2. Enhances mood and energy levels: A morning workout can provide you with a mood and energy boost that will carry you through the day. It can help increase the production of endorphins, which improve your mood and reduce stress. 3. Consistency and discipline: Morning workouts tend to be more consistent. By exercising first thing in the morning, you are less likely to have scheduling conflicts or distractions that could cause you to skip your workout. 4. Improved focus: Morning exercise may improve your focus and concentration throughout the day, making you more productive. 5. Better sleep: Working out in the morning may improve the quality of your sleep, as exercising in the evening could potentially disrupt your sleep cycle. Cons: 1. Time constraints: Fit a workout into a busy morning schedule may be challenging for some people. 2. Potential for injury: Your muscles and joints are typically tighter in the morning, which could increase the risk of injury if you don't warm up properly. Evening workouts: Pros: 1. More energy and strength: Some people find that they have more energy and strength in the evening after a day of eating and hydrating, which can make their workouts more effective and enjoyable. 2. Stress relief: Exercising in the evening can help relieve stress and tension from the day. 3. Greater muscle flexibility: Your muscles are typically more warmed up and flexible in the evening, which can reduce the risk of injury during your workout. 4. More time for preparation: Evening workouts can allow for extra time to mentally and physically prepare, stretch and hydrate, without feeling rushed. Cons: 1. Decreased consistency: Evening schedules can be more variable and prone to last-minute conflicts, making it difficult to maintain a consistent workout routine. 2. Disruptions to sleep: Exercising too close to bedtime may raise your adrenaline and energy levels, which could interfere with your sleep cycle. Concerning the two questions you have asked, \\"Which is the best time to workout, morning or evening?\\" and \\"Is it better to hit the gym in the morning or evening?\\", they essentially have the same meaning. Both questions seek to determine the ideal time of day to exercise for individual preference, lifestyle, and specific goals. In conclusion, the best time to work out depends on your personal preferences and needs. Some individuals may thrive on morning workouts, while others may find evening workouts more suitable. Experimenting with both options, in addition to evaluating your lifestyle, commitments, and daily routine, will help you identify the optimal time to incorporate exercise for maximum benefits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She turns down the elder Spotswoode's bribe to leave Jimmy alone. She telephones two men she has been blackmailing, Cleaver and Mannix, and demands one final generous gift from each of them by the next day. She makes the same request of \\"creepy\\" admirer Dr. Lindquist. Her ex-husband Tony Sheel eavesdrops and wants half, but she refuses to give him anything, even after he hits her.

After he reaches the lobby of her building, he and another person hear screams from her place. They knock on the door, but she assures them that she is fine.

Question: A flatbed truck has a really rough time driving over a landfill and a rather easy time driving over a parking lot. Which surface will let the flatbed truck travel a greater distance? (A) landfill (B) parking lot Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we need to consider the factors that would contribute to a flatbed truck's ability to travel a greater distance: 1. Surface conditions: A landfill has an uneven, rough surface with waste materials and potential obstacles, while a parking lot has a flat, smooth, and paved surface. 2. Traction: A flatbed truck can better maintain traction on a parking lot because of its even and better-constructed surface, while a landfill's surface may often be slippery and unstable due to waste materials and decomposition. 3. Fuel efficiency and speed: On a smooth surface like a parking lot, a flatbed truck would likely be able to travel at higher speeds without the need to frequently slow down or change directions. This results in better fuel efficiency and allows the truck to travel a greater distance. 4. Safety: A parking lot is generally safer to drive on than a landfill due to the absence of hazardous materials, reduced risk of getting stuck, and better visibility. Given these factors, the surface that would allow the flatbed truck to travel a greater distance is the parking lot (B).

Article: Welcome to the world of multitasking -- a place where the measure of a person is how many jobs they can perform at the same time. In fact, if experts are to be believed, multitasking is a disastrous idea. One of the opponents of multitasking is Dr. Clifford Nass, a professor at Stanford University. \\"People who multitask frequently are less able to pay attention; they're worse at managing their memory.\\" he said. In his opinion, the loss that we get with multitasking is harmless in some situations, for example, part of doing business in the digital world: but you can't do serious work like writing, thinking or solving an important problem this way. You do worse even as you think you're doing better. All the time the research points to a simple fact: the brain cannot cope. When you stop midway through composing a report to check an email, you force your brain to stop and regroup. It is like pressing the pause button during a movie, meaning the film takes longer to watch. And as for Dr. Nass, the problems extend beyond the brain. Young people who frequently multitask are not as socially and emotionally healthy as those who don't. They just feel more emotionally satisfied and the feeling is so good and they are bound to desire it again. Todd Oppenheimer, a writer said \\"We've become a very short-term society and don't reward people for taking a lot of time on something.\\" He fears we may end up losing the next generation of great thinkers. \\"It's really unfortunate because the long-term challenges of our world -- environmental issues, financial issues -- require people to think wisely about the long-term consequences of what they do. And it's no coincidence that the kind of people who do think long-term don't multitask.\\" Question: According to Dr. Nass, multitasking   _  .

Here is a hypothesis: The outlook of the government is subject to wide ranging and change. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. However, it is essential to analyze the given premise and hypothesis in detail to provide context and justification for this conclusion.  Premise: The outlook for government saving over the next 75 years is subject to wide ranging uncertainty due to economic changes and future legislation. The premise suggests that there is considerable uncertainty in the government's ability to save over the next 75 years due to external factors such as economic changes and future legislation. Economic changes refer to the variations and shifts in the economy, including fluctuations in growth, recessions, inflation, and other macroeconomic factors that can impact government saving. Future legislation, on the other hand, refers to potential new laws and regulations that might be enacted by the government in the future, further affecting its capacity to save. Thus, the premise establishes that the government's saving outlook is vulnerable and unpredictable because of the influence of various external factors over an extended timeframe. Hypothesis: The outlook of the government is subject to wide ranging and change. The hypothesis is a broader statement that implies that the government's outlook, not just its saving outlook, is subject to extensive and varying influences. An 'outlook' can encompass various aspects of government function such as fiscal, social, political, and economic dimensions. Although the hypothesis is more generalized than the premise, it does not contradict it. Instead, it reaffirms the idea that the government is susceptible to wide-ranging influences and changes, as mentioned in the premise concerning government saving and the factors affecting it. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise provides a specific example of an outlook – government saving – that is subject to uncertainty due to external factors, thus supporting the broader idea that the government's overall outlook is subject to wide-ranging influences and changes, as stated in the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question Like other American research universities, Northwestern was transformed by World War II. Franklyn B. Snyder led the university from 1939 to 1949, when nearly 50,000 military officers and personnel were trained on the Evanston and Chicago campuses. After the war, surging enrollments under the G.I. Bill drove drastic expansion of both campuses. In 1948 prominent anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits founded the Program of African Studies at Northwestern, the first center of its kind at an American academic institution. J. Roscoe Miller's tenure as president from 1949 to 1970 was responsible for the expansion of the Evanston campus, with the construction of the lakefill on Lake Michigan, growth of the faculty and new academic programs, as well as polarizing Vietnam-era student protests. In 1978, the first and second Unabomber attacks occurred at Northwestern University. Relations between Evanston and Northwestern were strained throughout much of the post-war era because of episodes of disruptive student activism, disputes over municipal zoning, building codes, and law enforcement, as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol near campus until 1972.

Craig was caught shaving his legs unlike Eric because","output":"Craig had always been a little more self-conscious about his appearance than Eric. He believed that having smooth, hairless legs could make him feel more confident in his athletic pursuits and overall life. Eric, on the other hand, never really paid much attention to his appearance or the grooming habits of others. Craig's decision to shave his legs was influenced by several factors. First and foremost, he looked up to professional athletes, particularly swimmers and cyclists, who shaved their legs to achieve a more aerodynamic edge during competitions. Craig admired their dedication to their sport and the minutiae of their routine, something that Eric didn't seem to understand or appreciate. Another reason behind Craig's decision was the social aspect of it. He noticed that many of his friends and acquaintances, both male and female, preferred the look of smooth, hairless legs. They commented on how it made them feel clean and more attractive. This, in turn, made Craig more aware of his own body hair and prompted him to give shaving his legs a try. However, this decision was not without challenges for Craig. He had to learn the proper technique for achieving a close shave without irritating his skin or causing cuts and nicks. He also dealt with the occasional ridicule from people like Eric, who found leg-shaving to be an odd or unnecessary habit, particularly for men. In spite of the criticism, Craig was unwavering in his decision. He felt that dedicating time and effort to maintaining his appearance was just another form of self-care, much like exercising or eating a balanced diet. It became a ritual for him to meticulously shave his legs, taking as much time as needed to achieve the desired results. This act served as a reminder of the discipline and commitment he aimed to apply in other aspects of his life. Eric, on the other hand, had a more laid-back approach to personal grooming. He saw no need to remove any body hair, as it didn't bother him physically or aesthetically. In a sense, Eric prided himself on embracing his natural look, with a tinge of defiance toward societal beauty standards. This difference in their grooming habits often led to subtle tension between Craig and Eric. While they were still good friends, they couldn't help but secretly judge one another's choices. Craig perceived Eric's disregard for shaving his legs as laziness or a lack of self-care, whereas Eric viewed Craig's shaving routine as vanity and excessive concern with appearance. In the end, despite their disagreement on this particular aspect of self-care, both Craig and Eric maintained a strong friendship. They learned to accept their differences as simply a matter of personal preference and enjoyed some friendly banter about the subject every now and then. It's vital to respect each person's choice regarding the care and presentation of their own body and understand that everyone's preferences and priorities are unique. As long as the choice stems from a place of self-love or self-expression, it's all a part of one's personal journey toward contentment and empowerment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Willingness to pay is not affected by mortality risk. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?  A. yes; B. it is not possible to tell; C. no;","output":"C. no The premise and hypothesis provided seem to have opposite assumptions. The premise states that population affected and the mortality risk facing that population are believed to affect the average willingness to pay (WTP) to reduce the risk. This means that if people perceive a risk to the population's mortality as higher, they are more likely to be willing to pay more to reduce that risk. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that willingness to pay is not affected by mortality risk, implying that regardless of the perceived risk to the population's mortality, it will not influence how much individuals are willing to pay to mitigate that risk. Given these opposite assumptions, we can infer that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In fact, the premise seems to challenge the hypothesis by suggesting that the willingness to pay is affected by the mortality risk facing a population. For clarity, let's break down the concepts and relationships present in both the premise and hypothesis. 1. Willingness to Pay (WTP) - how much individuals are ready and able to pay to reduce a certain risk. This could be in terms of monetary contribution, time spent, or resources allocated. 2. Population Affected - the number of people in the population who might be exposed to a certain risk. 3. Mortality Risk - the probability or potential of death within the population. 4. Relationship between variables - the premise suggests a positive correlation between population affected, mortality risk, and the willingness to pay. As the population affected and mortality risk increase, it is believed that WTP will also increase. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that there is no relationship between willingness to pay and mortality risk. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Instead, the premise contradicts the hypothesis by suggesting a relationship between the variables that is not acknowledged in the hypothesis. The hypothesis denies such a relationship, positing that WTP is not influenced by the mortality risk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hillary Clinton ‘Appalled’ By Trump Response to Supporter’s Anti-Muslim Remark DURHAM, N.H.âDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said Friday she was appalled by Donald Trumpâs response to a man who said Muslims are a âproblemâ in America and who wrongly charged that President Barack Obama is a Muslim who is not an American. Speaking with reporters after a campaign event, the former secretary of stateÂ said she was âcalling on him and anybody else who is seeking the highest office in the land to start behaving like a president, to show respect and to start standing up for the truth.â At a Trump town hall meeting Thursday in Rochester, N.H.,Â a man asserted, âWeâve got a problem in this country, itâs called Muslims. We know the president is one.â He added: âYou know heâs not even an American.â Those rumors have circulated for years but were debunked long ago. The questioner also asked Mr. Trump what he would do to address Muslim âtraining campsâ in the nation, where people âwant to kill us” and asked him, “When can we get rid of âem?â Mr. Trump didnât refute the premise. âWeâre going to be looking a lot of different things. A lot of people are saying that and a lot of people are saying bad things are happening out there,” he said. At the White House on Friday, spokesman Josh Earnest said the comments at Mr. Trump’s rally were “offensive” and said that they represent a popular strain in GOP politics. “Is anybody really surprised that this happened at a Donald Trump rally? I don’t think anybody who’s been paying attention to Republican politics is at all surprised,” Mr.Â Earnest told reporters. “The reason for that is that the people who hold these offensive views are — these offensive views are part of Mr. Trump’s base, and Mr. Trump himself would be the first to tell you that he’s got the biggest base of any Republican politician these days.” Asked how she would have handled such a situation, Mrs. Clinton said that this man never would have come to one of her events but if he did, she would have told him that his comments were out of bounds and âtotally factually untrue.â She said Mr. Trump, the celebrity businessman who is leading the Republican presidential field, should have done the same. âHe knew or should have known what that man was asking was not only way out of bounds. It was untrue, and he should have from the beginning repudiated that kind of rhetoric, that level of hatefulness,â she said. Asked whether he should apologize, she said his decision to break from the campaign trail gives him a chance to rethink his response and express his regret. âLetâs find out. Letâs see what he does,â she said. Her comments followed a town hall-style meeting at the University of New Hampshire focused on college affordability. There, she vowed to fight Republicans on their policy differences and also called for more civility in public life. Asked about how to attack childhood poverty, she listed several proposals including better access to preschool and an increase in the minimum wage. She then added: âThereâs no government program for this but we have to be kinder to each other. We have to quit looking down on each other. We have to end the hateful mean-spirited rhetoric we hear from Trump and others.â At the forum, she also was formally endorsed by New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, who said she had a record of leadership and âclear visionâ for America. Republican front-runner Donald Trump on Thursday declined to refute a questioner who declared that Muslims are a âproblemâ in America and reiterated the long-debunked rumor that President Barack Obama is a Muslim. ______________________________________________________ 2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls | 2016 Poll Standings Politics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

SINGAPORE — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed Tuesday \\"to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\\" during a historic summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who then unexpectedly said he was suspending military drills with South Korea. Kim's commitment to denuclearize was included in a document signed after the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader. It calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides promised to hold follow-up negotiations. While the document didn't lay out a specifics regarding denuclearization, Trump said at a news conference \\"We're starting that process very quickly. Very, very quickly, absolutely.\\" \\"We're going to denuke North Korea,\\" Trump also told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren, adding that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announcing one concession long-sought by North Korea not included in the document signed earlier in the day. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said, referring to the U.S. participation in joint military exercises with South Korea. At his news conference, Trump said the war games were expensive, provocative and inappropriate. ​Later, a Pentagon spokesman said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was \\"not surprised\\" by Trump's concession ending the war games and had been consulted, including discussions with Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \\"We welcome the outcomes,\\" the defense spokesman said. \\"We support them.\\" Trump struck an optimistic tone about his talks with Kim. \\"My meeting with Chairman Kim was honest, direct and productive. We got to know each other well in a very confined period of time.\\" The U.S. leader stressed that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" How likely is it that the signed document led to the any real change in North Korea's nuclear production? - highly probable - it was guaranteed effective - not enough information - not very likely","output":"The signed document between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump indicated a commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. However, the document did not provide specific details regarding the process of denuclearization and did not offer any guarantees. While the two countries have promised to participate in follow-up negotiations, it is difficult to determine the likelihood of real change in North Korea's nuclear production based solely on the signed document. Ultimately, there is not enough information to confidently predict the outcome or effectiveness of the agreement in achieving complete denuclearization."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Space vegetables are grown from seeds   that have been taken to space and brought back to the earth. The seeds are affected by the radiation   and low gravity in space. When they are brought back to the earth, these seeds produce vegetables that are bigger and healthier than normal vegetables. However, some people worry about eating space vegetables. They think that space vegetables might not be good for us and could make us get sick because of the radiation in space. However, people should not be frightened because space vegetables are very healthy. Here are some facts that you should know about space vegetables. Space vegetables are grown from seeds that are carefully chosen. When seeds are brought back from space, they are tested to make sure that they will be safe to eat. Space vegetables are better for you than normal vegetables. For example, space tomatoes stay fresh for twenty days, which is one week longer than normal tomatoes. After genetically modified   food appeared in the market, people worried that they were eating unknown things. For example, if nut genes   are put inside potatoes, people allergic   to nuts might get sick from eating these potatoes because they do not know they are also eating nuts. Unlike genetically modified food, space vegetables have not been genetically changed. This means that no new genes are put into the vegetables. Therefore, there are no dangers of eating something unknown. Question: According to the passage, normal tomatoes can stay fresh for about   _   days.

Given the question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him.  Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week.  The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey.  The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.  Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.  Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump... Question: How long was the publicity campaign for Comey's book?

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Baby girls make their way directly for dolls as soon as they can crawl, while boys will head for cars, a study has shown. The findings, the first to show differences in very young babies, suggest there is a biological basis to their preferences. Psychologists Dr Brenda Todd from City University London carried out an experiment involving 90 babies aged 9 months to 36 months. The babies were allowed to choose from seven toys. Some were typically boys' toys ---- a car, a digger, a ball and a blue teddy. The rest were girls' toys: a pink teddy, a doll and a cooking set. They were placed a meter away from the toys;and could pick whichever toy they liked their choice and the amount of time they spent playing with each toy were recorded. Of the youngest children (9 to 14 months), girls spent significantly longer playing with the doll than boys, and boys spent much more time with the car and ball than the girls did. Among the two and three-year-olds, girls spent 50 percent of the time playing with the doll while only two boys briefly touched it. The boys spent almost 90 percent of their time playing with cars, which the girls barely touched. There was no link between the parents' view on which toys were more appropriate for boys or girls, and the children's choice. Dr Brenda Todd said, \\"Children of this age are already exposed to much socialization. Boys may be given 'toys that go' while girls get toys they can care for, which may help shape their preference. But these findings agree with the former idea that children show natural interests in particular kinds of toys. There could be a biological basis for their choices. Males through evolution have been adapted to prefer: moving objects, probably through hunting instincts , while girls prefer warmer colors such as pink, the colour of a newborn baby.\\" Options: A Adults purposely influence their babies' preference.

It is a surprising fact that the population ageing is particularly rapid in developing countries.For example,it took France 115 years for the proportion of older people to double from 7 percent to 14 percent.It is estimated to take China a mere 27 years to achieve this same increase. What are the implications of these increased numbers of older folk?One of the biggest worries for governments is that the longer people live,the more likelihood there is for diseases and for disability.Attention is being paid to the need to keep people as healthy as possible,including during old age,to lessen the financial burden on the state. Another significant problem is the need for the younger generations to understand and value  the older people in their society.In some African countries,certainly in Asia,older people are  respected and regarded as the ones with special knowledge.Yet traditions are fading away daily,which does not ensure the continued high regard of older people.As society changes,attitudes will change.

Article:","output":"Title: Renowned German Nutcracker Maker, Steinbach, Files for Bankruptcy Introduction Steinbach, a prestigious German manufacturer of traditional wooden nutcrackers and a symbol of German craftsmanship, has officially filed for bankruptcy. Known for their intricate design and exquisite workmanship, Steinbach's nutcrackers have been a staple in collectors’ homes and as a part of festive decorations for generations. The company's recent financial troubles are a reflection of the changing market demands and the challenges faced by traditional industries in the modern era. History of Steinbach Founded in 1928 by Herrmann Steinbach, the company has a long-standing history of producing high-quality, handcrafted wooden nutcrackers in the Erzgebirge region of Germany. This mountainous area has a rich heritage in woodworking, with many skilled artisans crafting unique works of art from locally-sourced wood. Steinbach nutcrackers quickly gained international recognition for their detailed designs and impeccable quality, making them a sought-after collectible item. In its prime, Steinbach employed a dedicated team of master craftsmen who painstakingly created each nutcracker by hand, following age-old techniques passed down through generations. The company offered a wide range of designs, including historical figures, beloved fairytale characters, and traditional German folklore motifs. Every nutcracker was carefully assembled from precisely carved wooden parts, which were then painted and adorned with fine materials, such as real hair and hand-sewn clothing. Reasons for Bankruptcy The financial troubles faced by Steinbach can be attributed to several factors: 1. Changing Consumer Tastes: The demand for traditional handcrafted items has declined in recent years, with consumers moving toward more contemporary, mass-produced products. This shift in preference has affected the sales of Steinbach's nutcrackers, which were primarily marketed as high-value collectibles. 2. High Production Costs: The intricate crafting process and the use of high-quality materials make the production of Steinbach nutcrackers expensive. While the company tried to maintain a competitive price, it struggled to cover the rising costs of production and stay profitable. 3. Economic Uncertainties: The economic downturn and global financial crises in recent years have impacted consumer spending on luxury goods and collectibles, further exacerbating the sales decline experienced by Steinbach. 4. Competition: In addition to economic influences, Steinbach faced stiff competition from other nutcracker manufacturers, who offered cheaper, mass-produced alternatives. With fewer nutcracker enthusiasts willing to pay a premium for Steinbach's handcrafted workmanship, the company struggled to maintain a steady flow of orders. The Impact of Steinbach's Bankruptcy on the Nutcracker Industry Steinbach's bankruptcy has sent shockwaves through the nutcracker industry, highlighting the vulnerabilities faced by traditional manufacturers in the modern market. Many worry that the closure of such a prestigious company may mark the beginning of the end for the handcrafted wooden nutcracker industry. The loss of Steinbach will also likely impact the Erzgebirge region, which thrived due to the tourism generated by collectors and enthusiasts of traditional wooden crafts. The closure of Steinbach could result in the loss of jobs and reduced opportunities for future generations of local artisans. Conclusion The bankruptcy of Steinbach, a symbol of traditional German craftsmanship and a staple in holiday decorations, is a stark reminder of the challenges faced by artisanal industries in the modern world. The company's closure not only represents the end of an era for collectors, but also the potential decline of an industry that has been a part of German heritage for centuries. Whether other nutcracker manufacturers will follow in Steinbach's footsteps or adapt to the market changes and survive remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain – the intricate designs and masterful craftsmanship of Steinbach nutcrackers will forever be cherished by collectors and enthusiasts all over the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Deduct '204c' from both sides of the equation in order to consolidate the 'c' terms on the right side of the equation. 204*c - 204*c + 421 = 625*c - 204*c This simplifies to: 421 = 421*c 3.

Hypothesis: Sam loved a woman","output":"Based on the context provided, we can draw the hypothesis: \\"Sam loved a woman.\\" This hypothesis is backed by several pieces of evidence found within the context. To comprehensively analyze this hypothesis, we should break down the context and examine the rational justifications that support the claim. Here's a detailed breakdown of the context: 1. \\"Sam loved his wife.\\" - This opening sentence clearly establishes that Sam had a strong emotional connection with a woman — his wife. The verb \\"loved\\" indicates a deep affection and dedication towards her, showcasing his commitment as a partner. 2. \\"They had been together for years.\\" - This sentence further supports the idea that Sam shared a long-lasting relationship with his wife. They had spent years together, which suggests that their love had blossomed and matured over that time. Additionally, the phrase \\"together for years\\" can also imply that they were each other's pillar of strength and support. 3. \\"Sam's wife got cancer.\\" - Without a doubt, this part of the context demonstrates Sam's wife's vulnerability and the tragic turn their relationship took when she fell ill. The sentence creates a connection between the protagonist, Sam, and his wife's struggle, paving the way for the imminent challenges they would face together. 4. \\"There was no way to cure it.\\" - This line serves as a reminder that Sam's wife was battling incurable cancer. It sets the stage for the couple's unyielding resilience and love in the face of adversity, and further substantiates Sam's unwavering devotion. 5. \\"Sam suffered for years with her.\\" - The final sentence in the context reiterates Sam's commitment and love. Despite the circumstances, Sam shared his wife's suffering, demonstrating the empathy and unconditional love he had for her. This serves as the ultimate evidence proving that Sam loved this woman — his wife. Taking all the above points into consideration, it is safe to draw the hypothesis \\"Sam loved a woman\\" from the context. The story outlines Sam's relationship with his wife, showcases their dedication to each other, and emphasizes their love in the face of adversity.

Here is a question about this article: Following the Battle of Hakusukinoe against Tang China and Silla in 663 AD that led to a Japanese retreat from Korean affairs, Japan underwent widespread reform. One of the most important was that of the Taika Reform, issued by Prince Naka no Ōe (Emperor Tenji) in 646 AD. This edict allowed the Japanese aristocracy to adopt the Tang dynasty political structure, bureaucracy, culture, religion, and philosophy. As part of the Taihō Code, of 702 AD, and the later Yōrō Code, the population was required to report regularly for census, a precursor for national conscription. With an understanding of how the population was distributed, Emperor Mommu introduced a law whereby 1 in 3–4 adult males was drafted into the national military. These soldiers were required to supply their own weapons, and in return were exempted from duties and taxes. This was one of the first attempts by the Imperial government to form an organized army modeled after the Chinese system.

Do you know how it came about? The tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added  hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose   tea again. Sullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze   and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK, and today 85%of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags. However, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea.  This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy and tasly way to go. Who invented the tea bag? A) An English tea seller. B) Chinese. C) Lipton. D) Thomas Sullivan.

Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose from: *no; *yes;","output":"*yes; Infatuation and real love are two different feelings that people often experience in relationships. To discern between infatuation and love, we can compare their characteristics and look for signs that indicate each feeling. Step 1: Analyze the characteristics of infatuation Infatuation is characterized by a strong, intense, but short-lived passion and attraction towards someone. It is often idealized, with people overlooking any flaws or incompatibilities. It can be driven by physical or emotional attraction, and is often experienced early in relationships. People may feel an overwhelming desire to be with the person they are infatuated with, but often, the feelings fade quickly. Step 2: Analyze the characteristics of real love Real love, on the other hand, is a deeper, longer-lasting connection with someone. It involves genuine care, understanding, and trust between two people. Love is accepting the person for who they are, including their strengths and weaknesses. It evolves over time as the relationship grows and develops. People in love prioritize the well-being and happiness of their partner, support one another, and communicate openly and honestly. Step 3: Look for signs of infatuation and real love To discern between infatuation and love, look for signs that indicate each feeling. For example, if the relationship is based primarily on physical attraction, and the desire to be with the person is driven by intense emotions that change rapidly, it may be infatuation. If there is a lack of understanding and communication, or the relationship seems superficial, infatuation might be at play. On the other hand, if the relationship is built on trust, understanding, and communication, and the feelings evolve over time, it may be real love. A healthy balance between individuality and togetherness is also a sign of real love. In conclusion, both questions are paraphrases of each other, as they both seek to understand how one can differentiate between infatuation and love. Evaluating the characteristics and signs of each feeling can help in discerning between the two."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

On the left side of the equation, we have the terms 1222*q and -1234*q which are like terms since they both have 'q'. We can combine these terms by subtracting 1234*q from 1222*q: 1222*q - 1234*q = -12*q On the right side of the equation, we can subtract 195 from 39: 39 - 195 = -156 Now our equation should look like this: -12*q = -156 Step 2: Solve for q To solve for q, we need to isolate the variable 'q' on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by the coefficient of q, which is -12: (-12*q) / -12 = -156 / -12 This simplifies to: q = 13 So the solution for the given equation is q = 13."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The first spectators, many carrying chairs or picnic blankets, arrived at daybreak to secure a good spot. The Parks Department originally expected about 300,000 attendees. Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until the start of the concert, an estimated 500,000 audience members made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.The stage backdrop depicted an urban rooftop with water tank and air outlet, symbolic of New York's skyline.  At twilight, the backing band went onstage, followed by New York's mayor, Ed Koch, who announced, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, Simon and Garfunkel!\\" The duo entered through a side stage door, took center stage amid audience applause, looked at each other and shook hands, and began the concert with their 1968 hit \\"Mrs. Robinson\\". After the second song, \\"Homeward Bound\\", Simon delivered a short speech which began, \\"Well, it's great to do a neighborhood concert.\\" He then thanked the police, the fire department, the park administration and finally Ed Koch.

Pack A is from before September 2012, and pack B is from after September 2012. He started searching on the internet to find out why the packs were different.  Would pack A's health warning be more or less visible than pack B's? A:","output":"Pack A's health warning would be less visible than pack B's health warning. This is due to the changes implemented by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2012. The FDA mandated that cigarette packaging and advertisements must display larger, more prominent cigarette health warnings in order to better communicate the dangers of smoking to the general population. Before the implementation of the new regulations in September 2012, cigarette packs like pack A would have displayed smaller, less noticeable warning labels that did not convey the severity of the health risks involved in smoking as effectively as they should have. These older warnings were not comprehensive and were often placed in an inconspicuous location on the packaging, making them less effective in raising awareness and discouraging people from smoking. After September 2012, cigarette packs like pack B started featuring larger, bolder health warnings, as required by the FDA. These new warnings contain nine different messages that educate users about the specific health risks associated with smoking, such as death, addiction, lung disease, cancer, stroke, and heart disease, among others. The more prominent, graphic nature of these warnings act as an effective deterrent and serve to increase the awareness of the hazards of smoking cigarettes. Furthermore, these new warnings on pack B are complemented by graphic images, showing the direct consequences of smoking. This combination of stronger text warnings, vivid images, and the larger overall size makes the health warnings on pack B much more visible and impactful than those on pack A. In conclusion, the health warning on pack A, which is from before September 2012, would be considerably less visible and informative than the health warning on pack B, which is from after the implementation of the new FDA regulations. The changes brought about by the FDA have led to more effective communication of the dangers of smoking to the public, with the intention of reducing the health risks and societal burden caused by tobacco use."},{"instruction":"What is the answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who wrote Imagine as a love song for his wife? from the following article ?

In a letter to a friend, Dickens  said: \\"I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature\\", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that \\"in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep\\" on the Thames foreshore, and that \\"the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter\\". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged 34–36 °C (93–97 °F)—rising to 48 °C (118 °F) in the sun.

Hypothesis: Liberals should work on making their unions stronger instead. Step 2: Identify the key concepts in the premise and hypothesis Premise: Liberals, focus, more pressing, building stronger unions Hypothesis: Liberals, work, making their unions stronger, instead Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the key concepts In both the premise and hypothesis, the main subject is \\"liberals,\\" and the main action is strengthening or building unions. The hypothesis suggests that liberals should work toward this goal instead of focusing on something else presumably less important (implied by the word 'instead'). Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise In this case, the hypothesis appears to be entailed by or at least strongly supported by the premise. The premise suggests that liberals should prioritize building stronger unions, and the hypothesis asserts that liberals should actively work toward that same goal, potentially in place of another less important activity. So, yes, the hypothesis can be considered as entailed by the premise because both emphasize the importance of building stronger unions for liberals, and the premise supports the idea of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer is expressing a high degree of satisfaction with their experience at the hair salon, specifically with Lawrence, who seems to be a hair stylist there. From the onset, the reviewer states that the salon, in general, is skilled at handling Asian hair and transitioning to blonde, which aligns with the reviewer's personal desire to have blonde hair. This set the foundation for a good experience, and likely influenced the positive sentiment. Furthermore, the reviewer places considerable emphasis on the quality of service provided by Lawrence. They appreciated that he explained the steps he was taking during the process, which indicates good communication skills and a willingness to involve the client in the process. Lawrence managed to execute the task skillfully, transforming the reviewer's two-toned, brown hair into a warm blonde that was according to the reviewer's preference. Although the reviewer mentions a negative incident involving waiting an extra 40 minutes due to showing up late and Lawrence attending to other clients, they acknowledge that this was partially their fault. This brief moment of negativity is outweighed by the rest of the experience where Lawrence dedicated his attention and skill to the reviewer's hair.  The reviewer describes the service and care given throughout the process to achieve the desired blonde look as impeccable, implying a high degree of excellence that further resonates with the positive sentiment of the review. The reviewer ends the comment by stating that they will not experiment with other salons, suggesting strong loyalty and equating to an endorsement of this salon to others.

Article: A private sixth grade is set to start its lessons at 1.30 pm every day because the school's teacher thinks his students will study better after a morning lie-in  . Instead of rising early for a 9 am start, students at the PS15,000-a-year Hampton Court House, in East Molesey, Surrey, will get to enjoy a lie-in and work from 1.30 pm until 7pm. Head teacher Guy Holloway says the move for all sixth grade students, set to begin from September, has been made according to research by scientists. He predicts   that not only will his students aged 16 and upwards get great night's sleep, but their productivity   will also be improved. The co-educational school will have the latest start time in the UK, and will be the only one to begin lessons in the afternoon. Experts say young people are programmed to get up later, and that rather than laziness it is simply a shift   in their body clocks. 'There are 168 hours in a week and how productive they are depends on how they choose to use those hours,' said Mr Holloway. 'At Hampton Court House we don't think we have the answer for everybody; it's about what works in our school. We want to get them into a condition where they can get great sleep and study well.' He said students would also benefit from reduced journey times as they travel to and from school after rush hour  . Year 10 student Gabriel Purcell-Davis will be one of the first of 30 A-level students to start at the later time. 'I want to wake up in my bed, not in my maths lesson,' said the 15-year-old. Lessons for all other students at the school will still begin at 9 am as usual. Question: Why did the school decide to start the class at 1.30 pm? Answer: Answer:","output":"The school decided to start the class at 1.30 pm because the head teacher, Guy Holloway, believes that students will study better after a morning lie-in.

Please answer the following question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: what were frederick douglass achievements? Answer:","output":"Frederick Douglass was a former enslaved African American, who became a prominent abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman in the 19th century. Below, you'll find a list of his significant achievements: 1. Escaping Slavery: At the age of 20, Douglass courageously escaped from slavery in Maryland to freedom in the North. This was his initial step towards becoming a renowned leader in the fight against slavery. 2. Authoring Autobiographies: Throughout his lifetime, Douglass penned several autobiographies detailing his experiences as a slave and his journey towards emancipation. His first autobiography, \\"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave\\" (1845), became an instant bestseller and was followed by \\"My Bondage and My Freedom\\" (1855) and \\"Life and Times of Frederick Douglass\\" (1881). 3. Abolitionist Speaker: As an eloquent orator, Douglass began advocating for abolition in earnest in the 1840s. He would attend anti-slavery meetings and share his personal experiences as a slave, raising awareness about the cruelties of the institution and inspiring others to fight for its eradication. 4. Founding and Editing Newspapers: Douglass founded and served as the editor of several influential abolitionist newspapers, such as The North Star (1847-51), Frederick Douglass' Paper (1851-60), and New National Era (1870-74). These newspapers not only helped disseminate abolitionist ideas, but also promoted equal rights for African Americans and women. 5. Women's Suffrage Supporter: Douglass was a fervent supporter of the women's suffrage movement and contributed to the cause by attending conventions, writing about the issue, and participating in debates. He was one of the few male attendees at the historic Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, where he supported the proclamation of women's right to vote. 6. Recruiting Union Soldiers: During the American Civil War, Douglass played an active role in recruiting African American soldiers for the Union Army. He helped form the famous 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, one of the first all-black regiments in the United States. 7. Political Appointments: Frederick Douglass held several significant political positions after the Civil War, including:    - Presidential Elector in the 1872 election    - President of the Freedman's Savings Bank (1874)    - United States Marshal for the District of Columbia (1877-1881)    - U.S. Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia (1881-1886)    - U.S. Minister to Haiti (1889-1891) 8. Civil Rights Advocate: Douglass fought for the civil rights of African Americans throughout his life, campaigning for the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, which abolished slavery, granted African Americans citizenship, and provided them with the right to vote, respectively. In summary, Frederick Douglass's achievements consist of his escape from slavery, contributions to the abolitionist movement, support of women's rights, involvement in the Civil War, and participation in various political roles. As a writer, speaker, and activist, he left an indelible mark on American history and continues to be celebrated for his invaluable efforts toward social change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: Shortly afterwards a nurse arrived to take charge, and the other left the ill-omened building. Sentence 2: The nurse took charge after the other person left. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. To understand this, let us break down the information provided in both sentences and analyze their meaning and implications. In Sentence 1, we have the following pieces of information: 1. A nurse arrived to take charge. 2. The other left the ill-omened building. 3. These two events occurred in a relatively short time frame (\\"shortly afterwards\\"). The first sentence clearly states that a nurse arrived at the scene and took charge of the situation. Additionally, the sentence mentions another individual who decided to leave the ill-omened building around the same time the nurse took charge. Now, let's examine Sentence 2: 1. The nurse took charge. 2. The other person left. The second sentence also states that the nurse took charge of the situation and that another person left, making the claims in both sentences consistent. While Sentence 1 provides more information about the situation by mentioning the ill-omened building and the time frame, Sentence 2 focuses on the essential information that the first sentence provides: the nurse taking charge and the other person leaving. In this case, we can infer that the second sentence is a concise summary of the first sentence, capturing its core meaning. Therefore, we can conclude that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence as the primary information from the first sentence is retained, despite the omission of certain details."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Backup quarterback Brandon Weeden started for the first time since last season against the Arizona Cardinals, but this outing was much different. He completed 22 of 26 passes for 232 yards.

On the other hand, the Cowboys had no answer for Julio Jones, who ran 164 yards and had 2 touchdowns.  Owner Jerry Jones said after the game that the Cowboys just looked tired in the second half.

Question: Who threatens to have Violet, Doralee and Judy prosecuted for attempted murder? Movie plot title: Nine to Five Movie plot: Judy Bernly (Jane Fonda) is forced to find work after her husband, Dick (Lawrence Pressman), runs off with his secretary. Judy finds employment as a secretary at Consolidated Companies. The senior office supervisor, Violet Newstead (Lily Tomlin), introduces Judy to the company and staff, including mail room clerk Eddie, alcoholic Margaret Foster, the opportunistic boss Franklin Hart, Jr. (Dabney Coleman), and Roz Keith (Elizabeth Wilson), Hart's executive assistant. Violet reveals to Judy that Hart is supposedly involved with his buxom secretary, Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton). Hart exploits and mistreats his female subordinates, with backstabbing and sexist remarks. He takes credit for Violet's ideas, cruelly yells at and threatens Judy on her first day after an equipment malfunction and sexually harasses Doralee, spreading rumors about an affair that never happened. When Violet discovers that a promotion she was hoping to receive was instead given to a man because of sexist hiring practices, she confronts Hart about it, as well as the rumors about Doralee (who enters Hart's office just in time to hear, and now realizes why she has become unpopular with the other secretaries). Violet storms off, stating that she needs a drink. Doralee takes Hart to task over his transgressions, informing him that she keeps a gun in her purse and will \\"turn him from a rooster to a hen with one shot\\" if his sexist behavior continues. She then also leaves, stating that she needs a drink. Judy, upset over the firing of Maria, a dedicated employee (due to an infraction overheard by Roz, who had been eavesdropping in the ladies' room), joins Violet and Doralee in storming out of the office, and the three women drown their sorrows at the local bar before retiring to Doralee's house to smoke a joint given to Violet by her teenage son. While there, the beginning of their friendship forms, and they share fantasies of getting revenge on Mr. Hart: Judy wants to hunt him down like an animal in a classic mobster scenario, Doralee wants to...

Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeare's life, argues Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. \\"People have seen Shakespeare as a Dick Whittington figure, who turns his back on Stratford and his family, goes to London to earn his fortune and only comes back to die,\\" he said. \\"But Stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought. We are going to spend the year re-emphasizing the importance of Shakespeare, the man of Stratford.\\" The anniversary of the death of the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world will be marked across Britain and the globe. Macbeth is about to open in Singapore, Romeo and Juliet in Brussels. Shakespeare's Globe is completing the first world tour, in which it has taken Hamlet to almost every country. North Korea is still holding out, though. The Globe director recently jokily claimed Shakespeare as a true Londoner. Stratford, however, will be insisting that the town made and educated Shakespeare. \\"His old school room in Stratford-on-Avon where Shakespeare learned 'small Latin and less Greek' --as kindly laughed at by his friend Ben Johnson--will open its doors, scarred by centuries of naughty schoolboys, to mark 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death,\\" said Paul Edmondson. Shakespeare bought the splendid New Place, the second best house in the town, when he had made his fortune on the London stage. \\"You don't buy a house like New Place and not live there,\\" Paul said. He believes that after Shakespeare bought it, all his thinking time was spent there, and that the late plays, including The Tempest, were at least planned in his library and probably written there. Question: What can we know about New Place? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Shakespeare probably spent his last few years there.\\"?

Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later.

The game was back and forth, with neither team leading by more than one possession.  The Chargers led 7-3 after the 1st quarter.  On the Browns' first drive of the second quarter, QB Josh McCown threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to RB Duke Johnson to put the Browns up 10-7.  The teams traded field goals, making it a 13-13 game at halftime.  The Browns scored a field goal at the start of the 3rd quarter to go up 16-13.  On the Chargers' next drive, QB Philip Rivers led the Chargers to a touchdown, going up 20-16 heading into the 4th quarter.  After K Travis Coons kicked a field goal to cut the deficit to 20-19, Rivers led another touchdown drive to put the Chargers up 27-19.  On the Browns' next drive, they reached the end zone, assisted by an incredible catch by TE Gary Barnidge on the Chargers' 1 yard line.  They converted on the two point conversion to tie the game at 27-27 with just over 2 minutes remaining.  The Chargers reached the Browns' 24 yard line with under 50 seconds to play.  The Browns began to use timeouts until the Chargers faced 4th down with 2 seconds to play.  After the Chargers called timeout, their kicker had an opportunity to win the game with a 39-yard field goal.  The 39 yard game winning attempt was off to the right, and the game appeared to be on its way to overtime..  However, CB Tramon Williams was flagged for being offside during the play, giving the Chargers another attempt, this time from 34 yards.  The field goal was converted, and the Chargers won 30-27.  The Browns committed 12 penalties in the game, including this critical offside penalty.

I love that when you fly a lot, the airport social media staff say 'hello' on Twitter when you arrive and the cabin crew on your home route (or even on the Brisbane-Dubai non-stop route) recognise you from last time. I like getting great service, and see so many things about systems-thinking that work well in airlines, that I'm happy to forgive small indiscrepancies when they occur.

He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference.

Article: You’re likely going to feel tempted sometimes, and that’s okay. Take note of the situations that trigger your sexual urges or tempt you to break your vow. Then, do your best to stay away from these situations. For instance, you might stay out of bars if you tend to go home with someone. Similarly, you may decide not to be alone with someone you find sexually attractive. This is especially important if you’re new to living a celibate life. Adopt new habits that support your goal of staying celibate so that you’ll be less tempted. Use these habits to replace your old habits, which could lead you into temptation. For example, you might start your day with prayer or meditation so you feel spiritually energized. After work, you might add exercise to your day to help you release energy and avoid activities you used to do. In the evening, you might work on a hobby or read a book instead of watching TV shows that make you think of intimate relationships. After you become celibate, you’ll likely have a lot more mental energy since you’re not thinking about sex. Additionally, having a focus or goal can help you keep your thoughts off sex. Pick a goal, hobby, or interest that’s important to you. Then, dedicate your mental energy to that passion. For example, you might focus on your spiritual growth if you’re celibate because of your faith. Otherwise, you could focus on your career, your education, or a goal that you have for your future, like writing a novel. to help you deal with temptation.

The social media channels of the upmarket supermarket chain were flooded with negative comments about the Duchess of Cambridge’s sister, leading to an urgent damage control situation. Body: The recent announcement by Waitrose that Pippa Middleton, the sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, would be dispensing advice on preparing feasts has sparked a wave of outrage amongst shoppers. The supermarket chain's social media accounts, including Twitter and Facebook, have been inundated with complaints and disapproval. Many patrons voiced their concerns about the decision to associate Pippa with Waitrose, stating that it shows a lack of relevant experience and credibility. Shoppers also complained that while Pippa comes from a privileged background, she may not be the best spokesperson for practical and affordable grocery shopping. This created a perception of Waitrose as out-of-touch and disconnected from the average customer’s needs. In response to the backlash, the editor of Waitrose magazine interceded to appease the customers and damage control the situation. The editor assured the angry mob that despite Pippa's association, Waitrose remains dedicated to delivering fresh, sustainable, and affordable food to its customers. Furthermore, the addition of Pippa's expertise would only enhance the culinary experience for customers without compromising on the brand's ethos. Moreover, it was highlighted that Pippa Middleton is not new to giving out advice on party planning and entertaining at home. She had previously authored a book, 'Celebrate: A Year of Festivities for Families and Friends,' in 2012 that serves as a guide to hosting a range of celebrations requiring varying degrees of formality. The editor also emphasized that Pippa's tips would be focused on the joy of cooking and creating memorable feasts at home. The content would include recipes featuring seasonal ingredients, new techniques, and shortcuts, which would cater to food lovers across the board. Despite the uproar, Waitrose believes that having Pippa Middleton on board can bring many benefits to their customers. Her popularity can help boost sales and bring in new clientele interested in the latest trends in cooking and hosting. Capitalizing on her status as a fashion and lifestyle icon, the supermarket chain aims to enhance the overall experience of shopping at Waitrose by offering customers guidance from someone well-versed in the art of entertaining.

(B). stair is uneven.","output":"The sentence ends with option (B): The chair could sit on the floor but not on the stair because the stair is uneven. In this context, the sentence addresses the problem of placing a chair on different surface types, namely the floor and the stair. It is comparing the suitability of both surfaces for accommodating a chair without wobbling or instability. The floor, in this case, is considered level and even; thus, it provides a stable surface for the chair to sit. A level floor ensures that the chair's legs are all touching the surface, and there's no danger of unevenness causing instability or discomfort when someone uses the chair. On the other hand, the stair is uneven, making it an unsuitable surface for placing the chair. Stairs are primarily designed for foot traffic, and their surfaces are usually sloped to accommodate the rise and run. The step's uneven nature — with varying angles, heights, and depths — means that the chair's legs will not all make equal contact with the surface. This uneven contact leads to wobbling and instability, posing a potential risk of accidents and falls for the person attempting to use the chair on the stair. The sentence highlights the importance of appropriate surface selection when choosing a location for seating. It emphasizes the need to be mindful of safety and stability when deciding where to place a chair, taking into consideration the differences between even surfaces, like floors, and uneven surfaces, like stairs. So in summary, the sentence is a reminder of the importance of surface awareness when positioning chairs or other furniture pieces and the potential hazards that may arise from choosing incorrect or unstable surfaces."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year.

Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Hengameh Shahidi\\" correctly answer the question \\"What are the names of some of the women in prison charged for being women's activists?\\"?","output":"Yes, the response \\"Hengameh Shahidi\\" correctly answers the question \\"What are the names of some of the women in prison charged for being women's activists?\\" as the paragraph mentions her as one of the women's rights activists sent to Tehran's Evin Prison on charges related to their activism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: After fertilization, how many cells does a zygote form into?    Choices:  - three  - one  - six  - two  A: Answer:","output":"The zygote, after fertilization, forms into two cells. After the sperm cell from the male fertilizes the egg cell from the female, the process of cell division, called cleavage, starts to occur. The single-celled zygote begins dividing by a process called mitosis, where the cell duplicates its genetic material and divides into two cells, each containing a complete copy of the original genetic material. Therefore, the correct answer is two. However, it's important to understand that this is just the beginning of the process. After the first two cells have formed, cleavage continues, leading to the formation of four cells, then eight cells, and so on. These rapidly dividing cells form a structure called a blastula, which later becomes the embryo. As the embryo develops, it will further differentiate, forming the various tissues, organs, and structures within the developing organism. The number of cells in the zygote and the speed at which cleavage occurs can vary between species. For example, within mammals, the division can start within 24 hours of fertilization, while in birds, it can take a few days. During the early stages of embryonic development, these cells have the capability to develop into any cell type within the organism, a feature called pluripotency. Cell differentiation takes place as the cells continue to divide, and the pluripotent cells gradually lose their ability to form any cell type, becoming more specialized and forming the various structures within the developing organism. In summary, after fertilization, a zygote initially divides into two cells through the process of mitosis. However, the process doesn't stop there, as the cells continue to divide and differentiate, eventually forming a fully developed organism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the two sentences you provided, the word \\"see\\" holds different meanings: 1. \\"You have to be a good observer to see all the details.\\" In this sentence, \\"see\\" refers to the act of noticing or perceiving, especially after analyzing the scenario or looking very closely. It deals with the ability to discern or understand certain aspects that may not be conspicuous at first glance. This particular use of \\"see\\" denotes one's capacity to identify and appreciate finer or subtle points because of their observational skills. 2. \\"I saw him laughing.\\" Here, \\"see\\" means to visually witness or catch a glimpse of something that is happening. The sentence communicates that the speaker directly experienced an event through their sense of sight. In this context, the action is more passive than the previous example, as it pertains to having seen a situation unfold without necessarily needing to show a level of understanding or observation. It communicates that the person has spotted the subject laughing without describing their perception or experience of it in depth. In conclusion, although the word \\"see\\" in both sentences deals with the use of one's vision, they hold different meanings with respect to context.

Problem:Queen Gorgo of Sparta tells her men about the Battle of Marathon, in which King Darius of Persia was killed by General Themistocles of Athens ten years earlier. Darius' son, Xerxes, witnesses his father's death, and is advised to not continue the war, since only \\"the gods can defeat the Greeks\\". Darius' naval commander, Artemisia, claims that Darius' last words were in fact a challenge and sends Xerxes on a journey through the desert. Xerxes finally reaches a cave and bathes in an otherworldly liquid, emerging as the 8-feet tall \\"god-King\\". He returns to Persia and declares war on Greece to avenge his father.As Xerxes's forces advance towards Thermopylae, Themistocles meets with the council and convinces them to provide him with a fleet to engage the Persians at the sea. Themistocles (the Athenian general) then travels to Sparta to ask King Leonidas for help, but is informed by Dilios that Leonidas is consulting the Oracle, and Gorgo is reluctant to side with Athens. Themistocles later reunites with his old friend Scyllas, who infiltrated the Persian troops and learned Artemisia was born Greek, but defected to Persia as her family was raped and murdered by Greek hoplites and she was taken as a sex slave, and subsequently left for dead in the streets. She was rescued and adopted by a Persian emissary. Her lust for vengeance gained the attention of King Darius and he made her a naval commander after she killed many of his enemies. Themistocles also learns that Leonidas has marched to fight the Persians with only 300 men.Themistocles leads his fleet of fifty warships and several thousand men, which include Scyllas, Scyllas' son Calisto and Themistocles' right-hand man Aeskylos to the Aegean Sea, starting the Battle of Artemisium. They ram their ships into the Persian ships, charge them, slaughtering several soldiers before retreating from the sinking Persian ships. The following day, the Greeks feign a retreat and lead a group of Persian ships into a crevice, where they become stuck. The Greeks charge the Persian ships from the cliffs above and kill more Persians. Impressed with Themistocles' skills, Artemisia brings him onto her ship where she has sex with him in an attempt to convince him to join the Persians as her second-in-command. He refuses, causing her to push him aside and swear revenge on him.The Persians spill tar into the sea and send suicide bombers to swim to and board the Greek ships with their flame bombs. Artemisia and her men fire flaming arrows and torches to ignite the tar, but an Athenian manages to kill one of the Persians, who falls into the tar carrying a torch, causing ships from both sides to explode. Themistocles is thrown into the sea by an explosion and nearly drowns before being rescued by Aeskylos, and stands by Scyllas' side as he succumbs to his injuries. Believing Themistocles to be dead, Artemisia and her forces withdraw. After recovering from his injuries, Themistocles learns that only a few hundred of his warriors and six of his ships survived the disastrous attack executed by Artemisia.Daxos, an Arcadian general, tells Themistocles that Leonidas and his 300 men have been killed after Ephialtes betrays the Greeks to Xerxes. Themistocles returns to Athens and confronts Ephialtes. The deformed Spartan traitor reveals that Xerxes plans to attack and burn Athens to the ground. Ephialites is regretful of his actions, and is welcoming death. Themistocles spares him instead, so he can warn Xerxes that the Greek forces are gathering at Salamis. He then visits Gorgo in Sparta while she is mourning Leonidas' death to ask for her help, but she is too overcome with grief. Before leaving, Themistocles returns Leonidas' sword, which had been delivered to him by Ephialtes under Xerxes's orders, and urges Gorgo to avenge Leonidas.In Athens, Xerxes' army is laying waste when Ephialtes arrives to deliver Themistocles' message. Upon learning he is alive, Artemisia leaves to ready her entire navy for battle. Xerxes suggests a more cautious plan but she still leaves for battle, ignoring Xerxes' advice. The remaining Greek ships charge into the Persians ships, and the two armies battle, beginning the decisive Battle of Salamis. Themistocles and Artemisia fight, which ends in a stalemate with both receiving severe injuries.At this moment Gorgo, who had been narrating the tale to the Spartans, arrives at the battle along with ships from numerous Greek city states including Delphi, Thebes, Olympia, Arcadia, and Sparta, all of them uniting against the surrounded Persians. Daxos leads the Arcadian army while Themistocles urges Artemisia to surrender. Xerxes, watching the battle from a cliff, turns his back on her, acknowledging his invasion has ended in defeat. Artemisia tries to kill Themistocles one last time but is killed as he stabs her through the stomach. Themistocles and Gorgo take a moment to silently acknowledge one another's alliance as the remaining Persians charge while Dilios leads the assault.

Article: No woman can be too rich or too thin. This saying often attributed to(...) the late Duchess   of Windsor represents much of the strange spirit of our times. Being thin is assumed as such a virtue. The problem with such a view is that some people actually attempt to live by it. I myself have fantasies of slipping into narrow designer clothes. Consequently, I have been on a diet for the better --or worse-- part of my life. Being rich wouldn't be bad either, but that won't happen unless an unknown   dies suddenly in some distant land, leaving me millions of dollars. Where did we go off the track? When did eating butter become a sin , and a little bit of extra flesh unappealing, if not unpleasant? All religions have certain days when people stop from eating and overeating is one of Christianity's seven deadly sins. However, until quite recently, most people had a problem getting enough to eat. In some religious groups, wealth was a symbol of probable high morals, and fatness a sign of wealth and well-being. Today the opposite is true. We have shifted to thinness as our new mark of virtue. The result is that being fat -- or even only somewhat overweight -- is bad because it implies a lack of moral strength. Our obsession with thinness is also fueled by health concerns. It is true that in this country we have more overweight people than ever before, and that in many cases, being overweight correlates with an increased risk of heart and blood vessel disease. These diseases, however, may have as much to do with our way of life and our high-fat diets as with excess weight. And the associated risk of cancer in the digestive system may be more of a dietary problem -- too much fat and a lack of fiber -- than a weight problem. The real concern, then, is not that we weigh too much, but that we neither exercise enough nor eat well. Exercise is necessary for strong bones and both heart and lung health. A balanced diet without a lot of fat can also help the body avoid many diseases. We should surely stop paying so much...

John Lyshitski A:","output":"Title: A Twisted Reunion Genre: Crime, Comedy, Drama Plot Summary: In the quiet town of Elmswood, a seemingly ordinary man, John Lyshitski, concocts an elaborate plan to commit a crime that will send him to prison, just to reunite with his former cellmate and friend, Nelson Patterson. Driven by a sense of loyalty, unfinished matters from their shared past, and an insatiable desire to help Nelson regain his freedom, John embarks on a wild and unpredictable adventure that soon proves to be much more than he bargained for. Act 1: In Elmswood, John Lyshitski, a reformed criminal turned hardware store owner, receives a letter that shakes up his mundane life. The letter contains news of Nelson Patterson's recent arrest and subsequent incarceration in San Justice State Penitentiary. John reminisces about their days together behind bars, the friendship they built, and the promise they made to always have each other's back.  Feeling that he has let his friend down, and with the weight of past guilt bearing down upon him, John makes the rash decision to intentionally get himself thrown back into the prison system. Despite being on parole and attending weekly therapy sessions to better himself, John relapses into his old criminal habits and hatches a plan to rob a local bank, aiming to be caught and sent to the same prison facility where Nelson is being held. Act 2: John masterminds and conducts the bank heist in broad daylight, leaving behind undeniable evidence of his involvement, while wearing his signature orange hat during the crime. The authorities are quick to catch up with him, and John is eventually arrested and sent to prison, just as he planned. Upon arriving at the San Justice State Penitentiary, John seeks out Nelson and is shattered when he discovers that his old friend has become bitter and withdrawn after serving years in one of the harshest prison environments. Nelson blames John for not being there for him when he needed him most. John, unable to share the truth behind his incarceration, vows to make things right and help Nelson regain his freedom. Act 3: As John and Nelson rebuild their broken trust, they hatch a plan to break out of the penitentiary. Employing their combined knowledge of the inner workings of the prison, the duo recruits other inmates to join their cause, promising a share in the stolen money that John hid away before his arrest. The group devises a daring escape plan, involving a staged fight to draw the guards' attention, a secretly-acquired map of the underground tunnel system beneath the penitentiary, and a well-timed power outage. In the cover of darkness, John and his crew, with Nelson by his side, embark on their dangerous and high-stake journey to freedom. Act 4: Despite several near-death encounters and unforeseen challenges, the group succeeds in breaking out of the prison. As they make their way to the hidden location of the stolen money, they are pursued relentlessly by prison guards and local authorities. Along the way, some of John's crew are lost, either recaptured or decide to part ways, leaving only John, Nelson, and two trusted inmates to push forward. The remaining escapees reach the stash and split the money. It is at this point that John reveals his reason for pulling off that bank heist and reuniting with Nelson in the first place. Nelson, moved by John's unwavering loyalty and commitment to their friendship, forgives him. In the movie's climax, John leads the authorities on a wild chase to give Nelson and the two other inmates a chance to flee with the money. Ultimately, he is captured after ensuring that his accomplices make their escape. Epilogue: As John makes peace with his actions and accepts the consequences of his choices, he finds solace in the knowledge that he never abandoned his friend. While back behind bars, John receives a letter from Nelson, who has used his share of the stolen money to build a new life for himself and the two other inmates in a faraway country. In the letter, Nelson promises to wait for John's release, and together, they will find a way to get his life back on track. The movie concludes with a renewed sense of hope, trust, and camaraderie, showcasing the resilience and strength of friendship, even in the darkest of times."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Because some atoms will lose electrons and some atoms will gain electrons, there is no overall change in the number of electrons, but individual atoms acquire a nonzero electric charge. Those that lose electrons become positively charged, and those that gain electrons become negatively charged. Charged atoms are called ions. Because opposite charges attract (while like charges repel), these oppositely charged ions attract each other, forming ionic bonds. The resulting compounds are called ionic compounds and are the primary subject of this chapter. The second way for an atom to obtain an octet of electrons is by sharing electrons with another atom. These shared electrons simultaneously occupy the outermost shell of more than one atom. The bond made by electron sharing is called a covalent bond. Covalent bonding and covalent compounds will be discussed in Chapter 4 \\"Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds\\".

Information:  - Carbonated water (also known as club soda, soda water, sparkling water, seltzer water, \\"bubbly water\\" or fizzy water) is water into which carbon dioxide gas under pressure has been dissolved. Some of these have additives, such as sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate or similar, but seltzer water is almost always composed of water and carbon dioxide with no other additives. This process, known as carbonation, is a process that causes the water to become effervescent. Most carbonated water is sold in ready to drink bottles as mineral water and carbonated beverages such as soft drinks. However, it is rather easy to prepare at home with soda makers.  - A soft drink (see terminology for other names) is a drink that typically contains carbonated water, a sweetener, and a natural or artificial flavoring. The sweetener may be sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, sugar substitutes (in the case of diet drinks), or some combination of these. Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives, and other ingredients.  - Faygo Beverages, Inc., is a soft drink company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan. The beverages produced by the company, branded as Faygo or Faygo Pop, are distributed in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, Central Southern regions of the United States, and southern Canada. Faygo is imported in Europe by American Fizz, an official distributor of Faygo. Faygo Beverages, Inc., is a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Beverage Corporation, started in Detroit, Michigan, in 1907, as Feigenson Brothers Bottling Works.  - Robert James Ritchie (born January 17, 1971), known professionally as Kid Rock, is an American singer, rapper, songwriter, musician, record producer, and actor. His 1998 album \\"Devil Without a Cause\\" sold 14 million copies worldwide. He is a five-time Grammy Award nominee and has sold 25 million albums in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan. The RIAA certified him selling 23.5 million albums. He has sold over 35 million records worldwide and he was Soundscan's number-one selling male solo musician of the 2000s, selling 17.6 million albums; he was 17th overall for the decade.  - F.T.F.O. ( Fuck The Fuck Off ) is the debut solo album from American rapper Shaggy 2 Dope , an artist better known as half of the duo Insane Clown Posse ( ICP ) . Released in 2006 and produced by Mike E. Clark , it is his first full - length solo release . The album art alludes to the ICP tradition of spraying the audience ( and themselves ) with the American soft drink Faygo .  - Juggalo (feminine Juggalette, or Juggala in Spanish speaking countries) is a name given to fans of the group Insane Clown Posse or any other Psychopathic Records hip hop group. Juggalos have developed their own idioms, slang and characteristics. The Gathering of the Juggalos, alternatively known as just \\"The Gathering\\", is a notable annual festival held by juggalos and the artists that they support, which have included rap stars such as Busta Rhymes, Ice Cube, and MC Hammer; over its first eleven events, the festival had an average attendance of about 10,000 fans, with a peak of 20,000 in 2010.  - Corn syrup is a food syrup which is made from the starch of corn (called maize in some countries) and contains varying amounts of maltose and higher oligosaccharides, depending on the grade. Corn syrup, also known as glucose syrup to confectioners, is used in foods to soften texture, add volume, prevent crystallization of sugar, and enhance flavor. Corn syrup is distinct from high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is manufactured from corn syrup by converting a large proportion of its glucose into fructose using the enzyme D-xylose isomerase, thus producing a sweeter compound due to higher levels of fructose.  - Fructose, or fruit sugar, is a simple ketonic monosaccharide found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847. The name \\"fructose\\" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Miller. Pure, dry fructose is a very sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars. Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables.  - In cooking, a syrup or sirup (from ; \\"sharb\\", beverage, wine, via ) is a condiment that is a thick, viscous liquid consisting primarily of a solution of sugar in water, containing a large amount of dissolved sugars but showing little tendency to deposit crystals. Its consistency is similar to that of molasses. The viscosity arises from the multiple hydrogen bonds between the dissolved sugar, which has many hydroxyl (OH) groups, and the water.  - A sugar substitute is a food additive that provides a sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy. Some sugar substitutes are produced by nature, and others produced synthetically. Those that are not produced by nature are, in general, called artificial sweeteners.  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners.  - Joseph Bruce (born April 28, 1972), known by his stage name Violent J, is an American rapper, record producer, and professional wrestler, and part of the hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse.

Also along with Utsler, Bruce is the co-founder of the professional wrestling promotion Juggalo Championship Wrestling.  - Horrorcore is a subgenre of hip hop music based on horror-themed and often darkly transgressive lyrical content and imagery. Its origins derived from certain hardcore hip hop and gangsta rap artists, such as the Geto Boys, who began to incorporate supernatural, occult, or psychological horror themes into their lyrics and, unlike most gangsta rap artists, pushed the violent content and imagery in their lyrics beyond the realm of realistic urban violence to the point where the violent lyrics became gruesome, ghoulish, unsettling, or slasher film or splatter film-esque. While exaggerated violence and the supernatural are common in horrorcore, the genre also frequently presents more realistic yet still disturbing portrayals of mental illness and drug abuse. The term \\"horrorcore\\" was popularized by openly horror-influenced hip hop groups such as Flatlinerz and Gravediggaz.  - Psychopathic Records, also known as The Hatchet, is an American independent record label based in Farmington Hills, Michigan that specializes in hip hop music. The label was founded in 1991 by Alex Abbiss and hip hop group Insane Clown Posse.

Originally entitled Bitter Life , it was published when the author was 16 . It is the follow - up to In the Forests of the Night , which she wrote at the age of 13 . The title refers Edgar Allan Poe 's poem \`\` Alone '' , which appears in the beginning of the book . The novel was an ALA Quick Pick . The Bulletin of the Center for Children 's Books remarked that it is \`\` A fast - paced vampire novel '' , while Publishers Weekly has said that \`\` readers will drain ... in one big gulp \`\` . The Bulletin calls it '' a fast - paced vampire novel with an anti-Buffy heroine and a studly vampire who are n't going to let a little thing like death stand between them . \`\`  - The vrykolakas (Greek , pronounced ), variant vorvolakas or vourdoulakas, is a harmful undead creature in Greek folklore. It has similarities to many different legendary creatures, but is generally equated with the vampire of the folklore of the neighbouring Slavic countries. While the two are very similar, blood-drinking is only marginally associated with the \\"vrykolakas\\".  - Shroud usually refers to an item, such as a cloth, that covers or protects some other object. The term is most often used in reference to \\"burial sheets\\", mound shroud, grave clothes, winding-cloths or winding-sheets, such as the famous Shroud of Turin or \\"Tachrichim\\" (burial shrouds) that Jews are dressed in for burial. Traditionally, mound shrouds are made of white cotton, wool or linen, though any material can be used so long as it is made of natural fibre. Intermixture of two or more such fibres is forbidden, a proscription that ultimately derives from the Torah, \\"viz.\\", Deut. 22:11.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder.  - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.  - A vampire is a being from folklore who subsists by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Although vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures, the term \\"vampire\\" was not popularized in the West until the early 18th century, after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, although local variants were also known by different names, such as \\"shtriga\\" in Albania, \\"vrykolakas\\" in Greece and \\"strigoi\\" in Romania. This increased level of vampire superstition in Europe led to mass hysteria and in some cases resulted in corpses actually being staked and people being accused of vampirism.  - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU.  - Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809  October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.  - Amelia Holt Atwater-Rhodes (born April 16, 1984), known professionally as Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, is an American author of fantasy and young adult literature.  - In the Forests of the Night is a vampire novel written by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, and published in 1999. Originally entitled White Wine, she wrote it at the age of thirteen. The book was published on May 11, 1999, about a month after she turned fifteen. It is the first novel in the Den of Shadows. It tells the story of a three-hundred-year-old vampire named Risika and her struggles throughout her life, both before and after she was transformed. The novel is told in first-person narrative by the protagonist, Risika. It was well received by critics.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics.  - The undead are beings in mythology, legend, or fiction that are deceased but behave as if alive. A common example of an undead being is a corpse re-animated by supernatural forces, by the application of the deceased's own life force, or that of another being (such as a demon).  The undead may be incorporeal like ghosts, or corporeal like vampires and zombies. The undead are featured in the belief systems of most cultures, and appear in many works of fantasy and horror fiction. The term is also occasionally used for putative non-supernatural cases of re-animation, from early experiments like Robert E. Cornish's to future sciences such as cryonics and chemical brain preservation.    What entity does 'demon in my view' has the relation 'series' with?

Given those answer options, answer the question: Back at their house by the cemetery, Paul and Chloe found Bee in her room, what Paul referred to as her sanctum sanctorum - although no one else ever got the joke, and he refused to explain the comic book reference. As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice.

Question: Which planet has a higher internal heating? Context: Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.

Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling.  In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water.  Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling.  The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure.  Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises.  This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible.  Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water.  A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems.  A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels.  This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene.

Generally the value of cleaner air to people as revealed by the hard market choices seems to be less than their rhetorical valuation of clean air Add punctuation","output":"Generally, the value of cleaner air to people, as revealed by the hard market choices, seems to be less than their rhetorical valuation of clean air. It is important to understand the discrepancy between the value that people place on clean air in their rhetoric and their actual choices in the marketplace. Several factors contribute to this disparity, including the intrinsic challenges in valuing clean air and the role of market imperfections and behavioral biases. Firstly, clean air as a public good is intangible and hard to measure, which makes it challenging for individuals to perceive and evaluate its tangible benefits, like health improvements, increased productivity, and enhanced quality of life. Consequently, people tend to undervalue the importance of clean air. Secondly, the current market structure does not internalize the cost of pollution. Many industries emit pollution without accounting for the negative externalities of their actions on the environment and public health. In the absence of appropriate policy instruments and implementations, such as carbon pricing, cap-and-trade programs and pollution taxes, the market cannot provide an accurate reflection of people's preference for clean air. Next, information asymmetry is a significant issue when it comes to valuing cleaner air. Most people have limited knowledge about the effects of air pollution on their health and well-being. Additionally, scientific information about the benefits of cleaner air can be complex and hard to digest. This lack of information can lead to a distorted perception and valuation of cleaner air. Another important aspect is the short-term versus long-term tension in people's preferences. Cleaner air might yield benefits over time, such as a reduced likelihood of developing respiratory diseases or other negative health effects. However, people tend to prioritize immediate and visible gains, such as economic growth, employment, and lower consumer prices, over long-term benefits that are harder to perceive and quantify. Behavioral biases also play a vital role in the discrepancy between rhetorical valuation and actual market choices. Factors like status quo bias, optimism bias, and the availability heuristic can cause individuals to underestimate the importance of clean air or the risks associated with pollution exposure. Lastly, collective action problems can hinder efforts to improve air quality. Air pollution is a transboundary issue, and its mitigation requires international cooperation. However, individual nations might be hesitant to act unilaterally due to concerns about competitiveness, the uneven sharing of pollution reduction costs, and uncertainties associated with collective action. In conclusion, the value of cleaner air, as revealed by the hard market choices, seems to be less than people's rhetorical valuation of clean air, primarily due to the challenges in valuing clean air, market imperfections, information asymmetry, short-term preferences, behavioral biases, and collective action problems. Addressing these issues through robust policies, improved communication, and engagement can help bridge this gap and align people's genuine preferences for cleaner air with market outcomes and environmental policies."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the background: White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose having more animals near the water happens, how will it affect the water seeps into fewer animals.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"The supposed perturbation of having more animals near the water can have an indirect effect on the process of fossil formation. With an increased number of animals near the water, there is a potential for higher competition for resources, leading to a higher rate of animal deaths in the surrounding area. As a result, there may be more remains available for the fossilization process. However, having more animals near the water does not necessarily mean that the water will seep into fewer animal remains. The primary factor affecting the water seeping process is the location and accessibility of the remains to the water source, not the quantity of animals. Additionally, the overall process of fossil formation largely depends on specific conditions, such as the speed at which the remains are covered by sediment, the type of minerals present in the water, and the environmental factors in the area. Increasing the number of animals near the water may indirectly influence some of these factors, but it is not a direct determinant of the water seeping process or the fossil formation itself."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: “What was your worst makeup disaster?” Do fingernails count? I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under.

Teacher:In mathematics, the absolute value of a number is the non-negative value of that number, without regarding its sign. For example, the absolute value of -2 is 2, and the absolute value of 5 is 5. In this task you will be given a list of numbers and you need to return the element with highest absolute value. If a negative and positive element have the same absolute value you should return the positive element. The absolute value for negative numbers can be found by multiplying them by -1. After finding the element with the maximum absolute value you should return the value of that element before you applied the absolute value. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: [-13.006  20.838  -2.77   33.255] Student:","output":"To solve this problem, follow these steps: 1. Create a variable to store the maximum absolute value found so far, and initialize it to the absolute value of the first element in the list. 2. Create a variable to store the current element with the highest absolute value, and initialize it to the first element in the list. 3. Go through the remaining elements in the list one by one:    a. Calculate the absolute value of the current element.    b. Compare this absolute value to the stored maximum absolute value found so far.    c. If the current element's absolute value is greater than the stored maximum absolute value or if the current element's absolute value is equal to the stored maximum value and the current element is positive, replace the stored maximum absolute value with the current element's absolute value and update the current element with the highest absolute value to be the current element. 4. Finally, return the current element with the highest absolute value. Now, let's solve the given instance: 1. List: [-13.006, 20.838, -2.77, 33.255] 2. Initialize max_absolute_value = |-13.006| = 13.006 3. Initialize element_with_max_absolute_value = -13.006 4. Compare the remaining elements one by one:    a. Calculate |20.838|    b. Compare 20.838 to max_absolute_value (13.006). Since 20.838 > 13.006, replace max_absolute_value with 20.838 and element_with_max_absolute_value with 20.838.        c. Calculate |-2.77|    d. Compare 2.77 to max_absolute_value (20.838). Since 2.77 < 20.838, do not update any values.        e. Calculate |33.255|    f. Compare 33.255 to max_absolute_value (20.838). Since 33.255 > 20.838, replace max_absolute_value with 33.255 and element_with_max_absolute_value with 33.255. 5. The final value for element_with_max_absolute_value is 33.255, so this is the element with the highest absolute value in the list."},{"instruction":"Question: Article: Rollerworld is a public skating rink that welcomes everyone from beginners to experts.

Here's the problem:  -11*z + 4625 = -241*z + 45*z The first thing we should do is combine the z's on the right side of the equation. So, -241*z + 45*z is like taking away 241 z's, then adding back 45 z's. Let's count: -241 + 45 = -196 So now our problem looks like this: -11*z + 4625 = -196*z Now, we will move -11*z from the left side to the right side of the equation to have all the z's together.  When we move it, we'll change the sign from negative to positive. So it will be: 4625 = -196*z + 11*z Let's combine the z's on the right side now: -196*z + 11*z = -185*z Our problem now is: 4625 = -185*z To solve for z, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -185, just like sharing candies: 4625 / -185 = z Now let's do the division: z = -25 So, the solution is z = -25.

I'm standing in the crowded, dusty, garishly carpeted Binion's Horseshoe casino in downtown Las Vegas. It is the 31st annual World Series of Poker. At this point in my poker career, I am only here to watch. The buy-in fee for the tournament is 10,000: this is a luxury for millionaires, a handful of \\"professional poker players\\" (if, in 2003, such a thing really exists) and those lucky enough to win their seats in competitions. There are a few more people than usual playing the 2003 tournament. This is because a new system has recently been launched whereby you can win seats on the internet. What an idea! Playing poker alone on a computer, using a credit card, against opponents whose faces you can't see? It'll never work… So there are more contestants, but of the usual type: middle-aged men in big hats and shiny belt buckles, eating and drinking and smoking while they play. I am surprised to see a beautiful young woman in the crowd, shouting, in a cut-glass English accent: \\"Go Daddy Wheeler! Go Daddy Wheeler!\\" Following her eyeline, the story becomes clear. The millionaire owner of spread-betting firm IG Index, Stuart Wheeler, has treated himself to a World Series ticket, had a good run and made his way into the prize money. His daughter is here to lend support. Mr Wheeler finishes 33rd for 35,000. According to official records, he has never cashed in a poker tournament before or since. Thus, I was not surprised to see, during last week's little press scandal, that he has rather lost touch with the game. Arguing against the idea that there should be more women on the boards of companies, Stuart Wheeler (now retired from IG Index and ensconced as treasurer of Ukip) said: \\"Business is very, very competitive and you should take the performance of women in another competitive area… Chess, bridge, poker – women come absolutely nowhere.\\" Others have kindly pointed out that Stuart Wheeler must have missed the disproportionate recent success of women in poker: 23 female poker millionaires in the official rankings list, topped by the phenomenal Vanessa Selbst who has won 7,398,454. (I'm tenth, with 1.7m.) But Mr Wheeler is missing something far more important than that. He may know that poker has undergone a revolution, thanks mainly to the fact that the ultimate winner of that 2003 World Series (the magically named Chris Moneymaker, a likable accountant from Tennessee) was an internet qualifier: he'd won his seat on PokerStars.com for 39 and spun it into 2.5m. Millions flooded after him, transforming poker from a shady endeavour for the adventurous few into a massive pastime for an entire generation. But it is no longer, as Stuart Wheeler clearly imagines, about big hats and ballsy bluffs. Try that on the modern poker scene and even his fortune could be obliterated in weeks. The millions of new young players, many with maths degrees, brought a revolution in technical strategy. Belligerent old Texans, still relying on primitive ideas of aggression and bluster, have been left in the dust. You do not succeed by being more \\"competitive\\" than your opponent, but by being cleverer. In other words, Mr Wheeler's poker point proves that he overestimates the value of muscle. We have all realised this in poker, but the business world is glacially slow to catch on. It is the masculine prejudices of the stock market, towards big-hat aggression and high-pressure manoeuvres, that led to the financial mess where we currently find ourselves. Macho competition on trading floors led to over-reaching, borrowed money, crashes – and subsequent demands for huge bonuses from the men who triggered them, on the grounds that this bull-headed approach is a rare and special skill. If Stuart Wheeler approached me for poker advice, I would tell him what I tell all aspiring players: the first rule is not to go skint. The second rule is to make a profit, however small. Those who are blinded by ego, interested only in vast wins and huge adrenaline rushes, end up trapped in the escalating debt scenario that currently threatens the entire western economy. Stuart Wheeler made a personal fortune with his business, but it was a betting company. It did not build or create anything. On such shifting sands sit the precarious national economies of today. In poker's official list of all-time money winners (all genders) I am 525th. That's actually pretty good, but my secret truth is the more important lesson for would-be gamblers. If you take account of poker losses (which the official records do not), I am in much better shape than many of the 524 who are officially above me. I play far more rarely and selectively than most pros, so my statistical win rate is higher; also, I take fewer risks so have kept more of my winnings. I have flaws as a player, of course, but over-reaching myself for reasons of ego isn't one of them. Is this because I'm female? I suspect that's hugely relevant. It is only my personal observation, but it seems that women gamble less (even while we are in the act of gambling) because we are slower to separate the betting chips from the reality of food and shoes. This operates as a check on recklessness. Opponents will say this is a weakness in my poker game. I will think (but do not say): I bet my bank account is healthier than yours. Therefore, if, like Stuart Wheeler, I were looking to poker for a comfortable, gender-based generalisation about world affairs, I would make precisely the opposite point. If our western economies were in female hands then perhaps we would not be staring at our empty fingers and wondering: where did all that money go? Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Stuart Wheeler's outdated views on the role of women in poker and business underestimate their success and the value of strategic thinking over aggressive competition. Embracing the qualities that women bring to the table can lead to a more stable and sustainable approach to both poker and business, contrary to Wheeler's perspective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No one is a greater fan of Geroge Macdonald Fraser's Flashman papers than I am. I was surprised to see just now that Richard Lester directed Royal Flash, since I also see he had made the Three/Four Musketeers with Fraser which I though turned out rather well. Not so Royal Flash. I was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since I had read all the Flashman papers published up to that time, and was intoxicated with A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (I still am, but he was never really given a chance after that). What a disappointment (I saw it once again when I was about 20 on television and it seemed even worse). None of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen. The comedy of Flashman's character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do. The dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic. Looking back with more mature eyes, the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the Prisoner of Zenda. If you have read the book and not seen the film, I can only say that the film ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game Rudi has just invented: Russian roulette. A pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about. My comments would be more direct if I had seen the film more recently, but I am glad I have not. If by any chance Fraser ever reads this, I can only say I think he is a genius--perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation, but, based on my appreciation of that corpus of work, it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film, as that he did all those awful Roger Moore James Bond films. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The user expresses disappointment with the movie adaptation of the Flashman books, describing it as a mishandling of the source material, lacking sharp dialogue and dramatic scenes. They also mention a betrayal of the book's themes and express disbelief that George MacDonald Fraser wrote the screenplay. However, the user does praise Fraser as a genius and perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

And the answer is?","output":"The ship that housed the famous pirate radio station Radio Caroline, which tragically sank in March 1980, was named the \\"Mi Amigo.\\" The vessel had a long and storied history, playing a key role in the development of radio broadcasting in the United Kingdom and Europe as well. The history of Radio Caroline dates back to the early 1960s when its founder, Ronan O'Rahilly, decided to establish a radio station offshore to bypass the strict rules of the British broadcasting authority that granted a monopoly to the BBC. O'Rahilly envisioned a 24-hour, commercial-free broadcasting service that would rival the BBC, and he needed the right vessel on which to set up his pirate radio station. The ship that eventually became the Mi Amigo had several incarnations before it came to serve as Radio Caroline's home. It was originally a German cargo ship named Olga, built in 1921. Following World War II, it underwent several ownership and name changes, including being named Bon Jour and Magda Maria in the late 50s and early 60s. In 1964, Ronan O'Rahilly finally acquired the ship and renamed it Mi Amigo, which means \\"My Friend\\" in Spanish. The vessel was then adapted to accommodate the needs of a radio station, with the installation of broadcasting equipment and living quarters for the crew. From 1964 until its sinking, the Mi Amigo served as the broadcasting base for Radio Caroline. The station offered a diverse range of programs, including chart-topping hits, classic tunes, and alternative music from emerging rock bands that would go on to become iconic figures in the industry. This unique programming allowed Radio Caroline to capture the hearts of a loyal and devoted audience. In its heyday, Radio Caroline attracted millions of listeners from the UK and other European countries. The pirate radio station's dedication to playing a diverse mix of music not found on mainstream radio significantly influenced the music scene in the 1960s, eventually leading to changes in the UK's broadcasting regulations. On March 19, 1980, the tragic sinking of the Mi Amigo occurred during a severe storm, which inflicted irreparable damage to the ship. Although the crew members were safely rescued, the Mi Amigo was ultimately lost, marking a sad end to Radio Caroline's original era. Remarkably, the station continued to broadcast, and the resilience of Radio Caroline led it to later be housed on another ship called Ross Revenge. With the eventual liberalization of the radio broadcasting industry in the UK, Radio Caroline shifted to a land-based broadcasting facility in 1991 and has continued to broadcast to this day, albeit mainly online. In conclusion, the Mi Amigo was the ship that housed the iconic pirate radio station Radio Caroline until its unfortunate sinking in March 1980. The vessel's vibrant history and its role in shaping the British and European radio broadcasting scene make the Mi Amigo an unforgettable part of radio history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sheldon Gary Adelson (pronounced ; born August 4, 1933) is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is the founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Las Vegas Sands Corporation, which owns the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, and is the parent company of Venetian Macao Limited, which operates The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. He also owns the Israeli daily newspaper Israel Hayom and the American daily newspaper Las Vegas Review-Journal. Adelson, a lifelong donor and philanthropist to a variety of causes, also founded the Adelson Foundation in 2007, at the initiative of his wife, Miriam. In 2007, Adelson made an unsuccessful bid to purchase the Israeli newspaper Maariv. When this failed, he proceeded with parallel plans to publish a free daily newspaper to compete with Israeli, a newspaper he had co-founded in 2006 but had left. The first edition of the new newspaper, Israel Hayom, was published on July 30, 2007. On March 31, 2014, Adelson received the go-ahead from a Jerusalem court to purchase Maariv and the conservative newspaper Makor Rishon. In 2016 Adelson's attorney announced that he does not own Israel Hayom, it is owned by a relative of his.  According to a Target Group Index (TGI) survey published in July 2011, Israel Hayom, which unlike all other Israeli newspapers is distributed for free, became the number-one daily newspaper (on weekdays) four years after its inception. This survey found that Israel Hayom had a 39.3% weekday readership exposure, Yedioth Ahronoth 37%, Maariv 12.1%, and Haaretz 5.8%. The Yedioth Ahronoth weekend edition was still leading with a 44.3% readership exposure, compared to 31% for the Israel Hayom weekend edition, 14.9% for Maariv, and 6.8% for Haaretz. This trend was already observed by a TGI survey in July 2010.  In 2011, the Israeli press said that Adelson was unhappy with coverage of him on Israeli Channel 10, which alleged that Adelson had acquired a casino license in Las Vegas inappropriately through political connections. The channel apologized after Adelson threatened a lawsuit. This led to the resignations of the news chief, Reudor Benziman; the news editor, Ruti Yuval; and the news anchor, Guy Zohar, who objected to the apology. After two months of deliberations, the Israeli Second Authority for Television and Radio ruled that although there were some flaws in the manner in which the apology had been conducted, the decision to apologize had been correct and appropriate. Does Adelson still own the newspaper?","output":"In 2016, Adelson's attorney announced that he does not own Israel Hayom, it is owned by a relative of his."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"To examine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let's break down the premise and the hypothesis into smaller components. Premise: 1. Unrestrained ocean waves and salty sea spray are present. 2. These forces have wrecked huge chunks of the Malecen, a promenade and roadway by the sea. Hypothesis: 1. Malecen was wrecked by ocean waves and salty sea spray. 2. This demonstrates that nature is unstoppable. Now, let's analyze the connections between the parts of the premise and hypothesis: 1.

Both mention ocean waves and salty sea spray causing damage to the Malecen. 2. The second part of the hypothesis (This proves that nature is unstoppable) is a conclusion drawn based on the first part of the hypothesis. However, the premise does not explicitly state or imply that nature is unstoppable. One could argue that the damage to the Malecen illustrates the power of nature, but the premise does not provide enough information to confirm the claim that nature is unstoppable.

Please answer this question: The popular British pub name The Royal Oak is named after which King?","output":"The popular British pub name \\"The Royal Oak\\" is named in honor of King Charles II of England, who ruled from 1660 to 1685. The story behind the name dates back to a critical moment in British history and is tied to Charles II's escape from the Roundheads during the English Civil War. In September 1651, King Charles II found himself in a precarious situation after the Battle of Worcester. His Royalist forces had been defeated by the Parliamentarian army led by Oliver Cromwell, and he was now a hunted man with a large bounty on his head. Desperate to avoid capture and execution, Charles and a small group of loyalists were forced to flee the battleground and seek refuge in the surrounding countryside. During this daring escape, Charles sought sanctuary in the forests of Boscobel, Staffordshire. It was here that he and his companion Colonel William Careless stumbled upon a large oak tree, which they believed would be a suitable hiding place. In an incredible act of bravery and resourcefulness, the two men climbed up the tree and remained hidden within its leafy canopy, while enemy soldiers searched the area below. According to popular accounts, Charles and Careless spent an entire day nestled in the branches of the oak tree and successfully evaded capture. The tree where they hid became known as the \\"Royal Oak,\\" and became a symbol of loyalty to the King and the Royalist cause. As a patron saint of pubs, the Royal Oak has been embraced as a common pub name throughout Britain. It serves as a testament to the resourcefulness and tenacity of King Charles II as he faced one of the darkest hours in his life. Pub-goers across the nation continue to raise their glasses in tribute to the story of the King who evaded capture, hidden in the branches of an oak tree, ultimately prevailing to regain the English throne in 1660 during the Restoration of the English monarchy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In early November of 1503,during Christopher Columbus's fourth and final trip to America,his ship was seriously damaged in a storm.Columbus and his men had to live on a small island for several months while they tried to repair their ship and return to Spain. At first,the local people on the island were very kind to the European visitors,giving them allthe food and clothes they needed to survive.However,as the months passed,the local people became more and more unhappy with their guests,who were tricking and stealing from them.Finally the locals decided to stop helping.Without food or any way to leave the island,Columbus's group was soon in serious trouble. Luckily for Columbus,he had a book about the stars and planets on his ship.It described the movements of all the objects in the night sky.The book,written by a well-known German scientist,said there would be a total lunar eclipse on the evening of February 29,1504 and how long it would last. Columbus worked out the difference in time between Germ any and North America.He then had a meeting with the local leaders just before the eclipse would take place.In this meeting,Columbus told them his god was angry because the local people were no longer giving food.So his god would take away the moon to punish them.The moment Columbus finished talking,just as he had planned,the moon began disappearing. The local leaders grew frightened and quickly agreed to provide Columbus with food and anything else he wanted.But first,Columbus's god had to return the moon.Columbus told them he would have to discuss the idea with his god on his ship.Knowing the moon would stay completely hidden for about 48 minutes,Columbus returned just before the moon began to reappear.From that day on,until they finally left,Columbus and his men no longer had any trouble getting the food they needed.

C: He read about the stars and planets. D: He told his men what happened.","output":"The best answer is B: He waited for the eclipse to finish. After Columbus returned to his ship during the meeting, he was aware of the total lunar eclipse's timing due to the book he had on board. He knew that the moon would stay completely hidden for about 48 minutes. He used this time to his advantage, convincing the local leaders he was discussing with his god the idea of returning the moon. As per the information in the passage, there is no mention of Columbus discussing the problem with his god (option A) or reading about the stars and planets (option C) after he got back to his ship that night. Option D (He told his men what happened) is also not stated in the passage. Therefore, some inference is required, leading us to conclude that he waited for the eclipse to finish before returning to the local leaders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Sustainable management is seen as a practical and economical way of protecting species from dying out. Instead of depending on largely ineffective laws against poaching  , it gives local people a good economic reason to preserve plants and animals. In Zimbabwe, for instance, there is a sustainable management project to protect elephants. Foreign tourists pay large sums of money to kill these animals for sports. This money is then given to the inhabitants of the area where the hunting takes place. In theory, locals will be encouraged to protect elephants, instead of poaching them because of the economic benefit involved. This sounds like a sensible strategy, but it remains to be seen whether it will work. With corruption in these developing countries, some observers are skeptical that the money will actually reach the people it is intended for. Others wonder how effective the locals will be at stopping poachers. There are also questions about whether sustainable management is practical when it comes to protecting forests. In theory, the principle should be the same as with elephants --- allow logging companies to cut down certain number of trees, but not so many as to completely destroy the forest. Sustainable management of forests requires controls on the number of trees which are cut down, as well as investment in replacing them. Because almost all tropical forests are located in countries which desperately need funds from logging, there are few regulations and motive to do this. One solution might be to confirm wood comes from sustainably managed forests. In theory, consumers would buy only this wood and so force logging companies to _ or go out of business. Unfortunately, unrestricted logging is so much more profitable that wood prices from managed forests would cost up to five times more --- an increase that consumers, no matter how \\"green\\", are unlikely to pay. Question: Which of the following statements is true in understanding the \\"sustainable management\\"? Options: A: Sustainable management is usually used in commercial units. B: Sustainable management is more powerful than laws. C: We will probably meet many problems in the course of applying sustainable management. D: It is likely that sustainable management will replace the laws in protecting living things. The answer is:","output":"C: We will probably meet many problems in the course of applying sustainable management. The article discusses various challenges associated with the implementation and effectiveness of sustainable management in ensuring the protection of species and forests. Some of these issues include corruption in developing nations, skepticism whether the generated funds will reach the intended people, practical issues concerning feasibility and implementation of sustainable practices in forest management, as well as consumer's willingness to pay for sustainably managed products.  The article does not state that sustainable management is usually used in commercial units (Option A), but instead gives examples of its use in conservation efforts such as the elephant protection project in Zimbabwe and potential application in forest preservation.  Although sustainable management might offer economical incentives for locals to protect their natural resources and could be more effective than some laws against poaching, the article does not make the assertion that sustainable management is universally more powerful than laws (Option B). Given the potential challenges and intricacies involved in its application, it vests in the local context and varying circumstances. The article also doesn't posit that sustainable management will replace laws in protecting living things (Option D). On the contrary, a combination of laws, policies, and initiatives such as sustainable management may often be required for comprehensive protection of species and habitats.  Hence, while sustainable management is a promising approach, it is not without hurdles, making option C the truest statement in understanding \\"sustainable management\\" as per the article."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Tired of telling students to ask questions and to think about what they were doing, Damien Hynes, a high school geography teacher in Australia, decided to do an experiment to test what he had long been thinking.He wrote some well-organized nonsense (something untrue) on the blackboard.The students simply copied it but very few asked any questions.This shows that students are willing to believe anything given by teachers.The story is repeated in support of the Project for Enhancing Effective Learning (PEEL). PEEL was carried out by some teachers and researchers in Melbourne who had concluded that normal teaching methods seldom achieve their intended goals; what the teachers think they are teaching is one thing and what the students actually learn is something else.Students' lack of an over-all view of learning goals and their concentration on test scores make them see each lesson as a separate activity. Researchers realized that many students do not come into class empty-headed but have their own explanations of how the world works.Their own ideas can remain important to them even when they differ from scientific explanations that are learned later.In fact such ideas are hardly affected by traditional teaching.Students accept the teacher's scientific explanation, but do not drop their own.They simply keep both and use them practically: in a class test, they copy the teacher's idea, but in real life they use their own.

They are related but address different aspects of the synchronization problem in concurrent programming. Let's break down each question and provide a detailed answer for each. 1. How do you decide which one provides a better solution for achieving synchronization, Peterson's algorithm or mutex? To decide between Peterson's algorithm and mutex, one must consider the context and requirements of the system in question. Both of these methods aim to achieve synchronization among concurrent processes, but they have some key differences that make them suitable for different environments. Peterson's Algorithm: Peterson's algorithm is an algorithm for concurrent programming that ensures mutual exclusion, which means that only one process can enter its critical section at a time. It is designed for two processes and relies on shared memory for communication. Key features of this algorithm include: - It is busy-waiting: Processes that are not in their critical sections continuously check a condition to enter their critical sections. This consumes CPU resources and may not be the best choice for systems that require energy efficiency or have limited processing power. - It requires atomic operations: The algorithm assumes atomic read/write operations of shared memory, which may not hold true for all system architectures. - No reliance on OS support: Peterson's algorithm works at the user level code and does not require any OS support for implementation. - Limited to two processes: The basic algorithm only works for two processes, but it can be extended and modified for more processes, though it becomes more complicated. Mutex: A Mutex (short for \\"mutual exclusion\\") is a synchronization primitive provided by the operating system or programming libraries that ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. It is designed for multiple processes or threads and uses system-level calls to acquire and release locks. Key features of Mutex include: - It is not busy-waiting: Processes or threads block when they cannot acquire the Mutex's lock, freeing up CPU resources and are only resumed when the lock is available. - Support for multiple processes or threads: Mutex can handle more processes/threads than Peterson's algorithm can handle easily. - Relies on OS support: Mutex implementations may vary by operating systems or programming languages but generally are provided by the system. When choosing between Peterson's algorithm and Mutex, it is important to consider the number of processes, the availability of system support, the desired performance, and the specific requirements of your system. 2. How do you implement a mutex, if one is not provided? If a Mutex implementation is not provided by your programming language or operating system, you can create your own synchronization primitive based on the desired mutual exclusion behavior. Here are some general steps to implement a Mutex from scratch: 1. Define a Mutex data structure: Create a data structure that will hold information about the lock's state (e.g., locked or unlocked) and the identifier of the process/thread that currently holds the lock if applicable. 2. Implement lock acquisition: Create a function/method that acquires the lock. This function should:    a. Check the lock's current state.    b. If the lock is unlocked, update the lock's state to locked and store the identifier of the process/thread acquiring the lock.    c. If the lock is locked, block (suspend) the requesting process/thread until the lock becomes available (i.e., released by its current owner). 3. Implement lock release: Create a function/method that releases the lock. This function should:    a. Check if the current process/thread is the lock holder    b. If it is the lock holder, update the lock's state to unlocked and resume any blocked processes/threads waiting for the lock.    c. If it is not the lock holder, return an error or handle this case appropriately. When implementing a Mutex from scratch, you will likely require atomic operations, spinlocks, or other low-level synchronization primitives to ensure that the lock acquisition and release is performed atomically. These low-level primitives differ depending on the hardware and system architecture, so implementing a Mutex manually may require platform-specific code or libraries. In conclusion, the two questions inquire about different aspects of synchronization. The first question asks you to decide between Peterson's algorithm and Mutex based on their key differences and specific use cases. In contrast, the second question discusses how to implement a Mutex if one is not provided by the system, involving the various steps and considerations for a custom Mutex implementation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this 2012 image provided by the Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari, a dog, bottom right, watches a video of the silhouette of another dog wagging its tail to its left. At top right... (Associated Press)      A few years ago, researchers discovered a subtle difference in how dogs wag their tails. When a dog sees something positive, such as its owner, it tends to wags its tail more to its right. The wagging tends to go left when it sees something negative, like an unfamiliar dominant dog.      Now, the same Italian researchers report that other dogs pick up on that difference, and it's reflected in their behavior and even their heart rates. Experts say the tail-wagging difference appears to be one way that dogs gauge how other dogs will respond to them.      \\"It's just fascinating that dogs pick up on it,\\" said Evan MacLean, co-director of Duke University's Canine Cognition Center. For humans, he said, \\"it's a difficult thing to see.\\"      MacLean was not involved with the study, reported Thursday in the journal Current Biology.      Giorgio Vallortigara of the University of Trento in Italy, an author of the study, said Fido is not deliberately sending a message. Instead, the tail-wagging behavior stems from how different emotional cues activate different parts of the brain, he said in an email.      For the experiment, Vallortigara and co-authors used videos of a dog or its silhouette, wagging its tail mostly to one side or the other, or not wagging at all. They showed the videos to 43 dogs, including such breeds as Rottweilers, beagles, boxers, border collies and German shepherds as well as mongrels.      When the dog in the video wagged mostly to its left, the sign of a negative response, observer dogs tended to have faster heartbeats than when it wagged the other way or not at all. Their behavior also indicated a higher degree of stress.      Alexandra Horowitz, who studies mental abilities of dogs at Barnard College in New York, said that the wagging difference is probably not a primary signal between Fido and Rover in daily life, but it may play a minor role.      ___      Malcolm Ritter can be followed at http://www.twitter.com/malcolmritter ||||| Image caption According to the scientists, a dog's tail wag can reveal its mood      Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.      Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish.      But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences.      The study is published in the journal Current Biology.      Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: \\"It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions.      \\"Here we attempted to look at it in other species.\\"      Media caption Dr John Bradshaw: \\"The breakthrough is that dogs are reading one another's body language\\"      He added that just as in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.      Dogs on film      To find out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tail wags of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs.      They measured the pets' heart rates and analysed their behaviour.      Prof Vallortigara said: \\"We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding issues, and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right.\\"      When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed.      But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog's point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious.      Prof Vallortigara said he didn't think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.      Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feel worried about.      He said: \\"If you have several meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour, and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience.\\"      Image caption The team says dogs respond to lop-sided tail wags from other dogs      The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal's emotions.      Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's school of veterinary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines.      Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.      And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: \\"Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its 'tail' was made to wag left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the [Italian] study.\\"      He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines. A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he explained.      \\"While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception,\\" he said.      \\"However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other.\\" ||||| Not all tail wags are created equal. Although a dog wagging its tail may look friendly to us, to other dogs, there is a wealth of information in such a seemingly simple action.      A new study finds that dogs respond to the direction of a tail wag. Canines that see tails wagging to the right are more relaxed, whereas they become more stressed when they see tails wagging to the left. The responses are a result of the differing roles played by the left and right hemispheres of a dog's brain, according to the research. (Related: \\"Can Dogs Feel Our Emotions? Yawn Study Suggests Yes.\\")      The same scientific team previously found that dogs wag their tails to the right when looking at something they want to approach, such as their owner. But they wag their tails to the left when confronted with something they want to back away from, such as another dog with an aggressive posture.      The dogs' directional tail wagging was a result of increased activation of either the left or right side of their brains, said neuroscientist Giorgio Vallortigara of the University of Trento in Italy, who led both studies.      He has characterized other right-versus-left brain differences or biases in how dogs react to sounds, scents, and emotions. \\"But the issue remained open whether this asymmetry conveyed any meaning to an observing dog,\\" he said.      Reading the Signs      To find out if other dogs responded to the direction of tail wags, the researchers recruited 43 dogs of various breeds and showed them videos of another dog or a digitized silhouette of a dog with its tail wagging left or right.      The observing dogs were fitted with a vest to measure their heart rate, and their behaviors were filmed and analyzed.      When dogs looked at tails wagging to the left, their heart rate increased and they showed more signs of stress and anxiety. The dogs were more relaxed when they saw tails wagging to the right. The results were published October 31 in the journal Current Biology.      Vallortigara emphasized that just because dogs interpreted tail wagging as stressful or non-stressful, it did not necessarily indicate that the left or right tail wag was intended as a communication signal.      \\"It's possible that there's no communication going on in the intentional sense,\\" he said. It could just be a byproduct of the activation of one side of a dog's brain over the other side.      Dogs may become more stressed out when seeing a left tail wag because \\"they're interpreting that the dog they're looking at might have higher arousal, or might be more likely to attack,\\" said Lesley Rogers, an emeritus professor of neuroscience at the University of New England in Armidale, Australia, who was not involved with the study.      Rogers studied right or left biases in animal brains for more than 30 years, and was the first to show that such biases were not unique to humans.      \\"We know there's this fundamental pattern, that the left hemisphere is used when an animal is in a relaxed state, focused on things, and the right one [is used] when it's an emergency situation, when something novel has happened, and during an attack,\\" she said.      A similar process is at work in human beings, in whom the right hemisphere is used to express intense emotions, Rogers added. (Related: \\"OCD Dogs, People Have Similar Brains; Is Your Dog OCD?\\")      \\"Where this paper is a step forward is to show that those side biases are actually read or interpreted by another member of the species,\\" she said. \\"We have very little if any other evidence of that.\\"      Canine Interpretations      The new study is \\"a very major contribution\\" to our understanding of how animals interpret such signals, said Thomas Reimchen, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Victoria in Canada, who also was not involved in the study published October 31.      \\"It's great work,\\" Reimchen said. It’s one of the first studies to show that animals evaluate the left- or right-sided bias of other individuals and modify their behavior in response, he said.      In a previous study, Reimchen found that dogs in a dog park responded differently to the right and left tail wagging of a life-size robotic dog replica. Far more dogs approached the robot without stopping when the robodog's tail wagged to the left.      The fact that dogs hesitated less when approaching the left-wagging robot appears to contradict the results of Vallortigara's study, in which dogs became more anxious when they saw left-wagging tails. But the two experiments' methods were sufficiently different that it's hard to make comparisons, Reimchen said.      \\"The current paper did this very elegant analysis of physiological function, whereas we used this proxy of behavior, which was whether [the dogs] stopped or not,\\" he said.      \\"What is clear is that there is a lot of visual information that dogs use when interacting with each other, and the tail is a very important signal,\\" Reimchen said. The study also provides evidence that \\"docking,\\" or removing portions of a dog's tail, compromises their ability to communicate, he said. (Read \\"How to Build a Dog\\" in National Geographic magazine.)      Free Interactions      As a follow-up, Vallortigara said he would be interested in trying to look at the behaviors of freely interacting pairs of dogs.      \\"What I would like to do is to have two real dogs facing each other, with the possibility to measure very precisely the movement of the tail and other physiological parameters during free encounters,\\" he said. This could help researchers capture the feedback that characterizes interactions between two real dogs.      One could imagine practical uses of the study’s findings, Vallortigara said. For example, veterinarians could approach dogs from a preferred side, and the findings could also be used for teaching and training dogs.      \\"It's possible that we could produce dummies tailored to [elicit] right or left [brain responses],\\" he said. For example, one could build a dummy dog that would wag its tail to the left or right, producing aggressive or less aggressive attitudes depending on what a trainer wants to teach a dog to do, he added.      The University of New England's Rogers would like to see this laboratory experiment repeated in a more natural environment and extended to other species. \\"It opens up a whole field of research,” she said. Researchers could now focus on finding out how right or left biases in different species are interpreted by other members of the species, Rogers said. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A study conducted by Italian researchers found that dogs are able to pick up on the difference in the direction of tail wagging in other dogs, which influences their behavior and heart rates.

Write some highlights for the following article: Gunfire echoes across the desert plain as a Kurdish army commander, crouched on a dusty ridge, takes his finger off  his AK-47 trigger and lifts his binoculars. ‘They’re definitely getting closer,’ announces Shehab Ahmed Hamed a few moments later in a theatrical whisper. By ‘they’ he meant the Islamic State militants fighting Kurdish armed forces, or Peshmerga, only a mile and a half away in the village of Shovepelke. Thankfully we could only hear their guns, not see them, though that was scant comfort. ‘We need your British warplanes more than ever now,’ said Shehab after a long sigh. Scroll down for video. Thin line of defence: Fighters beneath the Kurdish flag near Makhmour. We didn’t know it at the time – it was late yesterday morning – but as he spoke two RAF Tornadoes carrying laser-guided bombs were already flying over Northern Iraq, prepared to strike at IS targets. Here in northern Iraq, on the frontline in the battle against IS, British assistance – any assistance from above, in fact – would indeed be most welcome. Behind us, at the foot of the Karajokh mountains, the fearful Kurdish town  of Makhmour shimmered in the distance. Its people feel trapped, surrounded – and very scared. Makhmour fell to the Islamists a month ago, only to be reclaimed by  the Peshmerga a few days later. But there are increasing concerns that without the support of coalition jets, it may fall again soon. ‘Please tell David Cameron that IS are all around us,’ says 22-year-old Marwa Fazil, who returned home yesterday after fleeing in terror last month with her children, aged two and three. Her husband stayed to fight with the Peshmerga. There was, she recalls, ‘a sick feeling of dread in my stomach’ when the ominous black flags of IS were raised across the town, when its terrorists swept from house to house, pillaging and killing and burning down shops. Bullet holes scar the walls of buildings, broken glass still carpets the pavements. ‘It keeps returning, that feeling. I don’t know how long it will be safe here,’ says Marwa. ‘We all fear them coming back and I am terrified something will happen to  my children.’ Enemy camp: Image from an IS video said to show recruits preparing for jihad. All over the town, David Cameron’s name is invoked with an almost strange frequency by both young and old. They whooped with joy, they said, when the Commons voted in favour of air strikes. ‘We keep a close eye on what goes on in UK,’ explained Shehab later, a patterned scarf hung around his waist in traditional Kurdish fashion. ‘We have to. What is decided in your country can make the difference between life and death here.’ As if suddenly embarrassed by this melodramatic flourish, he quickly laughed. ‘Of course, we know the names of Manchester United’s new signings too.’ Makhmour, with a population of around 6,000, is 30 miles from the city of Erbil, the oil-rich capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, which IS has coveted for months. Buoyed by the capture of Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, the jihadists managed to reach Erbil’s margins in the summer, but were repelled. ‘They want to take Makhmour again because it is the last place before Erbil,’ said another Peshmerga fighter, Idres Salem Muamed. ‘It is strategically important to them.’ Directly opposite the cafe in the centre of the town, where Idres sat drinking tea with other Peshmerga soldiers yesterday morning, were the burnt remains of an electrical goods store. ‘They [Islamic State] did this when they were here; they burnt down a lot of our houses and shops,’ said Idres. ‘Near here they killed a child, a boy, who was fleeing with his mother and father. We knew they were coming. We could see the black flags flying from their cars. We evacuated all the women and children – most went to the mountains – but there was not enough Peshmerga to fight back. Strong holds: The green lines show the increasing hold IS has over the region. ‘So we had to retreat and regroup and then we came back after a few days in greater numbers – 600 of us in  all from all over the region. The Islamists  soon took flight.’ It is only now that the women and children are beginning to drift back and many, like Marwa, already wish they hadn’t. In their absence the men of the town, ranging in age from 17 to 70, took up arms. Few had any military experience. They are a volunteer army ready to fight alongside the Peshmerga. Three miles away the front line is formed of mounds of earth. At the point where Shehab watched and waited yesterday, there was a cluster of tents, some plastic chairs and the Kurdish flag atop a pole that kept threatening to keel over. In all, it isn’t much of a bulwark against marauding terrorists. ‘But it’s the best we’ve got at the moment’, said Shehab. Alternately peering through his binoculars and aiming his gun, Shehab said fighting was raging ‘beyond the clump of trees in the far distance’. He added: ‘This morning the IS took control of Shovepelka and another settlement, Hoshtralok, which is nearby. But the Peshmerga has now moved in and there is fighting from close quarters. It has been going on since nine o’clock this morning.’ 'It is vital that Britain get involved because it gives legitimacy to our war. It means it is not just the US and a few others, but Europe to' As well as help from above, the soldiers beseech the UK to ‘send us weapons’. In Makhmour, at least, they possess only archaic rifles and ‘not enough semi-automatics’. In comparison, the IS terrorists’ arsenal is sophisticated, much of it the latest hardware from the United States. At the Peshmerga’s regional HQ, a few miles down the dusty desert road to Erbil, it is this subject that senior commander Najdt Ali Salin is constantly turning over in his mind. ‘Air strikes alone are not enough,’ he said. ‘We don’t need soldiers from Britain and America but we do need some of the marvellous weapons you have in the UK. ‘The air strikes have helped us a great deal, allowed us to recapture lost land, towns and villages. We need more, though, to strengthen our positions around Makhmour and push them [IS] further back. ‘It is vital that Britain gets involved because it gives legitimacy to our war. It means it is not just the US and a few others, but Europe too. ‘But more sophisticated weapons, are essential if we are to win this war. I do not wish to be ungrateful, I was delighted to hear the news about your Parliament’s vote.’ Elsewhere in the HQ, which was occupied briefly by IS, a less senior soldier boasted about recent successes. ‘We have killed 47 IS militants in villages around here in the past week, ‘ he said as he flourished his mobile phone, full of pictures of dead bodies. Back at the front line, Shahab had tilted his binoculars upwards and was scanning the skies. There was still no news about Britain’s Tornados – which did not, in fact, strike at IS targets yesterday. ‘They may be further north around Mosul,’ he said. ‘Never mind. Perhaps next time for us.’","output":"Highlights: - British warplanes are needed more than ever as Islamic State militants close in on Kurdish armed forces in northern Iraq. - The town of Makhmour in northern Iraq fell to the Islamists a month ago, but was reclaimed by the Peshmerga a few days later; there are fears that without the support of coalition jets, it may fall again. - Kurdish forces are requesting more sophisticated weapons from the UK to help win the war against ISIS. - British assistance, including weapons and airstrikes, are regarded as essential for legitimacy in the war against ISIS in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, \\"[t]he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson .... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger.\\" Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What is Atticus shooting the rabid dog symbolic of?","output":"Atticus shooting the rabid dog is symbolic of his fight against racial prejudice and injustice in the town of Maycomb. In the novel, the rabid dog represents the harmful and uncontrollable spread of racism, much like how a rabid dog's bite can transmit its deadly disease. By taking on the responsibility to shoot the dog, Atticus demonstrates his moral courage and willingness to confront and eradicate the town's deeply-rooted racism, even though it is not his designated role as a lawyer.  Atticus's position as the sole person willing to step up and deal with the rabid dog highlights the lack of support he receives from the majority of white citizens in Maycomb, who passively or actively contribute to the racial injustice. The dog’s presence on a deserted street further emphasizes the loneliness and isolation Atticus faces in his battle against racism. Additionally, the connection between the mad dog incident and the courtroom scenes indicates that the trial of Tom Robinson is another arena where Atticus confronts the rampant racism in Maycomb. The dreamlike imagery used by Harper Lee serves to link both situations and emphasize how the prejudice operating in town is destructive and needs to be confronted and halted, much like the rabid dog. In conclusion, Atticus shooting the rabid dog is symbolic of his courageous stand against racial prejudice and his unwavering determination to address and eradicate the town's racism, in spite of being surrounded by a community that is largely unwilling to support or join him in this fight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Justin Nelson, Jr., pounded the last of the stakes of his new cattle pen into the dry dirt. Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece. With a sigh escaping from the bellows of his withering chest, Justin shuffled back to the porch he had added onto his small two-room home. In the distance, a plume of dust was billowing off the road.

Detroit DJ Terrence Parker uses his advanced turntablism skills and his focus on precision to blend hip hop music DJing styles, such as rhythmic scratching, in his house mixes. Fellow Detroit spinner DJ Minx is a notable woman house DJ. Her records on her Women on Wax label blend Parker-influenced turntablism precision with a funky style. In the UK, any house song released by a Chicago-based label was routinely considered a \\"must-play\\" at UK house music clubs. Paradise Garage in New York City was still a top club in the house era, just as it had been during the disco age. The emergence of Todd Terry, a pioneer of the genre, demonstrated the continuum from the underground disco approach which moved to a new house sound. Terry's cover of Class Action's \\"Weekend\\" (mixed by Larry Levan) shows how Terry drew on newer hip-hop influences, such as the quicker sampling and the more rugged basslines. In the late 1980s, Nu Groove Records launched and nurtured the careers of Rheji Burrell and Rhano Burrell, collectively known as Burrell (after a brief stay on Virgin America via Timmy Regisford and Frank Mendez). Nu Groove also had a stable of other NYC underground scene DJs. The Burrell's created the \\"New York Underground\\" sound of house, and they did 30+ releases on this label featuring this sound.

On [insert specific date here], a 38-year-old woman charged with causing the death of her passenger through careless driving made her first appearance in a private hearing at Jedburgh Sheriff Court. The unfortunate incident that led to the charges occurred on [insert date of accident] when the driver, whose identity has not been released due to the ongoing case proceedings, allowed her car to veer off the road and crash.  The passenger, identified as [passenger's name], suffered critical injuries and was later pronounced dead at the scene. Paramedics had rushed to the location of the accident, but they were unable to save the passenger. The driver, on the other hand, sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was transported to a local hospital for treatment. During the investigation conducted by local authorities, it was revealed that the woman had lost control of her vehicle, specifically due to her careless driving. It has not been disclosed whether she was under the influence of any substances or if external factors such as poor road conditions and weather influenced her actions. Since the details surrounding the case are limited at this time, the severity of her carelessness remains undisclosed. While at the Jedburgh Sheriff Court hearing, the woman was charged under Section 2B of the Road Traffic Act of 1988, which specifically deals with causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving. If convicted, the defendant could face a maximum prison sentence of up to five years, an unlimited fine, and a minimum 12-month disqualification from driving. Under current UK regulations, causing death by careless driving is considered a serious offense. Judge [name of presiding judge] emphasized the importance of this case and expressed condolences to the family of the victim. \\"It is a tragedy that such a preventable accident has led to the loss of life,\\" they stated during the hearing. As the trial is set to commence in the coming weeks, the prosecution is expected to present a strong case, including statements from eyewitnesses, traffic camera recordings, and expert testimony on the road conditions at the time of the accident. Given the weighty evidence against her, the 38-year-old woman may soon face the consequences of her alleged careless actions. Safety organizations and advocates have also taken the opportunity to remind local drivers of the consequences of careless driving. The National Roads Authority (NRA) of the UK has released statistics that show how preventable accidents such as this one contribute to the overall death toll on the country's roads. The NRA has urged drivers to exercise extreme caution and adhere to traffic regulations, emphasizing the importance of vigilance not only for their own safety but also for the safety of their passengers and others on the road. In conclusion, the coming weeks will reveal the final verdict in this heart-wrenching case. As the community mourns the loss of a life taken too soon due to a preventable incident, it is crucial to learn from the incident and stress the importance of responsible driving habits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pokémon Go is supposed to have the original cast of the first Pokémon games: this means, at minimum, a roster of 151 creatures. But so far, there’s no way of collecting the full set.      In the main Pokémon games, there is a concept known as “legendaries”—that is, rare and powerful Pokémon that are significantly harder to catch. Some legendaries are encountered during the course of of a game’s storyline, while others have esoteric requirements that need to be fulfilled before a player can encounter them. Sometimes, a legendary can only be caught during special events thrown by The Pokémon Company, and these are often tied to specific locales, like a game store. All of this to say, Pokémon Go’s situation is not unprecedented: it makes sense that some critters would not be obtainable under normal means.      What’s curious, however, is that the unobtainable Pokémon Go critters aren’t all legendaries. At the moment, the Pokémon no trainer has caught include...      Mew      Advertisement      What makes it special, according to Pokemon resource Bulbapedia:      Mew is said to have the DNA of every single Pokémon contained within its body, and as such is able to learn any attack...Since Mew can make itself invisible at will, very few people have knowingly seen it, leading some scientists to declare it extinct and most to assume it to be a mirage. It will only show itself to a person who is pure of heart.      Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres      Advertisement      What makes them special, according to Pokemon resource Bulbapedia:      In the anime, Professor Oak states that Articuno and Moltres combined powers of ice and fire are the source and cradle of the oceans, and that Zapdos’ electric energy creates the currents and streams.      Mewtwo      Advertisement      What makes it special, according to Pokemon resource Bulbapedia:      Mewtwo was created after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments based on Mew. It is said to have the most savage heart among all Pokémon, lack compassion, and strike fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. Ditto      Advertisement      What makes it special, according to Pokemon resource Bulbapedia:      It can breed with any Pokémon other than the Pokémon in the Undiscovered group and itself, including some genderless Pokémon, to produce Eggs of the other’s species.      Most of this list makes sense...save for Ditto, who is not a legendary Pokémon. To be fair, though, Ditto is somewhat rare within the games themselves. Another thing worth considering: normally, Ditto plays a key part in a feature that is not currently available in Pokémon Go: breeding. Like battling and trading, it may be that developer Niantic introduces the breeding mechanic sometime in the future, which would explain Ditto’s current disappearance. Another possible explanation: Niantic is diving into Pokémon lore with Ditto—one of the most famous fan theories is that Ditto is a failed Mew clone. Maybe Ditto’s appearance is tied to Mew/Mewtwo, and we can expect to see them all around the same time.      Advertisement      I reached out to Niantic about Pokémon Go legendaries, and I’ve yet to hear back from them. But looking at the original announcement trailer for Pokémon Go may give us some clues on what to expect:      At the 1:59 mark, you can see a crowd surrounding a Mewtwo display in Times Square. There’s also a countdown timer, during which the players can all attack Mewtwo at once. At the end, Mewtwo’s healthbar is depleted, and the entire crowd catches him.      Advertisement      An actual event tied to a place probably won’t look as epic, unless Niantic splurges on holograms or something. But otherwise, mechanically speaking, what the trailer presents seems within the realm of possibility. Actually, the trailer closely resembles what is already available at Pokémon gyms, where multiple players can team up and try to defeat a strong monster together. Legendary events seem to be the same thing, except on a grander scale.      What is unknown is whether or not a legendary like Mewtwo will be available in multiple different regions / areas, or if he will only be capturable in a single spot. Given that Pokémon Go is already drawing incredible crowds at unofficial events, and some players are willing to risk it all to capture non-legendaries, the thought of area-specific legendary seems absurd: an event would quickly get out of hand. But if a legendary is available in multiple places, that set-up would betray the idea behind legendaries in the first place. It’s a conundrum for Niantic, the developers. Niantic has experience running events for Ingress, their previous game, but Ingress was never as big as Pokémon Go.      Meanwhile, Pokémon Go players have been busy diving into the code, trying to figure out what is going on. NesstendoYT made headlines earlier this month when he claimed that every legendary was technically accounted for in Pokémon Go’s code even if they weren’t obtainable yet:      On Reddit, players have noted a few specific details about the code pertaining to the legendaries and Ditto. Here’s kylecito, with some of what he allegedly found:      Mewtwo does not have a BaseCaptureRate, only a FleeRate. This shows you shouldn’t be able to find Mewtwo wild, and it will probably be a sure capture when you fulfill the event’s requirements. Mew is the ONLY “Mythic” type Pokemon at the moment. Seems like all Pokemon have “family types”, apart from their species one. Wonder if they plan to implement breeding in the future?      Advertisement      UPDATE 1/5 12:05 PM: Ditto has now been caught.      UPDATE 7/26 12:49 AM: Welp, turns out the two videos below are fake, as FrozenAquaCat explains here. The other Pokemon Go players still allege that the rare monsters are at least mentioned in the code. Nonetheless, we apologize for not affording the spawn videos the same skepticism as the rest of the supposed player discoveries that people have made.      Advertisement      Another player, FrozenAquaCat, messed with Pokémon Go’s files and was able to force the game to spawn a Ditto:      “Through the modification of the Pokemon Go client, I was able to change the ID that shows up during an encounter from 13 (weedle) to 132 (ditto),” FrozenAquaCat wrote on the YouTube description. “The game currently crashes any time I attempt to throw a pokeball or do anything in the menu.”      Advertisement      In a follow-up video, FrozenAquaCat explains how he uses a Python script to force the game to change normal encounters into legendary ones. In the video below, he transforms a Rattata into a Zapdos by injecting code into a program in real time, as he plays the game on the PC.      The Zapdos that spawns has a CP of 753, but he can’t actually capture it. Still, it’s cool to see what these fabled rare monsters look like in-game.      Advertisement      There’s no telling when or how Niantic will officially introduce legendaries into Pokémon Go, but in the meantime, players will continue to keep themselves busy catching ‘em all. Well, most of ‘em. ||||| Abstract Background Self–reported physical activity has been inversely associated with mortality but the effect of objectively measured step activity on mortality has never been evaluated. The objective is to determine the prospective association of daily step activity on mortality among free-living adults. Methods and Findings Cohort study of free-living adults residing in Tasmania, Australia between 2000 and 2005 who participated in one of three cohort studies (n = 2 576 total participants). Daily step activity by pedometer at baseline at a mean of 58.8 years of age, and for a subset, repeated monitoring was available 3.7 (SD 1.3) years later (n = 1 679). All-cause mortality (n = 219 deaths) was ascertained by record-linkage to the Australian National Death Index; 90% of participants were followed-up over ten years, until June 2011. Higher daily step count at baseline was linearly associated with lower all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio AHR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.98 per 1 000 steps; P = 0.004). Risk was altered little by removing deaths occurring in the first two years. Increasing baseline daily steps from sedentary to 10 000 steps a day was associated with a 46% (95% CI, 18% to 65%; P = 0.004) lower risk of mortality in the decade of follow-up. In addition, those who increased their daily steps over the monitoring period had a substantial reduction in mortality risk, after adjusting for baseline daily step count (AHR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.72; P = 0.002), or other factors (AHR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21–0.70; P = 0.002). Conclusions Higher daily step count was linearly associated with subsequent long term mortality among free living adults. These data are the first to quantify mortality reductions using an objective measure of physical activity in a free living population. They strongly underscore the importance of physical inactivity as a major public health problem.      Citation: Dwyer T, Pezic A, Sun C, Cochrane J, Venn A, Srikanth V, et al.

Introduction The inverse associations between physical activity (PA) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), [1–3] some cancers, [4] and all-cause mortality [5–7] have been demonstrated using self-reported PA. A meta-analysis concluded that the findings are consistent across studies and that there is a dose-response relationship between self-reported PA and mortality. [8] Parallel studies of change in fitness and mortality outcomes also indicate a likely benefit of PA on mortality. [9–11] Randomised trials involving PA interventions have demonstrated beneficial effects on elevated HDL cholesterol [12] and increased insulin sensitivity [13] but have not been maintained long enough to evaluate mortality. Prospective studies with accurate objective measurements of physical activity in a free-living population that can then quantify subsequent mortality risk have not been available. Developments in technology to improve the objective PA measurement in humans through the use of objective measures such as pedometers and accelerometers have promise. [14,15] Pedometers capture most of the variance in PA measured by accelerometers in adult populations. [16,17] Data from cohort studies using pedometers are now starting to emerge. [18] Yates et al, using data from the NAVIGATOR trial, [18] estimated a 10% reduction in annual cardiovascular disease (CVD) event rate for a 2 000 daily step increase at baseline. However, the NAVIGATOR study participants had impaired glucose tolerance and CVD or higher CVD risk so extrapolation to healthy free-living populations is difficult. Further, the level of PA was low compared to some general population samples: 5 000 daily steps [18] compared to up to 9 000 steps found in general populations aged over 50 years. [19] The recent U.S. nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) used accelerometers to focus on sedentary behaviour and reported that those who were in the highest category of sedentary time had an odds ratio (OR) for all-cause mortality of 5.0 over a 2.8 year follow-up period compared to the least sedentary. [20] This suggests that an even greater effect might be found in healthier populations. The possibility of reverse causality also needs to be addressed. The removal of early deaths in analyses of cohort data has been recognised as a critical way to take into account the possibility of reverse causality. [21] Neither of the above studies had sufficient follow-up time to address this. [18,20] In this report, we pool three population-based adult cohorts based in Tasmania [21–24] to enable us to examine the prospective association between daily step activity and all-cause mortality over a decade of follow-up. The independent association between a temporal objective change in daily steps and mortality is also assessed.      Methods The Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AUSDIAB) study Participants. The AUSDIAB study was a population based study designed to investigate diabetes. [25] Baseline testing was conducted on participants over 18 years of age in 2000. There were 1 136 participants who had a baseline oral glucose tolerance test then wore pedometers for two days at baseline and 642 provided pedometer data at both baseline and at a repeat interview. [21] Measures. Information on PA was collected using the Active Australia Questionnaire. [26] A weighted sum of the responses (with vigorous-intensity activity given double-weighting) was calculated to quantify total hours of PA. [26] Pedometer data (Omron HJ-003 and Omron HJ-102; Omron Healthcare, Inc., Bannockburn, IL) [21] were collected. Ethics. All participants gave informed written consent and the AUSDIAB was approved by the Southern Tasmanian Health and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee, University of Tasmania. The Tasmanian Older Adult Cohort (TASOAC) study Participants. The TASOAC study was a prospective study. Individuals between the ages of 50 and 80 years were randomly selected from the electoral roll in Southern Tasmania. Of all initially eligible individuals, 1 041 attended a baseline clinic between March 2002 and September 2004. Repeat interview data were collected for 793 eligible participants at a subsequent clinic approximately two to three years later. Measures. PA was assessed objectively as steps per day, as determined by pedometer at baseline (Omron HJ-003 and HJ-102; Omron Health-care Kyoto, Japan) and at second interview (Yamax Digi-Walker SW-200) as previously described.

All participants gave informed written consent and the TASOAC was approved by the Southern Tasmanian Health and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee, University of Tasmania.

Non institutionalised residents from southern Tasmania aged between 60 and 86 years (n = 399) were randomly selected from the electoral roll. The collection of baseline measures commenced in 2005. Measures. For PA, the average number of steps per day was measured using a Yamax Digi-Walker SW-200 pedometer at baseline and at second review worn for seven days. [29] PA was also collected by questionnaire using the IPAQ. [28] Ethics. All participants gave informed written consent and the TASCOG was approved by the Southern Tasmanian Health and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee, University of Tasmania. The Tasped cohort The Tasped cohort was developed by pooling three pre-existing cohort studies based on Tasmanian adults–the Australian Diabetes Obesity and Lifestyle (AUSDIAB) study, [21,22] the Tasmanian Older Adult Cohort (TASOAC) study [23] and the Tasmanian Study of Cognition and Gait (TASCOG) study. [24] The Tasped cohort participants were linked to the National Death Index, compiled by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare for all Australian deaths, to determine mortality up to June 2011. [30] In all studies, the self-report of lifestyle factors, medications and medical history including doctor diagnosed conditions was recorded by questionnaire. In all studies, a self-administered validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), developed by the Cancer Council of Victoria, was used to assess dietary and alcohol intake during the previous 12 months. [31] The Southern Tasmanian Health and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee University of Tasmania, specifically approved the Tasped cohort. Statistical Analysis The primary analysis was done with data from all participants who completed baseline PA measures: questionnaire and pedometer-based. The summary PA measure for each period was the average daily number of steps over two consecutive days where at least one was a weekday. We have previously established this measure of daily steps is inversely and prospectively associated with hypertension (AOR 0.87 (95% CI 0.77–0.97)) [22] and insulin sensitivity and adiposity in free-living adults. [21] Time-to-event analyses were used to assess the relationship between PA and all-cause mortality. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate unadjusted survival curves by PA group. The Cox proportional hazards model [32] was used to estimate crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) controlling for potential confounders as listed in Table footnotes and text. The proportionality assumption was assessed graphically via log-log survival curves and deemed to be appropriate. HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) accounted for age and sex unless those factors were the parameters of interest. Tests of trend of categorical variables were undertaken by using the categorical variable as a linear predictor, providing a P-value for the Wald test associated with the average HR per category increase. The linearity of the continuous exposures, such as baseline daily steps, was assessed using fractional polynomials. [33] In past work comparing the Omron to the Yamax pedometer, the two types were found to be linearly correlated (r = 0.88; P < 0.001, with the Omron reading higher by a mean difference of 9%). [29] We therefore multiplied the Omron pedometers for the correction factor (0.91) found in the comparison study. [29] All analyses were performed using Stata version 13 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas, USA).      Discussion The major finding from this pooled adult cohort study, comprising over 2 500 free-living participants followed-up over a decade, was that daily step count measured at baseline was inversely associated with all-cause mortality. Further, a temporal increase in annual daily steps was independently associated with lower mortality. These findings are the first concerning the association between objectively measured levels of PA and all-cause mortality in a free-living population. The association was independent of factors such as BMI or smoking. The observed effects were similar in magnitude of mortality benefit observed for statins in randomised trials. [36] A major strength is that the objective daily steps–mortality findings permits a much clearer definition of the linear shape of the relationship. This explains why lower activity level was associated with an approximately 10% lower mortality but a greater magnitude change from sedentary to over 10 000 steps a day was associated with more than a 40% mortality reduction. These findings are consistent with the findings of a past meta-analysis on self-reported activity, where highly active men had a significantly lower mortality than moderately active men. [37] Here, we also validate a recent study also demonstrating a dose response effect of reported physical activity and mortality [38] by providing supportive objective findings. This concept of a dose-response relation between daily steps and mortality has important public health implications. Although directly comparable studies are not yet available, this magnitude of effect is similar to the effect of daily step activity on cardiovascular events in the NAVIGATOR Study high CVD risk participants. [18] Also, although not directly comparable, this relatively large effect is consistent with the high likelihood of mortality for the highest category of sedentary time for all-cause mortality in the NHANES, with an odds ratio of five. [20] Otherwise, past large population based studies have generally used questionnaires that rely on the self-report of physical activity. One study that compared self-reported PA and exercise capacity simultaneously among the same cohort found a poor correlation between the two measures, though high levels of each were associated with reductions in mortality, [10] similar to the findings described here between self-reported PA and objectively measured PA. Reasons for the observed differences between objective and subjective methods to estimate PA typically focuses on biases that influence recall [39] or social desirability. [40] Also, a previous study reported that using pedometer significantly increased physical activity Therefore, a two-day pedometer may possibly overestimate daily physical activity compared to self-reported leisure-time physical activity [41]. The risk reduction was unlikely to be due to reverse causality. Removal of the first two years of deaths from the analysis did not alter the estimated HR. Intensity of PA was able to be considered and there was not a difference in magnitude of effect for daily step count with mortality among those taking vigorous activity versus those who reported not having done so. The inference that the inverse association between steps and death is not primarily due to concurrent illness influencing exercise tolerance was supported by the observation that the association between steps and mortality was not different among those with a reported doctor diagnosed illnesses. A potential limitation is that only two consecutive days of pedometer recording was used, but a previous study investigating how this might affect estimates reported that two days captured 89% of the variance over a seven day recording period. [42] It is reassuring that among the smaller sample in which repeat measures were also available, increasing steps over time was also found to be protective, even independently of baseline step count. Attrition bias is unlikely. Here, follow-up was for death, the National Death Index was used and has been shown to be relatively complete. [30] Given that few longitudinal observations from healthy free-living populations with documented daily step activity and subsequent long-term disease or mortality exist, these findings are highly relevant for future pedometer-based PA promotion guidelines. Consideration should be given to the linear nature of the association found for daily steps and mortality. These findings strengthen the evidence base for the hypothesis that physical activity can play a substantial role in reducing mortality. This report is the first to quantify the mortality reductions associated with objectively measured daily step activity in a free living population, and strongly underscore the importance of physical inactivity as a major public health problem.

A study conducted at Microsoft Research, “Influence of Pokémon Go on Physical Activity: Study and Implications,” finds that the benefits of playing the physical activity-minded mobile game are more than just “sizable,” though: Players have increased their exercise levels so significantly that they’ve accounted for an estimated 144 billion steps taken nationwide, among other achievements.      The study queried nearly 1,500 Pokémon Go users during the months of July and August, when the game was inarguably at its peak popularity. That’s a small pool, considering how many millions downloaded the game just after launch, and there are other biases to take into account. Lead researcher Tim Althoff explained to Polygon that the findings resemble those of other, similar studies, however, lending credence to the results.      “We find that in our study, subjects had a median age of 33 (reasonable given expectations for who actually plays Pokémon Go), 36.5 percent were overweight and 28.2 percent are obese,” he wrote to us in an email. “This matches official U.S. estimates very well. These indicate that our population is not extremely off.”      The researchers required these subjects to use a 150 Microsoft Band to track their steps, an expense that could further skew results toward more affluent users. Still, the study turned up impressive results with regards to Pokémon Go’s potential impact on public health. More than their control group, who simply walked around with the Microsoft Band on, the team’s Pokémon trainers were becoming increasingly active.      Playing Pokémon Go could add millions of years on our collective lifespan      “After they start playing Pokémon Go they exhibit a large increase in activity to an average of 7,229 daily steps ... which now is about 13 percent larger than the control population,” according to the study.      With more engagement came more time spent on their feet, walking around outdoors and ostensibly getting fit, regardless of age or gender. Althoff estimated that, alongside the positive potential effect on American step counts, the population could see an increase in average life expectancy as a result — upward of 2.825 million years.      “I find the life expectancy analysis intriguing because it highlights the massive impact that games like Pokémon Go could have on public health, the fact that an app could have a measurable impact on US-wide life expectancy,” he told us. “However, the analysis is based on the assumption that Pokémon Go would be able to sustain the high levels of engagement. This is certainly their goal but our analyses also highlight that this is their main challenge.”      Playtime with Pokémon Go has dropped off wildly since its summertime debut; even the research study noticed the change in engagment by its Aug. 23 conclusion. There are several factors for why players aren’t quite as active as they were when the game first arrived, including the change in seasons. So while Pokémon Go could still stand to be a boon for public health, that ship already may have sailed.      Pokémon Go may not be able to sustain players long enought to see the benefits      “We are very sure about the fact that Pokémon [Go] did increase activity significantly, that [the game is] able to reach less active populations compared to other health apps, and that activity dropped down after a few weeks, at least for the average user in our dataset.      “Being able to gain and sustain large-scale engagement is the holy grail for any app, game, or tech company. Pokémon Go, while very successful, seems to be no exception to that challenge.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Although Pokemon Go usage may be waning, new research by Microsoft has revealed that as well as playing a role in increasing social interaction, the app is enabling otherwise “low activity” players to increase the amount of exercise they do. Researchers found that increasing the daily step count from sedentary levels to 10,000 steps a day was associated with a 46% lower risk of mortality in a ten-year period. Analyzing 1,500 users of the action-based game, Microsoft found that users increased their activity by 1,473 steps, suggesting that augmented-reality games have a promising future in terms of public health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat.

Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's.

We need to construct points A and B on the sides of the angle such that the perimeter of triangle PAB is minimized. 2. **Mirror Points Construction:** - Let points P_1 and P_2 be the reflections of point P over the sides OA and OB, respectively. This geometric transformation helps to leverage the properties of symmetry in our problem. 3. **Intersection of Reflected Point Line with Angle Sides:** - Draw the line segment P_1P_2. Since the given angle is acute, it is guaranteed that the segment P_1P_2 will intersect the sides OA and OB. Let these intersection points be A' and B', respectively. 4. **Considerations on Triangle Perimeter:** - The perimeter of triangle PAB is given by PA + AB + BP. Utilizing the symmetry, realize that this is equivalent to P_1A + AB + BP_2. - By the triangle inequality, we know that the sum P_1A + AB + BP_2 is minimized when the path coincides directly with the line segment P_1P_2 without deviation, thus intersecting at A' and B' as mentioned. 5. **Minimum Perimeter Configuration:** - Therefore, the perimeter P_1A + AB + BP_2 is minimized and exactly equals to the length of the line segment P_1P_2. This minimum is achieved if and only if A coincides with A' and B coincides with B'. This is because any deviation from A' and B' would increase the path length. 6. **Conclusion:** - Given that the positions of P_1 and P_2 are fixed by reflecting P, the minimum perimeter of triangle PAB is achieved by setting A to A' and B to B'. Hence the construction of points A and B is complete where A and B are the points of intersection of the line segment P_1P_2 with the sides of the angle. Therefore, A and B are the optimal points achieving the minimum perimeter for triangle PAB.

Let (M_{1}) and (M_{2}) be the centers of circles (omega_{1}) and (omega_{2}) respectively. Similarly, (m_{1}) and (m_{2}) are the perpendicular bisectors of the segments (A_{1}A_{2}) and (A_{2}A_{3}), respectively. 3. (M_{1}) lies on (m_{1}) and (M_{2}) on (m_{2}).

Because (M_{1}A_{2}) and (M_{2}A_{2}) are both radii of (omega_{1}) and (omega_{2}), and they are perpendicular to the common tangent of (omega_{1}) and (omega_{2}) at the point (A_{2}), the points (M_{1}), (A_{2}), and (M_{2}) must be collinear. 5.

Denote the length of the given segment AB as d and the length of the tangent from point A to the given circle as AE = t. 3. Notice that the angle P M Q angle is congruent to R P Q angle since they rest on the arc PQ. Additionally, R P Q angle = A R P angle as they are alternate interior angles because PQ parallel AB. Therefore, [ P M Q angle = A M B angle = A R P angle ] Hence, since the angle at A is common, [ triangle A R P sim triangle A M B ] 4. This similarity implies that: [ frac{x}{AP} = frac{AM}{d} ] 5.

The point of tangency will be P. - The second intersection of the line AP with the given circle will be the sought point M. Since two tangents can be drawn from R to the circle, there will always be two points M and M^{*} solving the problem. # Verification of the construction: We need to prove that for the constructed point M, the line segment MB intersects the circle at a second point Q such that PQ parallel AB. From the construction process and the derived similarity of triangles: [ triangle A R P sim triangle A M B ] which implies: [ A R P angle = A M B angle ] Since these angles rest on arc PQ, we have: [ Q P R angle = P M Q angle equiv A M B angle ] Combining all these, it follows that: [ Q P R angle = A R P angle ] and thus [ PQ parallel AB ] The problem is thus solved. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Define a new operation x otimes y = x^2 y^2.

As ((1, 1)) is the bottom-left corner, it requires 1 + 1 - 1 = 1 rook. This is straightforward since Misha begins with 199 rooks in the bag. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: - Assume that Misha can place rooks up to position ((x, y)) (where (1 leq x leq 100) and (1 leq y le 100)). This placement hypothetically leaves us with enough rooks to fulfill the condition for every step from ((1,1)) to ((x, y)). 3. **Inductive Step**: - We need to show that this assumption allows us to place a rook at position ((x+1, y)) or ((x, y+1)), depending on the grid's boundaries. For position ((x, y)), as hypothesized, boxed{x + y - 1} rooks are required. - Let's analyze the placement at ((x+1, y)). It would require ((x+1) + y - 1 = x + y) rooks in total.

Hence, we still have one more step in our movement without exceeding the 199 rooks: [ x + y leq 199 ] - The similar logic applies when moving vertically to the next position ((x, y+1)). It requires (x + (y+1) - 1 = x + y) rooks. Using the same hypothesis and remaining moves, this satisfies the condition. 4. **General Position**: - When considering the position ((100, y_{100})), placing a rook requires: [ 100 + y_{100} - 1 leq 199 ] - This inequality holds because Misha starts with 199 rooks. Extending this logic to position ((99, y_{99})), the placement requires: [ 99 + y_{99} - 1 leq 198 ] - And again continues for all upstream positions until: [ 1 + y_1 - 1 leq 1 ] Thus, using induction, Misha can place all 100 rooks on the 100x100 board such that no rooks attack each other.

The probability that task 4 will not be completed on time is 1 minus the probability that it will be completed on time, which is 1 - 7/12 = 5/12. Now, we multiply these probabilities together: (3/8) * (2/5) * (5/9) * (5/12) To simplify the calculation, we can multiply the numerators together and the denominators together: Numerator: 3 * 2 * 5 * 5 = 150 Denominator: 8 * 5 * 9 * 12 = 2160 So the probability is: 150 / 2160 This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 30: 150 / 30 = 5 2160 / 30 = 72 So the simplified probability is: 5 / 72 Therefore, the probability that task 1 and task 3 will be completed on time, but task 2 and task 4 will not, is boxed{5/72} ."},{"instruction":"A certain bus driver is paid a regular rate for any number of hours that does not exceed 40 hours per week. For any overtime hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week, the bus driver is paid a rate that is 75% higher than his regular rate. Last week the bus driver earned 976 in total compensation and worked 52 hours. What is his regular rate per hour?","output":"Let's denote the regular rate per hour as R. The bus driver worked 52 hours, so he worked 40 hours at his regular rate and 12 hours at the overtime rate. The overtime rate is 75% higher than the regular rate, so the overtime rate is R + 0.75R = 1.75R. The total compensation for the week is the sum of the compensation for the regular hours and the overtime hours. So, the total compensation (TC) can be calculated as follows: TC = (Regular hours * Regular rate) + (Overtime hours * Overtime rate) TC = (40 * R) + (12 * 1.75R) TC = 40R + 21R TC = 61R We know the total compensation (TC) is 976, so we can set up the equation: 61R = 976 Now, we can solve for R (the regular rate per hour): R = 976 / 61 R = 16 Therefore, the regular rate per hour for the bus driver is boxed{16} ."},{"instruction":"Suppose for some p, q, r we have p+q+r = 3, pq+qr+rp = 11, and pqr = 6.

Thus, we can express the total number of coins as: [ n = 13k + 3 ] where k is the number of coins each of the other 10 friends receives. We also know that n < 150. Therefore, we set up the inequality: [ 13k + 3 < 150 ] [ 13k < 147 ] [ k < frac{147}{13} approx 11.31 ] Since k must be an integer, the largest possible value for k is 11.

Since each digit must be used exactly once among the three integers, we can distribute the digits in a way that minimizes the differences in their values. Let's start by assigning the largest digit, 9, to the thousands place of the smallest number, and the smallest digit, 2, to the thousands place of the largest number. This will help to minimize the differences in their overall values. The middle number will have a digit in the thousands place that is between the largest and smallest digits, so we can use 7 for that. Now we have: n = 9xxx m = 7xxx p = 2xxx Next, we assign the remaining digits to the hundreds, tens, and ones places in a way that keeps the numbers close together. We can use the next largest available digits for n, the middle digits for m, and the smallest available digits for p.

Since RS and PQ are parallel, the triangles formed by these intersections (triangle TVU and triangle PVQ) will be similar due to corresponding angle congruence (angle TVU cong angle PVQ and angle TUV cong angle VPQ). The ratio of the sides TU:PQ = 3:8. Because of the similarity, the ratio of the altitudes of triangle TVU to triangle PVQ is the same, 3:8. The height of rectangle PQRS is 4, which serves as the altitude of triangle TVU. Therefore, the altitude of triangle PVQ is frac{8}{3} times 4 = frac{32}{3} units.

Taking the derivative, we get f'(x)= frac {1}{x}-e^{x}, (x > 0).

Therefore, f(x) is increasing on (0,x_{0}) and decreasing on (x_{0},+infty). Thus, f(x)_{max}=ln x_{0}-e^{x_{0}}=-x_{0}- frac {1}{x_{0}}=-(x_{0}+ frac {1}{x_{0}}) < -2. Therefore, f(x) < -2. 2. For f(x)=ln x-e^{x-a}+a, taking the derivative, we get f'(x)= frac {1}{x}-e^{x-a}, (x > 0). This implies that f(x) has a unique maximum point x_{1} on (0,+infty), and f(x_{1}) > 0.

The focus F of the parabola is (frac{p}{2}, 0), so the point P which is equidistant from the focus and the directrix (and given the nature of the parabola and the conditions) can be represented as P(frac{p}{2}, p). 2. **Slope of OP Calculation**: The slope of the line segment OP connecting the origin O to the point P(frac{p}{2}, p) is calculated using the formula for the slope between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), which is frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}. Thus, k_{OP} = frac{p - 0}{frac{p}{2} - 0} = 2. 3. **Slope of PQ and Equation of PQ**: Since PQ is perpendicular to OP, the slope of PQ, k_{PQ}, is the negative reciprocal of k_{OP}. Hence, k_{PQ} = -frac{1}{2}. The equation of a line with slope m passing through a point (x_1, y_1) is y - y_1 = m(x - x_1). Applying this to PQ gives the equation y - p = -frac{1}{2}(x - frac{p}{2}). 4. **Finding x when y=0**: To find the intersection of PQ with the x-axis, we set y=0 in the equation of PQ and solve for x.

Expanding the left side, we get: sin^2 theta + 2 sin theta cos theta + cos^2 theta = frac{1}{25}. Now, using the Pythagorean identity sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1, we can substitute it into the equation: 1 + 2 sin theta cos theta = frac{1}{25}. Then solve for 2 sin theta cos theta: 2 sin theta cos theta = frac{1}{25} - 1 = -frac{24}{25}. Divide by 2 to isolate sin theta cos theta: sin theta cos theta = -frac{12}{25}. Now, let's focus on finding tan theta: tan theta = frac{sin theta}{cos theta}. Since we cannot directly find the sine and cosine from the given equation, let's turn this fraction into a form that involves sin theta cos theta. We can use the identity sin^2 theta = 1 - cos^2 theta (and similarly for cosine) to express sine in terms of cosine (or vice versa) and substitute this relation back into our equation for tan theta. From sin theta + cos theta = frac{1}{5}, solve for sin theta to get: sin theta = frac{1}{5} - cos theta. Square this to find sin^2 theta: sin^2 theta = left(frac{1}{5} - cos thetaright)^2 = frac{1}{25} - frac{2}{5}cos theta + cos^2 theta, and substitute sin^2 theta = 1 - cos^2 theta: 1 - cos^2 theta = frac{1}{25} - frac{2}{5}cos theta + cos^2 theta. From this equation we can solve for cos theta, but as theta in (0, pi), cos theta will be negative. Let's continue with the equation to find cos theta. Combine like terms and move everything to one side: 2cos^2 theta - frac{2}{5}cos theta + frac{24}{25} = 0. This is a quadratic in form. To solve this quadratic, find the roots. However, given the domain of theta, we are looking for the negative root for cos theta because cos theta is negative in the second quadrant (frac{pi}{2}, pi). Let's calculate the discriminant b^2 - 4ac for this quadratic equation where a = 2, b = -frac{2}{5}, and c = frac{24}{25}: left(-frac{2}{5}right)^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot frac{24}{25} = frac{4}{25} - frac{192}{25} = -frac{188}{25}. Since the discriminant is negative, we have a slight problem; we were expecting a real solution for cos theta because theta in (0, pi). It looks like we've made an arithmetic error while working through the solution. Let's go back and correct the error. Going back to the original squared sum, we should consider: 1 + 2 sin theta cos theta = frac{1}{25}. We should've solved for 2 sin theta cos theta to get: 2 sin theta cos theta = frac{1}{25} - 1 = -frac{24}{25}. Now, we divide by 2 to get sin theta cos theta: sin theta cos theta = -frac{12}{25}. But we need to find the individual values of sin theta and cos theta. For this instance, we can use the identity sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1 along with the given sum sin theta + cos theta = frac{1}{5} to solve for one in terms of the other and then use substitution. Let's use a system of equations, where we have: begin{cases} sin theta + cos theta = frac{1}{5}, sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1. end{cases} Now, square the first equation to find: (sin theta + cos theta)^2 = left(frac{1}{5}right)^2, sin^2 theta + 2 sin theta cos theta + cos^2 theta = frac{1}{25}. Substitute the sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1 into the equation just derived: 1 + 2 sin theta cos theta = frac{1}{25}, 2 sin theta cos theta = frac{1}{25} - 1 = -frac{24}{25}. Here, divide both sides by 2: sin theta cos theta = -frac{12}{25}. Now, use the substitutions to solve for sin theta and cos theta separately: sin theta = frac{1}{5} - cos theta, left(frac{1}{5} - cos thetaright)^2 + cos^2 theta = 1. After solving this system (which I will skip for brevity), we get that: cos theta = -frac{3}{5}, and thus: sin theta = frac{4}{5}. Now we can finally find tan theta: tan theta = frac{sin theta}{cos theta} = frac{frac{4}{5}}{-frac{3}{5}} = -frac{4}{3}.

We perform a sequence of ( k ) steps where in each step, we toggle the state (on/off) of one lamp. We define: - ( N ) to be the number of sequences of ( k ) steps resulting in lamps 1 to ( n ) being on and lamps ( n+1 ) to ( 2n ) being off. - ( M ) to be the number of sequences of ( k ) steps resulting in lamps 1 to ( n ) being on and lamps ( n+1 ) to ( 2n ) being off without ever toggling any lamp numbered ( n+1 ) to ( 2n ). 2. **Constraints:** We are given that ( k geq n ) and ( k-n ) is even. This ensures that we can distribute the steps evenly considering the toggling conditions. 3. **Counting ( M ):** The value ( M ) counts the sequences where only lamps 1 to ( n ) are toggled. Given that each of these ( n ) lamps must be toggled an odd number of times to end up 'on', ( M ) is simply the number of ways to distribute ( k ) steps to toggle these ( n ) lamps. Since each of the ( n ) lamps must be toggled an odd number of times, and ( k ) steps in total, we can proceed by determining how to distribute these odd toggles. This becomes a specific combinatorial problem but doesn't directly affect the numerical relationship required, so specific detailed counts of ( M ) are not necessary. 4. **Counting ( N ):** For ( N ), we allow toggling the lamps ( n+1 ) to ( 2n ) in addition to lamps 1 to ( n ). Each lamp ( n+1 ) to ( 2n ) can be considered as either being toggled or not without affecting the necessity of each of the first ( n ) lamps being 'oddly' toggled. 5. **Relationship Between ( N ) and ( M ):** For each sequence in ( M ) (where only the lamps 1 through ( n ) are considered), each of the ( k ) steps could either focus on these ( n ) lamps alone, or we could introduce pairs where each of the lamps among the ( n+1 ) to ( 2n ) can be considered toggled affecting the same steps: Given ( k-n ) pairs of steps (since ( k-n ) is even), this results in each of these pairs offering ( 2 ) choices.

When the man is rowing upstream, the speed of the boat is the difference between the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the stream, so the effective speed upstream is ( b - s ) km/h. We are given that the man rows 72 km downstream in 3 hours and 30 km upstream in 3 hours.

Prove that f(x) is a periodic function and calculate the value of fleft( frac {1}{3}right)+fleft( frac {2}{3}right)+fleft( frac {3}{3}right)+ldots+fleft( frac {2017}{3}right).","output":"(1) Since f(x) is not identically zero, there exists an x_0 such that f(x_0) neq 0. Let m = x_0, n = 0, f(x_0 + 0) + f(x_0 - 0) = 2f(x_0)f(0), which implies 2f(x_0) = 2f(x_0)f(0). Since f(x_0) neq 0, we get f(0) = 1. Next, let m = n = 1, then f(1 + 1) + f(1 - 1) = 2f(1)^2, which means f(2) + f(0) = 2f(1)^2. But since f(2) = f(1 + 1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0), we have that f(2) = f(0) = 1. Therefore, 2f(1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2, giving us f(1)^2 = 1, so f(1) = pm 1. Considering the constraint that f(1) < 1, we conclude that f(1) = -1. Therefore, we have boxed{f(0) = 1 text{ and } f(1) = -1}. (2) Let m = 0 and n = x, we get f(x) + f(-x) = 2f(0)f(x) = 2f(x). This simplifies to f(-x) = f(x), proving that f(x) is an even function. (3) From the condition f(1+m) = f(1-m), by setting m = -x we obtain f(1-x) = f(1+x). Since f(x) is even, we get f(x+2) = f(x). Hence, f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 2. Let m = n = frac{1}{3}, then fleft(frac{2}{3}right) + f(0) = 2fleft(frac{1}{3}right)^2, which gives fleft(frac{2}{3}right) +1 = 2fleft(frac{1}{3}right)^2. Also, let m = frac{2}{3}, n = frac{1}{3}, then f(1) + fleft(frac{1}{3}right) = 2fleft(frac{2}{3}right)fleft(frac{1}{3}right), which simplifies to fleft(frac{1}{3}right) -1 = 2fleft(frac{2}{3}right)fleft(frac{1}{3}right). Knowing that fleft(frac{2}{3}right) < 1, we can solve the system of equations to find fleft(frac{1}{3}right) = frac{1}{2} and fleft(frac{2}{3}right) = -frac{1}{2}. Because f(x) is periodic with a period of 2, we have fleft(frac{1}{3}right) = fleft(frac{1}{3} + 2kright) and fleft(frac{2}{3}right) = fleft(frac{2}{3} + 2kright) for any integer k. Thus, the sum of three consecutive values over one period is zero: fleft(frac{1}{3}right) + fleft(frac{2}{3}right) + f(1) = 0. To calculate the value of the sum from frac{1}{3} to frac{2017}{3}, we can split into blocks of three terms for each period. Since there are 672 complete periods of 3 within 2017 (2017 mod 3 = 1), the sum over these periods is 672 times 0 = 0, and the last term is fleft(frac{2017}{3}right) which is equal to fleft(frac{1}{3}right).

He loses 2400 calories a week from dancing. What is the ratio of calories burned per hour dancing to calories burned per hour walking?","output":"First, let's find out how many hours James dances per week. He dances twice a day for 0.5 hours each time, so that's 1 hour per day. Since he does this 4 times a week, he dances for a total of 4 hours per week. Now, we know that he loses 2400 calories per week from dancing. To find out how many calories he burns per hour while dancing, we divide the total weekly calories by the number of hours he dances per week: 2400 calories per week / 4 hours per week = 600 calories per hour dancing Now we have the calories burned per hour walking, which is 300 calories per hour, and the calories burned per hour dancing, which is 600 calories per hour. To find the ratio of calories burned per hour dancing to calories burned per hour walking, we divide the calories burned per hour dancing by the calories burned per hour walking: 600 calories per hour dancing / 300 calories per hour walking = 2 So, the ratio of calories burned per hour dancing to calories burned per hour walking is boxed{2:1} ."},{"instruction":"A bag contains 10 red, 12 green, 13 yellow, 15 blue, and 5 purple jelly beans.

(1) Find the equation of the ellipse and the range of values for the slope k of line AB; (2) Tangent lines to the ellipse are drawn at points A and B, intersecting at point P. Determine whether point P always lies on a fixed line, explaining the reason.","output":"(1) Since overrightarrow{F_{1}F_{2}} = 2overrightarrow{NF_{1}} and |overrightarrow{F_{1}F_{2}}| = 2, we have the system of equations: begin{cases} 2c = |overrightarrow{F_{1}F_{2}}| = 2 frac{a^2}{c} - 1 = |overrightarrow{NF_{1}}| = 1 a^2 = b^2 + c^2. end{cases} Solving this system results in a^2 = 2 and b^2 = 1, so the equation of the ellipse is frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1. Since overrightarrow{NA} = lambda overrightarrow{NB}, points A, B, and N are collinear, and point N has coordinates (-2, 0). Let the equation of line AB be y = k(x + 2), where k is the slope of line AB, and it is known that k neq 0. Substituting into the ellipse equation and eliminating x, we get (frac{1}{k}y - 2)^2 + 2y^2 = 2, which simplifies to frac{2k^2 + 1}{k^2}y^2 - frac{4}{k}y + 2 = 0. For the line to intersect the ellipse, we need the discriminant: begin{cases} Delta = left(frac{4}{k}right)^2 - 8 cdot frac{2k^2 + 1}{k^2} > 0 k neq 0. end{cases} Solving this, we get 0 < |k| < frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, and given the problem conditions, 0 < k < frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. If points A and B are (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) respectively, then by Viète's formulas, we have y_1 + y_2 = frac{4k}{2k^2 + 1} and y_1 y_2 = frac{2k^2}{2k^2 + 1}. Using the condition overrightarrow{NA} = lambda overrightarrow{NB}, we get (x_1 + 2, y_1) = lambda(x_2 + 2, y_2), which leads to the system: begin{cases} x_1 + 2 = lambda (x_2 + 2) y_1 = lambda y_2. end{cases} Eliminate y_2 to obtain frac{(1 + lambda)^2}{lambda} = frac{8}{2k^2 + 1}. Define phi(lambda) = frac{(1 + lambda)^2}{lambda} for lambda in [frac{1}{5}, frac{1}{3}], with derivative phi'(lambda) = 1 - frac{1}{lambda^2} = frac{lambda^2 - 1}{lambda^2}. Since frac{1}{5} leq lambda leq frac{1}{3}, phi'(lambda) < 0, so phi(lambda) is a decreasing function on the interval [frac{1}{5}, frac{1}{3}], and hence phileft(frac{1}{3}right) leq phi(lambda) leq phileft(frac{1}{5}right), that is, frac{16}{3} leq phi(lambda) leq frac{36}{5}. Thus, frac{16}{3} leq frac{8}{2k^2 + 1} leq frac{36}{5}, giving us frac{sqrt{2}}{6} leq |k| leq frac{1}{2}, and since 0 < k < frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, it follows that frac{sqrt{2}}{6} leq k leq frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the range of the slope of line AB is [frac{sqrt{2}}{6}, frac{1}{2}], which we denote boxed{frac{sqrt{2}}{6} leq k leq frac{1}{2}}. (2) Let point P have coordinates (x_0, y_0). The equation of the tangent line at point A is y - y_0 = -frac{x_1}{2y_1}(x - x_0). Point A (x_1, y_1) lies on this tangent line, giving us the equation y_1 - y_0 = -frac{x_1}{2y_1}(x_1 - x_0) which simplifies to x_0x_1 + 2y_0y_1 = x_1^2 + 2y_1^2. Since A is on the ellipse, x_0x_1 + 2y_0y_1 = 2. Similarly, we have x_0x_2 + 2y_0y_2 = 2 for point B. Since both equations represent the same line, AB, we have x_0x + 2y_0y = 2. As line AB passes through the fixed point N(-2, 0), we have -2x_0 = 2 which implies x_0 = -1.

The perimeter is ( 2a + b = 31 ). 2. The triangle inequality must be satisfied: ( a + a > b ) implying ( b < 2a ). 3. Additionally, we need ( b > a ) because the triangle must be acute-angled (in an isosceles triangle, the base angles are acute if they are less than 90°, which happens when ( b > a )). From ( 2a + b = 31 ), and since ( b ) should be an integer, ( b ) must be odd (since ( 31 ) minus an even number ( 2a ) is odd). We also know ( b < 2a ) and ( b > a ). Let’s find the possible values of ( a ) and ( b ): - From ( 2a + b = 31 ) and ( b > a ), we start calculating from ( a = 10 ) (as lower values will not allow ( b ) to be greater than ( a ) and less than ( 2a )): - ( a = 10 ), ( b = 31 - 2 times 10 = 11 ) (satisfies ( b > a )) - ( a = 11 ), ( b = 31 - 2 times 11 = 9 ) (does not satisfy ( b > a )) - ( a = 12 ), ( b = 31 - 2 times 12 = 7 ) (does not satisfy ( b > a )) - ( a = 13 ), ( b = 31 - 2 times 13 = 5 ) (does not satisfy ( b > a )) Thus, the only solution is ( a = 10, b = 11 ) which gives the triangle with side lengths 10, 10, 11.

To find the minimum value of f(x), we look for the vertex of the parabola. The given quadratic function opens upwards, so it attains its minimum value at the vertex. The vertex of the parabola described by f(x) is at x=-frac{a}{2}, thus the minimum value of f(x), denoted as f_{text{min}}(x), is: f_{text{min}}(x) = (-frac{a}{2})^2 + a(-frac{a}{2}) = frac{a^2}{4} - frac{a^2}{2} = -frac{a^2}{4}. For f(f(x)) to have the same minimum value, y = f(f(x)) must be able to attain its minimum value. This implies that: -frac{a^2}{4} leq -frac{a^2}{2}.

The only real number for which its square is non-positive is zero, therefore we conclude that a must be equal to zero for the equality to hold. However, since we only require the minimum values to be equal and not the entire range of the function, we can relax the condition. Instead, we need to ensure that f(f(x)) is not decreasing faster than it is increasing, so the derivative at the vertex should be non-negative: f'(x) = 2x + a, and at x=-frac{a}{2}, we have: f'left(-frac{a}{2}right) = -a + a = 0.

This gives us: f(1cdot1) = f(1) + f(1) Simplifying, we find: f(1) = 2f(1) Subtracting f(1) from both sides, we obtain: 0 = f(1) Thus, we have proven that f(1) = 0, which means boxed{text{A is correct}}. **Step 2: Analyzing Statement B** The domain of f(x) is (0, +infty), which means it does not include negative numbers. Therefore, the concept of evenness (which requires f(-x) = f(x) for all x in the domain) does not apply here. Hence, boxed{text{B is incorrect}}. **Step 3: Evaluating Statement C** For x > 1, and knowing that y > 0, we consider xy > y. Given f(xy) = f(x) + f(y), we can write: f(xy) - f(y) = f(x) > 0 This implies that f(x) is increasing for x > 1. Since the function is defined on (0, +infty) and is increasing for x > 1, it cannot be decreasing on (0, 1) and then increasing again. Therefore, boxed{text{C is incorrect}}. **Step 4: Investigating Statement D** First, we find f(2) by setting x = y = 2, which gives us: f(4) = 2f(2) Knowing f(4) = 12, we find: 12 = 2f(2) Rightarrow f(2) = 6 For the inequality f(x+3)-fleft(frac{2}{x}right)<6, we use the property f(xy) = f(x) + f(y) to rewrite the left side as fleft(frac{x^2+3x}{2}right). Thus, we need: fleft(frac{x^2+3x}{2}right) < f(2) Since f(2) = 6, we have: fleft(frac{x^2+3x}{2}right) < 6 Given that f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty), this inequality implies frac{x^2+3x}{2} < 2, which simplifies to x^2 + 3x < 4. Solving this inequality gives us 0 < x < 1. Therefore, boxed{text{D is correct}}.

The circumcircles of triangles ( ABP ) and ( CDP ) intersect at points ( P ) and ( Q ). The point ( Q ) is the center of the spiral similarity that maps ( A ) to ( C ) and ( B ) to ( D ). It is also the center of the spiral similarity that maps ( A ) to ( B ) and ( C ) to ( D ). This lemma is used to establish the existence of a point ( D ) such that the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ) passes through ( D ) for all possible choices of ( B ) and ( C ). 2. **Setup**: Suppose points ( B ) and ( B' ) lie on a fixed ray ( x ) emanating from point ( A ), and points ( C ) and ( C' ) lie on another fixed ray ( y ) emanating from point ( A ). Both ( B ) and ( B' ) are on one side of ( A ) on ray ( x ), and both ( C ) and ( C' ) are on one side of ( A ) on ray ( y ). Given that ( AB + AC = AB' + AC' ), we need to show that there exists a point ( D ) such that the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ) passes through ( D ) for all choices of ( B ) and ( C ). 3. **Intersection of Circumcircles**: Consider the circumcircles of ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle AB'C' ). These circumcircles intersect at points ( P ) and ( T ). The point ( T ) is the center of the spiral similarity that maps ( B ) to ( B' ) and ( C ) to ( C' ). 4. **Spiral Similarity**: By our assumption, ( AB + AC = AB' + AC' ). This implies that the distances ( BB' ) and ( CC' ) are equal. Therefore, the dilation factor of the spiral similarity is 1, meaning that ( T ) is equidistant from ( B ) and ( B' ), and from ( C ) and ( C' ). Hence, ( TB = TC ). 5. **Cyclic Quadrilateral**: Since ( T ) is equidistant from ( B ) and ( C ), and ( ACTB ) is cyclic, it follows that ( AD ) is the angle bisector of ( angle xAy ). Thus, ( D ) is the intersection point of the angle bisector of ( angle xAy ) and the circumcircle of ( triangle ACB ). 6. **Conclusion**: The point ( D ) is fixed and lies on the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ) for all possible choices of ( B ) and ( C ) such that ( AB + AC ) is constant.

Since both trains are running at the same speed, let's denote the speed of each train as \\"v\\" meters per second. The total distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths. Therefore, the total distance is: 120 meters (length of the first train) + 120 meters (length of the second train) = 240 meters. The time taken to cross each other is given as 16 seconds. We can use the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time, to find the relative speed at which the two trains cross each other: Relative speed = Total distance / Time taken Relative speed = 240 meters / 16 seconds Relative speed = 15 meters/second Since the relative speed is the sum of the speeds of both trains and they are moving at the same speed, we have: 2v = 15 meters/second v = 15 / 2 v = 7.5 meters/second To convert the speed from meters per second to kilometers per hour, we use the conversion factor: 1 meter/second = 3.6 kilometers/hour Therefore, the speed of each train in kilometers per hour is: v (km/hr) = v (m/s) * 3.6 v (km/hr) = 7.5 * 3.6 v (km/hr) = 27 kilometers/hour So, the speed of each train is boxed{27} km/hr."},{"instruction":"Tom spends 250 to buy gems in a game he plays.

By the formula, it's clear that each power of 5 contributes significantly to the total count of trailing zeros. The calculation for the maximum m for which f(m) = 2499 involves solving the inequality: frac{m}{4} geq 2499 Rightarrow m geq 9996.

What is the probability that the sum is greater than three?","output":"To solve this problem, we first identify the total number of possible outcomes when two dice are tossed. Since each die has 6 faces, and each face can land in combination with any face of the other die, there are 6 times 6 = 36 total possible outcomes. Next, we calculate the probability of getting a sum of 3 or less. This can happen in only a few specific cases: - A sum of 2 can be obtained with the toss (1,1). - A sum of 3 can be obtained with the tosses (2,1) and (1,2). Therefore, there are 1 + 2 = 3 ways to get a sum of 2 or 3. The probability of this happening is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is frac{3}{36}. Simplifying this fraction gives us frac{1}{12}. To find the probability of getting a sum greater than 3, we subtract the probability of getting a sum of 3 or less from 1 (the total probability space). This calculation is as follows: [1 - frac{1}{12} = frac{12}{12} - frac{1}{12} = frac{11}{12}] Therefore, the probability that the sum is greater than three when two dice are tossed is boxed{frac{11}{12}}."},{"instruction":"Kevin is 16 years old and Vanessa is 2 years old.

To find the smallest value of x where Kevin's age is a multiple of Vanessa's age, we can start by looking at the smallest multiples of Vanessa's age beyond her current age: When Vanessa is 3 (x = 1), Kevin will be 17 (not a multiple of 3). When Vanessa is 4 (x = 2), Kevin will be 18 (a multiple of 4). So, the smallest value of x is 2, which makes Kevin 18 years old and Vanessa 4 years old. At that time, Kevin will be 18/4 = 4.5 times older than Vanessa. Therefore, Kevin will be boxed{4.5} times older than Vanessa when he is a multiple of her age."},{"instruction":"Given n > 2, consider 2n distinct positive integers a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{2n}, each less than or equal to n^2.

We consider ( 2n ) distinct strictly positive integers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n} ), all of which are less than or equal to ( n^2 ). 2. Without loss of generality, we assume that these integers are ordered such that: [ 1 leq a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_{2n} leq n^2 ] 3. We aim to show that among the differences ( a_i - a_j ) where ( 1 leq j < i leq 2n ), at least three are the same. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that no such three differences are the same. 4. Consider the maximum possible difference: [ a_{2n} - a_1 ] 5. We express this maximum difference as: [ a_{2n} - a_1 = left( a_{2n} - a_{2n-1} right) + left( a_{2n-1} - a_{2n-2} right) + cdots + left( a_3 - a_2 right) + left( a_2 - a_1 right) ] 6. Since every ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) are distinct and positive, ( a_{i} - a_{i-1} geq 1 ). The above sum can be approximated considering the pairs of differences: [ a_{2n} - a_1 geq 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + cdots + (n-1) + (n-1) + n ] 7. We notice that we are summing an arithmetic series where each integer from 1 to ( n ) appears twice, except for the largest integer, which we add once: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} k + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k ] 8. This can be formulated as: [ sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 2k + n = 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + (n-1) + 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + (n-1) + n ] 9. Simplify these sums using the arithmetic series formula ( sum_{k=1}^{m} k = frac{m(m+1)}{2} ): [ 2 sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k + n = 2 cdot frac{(n-1)n}{2} + n = n(n-1) + n = n^2 ] 10.

For b = log_{3} 4, since the base of the logarithm, 3, is less than 4, and we are taking the logarithm of a number greater than the base, the result is greater than 1. So we get b > 1. c. For c = log_{4} 17, since 17 is greater than the base 4, similarly, the resulting logarithm is greater than 1. Thus, c > 1. Now, we need to determine the relationship between b and c as follows: For b, we know that: b = log_{3} 4 We can compare this with log_{3} 9, since 4 < 9 and log_{3} 9 = 2, we get: b < log_{3} 9 = 2 For c, we have: c = log_{4} 17 If we compare this with log_{4} 16, since 17 > 16 and log_{4} 16 = 2, we find that: c > log_{4} 16 = 2 Because both b and c are greater than 1, and we have established that b < 2 and c > 2, it is now clear that c > b.
