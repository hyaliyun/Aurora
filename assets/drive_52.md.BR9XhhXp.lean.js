Well, Greg Mortenson wanted to climb a mountain, but he ended up helping thousands of people to have a better life. Greg's story began with failure. In 1993, he set out to climb K2, the world's second highest mountain. But Greg never made it to the top. After five days, he stumbled  into the village of Korphe in northern Pakistan, injured and hungry. The kind villagers there looked after him for several days. Greg saw that the villagers were very poor and hungry, and some of them were ill. Also, the village school didn't have a roof  and the children wrote on the ground with sticks, Greg knew he wanted to do something to help. \\"I'll build you a school,\\" he told the villagers. \\"I promise.\\" Greg went back home to the USA to raise money for the school. He even lived in the car to save money! Finally he went back to Korphe and built the school. But _ was just the beginning of something bigger! Since then, Greg's organization has built around 80 schools and runs many others in Pakistan and other countries, too. Greg hasn't finished yet. He does many other things to help people in poor countries. He has got many prizes, but it's the smiles of the children he has helped that makes him happy! Greg has just written a best-selling book about his story called Three Cups of Tea. It's an interesting and exciting book which tells us what ordinary people can do with courage and determination . The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Three Cups of Tea.\\" Which of the following statements about Greg Mortenson is correct? a) Greg Mortenson successfully climbed K2, the world's second highest mountain. b) Greg Mortenson's organization has built only one school in Pakistan. c) Greg Mortenson embarked on his journey to help people after an experience in the village of Korphe in northern Pakistan. d) Greg Mortenson wrote a best-selling book titled \\"Two Cups of Tea.\\" Answer: c) Greg Mortenson embarked on his journey to help people after an experience in the village of Korphe in northern Pakistan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who dispatched a force with Odo in tow? from the following article ?  It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were...

Information:  - A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.  - X-radiation (composed of X-rays) is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×10 Hz to 3×10 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning Röntgen radiation, after the German (German-Dutch to be precise) scientist Wilhelm Röntgen, who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who had named it \\"X-radiation\\" to signify an unknown type of radiation. Spelling of \\"X-ray(s)\\" in the English language includes the variants \\"x-ray(s)\\", \\"xray(s)\\", and \\"X ray(s)\\".  - A brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is defined as the brightest galaxy in a cluster of galaxies. BCGs include the most massive galaxies in the universe. They are generally elliptical galaxies which lie close to the geometric and kinematical center of their host galaxy cluster, hence at the bottom of the cluster potential well. They are also generally coincident with the peak of the cluster X-ray emission.  - A light-year is a unit of length used to express astronomical distances. It is about 9 trillion kilometres or 6 trillion miles. As defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a light-year is the distance that light travels in vacuum in one Julian year (365.25 days). Because it includes the word \\"year\\", the term light-year is sometimes misinterpreted as a unit of time.  - A potential well is the region surrounding a local minimum of potential energy. Energy captured in a potential well is unable to convert to another type of energy (kinetic energy in the case of a gravitational potential well) because it is captured in the local minimum of a potential well. Therefore, a body may not proceed to the global minimum of potential energy, as it would naturally tend to due to entropy.  - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown.  - IC 1101 is a supergiant elliptical galaxy at the center of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster, approximately 320 megaparsecs (1.04 billion light-years) from Earth.  - A galaxy cluster, or cluster of galaxies, is a structure that consists of anywhere from hundreds to thousands of galaxies that are bound together by gravity with typical masses ranging from 1010 solar masses. They are the largest known gravitationally bound structures in the universe and were believed to be the largest known structures in the universe until the 1980s, when superclusters were discovered. One of the key features of clusters is the intracluster medium (ICM). The ICM consists of heated gas between the galaxies and has a peak temperature between 215 keV that is dependent on the total mass of the cluster. Galaxy clusters should not be confused with star clusters, such as open clusters, which are structures of stars \\"within\\" galaxies, or with globular clusters, which typically orbit galaxies. Small aggregates of galaxies are referred to as groups of galaxies rather than clusters of galaxies. The groups and clusters can themselves cluster together to form superclusters.  - An elliptical galaxy is a type of galaxy having an approximately ellipsoidal shape and a smooth, nearly featureless brightness profile. Unlike flat spiral galaxies with organization and structure, they are more three-dimensional, without much structure, and their stars are in somewhat random orbits around the center. They are one of the three main classes of galaxy originally described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work \\"The Realm of the Nebulae\\", along with spiral and lenticular galaxies. Elliptical galaxies range in shape from nearly spherical to highly flat and in size from tens of millions to over one hundred trillion stars. Originally Edwin Hubble hypothesized that elliptical galaxies evolved into spiral galaxies, which was later discovered to be false. Stars found inside of elliptical galaxies are much older than stars found in spiral galaxies.  - Abell 2029 or A2029 is a large cluster of galaxies 315 megaparsecs ( 1,027 million light - years ) away in the constellation Virgo . A2029 is a Bautz - Morgan classification type I cluster due to its large central galaxy , IC 1101 .

Answer the following question: who has the best nba record in history?","output":"The National Basketball Association (NBA) has seen many record-breaking performances over the decades, however, when it comes to the best regular-season record, the honor belongs to the 2015-2016 Golden State Warriors. The Golden State Warriors had a record-breaking 2015-2016 season, finishing their regular season with an unprecedented 73-9 win-loss record. This surpassed the previous record set by the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls, who had finished their regular season with 72-10, a record that had stood for 20 years.  The Warriors, led by their point guard Stephen Curry, had been the dominant force throughout the season. Curry himself also had an extraordinary season, becoming the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) that year. Supporting Curry were other key players like Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala, creating what came to be known as the \\"Splash Brothers\\" era. Their efficient ball movement, 3-point shooting accuracy, and strong defense were pivotal factors in achieving this historic record. It is essential to note, however, that this record is strictly about regular season and doesn't account for playoffs performance. Despite setting the regular season record, the Golden State Warriors did not win the NBA Championship that year. They advanced to the NBA Finals but lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games, denying them what could have been the perfect end to their historic season. In contrast, the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls, led by the legendary Michael Jordan, not only had a near-perfect regular season record, but they also won the NBA Championship, giving them what many consider to be the best overall single-season performance in NBA history. Turning our attention to playoff records, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics both share the record for the most NBA Championship titles, each having won the prestigious Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy 17 times (as of 2021). In conclusion, while the Golden State Warriors hold the best regular-season record in NBA history, the debate about the best overall team performance in a season, considering both regular and post-season records, potentially brings other teams into the consideration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It'd been my last film in a long, long day halfway through the festival. Maybe I'd dozed. The better a film is the more likely it triggers daydreams that send me really dreaming. Don't know. Did know there was an O'Henry twist achingly just beyond my ken as things finished. And knew it had to do with the heart, hence the quietly hilarious talent search. My plot-loss remark had more to do with intricacies of Trebor's connections in France, his relation to the dog woman and so on, stuff I'd been wide awake for. Denis barely glances at details that might have anchored another director's treatment. But I write these things too often from memory, especially festival films, films whose DVD I don't have at hand (Le Lait de la tendresse humaine is one of many examples.), and plot kinks fade much more quickly than broader impressions. Still, or already, L'Inrus in my memory is beyond all else a character study of a sort of dark-side superman, a super fiend not ensconced in genre or historical trappings but active and plausible, relatively soft-spoken, driven but patient, right among us. The scar, once he attains it, makes him, just visually I mean, in image, a sort of hybrid Frankenstein monster, mad doctor and creation all in one. The actual doctors are his tools. If he doesn't extract and install the heart himself, it's only because it's not possible. He's the force, always, the parasite consuming everyone he touches and finally himself. What else is he? To suggest that he's us, the First World versus the Third, seems too simple since he feeds no less on his fellow First Worlders, on all of us. Denis's camera's eye - when it looks at things I know - goes usually where mine would, so I tend to trust her when she looks at things I don't know. Snow trekking, too-fast bicycling, and forest darkness I've known in small ways, but the South Seas not at all, so I made better entry into L'Intrus, both France and the crystalline isles of its finish, than into Beau Travail. L'Intrus is, for me, a very comfortable discomforting film. It's a sequence of places portrayed familiarly, with a intimacy that allows us to know them whether we've seen the reality or not. A single image, Trebor cycling, his massive weight on the thin racing frame, the sounds of violated air and shrieking tires, the asphalt ribbon, the dark-in-bright-sun evergreens, cued me that the film would be linear, a road trip, a single will-driven thrust. Despite Trebor's personal power, he's a human failure. No matter who he's with, he's alone, though apparently he hasn't always been. His body aborts life twice, first to need the new heart, then despite it. L'Intrus is tragedy. Trebor is hubris. I'm navigating perilously the thread of what I remember. Let's leave it at that.

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

The pig should be centered and suspended roughly 1-2 feet (.30-.60m) above the coals. Any closer and the heat may cause the skin to scorch. Make sure the spit doesn’t slide or move around after it’s been mounted. Make sure you have help getting the pig positioned over the coals. They can be heavy! Let the pig cook at a moderate distance from the coals. One helpful guideline to keep in mind is that the pig should cook one hour for every ten pounds of its weight; for a pig of average size, 75-100 pounds (34-45kg), this means 4-6 hours on each side. Sit back and enjoy a cold beverage in the meantime! At the halfway point, turn the pig over to begin cooking the opposite side. Remember to keep the pit hot by adding more wood provisionally, and rake and reposition the coals if any one part of the pig is cooking faster than another.  ”Slow and low” is what experts recommend when roasting a whole pig. It’s time consuming and demands constant attention, but makes a great centerpiece for a day of cooking and socializing. Brush on a coating of barbecue sauce, or use a turkey baster to drench the pig in a savory marinade as it cooks. This will ratchet up the flavor and keep the skin crisp and juicy. When the pig is nearing completion, its skin will begin to brown and bubble, but there’s no way to tell if the meat inside is done except to temp it. Use a professional-grade meat thermometer to take an internal temperature reading in different areas of the pig. The soft belly and bacon sections (the fatty tissue on the backside) are best served at around 145°F (63°C), while tougher, more sinewy parts like the shoulder and haunches will need to be at least 160-165°F (74°C) before they’re safe to eat.  You will need to take a temperature reading several times throughout the cooking process. Do not serve the pig if any part of the meat is below 145°F (63°C). If an area is particularly slow getting done, reposition the coals underneath that area to increase the heat. After 10-12 hours the pig is now a crispy brown and the internal temperature is right—it’s time to eat! Take the pig off the coals, remove the spit and tell everybody to dig in. You can either carve the roast up into sections, dice it all together like pulled-pork barbecue or have everyone tear off their favorite sections by hand. When cooked right, the meat should be tender enough to pull apart. Slather the roast pork in your favorite sauce, serve it with a few sumptuous sides and enjoy!  The meat should be juicy when fully cooked, but not bloody or red. If it isn’t quite done enough when you cut into it, it may need a few more minutes. Pair a roasted pig with other backyard cookout favorites like grilled veggies and baked beans, or go for the more island-inspired flavors of wild rice, fried plantains and pineapple.

What is a good title for this?","output":"\\"Falling Populations: An Unforeseen Boon for the Environment Amid Economic Concerns\\" This title captures the implication that declining populations could have beneficial impacts on the environment despite the commonly cited economic disadvantages. It sparks curiosity by presenting a potential positive aspect (the environment benefiting) to a typically negative issue (decreasing populations). To start, it's important to note the symbiotic relationship between population growth and economic development. Typically, an increase in population correlates to a surge in economic growth due to the increase in consumer demand, which in turn promotes industrialization and job creation. This principle is one reason why governments, economists, and policymakers are often concerned about population decline, as it's perceived as a threat to sustained economic prosperity. However, population decline isn't necessarily all doom and gloom. From an environmental perspective, fewer people could mean less strain on our planet's natural resources, reduced carbon footprint, and diminished pressure on ecosystems. Consider each person as a consumer tool that requires certain goods and services: food, clothing, transportation, housing, energy, and so forth. Each of these demands contributes to environmental degradation in some way, be it through deforestation, carbon emissions, plastic pollution, or erosion. Let's start with carbon emissions. According to the United Nations, the world's population has grown from 1.65 billion to 7.7 billion in the last century. As a result, so, too, has our collective carbon footprint due to increased industrial activities, vehicular use, deforestation, livestock farming, etc. A smaller population could translate into lower overall emissions, assuming the per capita emissions rate remains the same. Deforestation is another critical issue linked with population growth. As more people need more space to live and grow food, forests are often cleared to make way for urban development and agriculture. These forests not only serve as homes to millions of species but also act as natural carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. Fewer people could mean less demand for such space, helping to preserve these vital ecosystems. Similarly, fewer people could decrease the demand for energy, lessening the pressure on non-renewable resources like coal, oil, and natural gas, and reducing pollution from their extraction and use.  In summary, while the economic implications of falling populations are a valid concern, this change could inadvertently stimulate environmental recovery by reducing consumption, curbing deforestation, mitigating carbon emissions, and alleviating the strain on our planet's natural assets. These issues are complex and interwoven, demanding a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to balance economic development with environmental conservation. Hence, the conversation shouldn't stop at population growth versus decline but instead embrace efficient resource usage, renewable energy, sustainable production and consumption practices, and climate-conscious policies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - redemption - isolation - absolution - great relief - feel better  I believe the correct choice is \\"redemption\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"When you choose to have a forgiving attitude toward someone, they receive multiple benefits, some of which may include redemption, absolution, great relief, and feeling better. Let's explore each of these aspects in detail: 1. Redemption: Forgiving someone helps them experience a sense of redemption, which involves the process of making amends, repairing relationships, and restoring trust. This can lead to personal growth and better understanding of mistakes made by the person, empowering them to overcome those flaws and establish healthier connections with others. 2. Absolution: Absolution refers to the act of setting someone free from guilt, blame, or sin. By forgiving the person, you are effectively releasing them from the burden of guilt associated with their actions. This allows them to move forward in life without constantly being weighed down by feelings of remorse or self-condemnation. 3. Great Relief: Forgiving someone results in great relief not only for the person receiving forgiveness but also for the one forgiving. For the person being forgiven, it can bring a sense of peace and tranquility, removing the anxiety and unease that were previously present due to unresolved conflicts or unaddressed misdeeds. On the other hand, it also brings relief to the one who forgives, as they no longer need to bear grudges or hold on to negative emotions, allowing them to focus on more positive aspects of their life. 4. Feeling Better: Forgiveness can genuinely make people feel better – both emotionally and physically. Studies have shown that individuals who forgive tend to experience lower levels of stress, depression, and anger, leading to improved mental health and overall well-being. Moreover, it can also have positive effects on physical health, as chronic stress and unresolved conflicts may contribute to the development of various health issues, including heart conditions and weakened immune systems. It is important to note that forgiveness is not solely about the person who has committed a wrongdoing; it is also about the one granting forgiveness. When you hold on to grudges and resentments, it takes a toll on your emotional well-being and may even affect your physical health. Therefore, adopting a forgiving attitude is beneficial for both parties involved, creating an atmosphere of understanding, empathy, and healing.  In conclusion, while redemption is indeed an essential aspect of forgiveness, it is crucial to acknowledge that several other factors play a role in creating a complete picture of the benefits received by someone when you adopt a forgiving attitude. These benefits include redemption, absolution, great relief, and overall emotional well-being. In the end, the act of forgiveness fosters healthier relationships and emotional growth that can lead to personal transformation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Just like the heart-shaped copper wire, this homopolar motor uses a simple AA battery sitting atop a neodymium magnet in a vertical position with its positive pole oriented above the negative pole.  Loop some copper wire around the magnet.  You need not make the whole loop touch the base; an ovular loop which touches the battery at just two points is as acceptable as a circular loop which grips the whole magnet. Once the loop around the base is complete, bend the wire up and away from the loop around the magnet.  The corkscrew’s diameter should be just a few millimeters wider than that of the battery.  Stop the corkscrew about halfway up the length of the battery. At a point about three millimeters above the highest point on the battery, press the wire inwards at a ninety degree angle toward the center of the positive pole.  Once the wire is over the positive pole’s central divot, bend it down so that it touches the divot, then races back up and away from the divot in a hairpin turn. Instead of a heart shape, bend the copper wire into the shape of a ballerina, arms outstretched.  Begin by turning the wire, now pointing straight up, in a ninety degree bend about one and a half inches above the positive pole of the battery.  Approximately one centimeter along this length, pull the wire into a hairpin turn, angling it back toward the ninety degree turn you just made. This will be the dancer’s head.  Once on the other side of the dancer’s “neck,” bring the wire back down on the other side of the dancer, mirroring the bends you just made.  You should end up with a “T” shape with a circle above the central junction.  You cannot end where you began, though (touching the central divot on the positive pole of the battery), and so will need to clip the wire at a point about half a centimeter above the positive pole of the battery. It may help to use a template or outline you’ve drawn or printed from the internet when shaping the wire into the ballerina form.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774  7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".  - Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel (December 8, 1815February 9, 1905) was a German Realist artist noted for drawings, etchings, and paintings. Along with Caspar David Friedrich, he is considered one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century, and was the most successful artist of his era in Germany. First known as Adolph Menzel, he was knighted in 1898 and changed his name to Adolph von Menzel.  - Studio Wall ( 1872 ) is an oil painting by the German artist Adolph Menzel , now in the collection of the Hamburger Kunsthalle . It is considered one of the \`\` masterpieces of Menzel 's maturity '' , and the artist deemed it his best painting . The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist 's studio at night , upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below .

Context: Moving can either be out of necessity or an act of desire. Whatever the case, moving rarely comes at a convenient time and involves so many variables that it is difficult to exhale until all of the documents are signed. Even then, that point in the process instantaneously starts a whole new chapter in the book of moving. No matter how long it takes to sell (or not sell) your previous home, whether you’re able to find your dream kitchen or settle for less, if you’re moving down the street, across the country, or around the world, the act of moving can be completely overwhelming. Long story short: Moving is a process. In the midst of all the uncertainties, there are a few ways to stay organized while moving. This short list is meant to guide you through steps to keep you on track during a stressful time. The largest piece of advice I can give you is to start by decluttering your current living space. Having less to deal with will help you feel more in control of the situation. Finding a realtor that you trust and feel comfortable working with will put your mind at ease (most of the time) about the process of listing your house and finding a buyer. Let your realtor do the work for you so you can concentrate on keeping your home “show ready” and begin to look at options on the other side of the move, like where you’ll be working, spending your time, and researching schools or neighborhoods. Make a list of people you’ll need to update contact information with once you leave. This should include any and all businesses you frequent or subscribe to, like pest control services, lawn maintenance, even all of your neighborhood loyal buyer programs you participate in. Do not overlook your banks, investment companies, retirement funds, healthcare providers for you and your family members, and even you pets. And, of course, family and friends.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that wrote I know that my Redeemer liveth?  The opening soprano solo in E major, \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\"  The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\". Young writes that the \\"Amen\\"  should, in the manner of Palestrina, \\"be delivered as though through the aisles and...

Article: Across continental Europe, but in France especially, booksellers and publishers had to negotiate censorship laws of varying strictness. The Encyclopédie, for example, narrowly escaped seizure and had to be saved by Malesherbes, the man in charge of the French censure. Indeed, many publishing companies were conveniently located outside France so as to avoid overzealous French censors. They would smuggle their merchandise across the border, where it would then be transported to clandestine booksellers or small-time peddlers. The records of clandestine booksellers may give a better representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read, since their clandestine nature provided a less restrictive product choice. In one case, political books were the most popular category, primarily libels and pamphlets. Readers were more interested in sensationalist stories about criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself. The second most popular category, \\"general works\\" (those books \\"that did not have a dominant motif and that contained something to offend almost everyone in authority\\") demonstrated a high demand for generally low-brow subversive literature.

Please answer the following question: Background: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village displayed an observable Allee effect? Answer:","output":"Village B displayed an observable Allee effect. The declining and small population size, combined with the geographic isolation, would lead to a reduced gene pool and increased chances of genetic drift, inbreeding depression, and the accumulation of deleterious mutations. These factors can contribute to a reduction in the overall fitness of the species inhabiting Village B, demonstrating an Allee effect in the population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground.

Wants to keep working until 70 or 75 like Sir Alex Ferguson.","output":"Title: Jose Mourinho's Journey to a 'Normal' Life: From Taunting to Longevity and Returning to England Introduction The world of football has seen its fair share of ups and downs, but Jose Mourinho, a renowned Portuguese coach, has managed to stay relevant and successful throughout his career. Despite facing challenges on and off the pitch, Mourinho has plans to lead a more \\"normal\\" life and is inspired by Sir Alex Ferguson to keep working till the age of 70 or 75. With his return to England at the end of his spell in Madrid, we take a closer look at the highlights of Mourinho's journey and what the future holds for the esteemed football coach. Jose Mourinho's Son Taunted While Playing Football Like any other dedicated father, Jose Mourinho is protective of his son, who also shares a passion for football. Unfortunately, there have been incidents where Mourinho's son has faced taunts and ridicule while playing the sport that he enjoys. Life in the public eye can be difficult, and Mourinho is fully aware of the challenges his family has faced due to his career. But his love for football and his determination to keep pushing forward is a testament to his resilience and commitment to the game. Portuguese Coach Wants to Live a 'Normal' Life As his career progresses and Mourinho contemplates the path ahead, he is increasingly drawn to the idea of living a more \\"normal\\" life. In recent interviews, the coach has expressed his desire to step back from the limelight and enjoy the simpler aspects of life with his family. After years of being in the public eye and the constant scrutiny that accompanies fame, it's perfectly understandable that Mourinho would want to find a balance between his professional and personal life. Return to England at the End of His Spell in Madrid Throughout his career, Jose Mourinho has taken on various challenges and has managed to leave a lasting impact wherever he goes. From Porto to Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, and eventually Manchester United, Mourinho has demonstrated his skill and adaptability as a football coach. With his current spell in Madrid coming to an end, Mourinho is making plans to return to England – the country where he has achieved significant success and also faced certain disappointments. Fans and football experts alike will be eager to see what Mourinho does next upon his return to England. Inspired to Work Until 70 or 75 Like Sir Alex Ferguson One of the most significant influences in Mourinho's life is the legendary former Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson. Not only does Mourinho admire and respect Sir Alex for his career successes, but he is also incredibly inspired by the longevity of the legendary manager's career. Currently in his 50s, Mourinho has already set lofty goals for himself, stating that he wishes to work until the age of 70 or 75 – just like Sir Alex Ferguson. Conclusion Jose Mourinho's journey so far has been nothing short of remarkable. As he plans to continue making an impact on the world of football for years to come, it's clear that the Portuguese coach has ambitions beyond the pitch. From overcoming personal challenges to drawing inspiration from the greats, Mourinho's unique combination of resilience, passion, and determination has set him on a path to achieve greatness in his own right. Now, with an eye on a more \\"normal\\" life and a return to England on the horizon, fans eagerly await the next chapter in the illustrious career of this iconic football coach."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"As music grew more expressive, the standard orchestral palette just wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers.\\"\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers?\\" Pick from: + yes + no","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"As music grew more expressive, the standard orchestral palette just wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"What wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers?\\"  The sentence explicitly states that the standard orchestral palette was not rich enough for many composers in the Romantic era. This period is known for valuing subjective emotion and individuality, translating into musical works with more personal expression and experimentation in sound and tonality. As a result, the need for more diverse instrumentation and expanded tonal color became increasingly evident. These Romantic composers sought to create a more diverse and expressive sound by pushing the boundaries of the standard orchestral palette, which predominantly consisted of strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion. In an effort to evoke intense emotions, breathtaking scenes, and powerful narratives within their compositions, many composers began to add novel instruments to their orchestrations or explore innovative techniques for established instrumentation. For example, the music of Richard Wagner required larger orchestras, featuring new instruments like the bass clarinet and Wagner tuba. Similarly, Hector Berlioz's seminal work, Symphonie Fantastique, showcased the extended capabilities of standard orchestral instruments by incorporating colorful effects like col legno (striking strings with the wooden part of the bow), and featuring the obscure Ophicleide as a bass instrument. While some composers chose to create new instruments or fully reinvent the role of existing instruments in their orchestrations, others approached the challenge by innovating the way they composed for standard orchestral instruments, employing advanced techniques to produce a richer texture or timbre, such as extended string techniques, multiphonics in the woodwinds, or dramatic brass swells. In conclusion, the sentence provides a succinct and direct answer to the question. As music during the Romantic period underscored the need for greater emotional depth and expressive qualities, traditional orchestral instrumentation proved insufficient for many composers, leading to a surge in experimentation and expansion of the orchestral palette to accommodate the new era's innovative demands."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Title: Decent Email Client with Room for Improvement Review: I recently downloaded and started using the email client app 'com.fsck.k9' on my Android device, and I feel that it deserves a 3-star rating. While this app offers a few commendable features that make it a decent option for managing my emails, it certainly has some shortcomings that I believe the developers should address to improve the overall user experience. Pros: 1. Open-source: One clear advantage that 'com.fsck.k9' has is its open-source nature. This provides me with a degree of transparency and contributes to my trust in the app, knowing that its code is accessible for inspection, modification, and even redistribution. 2. Support for multiple accounts: The app easily handles multiple email accounts, allowing me to manage both my personal and work emails from within the same interface. The set-up process for adding accounts was simple and stress-free. 3. Customizable interface: It offers a considerable degree of customization options, such as changing the theme, account colors, and notification settings. This allows me to tailor the app to my preferences and achieve a more pleasant experience. Cons: 1. Outdated user interface: Visually, 'com.fsck.k9' has an outdated aesthetic compared to other email apps on the market, with an interface that lacks a modern touch. This includes an unpolished design for buttons, menus, and icons, as well as the overall layout. With the visual experience being essential for user engagement, I would appreciate seeing a more seamless and contemporary layout. 2. Limited search functionality: When it comes to searching for specific emails, I find the app's search functionality quite limited. The basic search option often does not yield accurate results, and the app could certainly benefit from an advanced search mechanism, with filters to narrow down results by date, sender, keywords, or folders. 3. Occasional slow performance: There have been a few instances where I experienced some lagging and slow response times within the app, particularly when scrolling through emails or switching between accounts. This tends to disrupt the smooth flow of managing my daily emails and can be quite frustrating. Conclusion: Overall, the 'com.fsck.k9' email client is a decent app that fulfills its basic purpose of managing multiple email accounts. Its open-source nature, customization options, and easy set-up for multiple accounts are commendable features. However, its outdated user interface, limited search functionality, and occasional slow performance prevent it from being a top contender in the list of email clients available. I believe that addressing these issues and implementing further refinements could certainly elevate the app's rating and enhance the experience for its users."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to give the bigclock a good name, people held a meeting. Someone wanted to call it the Queen of Bells, and someone thought Victoria was good. At last, a man named Benjamin Hall stood up. He was a big man. Before he started to speak, someone shouted, \\"Why not call it Big Ben? \\"Everybody laughed and agreed with him. From then on, Big Ben became its name.

Paracord is like a strong and colorful rope that can be easily wrapped around the knife handle. It makes the handle comfortable, nice to hold, and also looks cool. The other option, bailing twine, is not the best choice because it's not as comfortable as paracord. Bailing twine is a thin and scratchy string, more often used for tying things together like packages or hay bales, and it's not very comfortable for gripping.

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  I am facing a new situation today: Two rivers, The Minninnippi and The Cedar, flow into the same ocean. The Minninnippi is surrounded almost entirely by farm lands due its location in a flat area of the country that sees regular rainfall.

Article: In many romantic movies or TV shows one scene always appears. It involves a handsome man standing outside a young woman's window, singing a love song to her to win her over. However, trying to woo a female with songs is not just something that humans do. A few animals sing love songs as well. Birds and elephants are romantic but the latest animal to  _ a female might surprise you--it is the humble mouse.     You may find it odd to find out that mice sing. We do not hear them because the frequency of their voice is so high. In fact, scientists have known for some time that male mice make special sounds to females, but it has always been assumed that the sounds are produced instinctively   and randomly, with little thought going into the process. But new research suggests otherwise. When male mice with different voices were put in a cage together, scientists found that they would gradually change their pitches   to sound like one another. But when a female mouse was put in the cage with two males, one male would change his pitch to match the other. \\"It was usually the smaller animal changing the pitch to match the larger animal,\\" professor Erich Jarvis, leader of the study, from Duke University, US, told BBC News. This ability, known as vocal learning, is rare in the natural world. It had been thought to be limited to some birds, such as parrots--as well as whales and dolphins. The latest findings challenge the long-held opinion that mice cannot learn to adapt their voices.     Scientists also found the part of the brain that controls the mice's singing ability. In the experiment, they damaged the cells in this part of the mice's brain and found that the animals couldn't keep their songs in pitch or repeat them any more. This also happened when the mice became deaf. Jarvis said that this finding had changed his understanding of the way mice make sound. \\"In mice we find that the pathways that are at least modulating   these vocalizations   are in the forebrain, in places where you actually find them in humans,\\"...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please answer a question about the following article about Race (human categorization): Over a dozen racial categories would be recognized in conformity with all the possible combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and not one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That is, race referred preferentially to appearance, not heredity, and appearance is a poor indication of ancestry, because only a few genes are responsible for someone's skin color and traits: a person who is considered white may have more African ancestry than a person who is considered black, and the reverse can be also true about European ancestry. The complexity of racial classifications in Brazil reflects the extent of miscegenation in Brazilian society, a society that remains highly, but not strictly, stratified along color lines. These socioeconomic factors are also significant to the limits of racial lines, because a minority of pardos, or brown people, are likely to start declaring themselves white or black if socially upward, and being seen as relatively \\"whiter\\" as their perceived social status increases (much as in other regions of Latin America). What way would categories grade into each other, rather than being isolated from each other?","output":"Imagine you have a big box of crayons with lots of colors. You want to sort them by their color, but you notice that some colors look very similar to each other, like light blue and dark blue.

This is what the article means when it says that racial categories \\"grade into each other\\" instead of being completely separate.

Article: Fast and accurate throwing is essential for every softball player, but the exact motions of a good throw may seem foreign to someone just starting to learn the game. Good throwers throw with a lot of backspin, which helps the ball fly farther, use their whole body instead of just their arm to get power, and align their legs and shoulders with the target for accuracy.  Make sure you throw with your dominant hand. This is whatever hand feels the most comfortable. Always practice with a glove in your opposite hand -- this is how you will have to throw in a game. Turn the ball so that the laces form a \\"C,\\" then place your four fingers along the top lace. Your thumb should comfortably rest on another lace along the side of the softball. The laces provide a surface to grip onto, and you will \\"pull\\" on the laces as you throw to give the ball backspin (the top of the ball spins back towards the bottom), which helps the throw's speed and stability. Your back foot is the foot on the same side as your throwing arm. You want the instep, or inside, of your foot to face your target so that your toes point diagonally to the right (right-handed throwers) or left (left-handed throwers) of your target. To be precise, point your toes roughly 45 degrees away from the spot you throw towards. You should be able to draw a straight line from your back instep through your front foot and to your target. In other words, you will be perpendicular to your target. You should point your front toes however you feel comfortable. Usually this is sideways. This insures accuracy, but it also opens up your shoulders to allow a more natural throwing motion. As you get more experienced, you may begin pointing your glove elbow, not the glove, towards your target. This makes your throwing motion more compact and efficient. Your arm should form an \\"L\\" shape with the ball held high. Dropping the elbow is the most common mistake many young softball players make when throwing, so pay close attention to your arm position. With your arm high in the air behind you, point your palm and the ball up and behind you. This will allow you to snap your wrist with more power later in the throw. This is your throwing motion, and you will feel your arm extending as you \\"whip\\" past your head. Remember to keep your elbow near shoulder-height as you begin your throw. The ball will be at the highest point of your arm. Try to keep your elbow loose and relaxed -- don't try to keep the \\"L\\" shape as you throw. As the ball passes you head, throw the ball by simultaneously letting go of the ball and \\"pulling\\" the laces of the ball down to create backspin. You can test your backspin by placing black electrical tape perpendicular to the laces of the ball. If you release the ball properly, you should see a solid black \\"line\\" of the tape as the ball spins. Though not necessary when you are first learning, practice pulling your glove back towards your chest as you begin your throw -- it gives you more room for a powerful follow-through. Bend your arm towards your chest at the elbow, then pull your elbow back towards your ribs. Once the ball is released, let your arm keep swinging down and across your body, ending with your hand near your opposite thigh. Your fingers and wrist should be down from spinning the ball. As you throw, you will feel your body weight shifting to your front foot. Don't resist it, and feel free to pick you your back foot to keep your balance as you lean forward after the throw. If you decide to try everything at once, every time, you are bound to pick up bad habits. Instead, break the throw down into smaller parts and practice these before bringing it all together:   Grip: Toss the ball up and catch it in your glove. As soon as you catch it, grab the ball and turn it in your hands to quickly place all four fingers on the laces. Repeat.  Feet: Pick 3-4 different targets in the distance. Toss the ball up to yourself. As soon as you catch it, grab the ball, turn, and set you feet up towards one of the targets, cocking your arm back like you are about to throw. Stop here and note your foot position -- are you in a straight line towards your chosen target?  Wrist Flick: Hold your arm in front of your body with the ball high and your elbow at shoulder height. Practice throwing the ball with just your upper arm, snapping down from the elbow and pulling back the laces with your fingers and wrist. Your goal is to practice good, consistent backspin. You should work on throwing with a good, fluid arc. Your final throwing motion should be consistent, smooth, and comfortable.  Grip the ball along the laces. As you bring the ball out of your glove, align your feet with the target. Cock you arm backwards at a 90 degree angle while pointing your glove at the target. Rapidly swing the ball past your head and release. Snap your fingers and wrist down and towards your target. Follow through by bringing your weight and arm forward and down. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is: To throw accurately and effectively in softball, use your dominant hand and grip the ball with the laces forming a \\"C.\\" Position your feet and align your body with the target. Keep your arm in an \\"L\\" shape, maintain proper elbow height, and incorporate a wrist snap to generate backspin.

A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name \\"Civilian\\" (or \\"The Civilian Project\\").

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Steven Delano Smith (born March 31, 1969) is an American retired basketball player who is currently a basketball analyst for Turner Sports. After a collegiate career with Michigan State, he played with several teams in his 14-season National Basketball Association career, including the Miami Heat, the Portland Trail Blazers and the San Antonio Spurs, but is perhaps best known for his five-year stint with the Atlanta Hawks which included an All-Star Game appearance in 1998. He won a championship with the Spurs in 2003. Smith was widely regarded as an excellent three-point shooter, and is one of three players to make seven 3 pointers in a quarter. Smith started in 59 of 78 games for Atlanta and averaged 16 points during the regular season and 19 points in the playoffs, as the Hawks lost in a first round sweep to the Indiana Pacers. He would go on to average a then career high 18.1 points a game in 80 starts in the 1995-96 season, forming a formidable backcourt one-two punch with Mookie Blaylock. The team under head coach Lenny Wilkens would win 46 games and defeat Indiana in the first round in 5 games before falling to the Orlando Magic in the conference semifinals in 6 games. Smith averaged 21.7 points in 10 playoff games, including a 35-point performance in a game 4 win against the Magic.  The following season would feature another career high scoring average (20.1) for Smith, as he continued to serve as the Hawks' main option on offense. The team also featured players such as Christian Laettner and Dikembe Mutombo, and would go on to win 56 games before meeting and defeating the Detroit Pistons in a 5-game first round series. Smith played well against Detroit and held his own against Michael Jordan and the defending champion Chicago Bulls, who defeated the Hawks in 5 games in the semifinals. The following season would be similar to Smith as he once again averaged 20.1 points a game, but this time managed to be named an NBA All-Star as he scored 14 points in 16 minutes of action in the 1998 NBA All-Star Game. The Hawks would disappoint in the playoffs yet again however, this time losing to the Charlotte Hornets 3 games to 1 in the conference semifinals despite a 24.8 ppg scoring average by Smith for the series.  The 1998-99 season would be limited to 50 games as a result of a league wide lockout, and in 36 games Smith averaged 18.7 points a game and led the Hawks to another 5 game first round victory over Detroit. The Hawks had no answer, however, for the New York Knicks, and again the Hawks were eliminated in the semifinals. Smith averaged 17.3 points a game in the 1999 playoffs. In the offseason, the Hawks traded Smith in a 4 player trade to the Portland Trail Blazers which included Isaiah Rider, who had served as Portland's starting shooting guard and who Smith would now replace. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What else can you tell me about his time in Atlanta?","output":"When Steven Smith was in Atlanta, he played for the basketball team called the Atlanta Hawks.

Question: Given the following context:  Though it reached No. 130 on the Billboard chart, Freak Out! was neither a major commercial nor critical success when it was first released in the United States. Many listeners were convinced that the album was drug-inspired, and interpreted the album's title as slang for a bad LSD trip. The album made the Mothers of Invention immediate underground darlings with a strong counter-cultural following. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa quotes a negative review of the album by Pete Johnson of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote: I guess you might call it surrealistic paintings set to music. Not content to record just two sides of musical gibberish, the MOI devote four full sides to their type of \\"artistry\\". If anyone owns this album, perhaps he can tell me what in hell is going on ... The Mothers of Invention, a talented but warped quintet, have fathered an album poetically entitled Freak Out, which could be the greatest stimulus to the aspirin industry since the income tax. The album developed a major cult following in the United States by the time MGM/Verve had been merged into a division of PolyGram in 1972.  At that time many MGM/Verve releases including Freak Out! were prematurely deleted in an attempt to keep the struggling company financially solvent. Zappa had already moved on to his own companies Bizarre Records and Straight Records which were distributed by Warner Bros. Records. Freak Out! was initially more successful in Europe and quickly influenced many English rock musicians. According to David Fricke, the album was a major influence on the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Paul McCartney regarded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as The Beatles' Freak Out! Zappa criticized the Beatles, as he felt they were \\"only in it for the money\\".Freak Out! was honored with the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999, ranked at number 243 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" in 2003, and featured in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

Answer the following question: What is the full name of the person that is overjoyed that Beatrix Potter is a spinster?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The story begins with Beatrix Potter nervously packing her portfolio and narrating that she is a London spinster, and that her ambition to become a children's author meets with wide disapproval. She and her chaperone, Miss Wiggin, visit the publishing house of Harold and Fruing Warne, who decide to publish her book. Beatrix is thrilled and returns home, taking a drive through the parks to celebrate first. However, it is revealed the Warne brothers think her book is ridiculous and will no doubt be a failure. The only reason they agreed to publish it is because they promised their younger brother, Norman, a project. When Norman Warne visits Beatrix, they make decisions about her book regarding size, colour and price. Norman admits he has never done anything like this before but has given her book a great deal of thought. Beatrix realises what Norman's brothers have done regarding him and her, but they become determined to prove them wrong. Norman takes Beatrix to the printer, and she has her drawings reproduced and copies of her book sold. Thrilled, Beatrix and Norman visit the Warne family, where Beatrix meets the wheelchair-bound but lovely Mrs. Warne, and Norman's sister, Amelia, nicknamed \\"Millie\\". Millie has decided that she and Beatrix are going to be friends and is overjoyed that Beatrix is a spinster, as is Millie, who believes men to be nothing but bores. The family befriends Beatrix, yet Helen Potter, Beatrix's social-climbing mother, is unhappy about her daughter spending time in the company of 'tradesmen'. Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, the full name of the person that is overjoyed that Beatrix Potter is a spinster is Amelia Warne, also nicknamed \\"Millie.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - Ten Foot Pole is an American punk rock band, formerly on Epitaph Records.  - Rev is the second album by Ten Foot Pole , and the last to feature Scott Radinsky .  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Epitaph Records is a Hollywood-based independent record label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. The label was originally \\"just a logo and a P.O. box\\" created in the 1980s for the purpose of selling Bad Religion records, but has evolved into a large independent record label. Gurewitz took the name from a King Crimson song of the same name. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most of the bands on Epitaph were punk and pop punk groups, while there are many post-hardcore and bands signed to the label as well. A large portion of the record label, known as Hellcat Records, is owned by Tim Armstrong, frontman of the punk rock band Rancid. Several sister-labels also exist, such as ANTI-, Burning Heart Records, Fat Possum Records, Hellcat Records and Heart & Skull Records that have signed other types of bands.  - Scott David Radinsky (born March 3, 1968) is a left-handed former relief pitcher in Major League Baseball, who had an 11-year career from  and . Radinsky is also the lead singer of the punk rock band Pulley, former lead singer of the bands Scared Straight and Ten Foot Pole and co-owner of the skate park which houses the Skateboarding Hall of Fame.    What is the relationship between 'rev ' and 'epitaph records'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'Rev' and 'Epitaph Records' is that 'Rev' is the second album by the American punk rock band Ten Foot Pole, and it was released under the label Epitaph Records. Epitaph Records is an independent record label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz, which primarily focuses on punk and punk-related music genres."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Given the question: Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this air flow due to the Coriolis effect. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena.  Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes.  Mark was visiting southern Africa as an exchange student. He was amazed by the beauty of Namib Desert, which is located mostly in Namibia. He kind of enjoyed the hot surface of the desert. Next to Namib desert is the grasslands of  Botswana.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Decide what you want to achieve before you get started in the program. If you’ll be working sixty hours a week while also attending school, it might be a bad idea to aim for being #1 in your class.  Don’t use your undergrad experience as a barometer. As an undergrad you were likely able to devote your full attention to school. Don’t expect to get the same grades (at least right away) in your MBA program while working full time. Pay attention to the competition but don’t let it get to you. Everyone else in your part-time MBA program likely has similar goals: they want to move up in their careers as well. This is a self-selected group of high achievers so you should expect the competition to be tough. Try to remember that you’re there to learn skills and develop a network, not necessarily to be the best in the class. Pursuing an MBA while working full-time is an ambitious challenge. You’ll need to juggle work, school, and family responsibilities. You should understand how much time you’ll be devoting to each before you jump in.  Use a planner. Whether digital or paper, a planner is essential to navigating through an MBA while working. Use the planner to write in test days, due dates for both school and work assignments, and other important dates. Use a “to do” list with specific tasks. It feels good to scratch things off your “to do” list, and doing so will help keep you on track. If your list says something like “study,” it’s hard to know when you’ve completed the task. Instead, write something like, “study Chapter Two of the Business Skills 101 text and make flash cards.”  Schedule big study blocks. As a part-time MBA student working full time, you’ll need to use whatever time you have to study. However, you should also schedule study blocks into your planner every week. If you’re a morning person, plan to wake up early and study; if you’re a night owl, schedule your study blocks for nighttime.  Figure out what you can cut out. You may need to cut back on time at the gym, social activities, or other things in your life. It’s easy to get burned out while pursuing an MBA and working full-time. You should schedule days off ahead of time. That way, you can look forward to your planned days off and not feel guilty when you take them. Studying hard is important for success in your MBA. Studying smart means using the best strategies to study effectively and efficiently.  Instead of heading to a restaurant for lunch, pack one and study in your office during your lunch hour. Keep your study materials with you whenever you can. If you have unexpected downtime, you’ll always be prepared to hit the books. Many schools have tutors that can help you with your work. If you’re having trouble understanding a concept you should reach out to a tutor. Remember that you’re getting an MBA to improve your marketability. If you start slacking off at work or missing days, the negative impression of your boss could offset any gains from having an MBA.  If you start to feel overwhelmed, talk to your school first. They have resources to help you manage your time and your stress. If worst comes to worst and you feel like you’re going to miss a work deadline, talk to your boss. It’s better to let your employer know beforehand that you’ll be late with a project than to have to explain yourself later. Summary:","output":"When pursuing an MBA while working full-time, it's essential to manage your time effectively and set realistic expectations. Understand that your competition will be fierce, and focus on learning skills and developing a network instead of being at the top of your class. To stay organized, use a planner and to-do lists with specific tasks. Schedule regular study blocks and consider cutting back on other activities to make time for your studies. Study smart by using efficient strategies and taking advantage of resources like tutors. It's vital to maintain a strong work-life balance and not let your job performance suffer as a result of your academic commitments. Communicate with your school and employer if you start feeling overwhelmed and take advantage of the resources they can offer to help you cope with stress and manage your responsibilities. Overall, be prepared to make sacrifices and adjustments in your schedule, but remember that the ultimate goal is to improve your career prospects and personal growth."},{"instruction":"What are the first names of the people who hear a scream?

The question implies that the satellite has already moved past the moon. 2. Therefore, the option \\"moon\\" can be excluded as the target location of the satellite since that would contradict the given information. 3. Similarly, the option \\"air\\" would be counterintuitive as \\"air\\" refers usually to Earth's atmosphere and the situation described in the question clearly states that the satellite is beyond that point. 4. The option \\"night sky\\" can also be discarded because it typically refers to the visible space seen from Earth during the night time. Given the satellite is beyond the moon, it is too far to be merely in the \\"night sky\\". 5. Now we're left with \\"outer space\\" and \\"universe\\".

How can I use Google spreadsheets as the backend for a simple mobile app?","output":"No, the two questions provided are referring to different technologies and use cases: 1. How can I use FreeBSD as a backend for my app on AWS? This question refers to using FreeBSD—an open-source Unix-like operating system—as the backend for an application that will be hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS)—a widely-used cloud computing platform. A backend typically consists of a server, application, and a database that manage and store the app's data and perform any necessary computing, while AWS provides the infrastructure to host and run these components. Here's a detailed guide on using FreeBSD as the backend for your app on AWS: - Create an AWS account: If you don't have one already, sign up for an AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com/. - Choose the appropriate service: For deploying FreeBSD on AWS, one of the popular choices is Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), which provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can sign in to the AWS Management Console to access EC2 Dashboard. - Launch FreeBSD Instance: In the EC2 Dashboard, choose \\"Launch Instance\\" and search the AWS Marketplace for \\"FreeBSD\\". Several FreeBSD images will be available; select the one that best suits your needs. Make sure to read the documentation provided for any specific instructions relating to the image. - Configure your instance: Select your desired instance type (based on your CPU, memory, storage, and network requirements), and configure instance details such as the number of instances, network, and security group settings. - Create and manage SSH keys: To connect remotely to your FreeBSD instance on EC2, you'll need to create a key pair (public and private keys) or use an existing one. Store your private key in a secure location. - Launch your instance: Review your settings and confirm the instance creation. AWS will then initialize and launch your FreeBSD instance. - Connect to your instance: After the instance is launched and running, you can connect to it using an SSH client and the key pair you created earlier. Use the public DNS name or IP address provided by AWS to establish the connection. - Set up your backend components: Once connected to your FreeBSD instance, you can install the necessary software for your application, which may include a web server, your application runtime environment, and a database server. Configure these components as needed for your app. - Deploy your application: Once the backend components are set up, you can deploy your application code to the FreeBSD instance and configure the web server, application server, and database as needed. - Test and monitor: After deploying your app, test it to ensure it's working correctly, and monitor your FreeBSD instance and app using AWS tools and services. 2. How can I use Google spreadsheets as the backend for a simple mobile app? This question is about using Google Sheets—a web-based spreadsheet application—as the backend for a simple mobile app. Google Sheets can serve as a basic backend for storing data in a structured format and provides a simple interface for managing the data. Here's a detailed guide on using Google Sheets as the backend for a simple mobile app: - Create a Google Sheet: Sign in to your Google account and create a new Google Sheet. Structure your data in a meaningful and logical manner to suit your app's requirements (rows and columns for storing elements, labels, etc.). - Make the sheet public or limited access: If you are fine with your data being public, you can make the sheet public, so it's accessible to everyone. Alternatively, you can choose to restrict access by sharing the sheet only with specific people or your team. - Create a Google Sheets API key: Sign in to Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project for your mobile app. Navigate to the \\"APIs & Services\\" dashboard, search for \\"Google Sheets API,\\" and enable it. Create an API key under the \\"Credentials\\" tab by selecting \\"Create credentials\\" and choosing \\"API key.\\" Store this key securely. - Connect your mobile app to the Google Sheets API: Depending on the programming language and platform you are using for your mobile app, you'll need to configure it to call the Google Sheets API.

Question: What kills people in the mountain? Title: Without Warning Movie plot: A father and son go hunting in the mountains. Before they can begin hunting, which the son does not want to do anyway, they are killed by flying jellyfish-like creatures, which penetrate their skin with needle-tipped tentacles. Some time later, four teenagers, Tom, Greg, Beth and Sandy, hike in the same area, ignoring the warnings of local truck stop owner Joe Taylor (Jack Palance). A group of Cub Scouts is also in the area; their leader (Larry Storch) is also killed by the alien creatures, while his troop runs into an unidentified humanoid and flee. The teenagers set up camp at a lake, but after a few hours, Tom and Beth disappear. Sandy and Greg go looking for them and discover their bodies in an abandoned shack. They drive away in their van, while being attacked by one of the starfish which tries to get through the car's windshield. After they get rid of it, they arrive at the truck stop. Greg tries to get help from the locals, but they do not believe him, except for Fred 'Sarge' Dobbs (Martin Landau), who is a mentally ill veteran. Meanwhile, Sandy encounters the humanoid and flees into the woods, where Joe Taylor finds and returns her to Greg. While they discuss the situation, the sheriff arrives, but Sarge shoots him and begins to become more paranoid. Greg and Sandy leave with Taylor, who reveals he has been attacked by the humanoid before and secretly keeps the flying jellyfish as trophies. They search for the shack and once there, Taylor goes inside to only find the bodies of Tom, Beth and the cub scout leader.

What may happen next in speaker 's story ?","output":"In the speaker's story, the moment after the character kisses his nose, eyelids, and cheekbones, a flood of emotions may envelop both characters involved. The atmosphere is likely charged with romantic tension and the air thick with vulnerability as their connection deepens. There are several ways the story could unfold from this point: 1. The male character may finally find the courage to express his feelings to her, the color behind his eyes and the flutter in his stomach. He could explain that he has fallen in love or feels a deep emotional connection with her. His vulnerability in this moment could leave them both feeling exposed and reliant on one another's honesty. This could lead to a stronger bond between them, opening doors for a new chapter in their relationship, from being friends to becoming lovers. 2. The male character might still struggle to find the words to express his emotions, prompting the female character to coax him gently, assuring him that she is there for him and that he can trust her with his heart. This dialogue may create an opportunity for an open and meaningful exchange of thoughts and emotions between the two characters. As they share their truths and insecurities, their emotional connection may grow stronger, and this newfound level of understanding could shape their relationship moving forward. 3. Alternatively, the male character could become overwhelmed with emotions and, fearing his own vulnerability, may choose not to reveal his feelings. Despite the female character's tender gestures, he could pull away, leaving her uncertain of his intentions and confused about his reaction. This could lead to a rift in their relationship, sparking misunderstandings and heartache, with the possibility of reconciliation or moving apart in the future. 4. Another possible development could be the female character herself confessing her feelings first, assuming that his hesitation stems not from fear but from uncertainty about her feelings towards him. She may make herself emotionally vulnerable, laying out her feelings and her hopes for a romantic relationship between them. This confession might act as a catalyst for him to share his own emotions and solidify their deepened connection. 5. Their emotional experience in this moment could be interrupted by an external event or a third character, putting their romantic development on hold. This interruption might force them to temporarily set aside their emotions, only to resurface later in the story. This unexpected circumstance could add complexity, suspense, and tension to their narrative, keeping readers intrigued and invested in the outcome of their relationship.

Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. Answer:","output":"Norm learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing.

'Pathetic': Labour leader Ed Miliband has come under fire for his bid to shift blame over the Paul Flowers scandal. Ed Miliband was described as ‘pathetic’ yesterday after he accused David Cameron of smear tactics and plotting to run the ‘dirtiest election campaign’ in decades. The Labour leader said the Prime Minister was ‘demeaning his office’ with a political strategy to ‘sling as much mud as possible in the hope that some of it sticks’. His outburst follows weeks of negative headlines for the Labour Party, from the vote-rigging scandal in Falkirk to last week’s revelations about former Co-op chairman Paul Flowers, a former Labour councillor who was arrested as part of a drugs inquiry. Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, said Mr Miliband’s complaints showed the party could not take scrutiny and tended to ‘clam up’ when facing difficult questions. The Labour leader said in an article for the Independent on Sunday: ‘David Cameron used to claim he wanted to change his party and lead it back to the middle ground. ‘That project has now entirely  disappeared. This is a Conservative Party preparing to fight the dirtiest general  election campaign that we have seen in this country for over 20 years.’ Accusing the Tories of employing tactics of ‘smear and character assassination’, he wrote that at last Wednesday’s Prime  Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron had ‘hit a new low by trying to use the gross errors and misconduct of one man, Paul Flowers, to impugn the integrity of the entire Labour movement’. Conservative chairman Grant Shapps expressed his surprise that Labour, whose spin doctor Damian McBride was forced to resign in 2009 after he sent emails  discussing plans to smear senior Tories, was accusing anyone of dirty politics. ‘This is a pathetic attempt to evade the serious issues. Labour have big questions to answer, and when they are asked, they simply try to avoid them by claiming they are smears,’ he said. ‘It is an obvious tactic from the party that brought you the most disgraceful smear operation of modern times, fronted by Damian McBride, and known about, encouraged and tolerated by Ed Balls and Ed Miliband. And McBride was simply the latest in a long line of bullying Labour spin doctors, including Alastair Campbell and Charlie Whelan. Movie night: Disgraced Paul Flowers goes to the cinema in Liverpool with Ian Hu on Thursday night. ‘Incredibly, Labour’s new campaign chief Michael Dugher used to be McBride’s right-hand man – it’s the same old Labour. We suggest they explain how the corruption at Falkirk happened, and how the Rev Flowers was allowed to become and remain an adviser, rather than dismiss legitimate questions as smears.’ Mr Gove criticised the Labour leader for his ‘coquettish reticence’ in dealing with the scandals. He said it was hypocritical of Labour not to expect to have to answer questions about Paul Flowers, but he insisted there was no Tory plan to fight a dirty campaign. ‘We need to have lots of questions: that’s why the Chancellor of the Exchequer took the advice of independent people to set up an inquiry, which will ask searching questions about what went on right up to the moment that we discovered everything we discovered about Paul Flowers,’ he said. ‘The difficulty Labour has is they were the people responsible for appointing, or allowing Flowers to be appointed, on their watch.’ Mr Gove told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that when it came to questions over the Unite official at the centre of the Falkirk vote-rigging probe, Labour ‘tend to clam up’. Shameless Paul Flowers allegedly tried to acquire cocaine last week – after he was exposed on camera trying to  buy drugs and after promising to seek professional help. He phoned a dealer on Tuesday and asked for drugs. He reportedly invited the dealer to stay with him in Liverpool and said ‘turn up and if you want to bring the boy Charlie, that’s fine too’.  Charlie is Flowers’s habitual name for cocaine. Keeping a clean nose: Rev Paul Flowers last week. ‘I had absolutely no doubt Paul was referring to coke,’ the dealer told The Mail on Sunday. ‘He always used that word for it.’ After the publication of a video showing him handing over £300 to buy cocaine  and other illegal drugs, former Co-op  Bank chairman Flowers apologised for his ‘stupid and wrong’ actions in a statement made through the Methodist church last Sunday. He also vowed to seek help for  his problem. The convicted dealer claimed Flowers had admitted using drugs since 2010 – which covers most of his time at the  Co-op Bank – and the former Methodist minister allegedly admitted he didn’t believe in God. ‘Paul’s been a really heavy user of coke and ketamine for a long time,’ the dealer added. ‘I laughed when I saw his statement saying he was getting professional help. The only professional help he was seeking was from a professional drug fixer – me.’ The dealer said Flowers ‘sniffed a line of coke’ on Remembrance Sunday morning before going to a service in Bradford. Flowers has not been home since the scandal broke eight days ago and has been reportedly staying with fellow Methodist minister Ian Hu, 51, in Liverpool. They went to the cinema on Thursday. Further details of his debauched lifestyle are revealed in a string of texts he sent in recent weeks to his drug dealer. On the day he was due to appear before a Commons committee about the Co-op’s performance, he texted to say he has taken drugs and plans a night touring the gay bars of Bradford looking for ‘lots of likely lads’. In the days before his exposure in The Mail on Sunday, Flowers texted about watching porn and taking drugs. He also texted his dealer about a 17-year-old straight student he likes and suggests the teenager watches him having sex. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article, published in 2013, primarily discusses several scandals that have negatively affected the Labour Party.

Additionally, the article brings up examples of how previous Labour leaders were involved in questionable tactics and ties these tactics to current Labour members, such as campaign chief Michael Dugher. The article also details the drug-related allegations against Paul Flowers, including his attempts to acquire cocaine even after being exposed on camera trying to buy drugs. Furthermore, it reports on Flowers' admission to using drugs since 2010 and his alleged disbelief in God, despite being a former Methodist minister."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"When the United States runs a trade deficit, foreigners buy less than a dollar's worth of U.S. goods and services with every dollar they earn on their exports sold to the United States.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"When the United State runs a trade deficit, foreigners buy less U.S. goods than they earn on exports to the U.S.\\"?","output":"If the premise states that \\"when the United States runs a trade deficit, foreigners buy less than a dollar's worth of U.S. goods and services with every dollar they earn on their exports sold to the United States,\\" it offers insight into the relationship between trade deficits, U.S. goods and services, and foreign exports. To analyze this premise and the hypothesis \\"when the United States runs a trade deficit, foreigners buy less U.S. goods than they earn on exports to the U.S.,\\" it's important to examine the underlying economic concepts and their implications. Firstly, let's explain the concept of a trade deficit. A trade deficit occurs when the value of a country's imports exceeds the value of its exports during a specific time period. In the case of the United States, this means that the costs of goods and services that are imported from foreign nations are greater than the income generated from goods and services exported to these countries. When we dissect the given premise, we see that it refers to the exchange of goods and services between foreigners and the U.S. during a trade deficit. As the U.S. is importing more than it's exporting, it implies that foreigners are selling more goods and services to the U.S. (generating more export income) than they spend on importing American products. In other words, with every dollar they earn from their exports, they spend less than a dollar on U.S. goods and services, indicating that they have a surplus of income that they are not spending on American products. Considering the economic implications of the premise, we can deduce that it entails the hypothesis \\"When the United States runs a trade deficit, foreigners buy less U.S. goods than they earn on exports to the U.S.\\" By stating that foreigners spend less than a dollar on U.S. goods and services with every dollar earned in export income, the premise suggests that foreigners are not fully investing the money they earn from U.S. trade back into purchasing American goods and services. Thus, the hypothesis can be considered a plausible and logical extension of the given premise. When the United States runs a trade deficit, it is indicative of a reduced demand for U.S. goods and services from foreigners, who are spending less on American products than they are earning from their exports to the American market. This discrepancy in spending and earning supports the notion that a trade deficit correlates with foreigners buying less U.S. goods than they earn on exports to the U.S."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jakubet was found off shore by divers at 9:23 a.m., and efforts to resuscitate him failed as he was brought back to shore by boat, the fire department said.      Jakubek was pronounced dead at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis. The Cape and Islands District Attorney's Office is investigating his death, according to the fire department. He had just graduated from SUNY Cortland two weeks before his death, WCVB reported.      ABC      Jakubek was formally the captain of the swim team at SUNY Cortland, WCVB reported. Jakubek's swim team coach at SUNY Cortland, Brian Tobin, praised his swimming skills and called him a \\"great teammate\\" who \\"everyone could rely on.\\"      \\"He was a very good high school swimmer, and over the course of his four years here at Cortland, he continued to improve, progress. He had a tremendous work ethic,\\" Tobin told WCVB.      After graduation, Jakubek had hoped to return to Cape Cod to work as a lifeguard, as he did last summer, WCVB reported. ||||| A record-setting college swimmer and recent graduate died Saturday during lifeguard tryouts off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.      State University of New York-Cortland 2016 graduate Jack Jakubek was participating in a fitness test for potential lifeguards at Pilgrim Lake in Orleans, Massachusetts, according to statements from the Orleans Fire Department and the University.      “At approximately 8:49 a.m. a swimmer went missing,” the fire department said.      A multiagency search and rescue operation was immediately launched, including emergency teams from Orleans, Barnstable County, State Police and the U.S. Coast Guard.      “A male victim in his 20s was located by divers at 9:23 a.m. off-shore. He was transported by fire to Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, where he was pronounced dead,” the fire department said.      Jakubek graduated in May with an outdoor recreation degree, according to SUNY. He was a school record-holder in the 100-yard breaststroke and the 200-yard breaststroke.      “Jack was an outstanding athlete, but he was even more remarkable as a person,” said head coach Brian Tobin in a statement. “His loss is devastating to the Red Dragon swimming and diving family, the SUNY Cortland community and beyond.”      Tobin said Jakubek planned to return to Cortland in the fall to pursue a master’s degree and work as a graduate assistant coach.      “I knew I could depend on him for anything at any time. Jack visited with me the day after graduation, and we talked about his plans for the summer, the next year and life in general. As he walked to the car, I remember being impressed by how he had everything planned out and put together for himself. It makes an unfathomable event like this even harder to comprehend,” said Tobin.      Jakubek graduated from Monroe-Woodbury High School in Monroe, New York, in 2012.      “Jack is perhaps best remembered for being a star member of the high school swim team,” said Superintendent Elsie Rodriguez in a statement. “Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to Jack’s family and friends at this difficult time.”      Jakubek’s death is being investigated by the Cape and Islands District Attorney.      #Orleans drowning victim mourned; Jack Jakubek was competitive swimmer, recent college grad https://t.co/0yqgs2rILR pic.twitter.com/mVwTmd2nWl — Cape Cod Times (@capecodtimes) May 30, 2016 ||||| Jack Jakubek was a star swimmer, a passionate young man who knew exactly what he wanted out of life. But his dreams of sharing his love of the outdoors with children were cut tragically short Saturday when he drowned at Pilgrim Lake in Orleans while trying out for a lifeguard position.      Jakubek, 22, of Newburgh, New York, slipped beneath the lake's surface during the trials and was later found by an Orleans Fire Department diver in 10 to 15 feet of water, officials said. Jakubek had been a lifeguard in Orleans for at least one other year before this summer, according to town records.      Jakubek graduated from the State University of New York at Cortland two weeks ago and was planning to return to the school in the Finger Lakes region of New York this fall for graduate school, said Brian Tobin, the school's head swimming and diving coach. Jakubek was planning to serve as Tobin's graduate assistant and help him coach the swim team in the upcoming year.      \\"He was the kind of person who figured out what he wanted out of life and went to get it,\\" Tobin said. \\"You don't see a lot of guys in their early 20s who just know what they want so clearly.\\"      Jakubek was a strong competitive swimmer dating back to his high school years in Monroe, New York, according to a profile of him in the SUNY-Cortland swimming and diving team guide. He was a two-time team captain both in high school and in college, where he held several records.      \\"He was the teammate everyone wanted to have as a teammate,\\" Tobin said. \\"He made others better, not just his teammates but the coaching staff and pretty much everyone around him. He was an exceptional individual and, in a lot of respects, was very humble about his successes as a swimmer and who he was.\\"      Since news of the tragedy reached Tobin, he said he's been on the phone talking with current and former members of the swim team. The overwhelming reaction has been shock, he said, and disbelief that something like this could happen.      \\"He is the best guy I know,\\" said Luke Strothenke, a former teammate at SUNY-Cortland. \\"It's a true tragedy.\\"      The incident is under investigation by the Orleans police and Massachusetts State Police. Tara Miltimore, spokeswoman for Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe, said Sunday via email there was no new information to release.      Jakubek is survived by his parents, Jill Legg and Mark Jakubek, and siblings, Kramer and Anna, according to the school.      — Follow Sean F.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I have a new situation: In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity.  But I can use this background: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.  What is an answer for this question: In battle day one would group A have less openings or more openings in their nest thatch? The answer is:","output":"On battle day one, group A would likely have less openings in their nest thatch. Based on the background information provided, Acromyrmex heyeri ants adjust the number of openings in their nest thatch in response to the temperature and air humidity around their nest. The optimal temperature range for these ants is 20-30°C. On battle day one, the temperature in group A's territory was 5°C, which is significantly lower than the optimal range. As a result, the ants would likely have fewer openings in their nest thatch in an attempt to conserve heat and maintain a stable internal nest temperature. Additionally, the ants close the openings in their nest thatch when the air humidity surrounding their nest decreases. While there is no information about the air humidity on battle day one, it is worth considering that a lower temperature could potentially coincide with lower humidity. If this were the case, it would further support the idea that group A would have fewer openings in their nest thatch to reduce water loss. In conclusion, based on the temperature on battle day one and the ants' behavior in response to changing temperatures and air humidity, it is reasonable to assume that group A would have less openings in their nest thatch on that day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We all get Gotham is a hole in the ground corrupt city. Move on DC. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided product review, it appears that the reviewer does not have a favorable opinion of the product, which seems to be related to DC's Batman franchise. The review can be considered unflattering for various reasons, as outlined below: 1. Use of negative language: The title of the review itself, \\"BORING,\\" indicates a strong dissatisfaction with the product. Additionally, the reviewer emphasizes their disinterest by stating they almost fell asleep while watching it. This negative language portrays the product as unexciting and unengaging. 2. Repetitive content: The reviewer explicitly mentions that DC needs to stop with the Batman franchise, as they feel it has been overdone. They argue that the content is repetitive, having seen similar iterations \\"twice\\" before. This criticism implies that the product lacks originality and freshness. 3. Lack of utilization of other DC characters: The reviewer expresses frustration that DC continually relies on Batman and Superman, while they possess a wealth of other characters. This point emphasizes the reviewer's belief that DC's focus on Batman has become tedious, potentially alienating fans of other characters who may seek more diverse stories and protagonists. 4. Unfavorable comparison to Superman: The review makes a comparison between Batman and Superman products, indicating that at least the latter's movies are watchable. This remark unfavorably sets the reviewed product apart from other films within the DC universe, further highlighting its negative portrayal. 5. Critique of the setting: The reviewer also criticizes the setting of Gotham City, describing it as a \\"hole in the ground\\" and suggesting that DC should move on from it. This comment reflects the viewer's dissatisfaction with the recurring themes related to corruption and darkness, which may contribute to their overall negative opinion of the product. In conclusion, the review provided does not depict the product in a flattering light. The reviewer's numerous criticisms and unfavorable comparisons suggest a strong dissatisfaction with the Batman franchise, as well as a desire to see DC explore different characters and storylines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Out of boredom, two scientists from the New Contagious Diseases Research Centre devised themselves a new game. One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door.

How do you do this: How do I make my bed?","output":"Making your bed is a simple yet important daily task that contributes to maintaining a clean and tidy bedroom atmosphere. By making your bed each morning, you can establish a positive routine, improve your focus and productivity, and cultivate a sense of accomplishment. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to make a bed: 1. Remove pillows and decorative items: Begin by removing all pillows, stuffed animals, and decorative throws from your bed. This will clear the space and make it easier to work. 2. Straighten the fitted sheet: Start with the bottom-most linens, called the fitted sheet, which wraps around the mattress. Pull the elasticized corners snugly over each corner of the mattress, ensuring the fabric is taut and wrinkle-free. If the fitted sheet has come undone during the night, reposition the corners and smooth the fabric across the surface of the mattress. 3. Lay the top sheet: Spread the top sheet (also called the flat sheet) over the fitted sheet evenly, making sure the sheet is aligned with the head, foot, and sides of the bed. The top edge should be at the head of the bed, with the sheet's finished side facing down. This will ensure that when you fold it back, the finished side will be visible. Allow the excess fabric to hang evenly on both sides of the bed. 4. Add a blanket or comforter: Drape your blanket or comforter over the top sheet, ensuring its edges line up neatly with the edges of the top sheet. Smooth the blanket or comforter across the entire surface of the bed, removing any wrinkles or folds. 5. Fold the top sheet: At the head of the bed, fold the top edge of the flat sheet and blanket or comforter back by approximately 12 inches (30 centimeters). This creates a neat and tidy appearance and exposes the sheet's finished side. Optionally, you can also fold the sheet and blanket or comforter down further (about halfway), creating a larger fold. This gives you more space to arrange your pillows. 6. Tuck in the sides: Move to one side of the bed, grasp the edge of the flat sheet and blanket or comforter together, and tuck them neatly under the mattress. To create a hospital corner, lift the hanging edge of the linens about 12 inches (30 centimeters) from the foot of the bed, then tuck the bottom section under the mattress. Now, fold the hanging edge down over the previously tucked section, ensuring it creates a 45-degree angle, and tuck this neatly underneath the mattress. Repeat the process on the other side of the bed. 7. Position your pillows: Place your sleeping pillows back on the bed, arranging them against the headboard or wall. Ensure the pillowcases are free of wrinkles, and the open ends are facing away from the center of the bed. If you have decorative pillows or shams, place these in front of your sleeping pillows. 8. Add finishing touches: Position any decorative throw pillows or blankets that you may have, arranging them to your personal preference. Make any final adjustments to ensure that the bed looks tidy and polished. By following these steps, you can successfully make your bed each day, instilling a sense of routine and organization into your daily life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A primary school teacher hit a boy of six over the head with a ruler so hard it snapped in half, a court heard yesterday. Rina Khan, 41, is accused of calling the child a 'muppet' and hitting him for getting a question wrong. A teaching assistant said part of the ruler 'flew across the room' after the incident on March 20, which left the boy 'sad and scared'. Khan, a full-time teacher for two-and-a-half years who has also worked with the disabled, denies child cruelty and common assault. Prosecutor Peter Arnold said she had been teaching Year Two maths with assistant Joanna Fleary. He said: 'She was having problems with him. Khan was standing behind the youngster when he got a question wrong. The defendant was upset about that and the long and short of it is that she had a plastic ruler in her hand and she hit the boy on the top of his head and the ruler broke. 'What she did was unlawful.' When asked about the incident, the boy said that it had hurt and made him 'sad and scared'. Miss Fleary said she heard Khan, from Smethwick, West Midlands, shouting increasingly loudly. She added: 'I looked up again and a piece of ruler flew across the room.' She said she put a compress on the boy's head, and added that Khan later admitted she had not meant to hit so hard. Khan wept as she told Birmingham Crown Court she loved her pupils at the school, which cannot be named for legal reasons, and denied mistreating them. She said: 'The boy was being really quite disruptive with the pupils next to him. He kept poking a sharp pencil into their arms and he was really reluctant to do his own work. 'He kept doing the same thing. He poked the girl next to him in the arm with the pencil and was pulling faces at her.' Khan claimed she repeatedly told him to stop, but he persisted. 'I turned around. I had to stop him. I have a duty of care to all my pupils. I had a ruler in my hand at that time because I was drawing lines for a pupil and I turned around and simply tapped him on the head.' She said that she was 'really really shocked' that it broke. 'I don't think I used any force. It was just a tap. Those rulers at the school have been known to break.' Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) heard the teacher denies the charges of child cruelty and assault. Khan said she asked the boy if he was hurt and he said no. 'I checked his head for any bruises or bumps. There weren't any. I offered to get medical assistance, but he was OK. 'I did not hit him. If I had hit him, the children would have been frightened. They were not.' She added: 'I did call him a muppet but [not] on that day. I used that word with my children sometimes but as a term of affection, just like The Muppet Show.' Tom Walkling, defending, asked the court: 'Is tapping a naughty boy on the head with a ruler really a criminal assault? Do we want to live in a world where teachers are so afraid of being prosecuted in a criminal court that they are wary of any contact with the children in their care?' The trial continues.

Unlike conventional gaming tables, which are typically rectangular, Daniel's table resembles a curvy, elongated banana. His unconventional approach challenges the conventionalism associated with gaming tables and triggers curiosity among onlookers. Step 4: The impact of the bizarre gaming table At once humorous and perplexing, Daniel's yellow gaming table ventures boldly into uncharted territory, urging people to view the world through a different lens. The avant-garde creation has redefined the notion of a gaming table and by extension, the possibilities of artistic expression. It encapsulates Cléon Daniel's ethos of breaking free from restrictive creative norms. Conclusion: In summary, British artist Cléon Daniel's bizarre gaming table showcases the boundless creativity within the world of contemporary art. Its origin story – taking root during a train ride – serves as a reminder that inspiration can be found in the most unexpected of places. With its striking yellow hue and unconventional curve, Daniel's challenging piece invites viewers to question their perceptions and embrace the unfamiliar, making it not only a symbol of artistic innovation but also a testament to the importance of thinking outside the box."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

By Liz Szabo, USA TODAY Authors of a new study hope to begin a debate challenging the conventional wisdom about early detection of breast cancer. In an article in today's , they ask: Do breast tumors ever go away on their own? Researchers of this controversial article note that one type of cancer found through screening — a rare childhood tumor, called neuroblastoma — sometimes disappears. In the new article, researchers try to learn if the same phenomenon occurs with invasive breast cancers found with mammograms. While the authors say it's possible that breast cancers can regress, they acknowledge that their study doesn't provide a definitive answer. Finding a solid answer to the question may be impossible, because it's not ethical to leave breast cancers untreated, according to an editorial that accompanied the article. In the study, American and Norwegian researchers compared the number of breast cancers found in more than 100,000 Norwegian women who were screened every two years with a roughly equal number who received only one mammogram after six years. Women with cancer who are screened more frequently could be diagnosed earlier. But the two strategies should find about the same number of cancers, authors say. Yet doctors actually found 22% more breast cancers among the women who got more frequent mammograms. That raises the possibility that mammograms found cancers that eventually went away — and never needed to be treated, says co-author H. Gilbert Welch of the VA Outcomes Group in White River Junction, Vt. Other experts disputed the study's findings and note that mammograms are proven to save lives. The American Cancer Society recommends most women get annual screenings after age 40. There are many reasons why women screened more frequently might be more likely to be diagnosed with cancer, says the cancer society's Robert Smith. Although a single scan may miss small tumors, doctors may more easily find cancers on repeat mammograms, especially if they compare new results with previous images. With more than 180,000 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in the USA every year, Smith says that doctors would surely have noticed if these tumors were really disappearing. \\"It's important that people not wonder if women lost their breasts for no reason,\\" Smith says. \\"That's a reprehensible conjecture.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of the news article can be summed up as follows: 1. The researchers proposed a controversial theory that breast tumors might sometimes go away on their own, akin to the rare childhood tumor, the neuroblastoma. 2. However, they acknowledged that it is impossible to conclusively prove if the same effect happens in breast cancer cases due to the ethical concerns of leaving such cancers untreated. 3. The research involved comparing data from over 100,000 Norwegian women who were screened every two years, and an equivalent number who had only one mammogram after six years. 4. The findings showed 22% more breast cancer cases among women who had mammograms more frequently, leading to a conjecture that some detected cancers might have regressed on their own without treatment. 5.

Toyota Deals Quickly With GX 460 Problem The company had gotten advance notice from Consumer Reports magazine that it would warn buyers not to buy the vehicle. The magazine said its safety tests had determined the GX 460 had a dangerous handling problem that caused its rear end to swerve and had a risk of rollover. After absorbing the predawn news, a Lexus spokesman said, the Japanese engineer immediately promised to get on it. Later on Tuesday, Toyota announced it was temporarily halting sales of the 52,000 luxury S.U.V., demonstrating that it had learned the lessons of dawdling during a safety crisis — and also reflecting the influence Consumer Reports exerts. While Toyota’s step might have seemed an overreaction under other circumstances, it had no choice given the current climate, auto analysts said Wednesday. “Safety problems and Toyota seem to be lumped together in the zeitgeist right now,” said James Bell, an executive market analyst at Kelley Blue Book, which tracks vehicle trends. Through the years, Consumer Reports’ positive recommendations of Toyota vehicles — the company makes Toyota and Lexus brands — were a factor in the Japanese automaker’s rise to second place in the American car market, behind General Motors. Many car buyers walk into the company’s showrooms carrying the magazine’s car-buying issue. But in late January, Consumer Reports suspended some of its positive recommendations when Toyota temporarily stopped building and selling eight models involved in a recall for sticking accelerator pedals. The company has since resumed production and sales of those vehicles, but the magazine’s positive recommendations have not returned. Ever since, Toyota has been working closely with the magazine’s editors, and Toyota executives said last month that they hoped the return of the positive, or recommended, ratings on those vehicles was imminent. That might help explain why Toyota moved only hours after hearing the magazine’s recommendation on the GX without being prodded by federal safety regulators. On Wednesday, as Lexus dealers provided loaner cars to owners who felt uncomfortable driving their GX models, Toyota engineers were focused on fixing the problem. The engineers were going over the Consumer Reports’ data, video footage and other information about the tests the vehicle had failed. Consumer Reports provided Toyota with the materials, said Ken Weine, a spokesman for the magazine’s parent, Consumers Union. The handling problem arises if the driver of a GX eases off the gas pedal while driving quickly through a sharp turn, the magazine said. That causes the rear end of the vehicle to slide toward the outside of the turn, a condition called “trailing throttle oversteer.” David Champion, the senior director of Consumer Reports auto testing, has theorized the control system was at fault, but Toyota had reached no conclusion on Wednesday. “Our engineering teams are vigorously testing the GX using Consumer Reports’ specific parameters to identify how we can make the GX’s performance even better,” Mark Templin, the general manager of Lexus, said in a statement posted on the division’s Web site. Consumer Reports said it would not let the company use its testing track because of a longstanding policy of barring manufacturers from its test facilities. “We test for consumers. They are our constituency,” Mr. Weine said. “We don’t test for manufacturers or the government.” That means the automaker must try to reproduce the turn and surface at a test facility in Japan, in part relying on satellite photos from Google, said the Lexus spokesman, Bill Kwong. “We are going to try and duplicate it as much as possible,” he said. If they can do so, Mr. Kwong said Toyota engineers would check tires and the vehicle’s suspension as well as the responsiveness of the electronic stability control system, which is meant to stabilize the car. The company’s fast response to the problem, analysts said, showed that the lessons of the last half year, in which Toyota was criticized by federal officials, members of Congress and lawyers for taking too long to deal with safety issues that led to the recall of six million vehicles in the United States and eight million worldwide. Lexus had largely escaped the taint of the recalls even though the highest-profile accident involving a stuck accelerator, involving a former California state trooper and his family, took place in a Lexus ES 350 sedan. Over all, Lexus sales were up in 2010, even before Toyota initiated generous incentives in response to the recalls that caused its sales to soar in March. And it had high hopes for the latest version of the GX, introduced in December and built at a high-tech plant in Tahara, Japan. Lexus has sold 4,787 GX models so far this year, up 180 percent from 2009, when the previous version was phased out. Based on the same frame as the Toyota 4Runner sport utility, the GX starts at 52,800 with destination charges and features a 4.6-liter V-8 engine. Before Consumer Reports “don’t buy” designation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s defects database showed only one consumer complaint about a sliding problem with the vehicle, dated March 10. That complaint had not appeared on the database until Wednesday. A second customer also wrote to the agency on Tuesday, asking for information about the newly publicized problem, the database showed.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? Can we use artificial light (CFL, tubelight) to charge a solar-powered calculator? Can LED light power another solar powered LED light? Options are: (a). no. (b). yes.","output":"(a). Yes. The two questions are indeed checking the same fundamental understanding about how solar power operates, specifically with regards to artificial light sources. The underlying principle for both cases involves photovoltaic cells (used in solar panels), which convert light into electricity. While these cells are designed to harness energy from the sun, they can also convert other types of light into electricity, albeit usually at a less efficient rate than sunlight. This means that if a solar-powered calculator or a solar-powered LED light receives enough light from an artificial source, like a compact fluorescent lamp (CFL), a tubelight, or an LED light, it could potentially continue functioning. The first question about the solar-powered calculator is wondering whether artificial light from devices like CFLs and tubelights can be utilized the same way sunlight is used - to generate power. These calculators typically need only a low light level to operate, hence it is possible for them to use artificial light sources.  In the second question, it is asking whether a solar-powered LED light could be powered by another LED light. It's essentially wondering if artificial light from an LED could power another solar device, similar to the first question. The key point is whether the light from the first LED is bright enough to be captured by the photovoltaic cells in the second LED's solar panel. However, it’s important to note that while in theory, artificial indoor lights can charge solar panels, in practicality the process would be extremely inefficient and ineffective compared to natural sunlight. They may not produce enough power to effectively charge the device as the intensity of the light does influence the charging efficiency, especially when considering larger devices. The light produced by artificial sources is less intense than sunlight, and generally covers a narrower spectrum of light, which makes them less effective at charging solar devices. Furthermore, solar panels are designed to make use of the full spectrum of light from the sun, so indoor lighting often falls short in offering the ideal light spectrum range. Therefore, while the two questions are essentially asking about the same principle, it's worth taking into account the practical implications of trying to use artificial light as a consistent source of power for solar devices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ask your doctor any questions you might have. Have a friend or loved one with you for support, if possible. Get an injection of methotrexate to dissolve the ectopic pregnancy. Consent to surgical treatment, if necessary.","output":"Title: Dealing with an Ectopic Pregnancy: Guidance, Support, and Treatment Options Introduction Ectopic pregnancies occur when a fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. Unfortunately, these pregnancies are not viable and can be life-threatening if untreated. Navigating an ectopic pregnancy can be emotionally challenging and physically draining. This article will provide guidance for individuals coping with this rare but serious condition, highlighting the importance of support from loved ones, asking questions, and understanding medical treatments such as methotrexate injections and surgical procedures. Acknowledging a Non-Viable Pregnancy Coming to terms with the fact that an ectopic pregnancy is not viable can be incredibly challenging and emotional. It's essential to remember that women experiencing this have done nothing wrong; such pregnancies usually occur due to factors beyond their control. Recognizing the reality of the situation is crucial for making the best decisions moving forward. Feeling grief, anger, or fear is natural, and seeking support from a therapist or support group may help ease these emotions. Asking Questions and Seeking Support from Loved Ones During this challenging time, it's essential to talk to your doctor and ask questions. Understanding the causes and implications of an ectopic pregnancy will help you feel more in control and allow you to make more informed decisions about your treatment. Topics to discuss could include risk factors, potential impacts on future fertility, and ways to additional emotional support, such as counseling or support groups. Having a friend or loved one by your side during this time can provide invaluable emotional support and another person to help listen and ask questions during medical appointments. Do not hesitate to reach out to your support network and lean on them during this time. Methotrexate Injection for Ectopic Pregnancy Once an ectopic pregnancy has been diagnosed, treatment must be initiated to protect your health. Methotrexate is a medication that can be used to dissolve the pregnancy when caught early. It's a chemotherapy drug that works by stopping cell growth, effectively halting the development of the ectopic pregnancy.  The injection is given at a hospital or clinic, and patients must be monitored closely with blood tests to ensure the medication is working effectively. Methotrexate injections are a non-surgical option and may be recommended based on factors such as the size and location of the pregnancy, the patient's overall health, and the absence of symptoms like extreme pain or bleeding. Consenting to Surgical Treatment In some cases, methotrexate may not be a suitable option or may not adequately dissolve the ectopic pregnancy. In these instances, surgical intervention becomes necessary. The most commonly performed surgery for an ectopic pregnancy is a laparoscopic procedure, which involves making small incisions in the abdomen and using a camera to guide the surgeon to the affected area. During this surgery, the ectopic pregnancy is removed, and the fallopian tube may be repaired or, in some cases, removed. This procedure has a shorter recovery time compared to open surgery and can usually be performed as an outpatient procedure. Conclusion Coping with an ectopic pregnancy requires emotional and physical resilience. Acknowledging the non-viability of the pregnancy is crucial for decision-making. Seeking medical advice, understanding available treatment options, and having a stable support system can aid in navigating this difficult time. Methotrexate injections and surgical treatments are standard interventions, and your doctor will help determine the best course of action for your individual needs. Remember, you are not alone in this journey, and resources and support are available to help guide you through this challenging experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person that conducted the December 1900 performance where the man who was called up for military service in 1896 played solo viola?, using the article: Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The answer to your friend's question is that the last name of the person who conducted the December 1900 performance where the man who was called up for military service in 1896 played solo viola is Mottl.

Information:  - Sub Pop is a record label founded in 1986 by Bruce Pavitt. In 1988, Sub Pop Records LLC was formed by Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman in Seattle, Washington. Sub Pop achieved fame in the late 1980s for first signing Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and many other bands from the Seattle alternative rock scene. They are often credited with taking the first steps toward popularizing grunge music, and have continued to achieve critical and commercial success in the new millennium, with bands such as Fleet Foxes, Foals, Beach House, The Postal Service, Flight of the Conchords, Sleater-Kinney, Blitzen Trapper, No Age, Wolf Parade and The Shins on their roster. In 1995 the owners of Sub Pop sold a 49% stake of the label to the Warner Music Group.  - Jack Endino (born 1964) is an American producer and musician based in Seattle, United States. Long associated with Seattle label Sub Pop and the grunge movement, Endino worked on seminal albums from bands such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, and Nirvana. Endino was also the guitarist for the Seattle band Skin Yard which was active between 1985 and 1992. Endino has maintained a down-to-earth and humorous website since 1997, and currently manages a studio in Seattle called Soundhouse Recording.  - Skin Yard was an American grunge band from Seattle, Washington, who were active from 1985 to 1993. The group never gained a mainstream audience, but were an influence on several of their grunge contemporaries, including Soundgarden, Screaming Trees, The Melvins, and Green River.  - Blues rock is a fusion genre combining elements of blues and rock. It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock. From its beginnings in the early- to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way inspired hard rock, Southern rock, and heavy metal. Blues rock continues to be an influence, with performances and recordings by several popular artists.  - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.  - Highlights and Lowlives is the eighth studio album by American rock band Blue Cheer , released in 1990 and produced by Jack Endino .  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals.  - \\"Summertime Blues\\" is a song co-written and recorded by American rockabilly artist Eddie Cochran. It was written by Cochran and his manager Jerry Capehart. Originally a single B-side, it was released in August 1958 and peaked at number 8 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 on September 29, 1958 and number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. It has been covered by many artists, including being a number-one hit for country music artist Alan Jackson, and scoring notable hits in versions by The Who and Blue Cheer. Jimi Hendrix performed it in concert.  - Stoner rock or stoner metal is a musical subgenre which combines elements of heavy metal, psychedelic rock, acid rock, doom metal, and blues rock. The term desert rock is often used interchangeably with the term \\"stoner rock\\" to describe this genre; however, not all stoner rock bands would fall under the descriptor of \\"desert rock.\\" Stoner rock is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features a heavily distorted, groove laden bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and \\"retro\\" production. The genre emerged during the early-1990s and was pioneered foremost by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep.  - Soundgarden is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1984 by singer and rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell, lead guitarist Kim Thayil, and bassist Hiro Yamamoto. Matt Cameron became the band's full-time drummer in 1986, while bassist Ben Shepherd became a permanent replacement for Yamamoto in 1990.  - Blue Cheer was an American rock band that initially performed and recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was sporadically active until 2009. Based in San Francisco, Blue Cheer played in a psychedelic blues rock style, and are also credited as being some of the earliest pioneers of heavy metal, with their cover of \\"Summertime Blues\\" sometimes cited as the first in the genre. They have also been noted as influential in the development of genres as disparate as punk rock, stoner rock, doom metal, experimental rock, and grunge.  - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented.

She learns that her talent is to be one of the tinkers, the fairies who make and fix things. Two other tinker fairies, Bobble (Rob Paulsen) and Clank (Jeff Bennett), teach her their craft, and tell her about the fairies who visit the mainland to bring each season. Tinker Bell is thrilled and cannot wait to go to the mainland for spring. While out working, she meets Silvermist (Lucy Liu), a water fairy; Rosetta (Kristin Chenoweth), a garden fairy; Iridessa (Raven-SymonÃ©), a light fairy; and Fawn (America Ferrera), an animal fairy. After meeting them, she notices Vidia (Pamela Adlon), a fast-flying fairy who immediately dislikes her because of her unusually strong talent. Vidia challenges her to prove she will be able to go to the mainland, and Tinker Bell creates several inventions, which she shows to the Minister of Spring (Steve Valentine). But Tinker Bell soon learns from Queen Clarion (Anjelica Huston) that only nature-talent fairies visit the mainland. She tries her hand at nature skills; making dewdrops with Silvermist, lighting fireflies with Iridessa, and trying with Fawn to teach baby birds to fly, but she fails miserably at all of these. Meanwhile, Bobble and Clank cover for Tinker Bell when questioned by Fairy Mary (Jane Horrocks), the tinker fairy overseer. When Tinker Bell returns, she tries to explain, but Mary simply responds that she knows, and expresses her disappointment with Tinker Bell's actions.

Step 1: Understand the structure of a manipular legion A manipular legion was a Roman military unit that existed from around the 4th century BC to approximately the 2nd century BC. The manipular legion was organized into three lines: the hastati, the principes, and the triarii, each consisting of 10 maniples. Step 2: Identify the supporting units in a manipular legion In addition to the heavy infantry of the three lines, the manipular legion had supporting units of light infantry called velites and cavalry troops called equites. Step 3: Determine the number of cavalry troops in a manipular legion As mentioned in the statement, the typical number of horsemen in a manipular legion was around 300. Based on the steps above, we can conclude that the statement \\"The heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion.\\" is correct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished.  and the situation: Jeff and Jeremy were neighbors and best friends since kindergarten. They always enjoyed the same hobbies and did everything together. When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested. The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer.  Answer the following question: Which sport would Jeff play better do to his size, basketball or soccer? Answer:","output":"Given Jeff's increased height due to his adolescent growth spurt, he would likely excel better at basketball compared to soccer. Jeff's taller stature would give him an advantage in basketball, as height plays a significant role in this sport, allowing him to more easily reach the basket, win rebounds, and block shots. While height can also provide certain benefits in soccer, such as in aerial challenges and headers, it is not as crucial to success as it is in basketball. Therefore, based on Jeff's size and growth, basketball would be the sport where he may perform better due to his height advantage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The digital portfolio Parker used for modeling was working much better than his print headshot, because the","output":"digital portfolio could encompass a wider variety of images and interactive content, showcase his work in a more dynamic format, and be constantly updated, making it a more suitable tool for the digital age. First and foremost, the digital modeling portfolio offered flexibility and the capacity to include a greater variety of images and multimedia content such as videos, GIFs, and 3D renders. This was crucial for Parker as it gave him the opportunity to demonstrate a wider range of his modeling abilities and styles. Unlike his print headshot, which was static and captured only one aspect of his personality and appearance, his digital portfolio allowed him to showcase the dynamic aspect of his performances. Modeling is not only about appearance, but about conveying emotions, attitudes and different moods. A digital portfolio enabled Parker to exhibit all these dimensions. Secondly, having his portfolio in a digital format empowered Parker to better express and market himself. Everyone who uses the internet is accustomed to moving images, as they are more engaging than static ones. His potential employers could, with just a click or swipe, get an immediate sense of his movement and modeling prowess, since they weren't just looking at a snapshot but instead could view an entire performance. This interactivity was particularly impactful when applied to video content, especially in our current digital-centric era where video content often takes precedence over static images. Additionally, a digital portfolio could be updated, edited, and curated in real time, constantly evolving and improving to meet industry trends and standards. This meant Parker could include images from his most recent jobs or take out older works as he accumulated newer content. He could also refine and adapt his portfolio with each job application, tailoring his showcased work to better suit the needs and preferences of prospective clients or agencies. On the contrary, a print headshot, once printed, became fixed and uneditable, which could potentially result in a dated representation of his modeling skills over time.  Furthermore, the digital portfolio had a much broader reach compared to the print headshot. It could be shared instantly via email, posted to a variety of social media platforms, or linked to a personal website. This ability of easy sharing could potentially reach numerous agencies, photographers, designers, and potential clients, irrespective of geographical boundaries. This greatly increased his chances of being noticed and hired. Lastly, the use of a digital portfolio manifested Parker's ability to keep up with the technological times and proved to potential employers that he was sophisticated, adaptable, and ready to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving industry. His technological savviness was a valuable asset in an industry that is becoming increasingly digital. In conclusion, the transition from traditional, printed headshots to more versatile, dynamic, and accessible digital portfolios provided significant advantages for modern models like Parker. In the fast-paced digital age, adapting to new technological advancements is not just an option but a necessity to stay relevant and competitive in the modeling industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Felicia was a lot more awake and healthier.;  2). Jessica was a lot more awake and healthier.;","output":"Felicia had a lot more energy than Jessica because Felicia was a lot more awake and healthier. This was due to a variety of factors, such as her lifestyle choices, her diet, and her sleeping patterns. Felicia's dedication to maintaining a balanced life helped her to feel more energetic and focused throughout the day, while Jessica's lifestyle left her feeling lethargic and exhausted. One of the primary reasons Felicia felt more energetic than Jessica was her commitment to engaging in regular physical activity. Felicia made exercise a priority in her life, consistently incorporating activities such as running, swimming, and yoga into her daily routine. This regular exercise not only helped to improve Felicia's overall physical health, but it also allowed her to expel energy in a healthy way and to sleep more soundly at night, both contributing factors to her heightened energy levels during the day. In contrast, Jessica struggled to make time for physical activity, often opting to spend her free time watching television or browsing the internet on her phone. This sedentary lifestyle resulted in lower energy levels, as her body and mind were not stimulated in the same way that Felicia's were through exercise. Additionally, Jessica's lack of regular exercise left her more susceptible to feelings of fatigue and exhaustion during the day. Another important factor contributing to the difference in energy levels between Felicia and Jessica was their diet. Felicia was very mindful of the foods she consumed, paying close attention to the nutrients she was putting into her body. She regularly ate a well-balanced diet of lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, all of which provided her with sustained energy throughout the day. Furthermore, Felicia made it a point to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, which ensured that her body was functioning optimally and preventing any symptoms of dehydration that can cause sluggishness. On the other hand, Jessica's dietary choices were less than ideal. She often opted for convenience and ease, frequently consuming processed foods that were high in sugar, fat, and empty calories. These unhealthy choices left Jessica feeling sluggish and lethargic, as the lack of essential nutrients in her diet did not provide her body with the sustained energy it needed to function properly. Moreover, Jessica's sporadic hydration habits left her prone to dehydration, exacerbating her feelings of fatigue and low energy. Felicia's consistent sleep schedule also played a crucial role in her increased energy levels. She made it a point to get seven to eight hours of sleep each night, ensuring that her body had ample time to recover and repair itself after a long day. This regular sleep pattern allowed Felicia to wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, ready to take on the day ahead. Jessica's inconsistent sleep patterns, in contrast, often left her feeling groggy and tired. She would frequently stay up late at night, either working or browsing on her phone, and then struggle to wake up early the next morning. This irregular sleep schedule greatly impacted her energy levels during the day, leaving her feeling drained and fatigued. In conclusion, the difference in energy levels between Felicia and Jessica can be attributed to their lifestyle choices, dietary habits, and sleeping patterns. Felicia's commitment to living a healthy, balanced life allowed her to maintain consistent energy levels and overall wellbeing, while Jessica's less than ideal choices led to feelings of exhaustion and fatigue. By taking the time to prioritize their own health and well-being, individuals like Felicia can significantly improve their quality of life and daily energy levels, ensuring that they are prepared to tackle whatever challenges their day may hold."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

More Women in Latin America Are Seeking Abortion Pills In countries hit hard by the ongoing Zika outbreak, more women are seeking abortion options, a new report shows. Abortion is illegal in many of the Latin American countries where Zika is spreading. But in the new report published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers analyzed data from the nonprofit Women on Web (WoW), an organization that connects women with restricted abortion access to doctors who can provide abortion medication. Researchers looked at the number of women from 19 Latin American countries who contacted WoW to request abortion medications—the pills mifepristone and misoprostol, which are typically in combination—from January 2010 until March 2016. Their goal was to see if the number of requests changed once Zika became an issue and the link between Zika and birth defects like microcephaly emerged. They did see a change. During that time, the researchers found that the orders spiked between 36% to 108%, depending on the country, in countries with ongoing Zika transmission where abortion is illegal, including Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ecuador, Honduras and Venezuela. Small increases in orders were also seen in Argentina and Peru, where abortion is also illegal but where there is not ongoing Zika transmission. While the researchers say they can’t confirm that Zika is definitely the cause of the uptick for the countries, the number of women who said that Zika was the reason they were seeking abortion also increased. Government warnings may also play a role in the rise. Requests for abortion increased significantly in Latin American countries where the governments issued warnings to pregnant women regarding Zika-related complications, though the researchers say that increase could be even larger in reality. “Our approach may underestimate the effect of the advisories on demand for abortion, since many women may have used an unsafe method, accessed misoprostol from local pharmacies or the black market, or visited local underground providers,” the study authors write. “But accurate data on these choices are difficult to obtain.” A large number of pregnant women are infected with Zika worldwide. A report on the situation in Colombia recently revealed that around 12,000 pregnant women have been infected, and well over 200 pregnant women in the U.S. have gotten Zika. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. There is an increasing trend of women in Latin American countries seeking abortion options due to the ongoing Zika outbreak. 2. Abortion is illegal in many Latin American countries, which are also experiencing the spread of Zika. 3. Researchers analyzed data from the nonprofit organization Women on Web (WoW), which connects women with restricted abortion access to doctors providing abortion medication, to determine if there was a link between a rise in abortion requests and the spread of Zika. 4. Orders for abortion medication in countries with ongoing Zika transmission where abortion is illegal saw an increase of 36% to 108%. 5. Government warnings regarding Zika-related complications may have played a role in the increase in abortion requests. 6. The researchers suggest that the actual increase in demand for abortion could be higher than their findings, as accurate data regarding other methods used by women is difficult to obtain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The weathering of rocks and minerals can be mechanical or chemical. Mechanical weathering changes the size of a mineral or rock. Mechanical weathering does not change the chemical composition of that material. Chemical weathering changes the composition of a mineral or rock. Different types of weathering can alter the same material. Soil forms on top of rock. The type of soil that forms depends on the environment of the region. For example, warm and wet climates form different soils than cold and dry climates. A profile through the soil shows different horizons. Topsoil is the most important layer for crops. Water, ice, wind, and gravity create or modify landforms on Earth's surface. These agents can erode or deposit features that indicate their presence. Erosion by water and ice lowered and rounded the Appalachians. These old mountains no longer look like the Himalaya. Someday the Himalaya may look like the Appalachians do now.   Q: What kind of weathering changes the size of a mineral or rock but does not change its chemical composition?   Choices:  - molecular weathering  - chemical reaction  - radiation  - mechanical weathering  A: The answer is:","output":"mechanical weathering. Mechanical weathering is the type of weathering that changes the size of a mineral or rock without altering its chemical composition. This process occurs through various means, such as freeze-thaw cycles, the growth of plant roots, abrasion by water or wind, and thermal expansion and contraction caused by temperature fluctuations. These different mechanisms break down rocks and minerals into smaller fragments, preserving their original chemical makeup.

Article: In general, people talk about two groups of colours warm colours and cool colours. Researchers in psychology think that there are also two groups of people people who prefer warm colours and people who prefer cool colours. The warm colours are red, orange and yellow. Where there are warm colours and a lot of light, people usually want to be active. People think that red, for example, is exciting. Sociable people, those who like to be with others, like red. The cool colours are green, blue and violet. These colours, unlike warm colours , are relaxing. Where there are cool colours, people are usually quiet. People who like to spend time alone often prefer blue. Red may be exciting, but one researcher says that time seems to pass more slowly in a room with warm colours than in a room with cool colours. He suggests that a warm colour, such as red or orange is a good colour for a living room or restaurant. People who are relaxing or eating do not want time to pass quickly. Cool colours are better for offices or factories if the people who are working there want time to pass quickly. Researchers do not know why people think some colours are warm and other colours are cool. However, almost everyone agrees that red, orange, and yellow are warm and that green, blue and violet are cool. Perhaps warm colours remind people of warm days and the cool colours remind them of cool days. Because in the north the sun is higher during summer, the hot summer sunlight appears yellow.

Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - The araB gene promoter is a bacterial promoter, activated by e L-arabinose binding.  - Arachosia is the Hellenized name of an ancient satrapy in the eastern part of the Achaemenid, Seleucid, Parthian, Greco-Bactrian, and Indo-Scythian empires.

Born in Pella in 356 BC, Alexander succeeded his father, Philip II, to the throne at the age of twenty. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders.  - Historical regions (or historical countries) are delimitations of geographic areas for studying and analysing social development of period-specific cultures without any reference to contemporary political, economic or social organisations. The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period.  - Basileus is a Greek term and title that has signified various types of monarchs in history. In the English-speaking world it is perhaps most widely understood to mean \\"king\\" or \\"emperor\\". The best known use of the title is by the Byzantine emperors, but the title also has a longer history of use by sovereigns and other persons of authority in ancient Greece, as well as for the kings of modern Greece.  - The Arabian Sea is a region of the northern Indian Ocean bounded on the north by Pakistan and Iran, on the west by northeastern Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula, and on the east by India.

It is directly to the south of the countries of Bactria , Arachosia and Drangiana , to the east of the country of Carmania and due west of the Indus River which formed a natural boundary between it and Western India . The native name of Gedrosia might have been Gwadar as there are two towns by that name and a bay ( Gwadar Bay ) in central Makran . The Gedrosians are known to have successfully defeated the Indian Mauryans capturing the western-most parts of their state . Following his army 's refusal to continue marching east at the Hyphasis River in 326 BC , Alexander the Great crossed the area after sailing south to the coast of the Indian Ocean on his way back to Babylon . Upon reaching the Ocean , Alexander the Great divided his forces in half , sending half back by sea to Susa under the command of Nearchus . The other half of his army was to accompany him on a march through the Gedrosian desert , inland from the ocean . Throughout the 60 day march through the desert , Alexander lost at least 12,000 soldiers , in addition to countless livestock , camp followers , and most of his baggage train . Some historians say he lost three - quarters of his army to the harsh desert conditions along the way . However , this figure was likely based on exaggerated numbers in his forces prior to the march , which were likely in the range of no fewer than 30,000 soldiers . There are two competing theories for the purpose of Alexander the Great 's decision to march through the desert rather than along the more hospitable coast . The first argues that this was an attempt to punish his men for their refusal to continue eastward at the Hyphasis River . The other argues that Alexander was attempting to imitate and succeed in the...  - Ariana, the Latinized form of the Ancient Greek \\"Ar(e)ian\\" (inhabitants: \\"\\"; \\"Ar(e)ianoi\\"), was a general geographical term used by some Greek and Roman authors of the ancient period for a district of wide extent between Central Asia and the Indus River, comprehending the eastern provinces of the Achaemenid Empire that covered the whole country of modern day Afghanistan, and a few parts of Pakistan, Tajikistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  - Gwadar Bay is located in the Gulf of Oman on the maritime border of Pakistan and Iran.

It rises in the Hazarajat country north-west of Ghazni, and flows south-west falls into the Helmand below Girishk. In its lower course it is much used for irrigation, under the control of the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority, and the valley is cultivated and populous; yet the water is said to be somewhat brackish. It is doubtful whether the ancient Arachotus is to be identified with the Arghandab or with its chief confluent the Tarnak, which joins it on the left out SW of Kandahar. The Tarnak, which flows south of Kandahar, is much shorter (length about 320 km or 200 miles) and less copious. The ruins at Ulan Robat, supposed to represent the city Arachosia, are in its basin; and the lake known as Ab-i-Istada, the most probable representative of Lake Arachotus, is near the head of the Tarnak, though not communicating with it.

It shares borders with the Federally Administered Tribal Areas to the west; GilgitBaltistan to the northeast; Azad Kashmir, Islamabad and Punjab to the east and southeast. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \\"does not\\" share a border with Balochistan, which lies to its southwest. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa also shares an international border with Afghanistan, connected through the Khyber Pass.  - The Strait of Hormuz \\"Tangehyyeh Hormoz\\" , \\"Maq Hurmuz\\") is a strait between the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf.

It is one of the most sparsely populated regions in Jammu and Kashmir and its culture and history are closely related to that of Tibet.  - Balochistan (also Baluchistan, often interpreted as the \\"Land of the Baloch\\") is an arid desert and mountainous region in south-western Asia. It comprises the Pakistani province of Balochistan, the Iranian province of Sistan and Baluchestan, and the southern areas of the Afghan provinces of Nimruz, Helmand, and Kandahar. Balochistan borders the Pashtun region to the north, Sindh to the east, Punjab to the northeast, and Persian regions to the west. Across its southern coastline lies the Persian Gulf.

Suggested answer: A number of Austronesian languages are spoken on the coast and on offshore islands. Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"No, you should not validate the suggested answer, as it does not directly address the question of where the island of New Guinea is located. Instead, a more appropriate and detailed response would be: New Guinea is a large island located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It is the world's second-largest island, covering an area of approximately 785,753 square kilometers (303,381 square miles). It is situated just north of the Australian continent, specifically the Cape York Peninsula, and is separated by the narrow Torres Strait. The island lies between the equator and 10 degrees south latitude and stretches from 130 degrees to 150 degrees east longitude. Administratively, New Guinea is divided into two regions: the western half belongs to Indonesia as the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while the eastern half constitutes the independent country of Papua New Guinea. The island is characterized by its densely forested, mountainous terrain, with the highest peak, Puncak Jaya at 4,884 meters (16,024 feet) above sea level. The island of New Guinea is home to diverse indigenous ethnic and linguistic groups. In fact, it is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse regions in the world. Austronesian languages are indeed spoken on parts of the coast and on offshore islands, as the suggested answer mentions. However, the island is also home to hundreds of other non-Austronesian languages belonging to the Papuan language family, spoken by various indigenous peoples across the island. In summary, an appropriate answer to the question of where the island of New Guinea is located should focus on its position in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, the division between the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua and the nation of Papua New Guinea, as well as its geographical characteristics. While the linguistic diversity of the island is noteworthy, it should not be the primary focus of the answer to this specific question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Atrag atenția asupra ratei mari a abandonului școlar. Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The sentence \\"Atrag atenția asupra ratei mari a abandonului școlar\\" is Romanian. Translated into English, it means \\"I draw attention to the high rate of school dropout\\". The phrase denotes a concern for the significant percentage of students who abandon their education prior to completion. This matter is seen globally and is a focal point for educational institutions, policymakers, and social workers alike as it broadly impacts society.  A high school dropout rate can indicate several potential issues within a society, including deficiencies in the education system, socio-economic problems, such as poverty and unemployment, and personal issues faced by students, including academic difficulty, lack of family support or behavioral problems. Tackling high dropout rates requires a comprehensive approach. This begins with understanding the root causes, which could include factors such as school policies, school climate, academic achievement, socio-economic status, or personal choices. Then, relevant interventions can be designed to address these issues. To outline a few examples, these interventions could entail modifying school policies to make them more supportive of students who are struggling, adjusting the learning environment to make it more inclusive and safe, providing additional academic support to students who are having trouble with their studies, offering financial aid to students from low-income families, or providing counseling to students who may be dealing with personal issues that are affecting their ability to focus on school. A part of the solution would also invlove societal reform such as creating stable jobs, tackling poverty, increasing living standards, and elevating the perceived value of education within the community. The goal would be to construct an environment where dropping out of school is not seen as an acceptable or necessary option.  Data tracking is another important tool that can support addressing the dropout issue. Data can provide insight into dropout patterns (e.g., which grades account for the most dropouts, which types of schools are most susceptible to high dropout rates, etc.) and can help to design interventions that are targeted to specific needs. Innovative teaching methods, early intervention programs, after-school programs, mentorship programs, and positive behavioral intervention strategies are other strategies that have proven effective in combating dropping out. In summary, drawing attention to the high rate of school dropout is an issue of great significance. It is essential to approach these rates not merely as numbers, but as indicative of wider societal issues and a call to action for systemic changes in education, societal support structures, policies, and community values."},{"instruction":"Build a movie plot around this: William points out that the murders are tied to a book written in what language?

Roeland Park officer Zack Stamper says he was just doing his job last week when he gave Samuel Meixueiro a bicycle to ride to and from the man's work as a liquor store cashier. Stamper threw in a duffel bag to replace Meixuero's suitcase, which had a broken zipper. The kindness drew tears from Meixueiro, who says he's been staying in a church while trying to save money for an apartment. Stamper's gesture came after he was dispatched to investigate a report of a suspicious person in a park. That person turned out to be Meixueiro, who explained to Stamper his situation — and the foot-pounding treks to the job Meixueiro said he couldn't afford to lose. So Stamper drove the man to work that day. The officer retrieved a duffel bag from his basement and a bicycle from the department's assortment of surrendered or abandoned ones.

When his young staff experience problems in their personal lives, he routinely reminds them they can seek him out for advice. The film opens with store manager Joe allowing employee Lucas (Rory Cochrane) his first opportunity to close the store, an opportunity Lucas regards as an honour. While counting the day's receipts in Joe's office, Lucas snoops and discovers that Empire Records is about to be bought and converted into a branch of Music Town, a large national music store with many franchises. In an effort to keep the store independent, Lucas takes the day's cash receipts totaling 9,000 to a casino in Atlantic City in an attempt to quadruple it via gambling. Lucas believes this act will create enough money to allow Joe to save Empire Records. Though initially doubling the money, Lucas soon loses the entire amount in one bet on a dice table.

Movie title: The Tingler Movie plot: A pathologist, Dr. Warren Chapin (Price), discovers that the tingling of the spine in states of extreme fear is due to the growth of a creature that every human being seems to have, called a \\"Tingler\\", a parasite attached to the human spine. It curls up, feeds and grows stronger when its host is afraid, effectively crushing the person's spine if curled up long enough. The host can weaken the creature and stop its curling by screaming. Movie theater owner Oliver Higgins (Coolidge), who shows exclusively silent films, is an acquaintance of Dr. Chapin. Higgins's wife Martha (Evelyn), who is deaf and mute, dies of fright after weird, apparently supernatural events have occurred in her room. During her autopsy, Chapin removes the Tingler from her spine. After they have contained the Tingler and return to Higgins' house, it is revealed that Higgins is the murderer; he frightened his wife to death knowing that she could not scream because she was mute. The centipede-like creature eventually breaks free from the container that held it in and is released into the theater where the deaf mute woman ran before she died. Chapin wishes not to tell anyone, knowing it would start a panic. The Tingler latches onto a woman's leg, and she screams until it releases its grip.

In Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.). This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The event with a long history in reference to the timing you mentioned is the celebration of Carnival, also known as Fastelavn, Shrove Tuesday, and Maslenitsa. These festivities have been held in various countries and regions around the world, with their origins and practices often connected to the religious and cultural backgrounds of the local people. Carnival is a period of festivities that precedes the Christian liturgical season of Lent, a time of fasting and penitence in preparation for Easter. Throughout history, it has been celebrated in regions with strong Roman Catholic connections, such as Latin America, Europe, and some parts of the United States. The Carnival season typically involves public celebrations, masquerade balls, parades, and other lively events, often characterized by indulgence in food, drink, and merrymaking before the more austere time of Lent. In countries with a predominantly Lutheran Church, such as Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, the celebration goes by the name Fastelavn. It usually involves children dressing up in costumes, participating in community events, and enjoying traditional treats. Similarly, in areas with Anglican and Methodist congregations, pre-Lenten celebrations take place on Shrove Tuesday, also known as Pancake Day, Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday. These events often involve the consumption of rich and indulgent foods, most notably pancakes, before the fasting period begins. The Eastern Orthodox Church also has a unique way of observing the pre-Lenten period through the celebration of Maslenitsa, also called Butter Week, Pancake Week, or Cheesefare Week. This is the last week before the start of Great Lent, and it is marked by feasting on pancakes, bliny, or crepes, which symbolize the sun and the coming of the warmer spring months. These celebrations often involve family gatherings, public events, and farewell parties for the beloved. In German-speaking countries and the Netherlands, the Carnival season has a unique opening date: the 11th of November, precisely at 11:11 a.m. The tradition of celebrating at this time can be traced back to Advent celebrations or to harvest festivities associated with St. Martin's Day. In conclusion, the event with a long and varied history of celebration is the Carnival season, with its diverse names and customs across different cultures and religious traditions. The core theme of these festivities is the indulgence and enjoyment of life before the subsequent period of fasting and penitence during Lent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The combined coefficient is the sum of -21550 and 21587: -21550 + 21587 = 37 So now the equation is: 518 = 37 * w Step3: Isolate the variable w by dividing both sides of the equation by 37. 518 / 37 = 37 * w / 37 Step 4: Calculate the value of w. 518 / 37 = 14 So w = 14.

Choices:  - call the police - doing drugs - new contacts - making new friends - plan  The rationale to choose \\"doing drugs\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the question and the given choices The question asks about the likely activities to occur at a party in an alley. We have to choose one of the following choices: calling the police, doing drugs, making new contacts, making new friends, or planning something. Step 2: Assess the context Alley parties are not typically conventional party locations and may be associated with some form of underground or illicit activities. It's important to consider the context and setting while exploring the possible answer. Step 3: Evaluate each choice - Calling the police: While it may be possible for someone to call the police due to potential illegal activities, it is unlikely to be the most common event that occurs at an alley party, as people attending would most likely be aware of the potential risks involved. - Doing drugs: Alley parties, due to their unconventional nature, may attract individuals engaged in illegal activities such as drug use or distribution. - Making new contacts: While attendees may meet new people at the party, this option isn't as specific as others to the context of an alley party. - Making new friends: Similar to making new contacts, making new friends is a possibility at any party but doesn't carry unique significance given the scenario. - Planning something: It is difficult to determine the specificity of \\"planning something\\" as it pertains to the alley party, so we cannot conclude that this is the most likely outcome. Step 4: Choose the most likely option Based on the context of an alley party, which implies a potentially unconventional or underground gathering, the most likely activity to occur at the party is \\"doing drugs.\\" This is because the underground nature of such an event could attract individuals who are more prone to engage in illicit activities like drug use or distribution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

All the Korean ambassadors have died, leaving the inexperienced general to take charge. The soldiers arm themselves and quickly discover that the Mongols have kidnapped the Ming Emperor's daughter. They ambush the Mongols and rescue the princess. Yeo-sol, the former slave of an ambassador, defeats the injured Mongolian general Rambulwha in single combat, but allows him to live and escape.The Koreans flee with the Princess, determined to return her safely to the Ming Emperor to atone for their diplomatic failure. The Mongols pursue, hoping to recover the Princess and marry her to the Yuan Emperor so that he may legitimize his claim over all China. Koreans head for a seaside fortress that the Princess tells them about, where they expect to find safe haven. Along the way, the Koreans pick up a group of Chinese peasants who are also fleeing from the Mongols.Fighting their way through Mongol search parties, the group experiences many internal conflicts stemming from social class, love, and honor. The lower-class soldiers chafe under their poor treatment in comparison to the soldiers of the upper-class.

Write an article based on this \\"A survey by BBC Radio 5 live has suggested a large majority (83%) of women think that men and women are not always equal in the workplace.\\"","output":"Title: The Workplace Equality Gap: Are Men and Women Always Treated Equally? Introduction A recent survey conducted by BBC Radio 5 Live has reignited discussions about the continuing disparity in the workplace for men and women. The survey found that a staggering 83% of women believe that men and women are not always treated equally in their work environment. This article aims to delve deeper into the issue of workplace equality and investigate the possible reasons, consequences, and potential ways to close the gap. Step 1: Examining the reasons for workplace inequality The existence of workplace inequality can be attributed to various factors, ranging from cultural and social norms to organizational policies and individual biases. Let's examine a few common reasons that underlie the unequal treatment of men and women at work: 1. Stereotyping and unconscious bias: Preconceived notions of gender roles can influence hiring practices, promotion decisions, and task allocation, leading to unequal opportunities for women in the workplace. 2. Pay gap: Women continue to face discrepancies in their pay compared to their male counterparts, earning on average 80 cents on the dollar compared to men, according to recent data from the Institute for Women's Policy Research. 3. Glass ceiling: The difficulty faced by women in breaking through the upper echelons of leadership can further exacerbate workplace inequality. Step 2: Consequences of workplace inequality The unequal treatment of men and women in the workplace has repercussions not just for the employees themselves but also for companies and society as a whole. Some potential consequences of workplace inequality include: 1. Retention issues: Unequal treatment can lead to increased attrition rates, as women may not feel valued and well-supported in their roles, resulting in higher turnover costs for businesses. 2. Lower morale and productivity: A lack of fairness in the workplace can lead to poor employee morale and can negatively impact the overall productivity of the company. 3. Missed opportunities for innovation and growth: A diverse workforce promotes creativity and innovation, and companies that do not foster an equitable environment may miss out on the unique perspectives and contributions that women bring to the decision-making table. Step 3: Implementing solutions to promote workplace equality To address the issue of workplace inequality, there is a need for concerted efforts by both employers and employees to bring about change. Here are a few steps that can be taken to promote a more equitable work environment: 1. Education and awareness: Encourage conversations about workplace equality, provide training on recognizing unconscious biases, and foster an environment in which employees feel comfortable discussing their concerns. 2. Transparent hiring and promotion practices: Implementing an unbiased recruitment process that emphasizes objective performance criteria, rather than personal characteristics, can mitigate gender gaps in hiring, pay, and promotions. 3. Flexible work policies: Adopting family-friendly policies, such as providing robust maternity leave options and flexible working arrangements, can enable women who have taken time off for family reasons to return to the workforce and continue to progress in their careers. 4. Mentorship and leadership development programs: Encourage the development of women by providing mentorship opportunities and supporting leadership development programs that are specifically tailored to women. Conclusion It is clear that workplace inequality remains a significant challenge, given the large percentage of women who believe that men and women are not always treated equally at work. To close the equality gap, employers and employees must actively strive to foster a culture in which women's contributions are recognized and rewarded equally to those of their male counterparts. By doing so, companies can not only create a fairer environment for all employees but also benefit from the increased diversity within the organization, thereby paving the way for more innovative and successful businesses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At times last week it seemed some were ready to award Chelsea the Premier League title on the back on a 3-1 win at Burnley. And though in the end they did re-discover some of that momentum on Saturday, the over-riding lesson of their victory over Leicester was the stark reminder that Chelsea’s season will be a degree tougher in the long run and that they still struggle against well-organised teams. True, they won comfortably enough in the end with goals from Diego Costa and Eden Hazard. And they could even afford a carnival moment towards the end, with Didier Drogba coming on, a hero returning to his natural home, on 79 minutes. Joy: Diego Costa runs off in celebration after breaking the deadlock for Chelsea against OPTIONS: - Blues on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Burnley on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Chelsea on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - David Nugent on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Didier Drogba on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Diego Costa on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Eden Hazard on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Goalscorer Costa on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Jose Mourinho on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Leicester on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Leicester City on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Nigel Pearson on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Premier League on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Thibaut Courtois on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win","output":"Based on the context provided in the paragraph, the sentence is likely to end as: \\"Joy: Diego Costa runs off in celebration after breaking the deadlock for Chelsea against Chelsea on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win.\\" The main focus of the paragraph is Chelsea's performance in the Premier League, and in particular, the contribution of Diego Costa in their victory over Burnley. The sentence preceding the incomplete one talks about Costa's role, so it would make sense for him to be the subject of the celebratory moment described. The mention of his 'home Premier League debut' and the '2-0 win' are cues that suggest this option. Other options mentioning different individuals or teams, don't align well with the paragraph's discussion about Diego Costa's instrumental role in Chelsea's performance. However, alternatively, the correct context could be:  \\"Joy: Diego Costa runs off in celebration after breaking the deadlock for Chelsea against Leicester on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win.\\" The mention of Chelsea's victory over Leicester in the paragraph could be closely associated with Diego Costa's celebration, as he was one of the main contributors with his goal in the match. These key points in the context of the paragraph make the option a possible fit to complete the sentence. So, considering the direction of the narrative, either of these options could plausibly complete the sentence depending on the exact match and moment being referred to. It would be more concrete if the exact match in which Diego Costa broke the deadlock on his home Premier League debut was explicitly mentioned."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The observation might help explain how all whales hear. The work might also help scientists understand how animals are affected by underwater sonar  . This sonar, used by some ships, sends out sound waves to locate underwater objects.  The Cuvier's beaked whale is a so-called toothed whale. Toothed whales dive deep into the ocean in search of food. As the whales hunt, they produce sounds that reach objects and then return to the whales. This allows the animals to \\"see\\" the shape, size, and location of objects, even when they're 1,000 meters under the sea, where it is totally dark.  To better understand how the whale hears, researchers from San Diego State University in California took X-rays of two Cuvier's beaked whales. The whales had died and washed up on the beach.  Ted Cranford and his colleagues used the images to make a computer model of a Cuvier's beaked whale's head. Then, they modeled the process of sound traveling through the head.  The researchers knew that some sounds get to the ears of a toothed whale through a structure called \\"the window for sound\\". Found on the lower jaw, this structure is very thin on the outside and has a large pad   of fat on the inside.  When the researchers used their computer model to work out how sound waves travel in the whale's head, they were surprised to find that sounds coming from right in front of the whale actually travel under the animal's jaw. From there, sound waves move through the throat, into a hole in the back of the jaw, and finally to the pad of fat near the animal's ears.  Cranford guesses that other types of whales may hear through their throats. Further testing is needed to be sure. Eventually, the insight into how whales hear might explain whether sonar testing by military ships is causing the animals to wind up on beaches.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the person that conducted the Tchaikovsky symphony? , can you please find it?   Between the first and second season of promenade concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera Shamus O'Brien at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, \\"I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday\\". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, \\"Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?\\"In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior. Jacobs describes it as \\"a marriage of perfect professional and private harmony\\". As a singer, with Wood as her accompanist, she won praise from the critics.

Let's analyze both sentences in more detail to understand the logical connection. In the first sentence, \\"However, it began life with a totally different purpose.\\", the statement informs that an object, idea, or concept began or was created with an entirely different purpose or intention than the one it is currently associated with or known for. This suggests that there has been at least one alteration or shift in its purpose throughout its existence. The second sentence, \\"It changed purposes throughout its life.\\", further emphasizes that the object, idea, or concept experienced changes in its purposes or functions during its existence or time in use. Essentially, this sentence reinforces the idea that the original purpose was altered or evolved in some way, which had already been implied by the first sentence. In conclusion, when the first sentence is true, which states that something began its life with an entirely different purpose, it implies the occurrence of a change in its purpose.

Article: You may notice that the other person always has to decide when you do something together and what you do. If they are a commitment phobe, this may be because they want to see you when they want to see you and don’t want to commit to taking time out of their schedule otherwise. If you make plans, they may cancel, be late, or not show at all. The more time you spend with someone, the more serious the relationship starts to become. If you are with a commitment phobe, when things start to get more serious, they may distance themselves or break it off completely.  Commitment phobes love the excitement of starting to date and then the passion at the beginning of a relationship. After that is over, they lose interest. Commitment phobes only show interest when things are exciting, romantic, or fun. If you try to come to them with problems, they are not interested or understanding. People who are commitment phobic tend to have many short relationships. Casually ask about their relationships. If they divert the topic away, or they have only had short casual flings, the person may be a commitment phobe.  Some people have limited dating experience. This does not mean they are a commitment phobe. There are many factors that lead to someone not dating often. Some commitment phobes have been in long relationships. These usually end with no visible signs of commitment. If you are involved with a commitment phobe, you may have no clue what your relationship actually is. You don’t know if you’re dating, if you’re a couple, or something more. You probably haven’t talked about your relationship or the future. If you bring up what your relationship is, they change the subject, get defensive, or wonder why you want to label what you have. Commitment phobic people have trouble labeling the relationship or their feelings. They may feel uncomfortable with those words because they are too confining or they point to a commitment. If you say the words, they may be uncomfortable or try to explain away why they won’t say the same thing.  For example, these people won’t use terms like girlfriend or boyfriend. They also won’t say that they love you. Try calling the other person your \\"boyfriend\\" or \\"girlfriend\\" or say, \\"I love you.\\" See how they react. However, only do this if you really feel this way about the person. Don’t say “I love you” or put a label on your relationship as a test. People who are commitment phobic may respond in a more sexual way than an emotional way. They are interested in passion and equate intimacy with sex, but not the connection and emotions that can accompany sex. Think about if they only want to be around if you’re going to be sexual. If you want to go out, do something with friends, or mention you’re not interested in having sex on this date, they may not be interested.

Many studies on happiness give negative answers. Here are some points in being happy. Basic Human Needs Must Be Met People whose basic needs for shelter, clothing and food are not met will find it very difficult to feel happy. Of course, there are exceptions, but for most of us, we can only be happy once our basic needs are met. The Joneses Cannot Be Escaped People's happiness is not determined by how much they have, but by how much people around them have. So, we tend to feel happy once our basic needs are met and we have more than the people surrounding us. This means that while keeping up with _ could be destructive if we let it go too far. It is also part of humana nature to want to feel at least on the same level, financially, as those surrounding us. You Should Escape The Rat Race We should know the importance of staying out of the rat race. So yes, you need to work hard, get the education you need to land a good job and work long enough and hard enough to get to a place where you can easily meet your basic needs. What are basic needs? For most middle or upper middle class Americans, basic needs are not very basic anymore. For most of us, once our basic needs have been met, happiness is achieved when we engage in activities we like, spend time with friends and family and stay active. Making money for the sake of making money does not make people happy. Ideally, these questions should be answered when you're still young and just starting out.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who left the atelier after a week? , can you please find it?   Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that \\"I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy\\" and complaining of \\"the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth\\" which he considered \\"such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it\\". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student. Etty was disqualified from the competition, but the high quality of his...

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Hippos have always attracted people's interest. Modern hippos in Walt Disney movies can dance lightly. A stone hippo in a 13th-century church in France has wings. And in ancient Egyptian fairy tales, the hippo was a goddess that guided the dead to the afterworld. Despite their popular appeal, hippos, as well as other animals, have difficulty when their needs conflict with those of humans. The early Egyptians liked to hunt hippos for their teeth and because they were dangerous animals. Amulets to protect babies from demons were made from hippo bones. About 4,000 years ago, there were so many hippos in Egypt that they caused serious crop damage. Egyptian farmers killed them routinely, and by the beginning of the 19th century, all the hippos in Africa had been killed. People used to see hippos fight in the arenas of ancient Rome. After the fall of the Roman Empire, hippos weren't seen in Europe again until a few zoos began to exhibit them in the mid 1800s. All the various uses and abuses of hippos through the centuries have made their population fall greatly. Where they do occur, mostly in national parks, they live in such high density that they make the grasslands bare. This causes other grass-eating animals to go farther for food, and hippos, which can't live far from water, destroy their own feeding grounds. Question: Apart from protecting crops, what's the main reason for people to kill hippos? - To save other animals. - To satisfy personal demands. - To look for guidance after death. - To follow the routine established by the Egyptians. Answer:","output":"The main reason people killed hippos, apart from protecting crops, was to satisfy personal demands. According to the article, the early Egyptians hunted hippos for their teeth and because they were considered dangerous animals. Also, hippo bones were used to make amulets to protect babies from demons. Therefore, their killing was not primarily for ecological reasons such as saving other animals, but rather to fulfill human wants and fears."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise \\"He was ageless, neither young nor old\\" describes a situation where the age of the person cannot be determined or simply does not apply. The term 'ageless' implies that the individual does not exhibit characteristics or features that can be associated with any specific age group, be it young, middle-aged, or old. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"He was 15 years old\\" asserts that the individual in question is indeed 15 years of age, which places them in the category of being young. As a result, the hypothesis clearly contradicts the premise, as it attempts to assign a specific age to a supposedly ageless person. To further analyze the compatibility between the premise and the hypothesis, let us consider the definition of entailment. In logic, one statement entails another statement if the truth of the first statement (the premise) guarantees the truth of the second statement (the hypothesis). In other words, if the premise is true, the hypothesis must be true as well, and if the premise is false, the entailment does not hold. In this particular case, the premise \\"He was ageless, neither young nor old\\" cannot guarantee the truth of the hypothesis \\"He was 15 years old.\\" In fact, the premise negates the hypothesis, as an ageless individual cannot be assigned a specific age, let alone be categorized as young or old. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. To conclude, the premise \\"He was ageless, neither young nor old\\" does not entail the hypothesis \\"He was 15 years old.\\" The two statements are incompatible, as the premise suggests the absence of a specific age while the hypothesis attempts to assign the individual a precise age and place them within a particular age group."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible A: carton, light fire, burn down forest, ashtray, hand  Why is \\"carton\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Carton\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it refers to the packaging in which cigarettes are stored. Cartons are specifically designed to protect the cigarettes from damage, moisture and external contaminants to an extent, and maintain their freshness for a period of time. Human common sense is a set of knowledge and understanding that is shared and understood by most people. This common sense allows humans to appropriately interpret information, make reasonable decisions and choose suitable actions based on the context. In the context of the given question, human common sense would eliminate the other options because they do not effectively address the aspect of keeping a cigarette fresh. Let us analyze the alternative answers and their relation to human common sense: 1. Light fire: Lighting a fire is not relevant to keeping a cigarette fresh. In fact, it is the opposite action, as lighting a cigarette consumes it. Human common sense would eliminate this option due to its irrelevance to preserving freshness. 2. Burn down forest: This answer is not only unrelated to the given question but is also an extreme, destructive and dangerous option. Human common sense would strongly disapprove of this option, as it does not address the topic of keeping a cigarette fresh and runs counter to responsible behavior, environmental protection, and human safety. 3. Ashtray: An ashtray is typically employed to collect ashes and cigarette butts after the cigarettes have been smoked and hence lost their freshness. Therefore, it is not associated with keeping cigarettes fresh and would be discarded by human common sense. 4. Hand: While a person's hand might be used to hold an individual cigarette, it is not a practical or effective solution for keeping cigarettes fresh. Human hands cannot provide an adequate seal to protect them from moisture, contaminants, or damage, and therefore, this option would also be rejected by human common sense. In conclusion, \\"carton\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense as it effectively preserves the freshness of cigarettes by providing an appropriate storage environment and protection. The other options either do not contribute to maintaining freshness or represent undesirable and unrelated actions that contradict the principles of human common sense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In Spring 1922, Poeymirau and Freydenberg launched attacks into the headwaters of the Moulouya in the western Middle Atlas and managed to defeat Said, the last surviving member of the Berber triumvirate, at  El Ksiba in April 1922.  Said was forced to flee, with much of the Aït Ichkern tribe, to the highest mountains of the Middle Atlas and then into the High Atlas.  Lyautey then secured the submission of several more tribes, constructed new military posts and improved his supply roads; by June 1922, he had brought the entire Moulouya Valley under control and pacified much of the Middle Atlas.  Limited in numbers by rapid post-war demobilisation and commitments to garrisons in Germany, he determined not to march through the difficult terrain of the High Atlas but to wait for the tribes to tire of the guerrilla war and submit.  Said never did so, dying in action against a groupe mobile in March 1924, though his followers continued to cause problems for the French into the next decade.  Pacification of the remaining tribal areas in French Morocco was completed in 1934, though small armed gangs of bandits continued to attack French troops in the mountains until 1936.  Moroccan opposition to French rule continued, a plan for reform and return to indirect rule was published by the nationalist Comité d'Action Marocaine  in 1934, with significant riots and demonstrations occurring in 1934, 1937, 1944 and 1951.  France, having failed to quell the nationalists by deposing the popular Sultan Mohammed V and already fighting a bloody war of independence in Algeria, recognised Moroccan independence in 1956. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many years after Said was defeated at ElKsiba did he die?","output":"Said was defeated at El Ksiba in April 1922 and he died in action in March 1924.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Washington: NASA has announced evidence that Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, has a saltwater ocean under its icy surface. The ocean seems to have more water than all the water on Earth's surface, according to new Hubble observation. New Hubble observations of Ganymede's magnetic field strongly suggest that the moon, which is the largest in our whole solar system, is home to a subsurface ocean. Scientists estimate the ocean is 95 kilometres thick, which is about 10 times deeper than Earth's oceans. But unlike our salty waters, Ganymede's ocean is buried under 150 kilometres of ice. While scientists have speculated  since 1970s about the presence of an ocean on Ganymede------the largest moon in our solar system------ until now the only observational evidence came from a brief flyby by the Galileo spacecraft, which didn't observe the moon long enough to confirm a liquid ocean. This discovery marks an important milestone, highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish. In its 25 years in orbit, Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy surface of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth. Scientists have already confirmed the existence of an ocean on Europa, another moon orbiting Jupiter, and NASA has announced plans to send an unmanned mission there searching for the life that might come with liquid water. Hubble is a telescope that orbits Earth, but because of its impressive gravitational analyses it can be used to study the inside of far distant planets. Using these same principles, scientists could theoretically detect oceans on distant planets as well.

To do this, we subtract 49 * v from both sides of the equation. 59 * v - 49 * v = 49 * v - 49 * v + 30 Step 3: Simplify the equation On the left-hand side of the equation, we have the subtraction of two terms with the same variable.  (59 - 49) * v = 10 * v So the equation is simplified to: 10 * v = 30 Step 4: Solve for 'v' Now that we have only one 'v' term in the equation and it's properly isolated, we can solve for 'v' by dividing both sides of the equation by 10.

Answer:","output":"The story of someone kissing a frog and it turning into a prince is a widely known fairy tale called \\"The Frog Prince\\" or \\"The Frog King.\\" The narrative features a princess who kisses a frog, which then transforms into a handsome prince. This tale has been popularized and adapted in various forms of literature, stage performances, and film productions throughout history. The origins of \\"The Frog Prince\\" can be traced back to European folklore, with the first known written version coming from the Brothers Grimm in their 1812 compilation, \\"Grimm's Fairy Tales.\\" The story goes as follows: In a faraway kingdom, there lived a beautiful, yet spoiled princess. She was very fond of playing with a golden ball, one of her most prized possessions. One day, while playing near a pond in the forest, the princess accidentally dropped her golden ball into the water. Distressed about losing her beloved toy, she started to cry. At that moment, a frog appeared and offered to retrieve the ball from the pond in exchange for a promise: that the princess would befriend him, allowing the frog to eat from her plate, drink from her cup, and sleep on her pillow. Desperate to recover her ball, the princess agreed to the frog's terms without any intention of fulfilling her promise. But as soon as her ball was returned, she left and forgot about the frog. From that moment on, the frog waited patiently near the castle. Later, during a royal banquet, the frog appeared, reminding the princess of her promise. Seeing that everything was unfolding in front of her guests, the king insisted that she fulfill her agreement. Forced by her father, the princess begrudgingly let the frog eat from her plate, drink from her cup, and led him to her room. When the time came for the frog to sleep on her pillow, the princess became frustrated and threw the frog against the wall in anger. Instead of being killed, the frog was magically transformed into a handsome prince. The prince then revealed that he had been cursed by a wicked witch and could only be released by a princess’s actions. In some versions of the story, the transformation occurs when the princess kisses the frog. In any case, the princess and the prince eventually fall in love, and they live happily ever after. The tale of \\"The Frog Prince\\" has undergone numerous adaptations in literature and other media forms, often carrying the moral lesson of keeping one’s word and looking beyond appearances in relationships. The story has also been analyzed and interpreted in various ways, as an allegory of chivalric romance or personal transformation and redemption. Whichever way one chooses to read it, \\"The Frog Prince\\" remains a classic fairy tale that has fascinated and entertained people for centuries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It includes essential information such as the date of the transaction, the products or services sold, the quantities and prices, the taxes charged, and the payment terms. In case of disputes or discrepancies, these invoices can be valuable evidence to resolve conflicts or confirm compliance with business regulations. 2. Financial record keeping: Sales invoices play a vital role in maintaining accurate financial records. Businesses routinely use sales invoices to record the sale of goods or services in their accounting system, ensuring they have information on incoming revenue and outstanding payments. These records form the basis of a company's financial statements, such as profit and loss statements, balance sheets, and cash flow analysis. 3. Tracking payments and managing cash flow: Sales invoices help businesses monitor outstanding payments from clients and keep track of when those payments are due. Properly documenting and organizing invoices enable businesses to manage cash flow effectively, ensuring that they have sufficient funds to cover expenses and invest in growth. 4. Tax obligations and reporting: Accurate invoicing is crucial for complying with tax regulations and reporting obligations. Sales invoices contain essential information on the taxes charged, such as VAT or GST, and provide businesses with the necessary data to file their tax returns and avoid penalties for non-compliance. 5. Customer relations: Providing customers with well-prepared, clear, and detailed invoices fosters a positive relationship between a business and its clientele. Sales invoices help clients understand the products and services they purchased, the associated costs, and payment terms. In addition, invoices create transparency and trust between both parties, essential for a successful long-term business relationship. In conclusion, sales invoices serve multiple purposes, from being legal proof of a sale to maintaining financial records and managing tax obligations. From the customer's perspective, this document is called a purchase invoice, as it provides them with a record of their purchase transactions with the seller. A sales invoice is indispensable for the smooth operation of any business, ensuring transparency and accuracy in financial dealings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That's the finding of an extensive study of Dutch men in which deaths from heart disease were more than 50 percent lower among those who consumed  at least an ounce of salt water fish per day than those who never ate fish. The Dutch research is one of three human studies that give strong scientific backing to the long-held belief that eating fish can provide health benefits, particularly to the heart. Heart disease is the number-one killer in the United States , with more than 550, 000 deaths occurring from heart attacks each year . But researchers previously have noticed that the incidence  of heart disease is lower in cultures that consume more fish than Americans do. There are fewer heart disease deaths, for example, among the Eskimos of Greenland, who consume about 14 ounces of fish a day, and among the Japanese, whose daily fish consumption averages more than 3 ounces. During the next two decades, 78 of the men died from heart disease. The fewest deaths were among the group who regularly ate fish, even at levels far lower than those of the Japanese or Eskimos. This relationship was true regardless of other factors such as age , high blood pressure , or blood cholesterol   levels . Question: How many lives could probably be saved each year in the United States by eating fish according to the Dutch study? Answer: Pick from: A). 550, 000.; B). 110,000.; C). 275,000.; D). 852.; A:","output":"To answer this question, let's first look at the key points mentioned in the article.  1. Deaths from heart disease were more than 50% lower among those who consumed at least an ounce of saltwater fish per day. 2. Heart disease is the number-one killer in the United States, with more than 550,000 deaths occurring from heart attacks each year. Now, let's calculate how many lives could potentially be saved each year in the United States by eating fish according to the Dutch study. Since the study shows that deaths from heart disease were more than 50% lower among those who consumed fish, we can estimate the number of lives that could be saved. Lives potentially saved = Total number of heart disease deaths per year * Reduction in deaths due to fish consumption Lives potentially saved = 550,000 * 50% Therefore, the answer is: C). 275,000."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He promises the public a 3-day workweek with 8 days pay and other ludicrous things, and looks like a shoe-in. But for years he's kept a diary in which he's recorded all sorts of crooked deals and scandalous stuff, and the night before the convention it gets stolen. When it's published, half of Washington is seen leaving for places unknown. The political satire is pretty well laid on here (it should have even been stronger), and why it's not shown more on TV is hard to figure. It's not at all a bitter brand of satire either, which is an indication of the innocence of the times (in terms of what was revealed about politicians, not that politicians were more innocent).

Answer:","output":"The given product review for \\"For Flation\\" seems to be a mix of both positive and negative remarks, although it leans more towards the positive side. The title \\"For Flation\\" is not directly commented on, so it's difficult to determine if the reviewer views it negatively or positively. However, the review praises certain aspects of the film, such as the political satire, stating that it is \\"pretty well laid on.\\" The reviewer also mentions that the film is not bitter in its satirical approach, which they believe is indicative of the time period. Additionally, the direction of George S. Kaufman is mentioned, although the reviewer does not explicitly state whether his direction is a strong or weak point for the film. On the other hand, the review does express confusion and frustration regarding why the film is not shown more frequently on TV. The reviewer also claims that the political satire could have been even stronger, suggesting that it may not be as powerful or impactful as they would have preferred.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: In which of the six main climatic zones of the country that is predominantly temperate is precipitation very heavy? , can you please find it?   The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers.

But I think it is certain that most of the early Christians understood these words of our Lord's ascension and coming again in glory.  They believed that He was coming again in a very little while during their own life-time, in a few months or years, to make an end of the world and to judge the quick and the dead.  And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them.  Christ seemed to have left the world.  The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while.  Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory.  And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church.  Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days.  And they did fast, and weep, and lament; and their religion became a very sad and melancholy one--most sad in those who were most holy, and loved their Lord best, and longed most for His coming in glory.  Question: \\"Did Christ seem to leave the world?\\" Response: \\"No\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question based on the information provided in the text.

It explores genres similar to Jackson's previous album, Off the Wall (1979), including pop, post-disco, rock and funk. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, with a production budget of 750,000. In just over a year, Thriller became the world's best-selling album, having sold an estimated 66 million copies. It is the second-best-selling album in the United States, behind the Eagles' album Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975), and was the first to reach 30x platinum, with 33 million shipped album-equivalent units certified in the US.

Pick your answer from: (i) World. (ii) Sports. (iii) Business. (iv) Science/Tech.","output":"This topic mainly falls under the category of (iv) Science/Tech. The information discussed involves Microsoft's Sender ID framework, which is a technology concept designed to combat spam emails. Spam emails have been a significant issue in the digital world, causing various security concerns, identity thefts, and inconvenience to the recipients. As a leading technology company, Microsoft has been working on different solutions to handle spam emails, such as developing the Sender ID framework. Sender ID is an email authentication method that aims to verify an email sender's authenticity, ensuring that the email comes from a legitimate source. This technology helps protect users from phishing attacks and other malicious activities that could involve spam emails. Microsoft, being one of the pioneers in tech innovation, has been attempting to make its Sender ID framework a standard solution for spam problems around the world by promoting its adoption globally. However, it is mentioned in the text that the company has encountered some failure in implementing Sender ID as a widespread solution. This is particularly relevant to the Science/Tech category because it demonstrates the ongoing challenges within the technology industry, specifically dealing with internet security concerns like spam. Additionally, the text refers to Microsoft filing over 100 lawsuits against spammers, which is another aspect of combating spam emails from a legal perspective.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: There are three audience levels you need to concern yourself with here:  The interviewer: Usually, a specific journalist will be assigned to your interview. Make sure you know who will be conducting the interview and read his or her past pieces to find out what that interviewer's slant or focus generally is. The media outlet: The tone of an interview usually varies depending on the medium used to deliver it. A blog is one of the most casual, followed by phone interviews, newspaper interviews, and radio interviews. Professional journal interviews and broadcast television interviews tend to be the most formal. The primary audience: The company the reporter works for will have a specific audience. A local news or radio station will ask questions that will concern local viewers, while a national station will ask questions that pertain to a wider audience. A specialized source, like a blog or journal, will focus on issues that affect their readership. If the interview is scheduled in advance, gather all possible information about it as you set up the time and date. Find out what material the interviewer plans on asking about as well as the expected length of the interview. Depending on the content of the interview, the journalist may even be willing to provide you with a list of questions he or she plans to ask. The list may not be comprehensive, but it could at least give you a place to start. If there is information you cannot disclose about a given topic, make sure the reporter knows this ahead of time. He or she may still try to ask about it anyway, but if you firmly explain that you will not answer those questions before the interview, the reporter is less likely to push you for an answer. Since press interviews can be about nearly any topic, it is impossible to generalize about the questions you will be asked during the interview. If the reporter does not provide you with a list in advance, prepare yourself by noting the most important aspects of whatever the subject matter is. Anticipate what others might be curious about and prepare your answers based on that. Conducting a mock interview is often a good way to calm your anxieties about the real interview.  Set aside time in advance for a test run. Ask a trusted associate to practice interviewing with you. Have the associate ask questions you have been informed about or ones that you anticipate and deliver your answers as though you were conducting the actual interview. You can wear anything you want during a phone or email interview, of course, but if you are meeting with the reporter in person, you should wear clean clothes that are suited to your position. This is true regardless of whether you will appear in photographs or video.","output":"The article essentially provides crucial advice on effectively preparing for media interviews. It presents a comprehensive guide emphasizing the significance of understanding the target audience, categorized into three critical sectors: the interviewer, the media outlet, and the primary audience. The author strongly suggests researching the interviewer and their narrative styles, understanding the tone of different mediums – namely, blogs, phone, newspaper, radio, professional journal, and broadcast television interviews – and adjusting one's approach accordingly. Additionally, catering to the company or platform's specific audience, be it local, national, or specialized, is advised.  The author also underlines the importance of proactive preparation, including acquiring information about the interview's format, content, and length, and potentially even securing the interview questions in advance, if possible. If there are any topics that the interviewee can't discuss, this needs to be communicated to the reporter in advance to avoid awkward situations during the interview.  As the nature of questions can vary based on the topic of the interview, the author recommends preparing based on the subject's key aspects and what the public might be curious about. A recommended strategy for allaying anxieties about the actual interview is conducting a mock interview with a trusted associate. This practice interview should emulate all aspects of the actual interview, with the associate asking both known and anticipated questions. Finally, the article serves as a reminder that physical appearance plays a role in face-to-face interviews, regardless of whether photographs or video will be involved. Presenting oneself in clean, position-appropriate attire is strongly advised to create a positive impression. While the attire does not matter in a phone or email interview, it can contribute significantly to the overall impression made during in-person meetings. Thus, the article essentially emphasizes that thorough preparation, understanding the intended audience, and presenting oneself suitably can significantly enhance the effectiveness of media interviews."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They include new entrants Belgium, Denmark and Britain, which will all send fighter jets to Iraq to assist that nation's government and the United States in the anti-ISIS military campaign. Even the foreign minister of Russia -- which has butted heads repeatedly with Washington, including over whether the President of neighboring war-torn Syria needs to go -- signaled Friday his country is ready to back Iraq in fighting terrorists, \\"above all the Islamic State,\\" which is what ISIS calls itself. Still, even as more countries agree to take part in airstrikes and helping","output":"train ground forces, some critics argue that the coalition lacks unity and a clear strategy. While ISIS continues to gain ground and propagate violence, there are concerns about the effectiveness of the combined efforts. The issue is further complicated by the ongoing civil war in Syria and the political turmoil in Iraq. Despite these difficulties, proponents believe that the continued expansion of the coalition signifies a global recognition of the threat posed by ISIS and displays a robust willingness to combat it. The U.S., alongside its allies, pledges to continue its strategic efforts and ramps up its operations against the terrorist group. In the coming weeks, it will be crucial to see how these combined international efforts affect the progress of ISIS and whether the coalition's strategy can effectively suppress the group's influence and expansion. Any substantial success or failure will likely prompt a reassessment of the current strategy and potentially reshape the international response to this global issue. Leading figures have stressed the importance of the political solution rather than solely relying on military force.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Daniel Barenboim (born 15 November 1942) is an Argentine-Israeli pianist and conductor who is a citizen of Argentina, Israel, Palestine, and Spain. He is the general music director of the Berlin State Opera, and the Staatskapelle Berlin; he previously served as Music Director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestre de Paris and La Scala in Milan. Barenboim is known for his work with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, a Seville-based orchestra of young Arab and Israeli musicians, and as a resolute critic of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. Barenboim has received many awards and prizes, including an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, France's Legion d'honneur both as a Commander and Grand Officier, and the German Grosses Bundesverdienstkreuz and Willy Brandt Award. Barenboim has performed several times in the West Bank: at Bir Zeit University in 1999 and several times in Ramallah.  In December 2007, Barenboim and 20 musicians from England, the United States, France and Germany, and one Palestinian were scheduled to play a baroque music concert in Gaza. Although they had received authorization from Israeli authorities, the Palestinian was stopped at the Israel-Gaza border and told that he needed individual permission to enter. The group waited seven hours at the border, and then canceled the concert in solidarity. Barenboim commented: \\"A baroque music concert in a Roman Catholic church in Gaza - as we all know - has nothing to do with security and would bring so much joy to people who live there in great difficulty.\\"  In January 2008, after performing in Ramallah, Barenboim accepted honorary Palestinian citizenship, becoming the first Jewish Israeli citizen to be offered the status. Barenboim said he hoped it would serve as a public gesture of peace. Some Israelis criticized Barenboim's decision to accept Palestinian citizenship. The parliamentary faction chairman of the Shas party demanded that Barenboim be stripped of his Israeli citizenship, but the Interior Minister told the media that \\"the matter is not even up for discussion\\".  In January 2009, Barenboim cancelled two concerts of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra in Qatar and Cairo \\"due to the escalating violence in Gaza and the resulting concerns for the musicians' safety.\\"  In May 2011, Barenboim conducted the \\"Orchestra for Gaza\\" composed of volunteers from the Berlin Philharmonic, the Berlin Staatskapelle, the Orchestra of La Scala in Milan, the Vienna Philharmonic and the Orchestre de Paris--at al-Mathaf Cultural House. The concert, held in Gaza City, was co-ordinated in secret with the United Nations. The orchestra flew from Berlin to Vienna and from there to El Arish on a plane chartered by Barenboim, entering the Gaza Strip at the Egyptian Rafah Border Crossing. The musicians were escorted by a convoy of United Nations vehicles. The concert, the first performance by an international classical ensemble in the Strip, was attended by an invited audience of several hundred schoolchildren and NGO workers, who greeted Barenboim with applause. The orchestra played Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik and Symphony No. 40, also familiar to an Arab audience as the basis of one of the songs of the famous Arab singer Fairuz. In his speech, Barenboim said: \\"Everyone has to understand that the Palestinian cause is a just cause therefore it can be only given justice if it is achieved without violence. Violence can only weaken the righteousness of the Palestinian cause\\". Can you tell me anything else about the Orchestra for Gaza?","output":"The \\"Orchestra for Gaza\\" was a unique ensemble composed of volunteers from prestigious orchestras such as the Berlin Philharmonic, the Berlin Staatskapelle, the Orchestra of La Scala in Milan, the Vienna Philharmonic, and the Orchestre de Paris. The concert held in May 2011 in Gaza City was coordinated secretly with the United Nations, and the musicians flew from Berlin to Vienna and then to El Arish on a plane chartered by Barenboim before entering the Gaza Strip at the Egyptian Rafah Border Crossing.

Both the violin and viola are played under the jaw. The viola, being the larger of the two instruments, has a playing range that reaches a perfect fifth below the violin's. The cello is played sitting down with the instrument between the knees, and its playing range reaches an octave below the viola's. The double bass is played standing or sitting on a stool, with a range that typically reaches a minor sixth, an octave or a ninth below the cello's. Is the following statement correct based on the text is a cello and a bass the same thing","output":"No, the statement is not correct based on the text. A cello and a double bass are not the same thing. Although both are string instruments and share some similarities, there are some distinctive characteristics between them. The cello, also known as the violoncello, is played while sitting down, with the instrument placed between the knees. The cello's playing range reaches an octave below the viola's. The cello is known for its rich, deep sound, and is often used to play middle and bass register parts in orchestra music, though it can also play higher parts; it is quite versatile.  The double bass, also known as the upright bass, can be played either standing up or sitting down on a stool. It generally has a range that reaches a minor sixth, an octave or even a ninth below the cello's range. The double bass is the largest and lowest-pitched instrument in the standard string orchestra, providing the bass lines and underpinning the harmonic structure in many different types of music, from classical to jazz. In addition to these differences in size, range, and playing position, there are also significant differences in technique and notation between the two instruments. For example, the double bass is traditionally played with the side of the bow (known as \\"French bow style\\") rather than with the bow hair flat against the strings (known as \\"German bow style\\"), although some bassists will use the German bow style. On the other hand, cellists only use the bow hair flat against the strings. Also, while both instruments use the bass clef for most of their range, the cello often uses the tenor and even the treble clef for its higher notes, whereas the double bass generally only uses the bass clef.  Lastly, although the cello and the double bass share the same four strings (A, D, G, C), the double bass is tuned in fourths, unlike the cello, which is tuned in fifths. This factor considerably influences the technique and fingering employed by cellists and double bass players. In conclusion, although the cello and the double bass are both part of the string family and share some family likeness, they are different in many aspects including size, pitch range, playing positions, tuning and techniques. Therefore, the cello and the double bass are not the same thing."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity.

Junkie XL, along with Charlie May, also assisted Sasha on his second album of original material, Airdrawndagger.  Airdrawndagger took several years to produce due to Sasha's desire for the album to be \\"as near to perfection as possible.\\"  That March, Sasha suffered a perforated eardrum in a traffic accident, further delaying the album's production. Though the accident temporarily impaired his hearing, he drew inspiration for the album from his ordeal.  Airdrawndagger was finally released, in August 2002, to much fanfare. However, the album was \\"received with a lot of head scratching\\", according to Sasha, which he attributed to its unexpected mix of genres. The album did not feature the heavier \\"club sound\\" of Sasha's previous mix albums, bearing a closer resemblance to ambient music.  Airdrawndagger generally received favorable reviews, though critics noted that it was not as consistent and well produced as his DJ mixes. Sasha himself described it as \\"a selfish, slightly self-indulgent record\\", though he maintains that he is \\"happy with it to this day\\".

Due to the contest's success, Sasha released all the tracks from Airdrawndagger on his website, so that fans could download and create their own versions.After the release of Airdrawndagger, Sasha took the young DJ James Zabiela \\"under his wing\\". He introduced Zabiela to the CDJ1000 turntable, and signed Zabiela to the Excession talent agency.  The two toured the United States together, which extended Sasha's influence to already-popular American DJs such as Kimball Collins. In 2004, Sasha signed with Global Underground to produce another mix album. However, he found the process of creating a standard mix album unrewarding, and decided to apply his production and DJing skills to a mix compilation that resembled a \\"real\\" album—that is, one featuring original material.  Sasha's next studio album, Involver, was \\"a fusion of mix album and production record\\", consisting entirely of Sasha's reworkings of tracks by other artists.  \\"I tried to take all the separate sounds to all the tracks [and recombine them]\\", he later explained, \\"and it allowed me to mix the tracks together on a much deeper level.\\"  He accomplished this by sequencing the album using Ableton Live and Logic Pro.  Ableton Live is a music loop-based software package that Sasha uses to engineer tracks in real-time, whereas he used Logic Pro primarily for premeditated edits to audio tracks.  Question: Whose album was \\"received with a lot of head scratching?\\"? A:","output":"Sasha's album"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:On Saturday, President Donald Trump will mark the first anniversary of his inauguration as the 45th president, the day on the steps of the U.S. Capitol he promised to put \\"America first.\\" Trump's tumultuous first year was unlike that of any other president in recent U.S. history, and 2018 could offer more of the same. The president had his share of victories and setbacks amid a backdrop of Twitter storms and, at times, raging rhetoric. Trump's political base seems pleased with his first year in office, touting his efforts to cut Obama-era regulations, install Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and roll back Islamic State forces in the Middle East. \\"We were kind of thinking we were going to relax and put Trump behind us and just watch all the great promises that he gave us, and watch him make America great again,\\" said Michigan Trump supporter Meshawn Maddock. \\"But what happened immediately is that we felt he was under attack from day one.\\" The president's biggest legislative victory came just last month, a sweeping tax cut bill that had been a Republican priority for years. \\"We are very proud of it,\\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed it. \\"It is going to be a tremendous thing for the American people. It is going to be fantastic for the economy.\\" In fact, there are plenty of signs of a surging economy, and public opinion polls show growing support for Trump's handling of it and even a bump up in support for the tax bill, which many voters saw initially as too favorable to the wealthy. The tax victory also seems to be helping Trump galvanize the Republican Party behind him, even those who in the past have been cool to his leadership. \\"This president hasn't even been in office for a year, and look at all the things he has been able to get done, by sheer will in many ways,\\" said Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who also announced recently he would not run for re-election this year. What is the main cause of President Trump's increase in approval rating? - His tax cut bill - not enough information - His twitter storms - His raging rhetoric A:","output":"The main cause of President Trump's increase in approval rating appears to be his tax cut bill."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result, there are key aspects to consider when assessing the validity and effectiveness of these indicators in comparison to those that exclusively rely on waste volume measurements. Firstly, it is important to understand the overall goal of the indicators. Environmental indicators aim to measure the impacts of human activity on the environment, providing crucial information to policymakers, businesses, and the general public. The effectiveness of an indicator depends on its ability to accurately represent the reality of environmental disturbances and provide meaningful data that can drive sustainable decision-making. Secondly, the method employed in the development of the indicators should be scrutinized. The method utilized in formulating the indicators, as well as the statistical base used for comparison, should be subjected to a comprehensive review process. This process includes evaluating the sources of data, the methodologies used to compile and analyze the data, and the statistical measures taken to ensure the indicators are accurate and relevant. Thirdly, it is essential to identify the key differences between the reviewed indicators and other existing indicators based solely on waste volumes. Indicators that focus solely on waste volumes may not necessarily provide a comprehensive representation of the environmental impacts. These measurements may overlook crucial factors such as toxicity levels, the energy consumption required for waste management, and the broader ecological implications of waste production and disposal. Conversely, the reviewed indicators take into account multiple factors beyond waste volumes, such as the environmental impact of waste generation, the efficiency of recycling and disposal processes, and the potential risks posed to ecosystems and human health. By incorporating a broader range of variables, these indicators create a more holistic picture of the real environmental impacts associated with waste production and management. Lastly, the comparative analysis of the indicators should be conducted to validate the superiority of the reviewed indicators in terms of accuracy and effectiveness. This can be achieved through various methods, such as comparing the correlations between indicators and real-world environmental impacts, assessing the ability of the indicators to predict future trends, and examining the responsiveness and sensitivity of the indicators to changes in policy and technology. In conclusion, the reviewed indicators, which consider various aspects beyond waste volumes, undoubtedly provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the real environmental impacts of waste production and management. They serve as valuable tools for guiding sustainable decision-making and formulating effective strategies to mitigate the negative consequences on the environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: When did the Chinese actively enter the war Context: The war started badly for the US and UN. North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy.

Vlasák avea dreptate când afirma că această cofinanţare joacă un rol foarte important; totuşi, consider că o creştere a nivelului de cofinanţare pe timp de criză este o propunere bună, deoarece unele state aflate într-o situaţie foarte dificilă au probleme foarte serioase în obţinerea cofinanţării. Translate this to English?","output":"Of course, Mr. Vlasák was right when he stated that this co-financing plays a very important role; however, I believe that an increase in the level of co-financing during a crisis is a good proposal, because some states in a very difficult situation have very serious problems in obtaining co-financing. In this statement, the speaker acknowledges Mr. Vlasák's opinion on the significance of co-financing in certain circumstances. Co-financing generally refers to a financial arrangement where multiple organizations or entities contribute to funding a particular project or venture. This can help in sharing the financial burden, mitigating risks, and enabling a more effective implementation of projects. The speaker then expresses their belief that an increase in the participation level, through co-financing, could be advantageous during a crisis. A crisis, in this context, might refer to economic downturns, natural disasters, or other situations that cause significant stress on a country's resources and financial stability. In such situations, states may struggle to obtain the necessary funds to support various initiatives and projects. By boosting the level of co-financing, multiple benefits become apparent: 1. Shared financial burden: An increased level of co-financing can alleviate the economic strain on individual states, as the costs are distributed among multiple parties. This can be especially helpful for states dealing with severe financial hardships during a crisis. 2. Reduced risk: As risks are shared among multiple entities, the potential negative impacts and financial losses on any given participant are mitigated. In the context of a crisis, this is particularly important as affected states may face increased financial uncertainty. 3. Increased project viability: With more parties contributing to funding, projects are more likely to move forward despite the difficult economic circumstances caused by the crisis. This can help ensure that vital initiatives and infrastructural developments are not stalled due to lack of funds and that progress can continue within the affected region. 4. Enhanced collaboration: An increase in co-financing during a crisis provides an opportunity to foster better collaboration among states, promoting solidarity and cooperation in tackling challenges together. This can lead to better resource utilization and more efficient problem-solving, both critically important in times of crisis. Overall, the speaker effectively highlights that a higher level of co-financing during a crisis could prove beneficial for states experiencing severe economic difficulties. This mechanism, in promoting financial collaboration and risk-sharing, helps safeguard vital projects and initiatives in the face of uncertainty."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"what event is first mentioned?\\" is in \\"In 1808, Napoleon and Czar Alexander met at the Congress of Erfurt to preserve the Russo-French alliance.

Given the question: Alona's persistent knocking at the door of room 412 went unanswered for three minutes as she nervously shuffled her feet. Her book bag was super-saturated with textbooks, notebooks, schedules, rough drafts, and various other forms of academic paraphernalia. It was getting heavier. She continued to knock, even though there had as yet been no answer, because the note card tacked to the right of the door indicated that these indeed were Prof. Turgy K. Sigger's office hours. She could see the light under the door and thought she had heard a groan. Just before she decided to give up, slow feet approached from the opposite side, then silence; with a dramatic turn of the knob, the door swung open. \\"Was this trip really necessary?\\" asked Prof. Sigger, blinking and brushing his oily, graying hair back into place. \\"These are your office hours,\\" Alona replied. She nervously smiled, feeling the corners of her mouth twitch. Somewhere in the darkened hall, a janitor coughed. \\"All right,\\" conceded Prof. Sigger. \\"Come in.\\" The carpet was smothered by leaning towers of textbooks. Papers lined the left side of the desk, above which was a small note card which read \\"To Be Graded.\\" On the right side, the oak finish gleamed of the mid-morning light piercing the Venetian blinds. \\"You've come about your final project,\\" Prof. Sigger stated. \\"It's only mid-term,\\" Alona reminded him. \\"Oh yes, yes,\\" continued Prof. Sigger, without conscious embarrassment. \\"Mid-term grade. I think I have it here. Somewhere.\\" His hands disappeared into the left side of his desk. \\"You told the class that we would get a C if we maintained that Coca-Cola isn't a crypto-fascist conspiracy.\\" \\"Oh yes,\\" said Prof. Sigger. \\"We were discussing social issues, as I remember. I was quoting Marx and some little idiot brought up Rush Limbaugh.\\" \\"That was me,\\" Alona muttered. Why did Prof. Sigger agree to see Alona despite feeling disturbed? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. not enough information  B. because Alona had been carrying a heavy book bag  C. because he was accountable for his own office hours  D. because he saw Alona as a hardworking student The answer is:","output":"C. because he was accountable for his own office hours In the given scenario, Prof. Sigger, although seemingly disturbed and mildly annoyed, agreed to see Alona because it was during his office hours. The narrative specifically mentions that Alona had shown up at his door because \\"the note card tacked to the right of the door indicated that these indeed were Prof. Turgy K. Sigger's office hours.\\" This expresses the expectations associated with office hours, which are typically designated periods of time when professors or teachers are available to meet with students to discuss academic matters. Prof. Sigger's choice to open the door and invite Alona in was not linked to the weight of her book bag (option B) or his perception of Alona as a hardworking student (option D). It was, instead, rooted in his professional obligation to be available to students during his stated office hours, thus making option C the correct answer. Option A, \\"not enough information,\\" could potentially be seen as accurate if we were lacking significant context inside the narrative. However, the story provides sufficient information from which one could infer the reason behind Prof. Sigger's actions. Alona's heavy book bag and her anxious anticipation highlight her dedication to her academic work, yet these details don't directly inform Prof. Sigger's decision to open the door. Rather, they enhance our understanding of Alona's character and underline the significance of the meeting for her. Similarly, while Alona being the one who brought up Rush Limbaugh in class helps paint a more comprehensive picture of the academic environment and the past interaction between Alona and Prof. Sigger, it does not inherently influence Prof. Sigger's decision to engage with her during his office hours. In conclusion, while the narrative delivers a rich understanding of context and character interactions, the core reason behind Prof. Sigger's decision to open the door to Alona rests in his responsibility to honour his office hours, as outlined in option C."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Information:  - An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using electrical energy stored in rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device. Electric motors give electric cars instant torque, creating strong and smooth acceleration. They are also around three times as efficient as cars with an internal combustion engine. The first practical electric cars were produced in the 1880s. Electric cars were popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century, until advances in internal combustion engines, electric starters in particular, and mass production of cheaper gasoline vehicles led to a decline in the use of electric drive vehicles. The energy crises of the 1970s and 1980s brought a short-lived interest in electric cars; although those cars did not reach the mass marketing stage, as became the case in the 21st century.  - Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A. is an Italian car manufacturer, founded as A.L.F.A.

Known as Remembrance Day, the day originated as a tribute to the soldiers of WWI, a dark period for our young country, which claimed the lives of over 60,000 military personnel and civilians and over 16 million dead worldwide. As there are no more surviving soldiers of WWI,today we rely on the wisdom and words of those soldiers who fought in the wars that followed,and this day now also recognizes their heroic contribution. They tell us to always remember what those brave souls fought for, and all they ask in return is that we never forget.

A branch of hacker group Anonymous has taken on the people they believe are involved in the cover up of a horrific rape case in Ohio where two star football players are accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl. The alleged rape took place in Steubenville, Ohio in August of last year, but because authorities did not immediately arrest the athletes involved, much of the policing has been done on the web. Officially, two boys- Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond- have been arrested and charged with raping a fellow 16-year-old, taking her to a number of parties when she was too drunk to resist, digitally penetrating her and possibly even urinating on her. Scroll down to watch video extract. Taking action: The so-called 'hacktivist' group Anonymous made a video announcing their plan to 'out' people involved in the alleged coverup of the incident. The case, which was publicized nationally by an explosive New York Times story, has split the small town of Steubenville into two sides- those who are devout fans of the football team who have chosen to support the two players, saying that the incident is the girl's fault for getting that drunk. There is also the allegation that she was drugged, but because a toxicology report was not done immediately after the alleged assault, that has not been proven. Others feel that the reason why the case. has not moved more swiftly through the legislative process is because. local officials are covering up for the start athletes, taking it as the. latest example of the hero-worship provided the teenage football. players. Horrific: Attendees at the various parties posted pictures of the two suspects dragging the seemingly unconscious victim around because she was too drunk to move. Anonymous qualifies as the latter, and an individual cell called Knight Sec has appointed themselves that internet vigilantes for the case. On their website, called Local Leaks: The Steubenville Files, they said that they took up the cause since 'a town rife with corruption, cronyism, illegal gambling  and fixated upon their star high school football team (a major economic revenue engine) were prepared to orchestrate a major cover-up in order to sweep the entire affair under the rug.' The group 'began unraveling this conspiracy of silence designed to protect a group of these high school football players who had become well known to their fellow students as “The Rape Crew”.' They go on to name and discredit a number of people involved in the case- from the sheriff involved in the investigation to the prosecuting attorney- using their tech skills to hack into individuals email accounts and publish damaging allegations. In the case of a prominent football team supporter, the group published inappropriate and pornographic photos found in his email account. The Local Leaks site has become somewhat of a collection of the various Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter posts made by students who were either present at the parties where the girl was being dragged around by the two players by her ankles and wrists. That picture was originally screen-grabbed by Alexandria Goddard, a crime blogger who used to live in Steubenville. She took it from the Instagram account of a local high school student who later tried to sue her for defamation because she posted the photo on the web. His suit was dismissed and the teenage boy publicly apologized to the victim and her family, whose names are not being reported because she is a minor and an alleged sexual assault victim. A horrifying online trail of the August 11 incident continues to emerge, and one of the latest discoveries was that of a video of a group of high school students talking about- even laughing- about the alleged rape which seems to be happening at the time the video was shot. Throughout the video, which is just over 12 minutes long, there are numerous references to a 'dead girl' who is described as being raped and urinated on. The boy who talks the most in the video has been identified as Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student and baseball player who cannot contain his laughter as he describes the 16-year-old victim, seemingly in another room of the house, being raped. 'She is so raped right now,' he says at one point in the video. Laughing boy: The 'star' of the video is Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student who can't contain his laughter as he describes the 'dead' victim, seemingly in another room of the house. Offensive: A number of offensive comments about the alleged rape were made online, including this one on Twitter; detectives are now trawling through the online exchanges for more evidence. 'There won't be any foreplay for a dead girl,' he says. 'It ain't wet now to be honest. Trust me, I'm a doctor.' The video was obtained by hacker group KnightSec and posted on Deadspin on Wednesday. Wearing an Ohio State Buckeyes t-shirt, Nodianos jokes that the girl is 'deader than a doornail' and 'they p***** on her.' He then goes on a tirade of the. figures that she's 'deader than,' including Caylee Anthony, 'O.J. Simpson's wife,' John F. Kennedy and Trayvon Martin. Fan frenzy: The Big Red plays their home games at a 10,000 seat stadium, where they are broadcast on local television. Allegation: Both of the boys facing charges are students at Steubenville High School and were on the school's prestigious football team. The city’s police chief begged for witnesses to come forward, but received little response. At least two other people who don't. appear on camera interrupt Nodianos to let inform him that the situation. is anything but a laughing matter. 'It is rape. They raped her,' one of them says. Later, he chastises Nodianos, saying: 'Like, this is not like funny... what if that was your daughter?' Nodianos responds: 'But it isn't. If that was my daughter, I wouldn't care. I would just let her be dead. 'And is it really rape if you don’t. know if she wanted to or not? She might have wanted it. That might have. been her final wish.'

A woman who was just 14 when she accompanied her 19-year-old boyfriend on a killing spree is set to ask for a pardon 57 years after she was jailed, insisting she didn't kill anybody and her sentence was unfair. Caril Ann Fugate, now 71, was on a two-month road trip with notorious mass murderer Charles Starkweather from Lincoln, Nebraska, to Wyoming  when he killed 11 people between 1957 and 58. High school dropout Starkweather was sentenced to death and executed for his crimes in September 1959. Fugate, who says she was forced to accompany the killer, was found guilty of being an accessory to first-degree murder in connection with the death of 17-year-old victim Robert Jensen. She was sentenced to life but was released after 17 years. Defense attorney John Stevens Berry, who wrote a book earlier this year suggesting Fugate was unfairly convicted, is backing her plea and is hoping the move will become a campaign issue in the Nebraska gubernatorial race, according to the Omaha World Herald. Scroll down for video. Plea: Caril Ann Fugate (pictured left at 15) was on a road trip with  mass murderer Charles Starkweather (then 19) between Lincoln, Nebraska, and Wyoming when he killed 11 people between 1957 and 1958. Defiance: Fugate (pictured with her late husband Frederick in 2013) has always maintained her innocence and has the backing of several attorneys who say her sentence was unjust. The killings began with the death of 21-year-old Robert Colvert, who was robbed, abducted and shot in late 1957. His body was later discovered on a country road. Two months later authorities found many other bodies including those of Fugate's stepfather Marion Bartlett, 57 and his 35-year-old wife Velda, in an outbuilding. Their two-year-old daughter, Betty Jean, had been clubbed to death with the butt of a gun and her body stuffed in a cardboard box. Fugate admitted taking 4 from Jensen's wallet just before he and a friend, Carol King, 16, were shot to death. One of the main factors in her conviction was that she was holding a shotgun at the time. She was initially sentenced to life, but the term was later reduced to between 30 and 50 years. This meant she was eligible for parole in 1976 and was released after serving 17 years of her sentence because she had been considered a 'model prisoner'. Killer: Starkweather (pictured in a Converse County jail cell) was arrested following the two-month killing spree which lasted between December 1957 and January 1958. He was given the death penalty. Sentence: After serving 17 months in prison, Starkweather was put to death in the electric chair in 1959 after being found guilty of killing Robert Jenson, the only murder he was tried for. In 1996, she asked for a pardon saying the 'sentence did not fit the crime', also telling the newspaper: 'Everyone knows I never killed anyone.' However the request was turned down. Mr Berry, a Lincoln attorney who published The Twelfth Victim earlier this year, claims Starkweather told investigators several times that Fugate was not involved in the slayings. But he changed his story just before they went to trial. Starkweather ultimately testified that Fugate was a willing participant in the murder spree. 'His lies convicted Caril,' Berry told the paper. 'We are convinced not only that she was treated illegally and unjustly, but was, in fact, innocent.' He added that he will survey the candidates for governor, attorney general and secretary of state — the three offices that comprise the Pardons Board. This is so he can determine where voters stand on the request. Attempts: Fugate (pictured in 1958) was released in 1976 after serving 17 years in prison. In 1996 she asked for a pardon on the grounds the sentence 'did not fit the crime'. Her plea however was rejected. When Fugate was released, she is believed to have moved to Lansing, Michigan, where she worked as a janitor and medical technician. In 2007, Fugate married Fredrick Clair, a machinist who also worked as a weather observer for the National Weather Service. She now lives in Hillsdale, Michigan. Fugate's stepson states she suffered a series of strokes in her late 60s. In August last year, she was critically injured in a car crash in Stryker, Ohio, that killed her husband. Starkweather's murders are the most notorious in Nebraska's history and have been depicted in films and TV programs. The 1973 film Badlands starring Martin Sheen was based on the killing spree.

The marijuana was stored in plastic instead of burlap, as the","output":"supplier had recently decided to switch packaging materials. This change was made to increase the shelf-life and freshness of the marijuana, but it came with some drawbacks. Burlap allowed the marijuana to breathe, while the plastic often condensed moisture, potentially leading to the growth of mold. Paul, who owned the small dispensary, was concerned about this new packaging. He had just received a shipment and needed to make a decision about how to best handle the situation. After some thought, Paul decided to take a number of steps to mitigate the potential issues caused by the plastic packaging. Step 1: Sort and inspect the marijuana His first step was to sort and inspect the marijuana for any visible signs of mold or damage. By sorting through the shipment, Paul could identify any problem areas early and reduce the chances of mold spreading throughout the entire inventory. Step 2: Air out the marijuana As the marijuana was stored in airtight plastic packages, the lack of air circulation increased the risk of mold. Paul decided to carefully open the plastic packages and allow the marijuana to air out in small batches. He arranged the marijuana on clean, dry surfaces in a well-ventilated room to ensure proper air circulation. This would help to regulate the moisture levels within the marijuana and prevent the growth of mold. Step 3: Monitor the humidity levels To further combat the growth of mold, Paul decided to maintain a close watch on the humidity levels within the dispensary. He purchased a hygrometer, a device that measures the humidity in the air, and placed it in a central location. This allowed him to maintain the humidity levels between 50% and 60% to ensure the optimal environment for marijuana storage. Step 4: Rotate inventory To prevent any batch from being stored too long in plastic, Paul decided to implement a rotation system in the dispensary. This involved moving older batches up front for sale and placing new shipments toward the back. By rotating the inventory, Paul could ensure that all of the marijuana stayed fresh and did not remain in plastic for an extended period of time. Step 5: Educate employees and customers Lastly, Paul recognized the importance of educating both his employees and customers about the new packaging and its potential risks. He created a guide outlining the steps taken to mitigate the risks associated with plastic packaging and informed his employees about the importance of following these measures. In addition, Paul made an effort to communicate this information to his customers, educating them on how to properly store the marijuana once it left the dispensary. By taking these steps, Paul was able to overcome the challenges posed by plastic packaging and continue providing his customers with high-quality, fresh marijuana. He kept an open mind and remained adaptable, ensuring that his business could successfully navigate the ever-evolving landscape of the marijuana industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Math problem: Solve 130*k - 103*k + 567 = 0 for k. What is the solution?","output":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step by step, just like a puzzle! We have this equation: 130*k - 103*k + 567 = 0 First, we have two terms with 'k' in them. \\"130*k\\" means we have 130 sets of 'k', and \\"103*k\\" means we have 103 sets of 'k'. Now, imagine 'k' as toy blocks. We take away 103 blocks from 130 blocks. So, we subtract: 130 - 103 = 27. That means we now have: 27*k + 567 = 0 We want to solve for 'k', so we need to get rid of the 567 on the left side. To do that, we do the opposite of adding (which is subtracting). So, let's subtract 567 from both sides: 27*k = -567. Now we have 27 sets of 'k' equal to -567. To find out the value of 'k', we need to divide both the sets and blocks evenly. So, let's divide -567 by 27: -567 ÷ 27 = -21. That means: k = -21. So, the solution to the problem is k = -21. Imagine, for every set of toy blocks ('k'), we would have -21 blocks. But remember, blocks can't really be negative - this is just a fun way to understand the math problem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise.

Sentence:","output":"This data provides some valuable information about the geographical, political, and sociocultural characteristics of Alpharetta, a city in Georgia, which is part of United States. Firstly, let's focus on the location - Alpharetta. It is a city situated in the state of Georgia, lying in the Southeastern region of United States. Alpharetta is known for its vibrant culture, thriving businesses, and appealing landscapes. This place falls under the jurisdiction of the country known as the United States, which is a federal republic consisting of 50 states and a federal district. It's the world's third-largest country by total area and population. The United States exhibits a very diverse culture due to its size and the influence of indigenous people, immigrants, and slaves throughout its history.  Now, focusing on the ethnic group data provided, we are given that African Americans are a significant ethnic group in the United States. This term refers to the descendants of African people who were brought to America during the Transatlantic Slave Trades from the 16th to the 19th century. Over generations, African Americans have become integral to the story of American democracy, contributing to society in the fields of science, arts, politics, sports, and much more. They have played a significant role in fighting for civil rights and equality, shaping the country in fundamental ways. It's important to note that the presence of African Americans in the United States indicates its culturally diverse population, and informs us about the multicultural nature of the U.S.  However, this data about African Americans is linked to the United States as a whole and does not specifically mention their representation in Alpharetta, Georgia. If we were to extrapolate, we could infer that as a city in the United States, Alpharetta could also be culturally diverse and potentially has a percentage of African American residents. Yet, more specific data would be required to confirm the ethnic demographics of Alpharetta.  In summary, Alpharetta, based in Georgia in the United States, falls under the broad umbrella of American sociocultural dynamics, which includes a substantial African American population.

The sentence is expressing an opinion that, although individual elements of a Hollywood production may have great potential, the final output often ends up being less satisfying or successful than one might expect. There are several reasons behind this perception, including the focus on spectacle, challenges in storytelling and character development, the role of marketing, and a reliance on trends rather than originality. Firstly, spectacle has become a dominant feature in Hollywood films of late. With advances in technology and the growing demand for immersive experiences, many blockbuster movies rely heavily on visual effects, CGI, and action sequences to captivate audiences. While these aspects can indeed offer an exhilarating experience, they may also lead to the neglect of other essential components of storytelling, such as plot and character development. As a result, the film may end up feeling shallow and disconnected despite its impressive visuals. Another factor contributing to the notion that the whole is less than the sum of its parts in contemporary Hollywood is the challenges in crafting cohesive and engaging stories. A movie may feature a talented cast, high production values, and competent direction, yet still fall short of expectations due to a weak script or inconsistent pacing. It is not uncommon for movies to suffer from convoluted storylines, clichéd dialogues, or flimsy character motivations, which ultimately detract from the audience's overall enjoyment of the film. Moreover, marketing plays a significant role in shaping the perception of a movie. Film studios often invest heavily in promotional campaigns that overhype their products, creating unrealistic expectations among potential viewers. This can lead to disappointment, even when a film has all the ingredients for success on paper. In some cases, the marketing materials might reveal major plot points or spoilers, diminishing the impact of the movie when it is finally released. Lastly, Hollywood's penchant for following trends and producing remakes, sequels, and adaptations can lead to creative stagnation and a lack of originality. With studios playing it safe by relying on established brands, franchises, or previous successes, the end result often becomes formulaic and predictable. This practice can render the whole less satisfying than the sum of its parts, as it fails to harness the full potential of the individual components. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence highlights the perceived issues with modern Hollywood films where a focus on spectacle, challenges in storytelling and character development, the influence of marketing, and a reliance on trends rather than originality lead to an end product that falls short of the combined potential of its individual elements. This critical perception suggests that the film industry ought to prioritize a balance of innovative storytelling, creative risk-taking, and strong character development alongside the visually stunning and immersive experiences that Hollywood is known for."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

David Mark Winfield (born October 3, 1951) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) right fielder. He is currently special assistant to the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association. Over his 22-year career, he played for six teams: the San Diego Padres, New York Yankees, California Angels, Toronto Blue Jays, Minnesota Twins, and Cleveland Indians. He had the winning hit in the 1992 World Series with the Blue Jays over the Atlanta Braves. After the 1992 season, Winfield was granted free agency and signed with his hometown Minnesota Twins, where he continued to perform at a high level of play despite advancing age. He batted .271 with 21 home runs, appearing in 143 games for the 1993 Twins, mostly as their designated hitter. On September 16, 1993, at age 41, he collected his 3,000th career hit with a single off Oakland Athletics closer Dennis Eckersley.  During the 1994 baseball strike, which began on August 12, Winfield was traded to the Cleveland Indians at the trade waiver deadline on August 31 for a player to be named later. The 1994 season had been halted two weeks earlier (it was eventually canceled a month later on September 14), so Winfield did not get to play for the Indians that year and no player was ever named in exchange. To settle the trade, Cleveland and Minnesota executives went to dinner, with the Indians picking up the tab. This makes Winfield the only player in major league history to be \\"traded\\" for a dinner (though official sources list the transaction as Winfield having been sold by the Minnesota Twins to the Cleveland Indians).  Winfield, who was now the oldest MLB player, was again granted free agency in October but re-signed with the Indians as spring training began in April 1995. A rotator cuff injury kept him on the disabled list for most of the season; thus he played in only 46 games and hit .191 for Cleveland's first pennant winner in 41 years. He did not participate in the Indians' postseason. What happened in 1994?","output":"In 1994, Major League Baseball (MLB) faced a significant event that disrupted the season and led to its premature end. On August 12, 1994, the MLB Players Association went on strike due to a labor dispute with the team owners. The main point of contention between the players and the owners was the owners' desire to implement a salary cap, which the players adamantly opposed. The players believed that a salary cap would limit their potential earnings and restrict the financial growth of the sport. As the strike persisted, negotiations between the MLB Players Association and the team owners proved unfruitful, leading to the cancellation of the remainder of the 1994 season, including the playoffs and the World Series. This marked the first time in 90 years that the World Series was not played and left a blemish on the sport's history. The baseball strike also had a significant impact on players, like Dave Winfield, who were unable to continue playing during that time. As mentioned in the previous response, Winfield was traded from the Minnesota Twins to the Cleveland Indians on August 31, 1994, during the strike. However, due to the cancellation of the remaining season, he never got a chance to play for the Indians that year. This, in turn, led to a unique situation in which Winfield was essentially traded for a dinner between the two teams' executives. The strike continued into the early months of 1995 and finally ended on April 2, 1995, after a U.S. District Court issued an injunction against the team owners, effectively ordering them to restore the previous labor agreement. This decision allowed the 1995 MLB season to commence, albeit with a shortened schedule. The 1994 MLB strike left a lasting impact on the sport, with many fans disillusioned by the labor dispute and the loss of the World Series. It took several years for the sport to recover from the strike and regain the trust and excitement of its fans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Ancient Greek prólogos included the modern meaning of prologue , but was of wider significance , more like the meaning of preface . The importance , therefore , of the prologue in Greek drama was very great ; it sometimes almost took the place of a romance , to which , or to an episode in which , the play itself succeeded . It is believed that the prologue in this form was practically the invention of Euripides , and with him , as has been said , it takes the place of an explanatory first act . This may help to modify the objection which criticism has often brought against the Greek prologue , as an impertinence , a useless growth prefixed to the play , and standing as a barrier between us and our enjoyment of it . The point precisely is that , to an Athenian audience , it was useful and pertinent , as supplying just what they needed to make the succeeding scenes intelligible . But it is difficult to accept the view that Euripides invented the plan of producing a god out of a machine to justify the action of deity upon man , because it is plain that he himself disliked this interference of the supernatural and did not believe in it . He seems , in such a typical prologue as that to the Hippolytus , to be accepting a conventional formula , and employing it , almost perversely , as a medium for his ironic rationalismo .  - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.   - A preface or proem is an introduction to a book or other literary work written by the work's author. An introductory essay written by a different person is a \\"foreword\\" and precedes an author's preface. The preface often closes with acknowledgments of those who assisted in the literary work.  - A foreword is a (usually short) piece of writing sometimes placed at the beginning of a book or other piece of literature. Typically written by someone other than the primary author of the work, it often tells of some interaction between the writer of the foreword and the book's primary author or the story the book tells.

The answers are important enough that they will be a discussion topic of this year's Senior Day at 9 a.m. March 25 in the House Chamber at the Capitol. The following is a preview of some of the answers for review: We can all agree that older Oklahomans need medical care. But even the best care is worthless if an older patient can't drive to the doctor for ongoing treatment because his or her car has been wrongfully seized in a debt dispute. Therefore, lawyers are part of the prescription for regular medical care for many of the 600,000 Oklahomans age 60 and older. Another example: if a doctor treats an elderly patient for a lung ailment, the doctor's treatment will be undone and he will see the patient again and again, if the patient is sent home to an unheated apartment. Lawyers know how to make landlords heat apartments so the medical treatment can stick. (By the way, a May 16, 2001, article in The New York Times reports on a program at Boston Medical Center providing a walk-in legal clinic in the hospital to help fight their patients' legal and administrative battles.) We also can agree that older Oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal document or process. \\"Old\\" is not a legal classification that results in automatic loss of these rights. Moreover, having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents' health care choices. It follows that an important role lawyers provide for aging Oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders, but also to monitor their use. In family situations, for example, lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing rights. They are not to be used to help a family \\"manage\\" their mother or help a doctor or nursing home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient. Good news: Oklahoma now has a Public Guardianship Program, albeit unfunded, that will supply lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring process Oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren, not raise them. But owing to the social problems of divorce and drug use, grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing parents. Adding to the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on, grandparents face legal problems. All the decisions parents made without a second thought now require evidence of legal authority when made by grandparents.  Question: \\"What can lawyers do for old people?\\" Answer: \\"Create rights and make landlords heat apartments\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: pick from the following.  (A). no  (B). yes","output":"Answer: (B). yes The answer \\"Create rights and make landlords heat apartments\\" is correct as it is mentioned in the paragraph. Lawyers can create rights by transferring documents like durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders. They can also make landlords heat apartments so the elderly medical treatment can be effective. Other answer (A). no is not correct because it contradicts the information provided in the paragraph."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: دختران بیشتر به سیگار اعتیاد دارند یا پسران؟ Output:","output":"Explanation: The task asks us to read the provided Persian passage and determine if the given question can be answered based on the passage. The question is whether girls or boys are more addicted to smoking. Translation of the passage: Mobile phone or cellular phone, which is also called a mobile, is a device for transmitting and receiving sound through radio communication across a wide geographical range. Mobile refers to a device used to connect to a cellular network. The first wireless phone was made in 1973, weighing about 2 kg. Mobile phones have different generations and are produced and sold by various manufacturers. Some of the largest cellphone manufacturers in the world include Nokia, Huawei, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Motorola, Sony, Apple, Xiaomi, HTC, Google Pixel, and so on. Mobile phones typically use a set of software or operating system to control the hardware, and side applications are run by the operating system. Famous mobile operating systems include Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. Studies on mobile phone usage show that a large number of people go to sleep while holding their mobile phones or putting them close. Research in the United States, England, Brazil, China, Spain, Mexico, and India shows that modern communication technology, including mobile phones, has become an integral part of human life, and people's dependency on it increases every day. According to a study by a behavioral scientist, 60% of surveyed girls use mobile phones to access social networks and related games, and 30% of them experience stress when their phones run out of charge or are left behind or disconnected in some way. The study found that girls have twice the addiction rate to mobile phones compared to boys. Now, let's analyze the question: Question: Are girls or boys more addicted to smoking? Based on the passage, there is no information about the addiction to smoking for either gender. The passage only mentioned the addiction rate of girls and boys related to mobile phone usage.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is Tyler's profession?  The unnamed Narrator is an automobile recall specialist who is unfulfilled by his job and possessions, and has developed severe insomnia. He finds catharsis by posing as a sufferer of testicular cancer and other afflictions in support groups, remedying his insomnia. His bliss is disturbed by another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him he is attending these groups dishonestly. The two agree to split which groups they attend, but not before they exchange contact details on the premise of switching groups at short notice. On a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets and interacts with soap salesman Tyler Durden. The Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. Deciding against asking Marla for help, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. Tyler says the Narrator is beholden to consumerism. In the parking lot, he asks the Narrator to hit him, and they begin a fistfight. The Narrator is invited to move into Tyler's home: a large, dilapidated house in an industrial area. They have further fights outside the bar, which attract growing crowds of men. The fights move to the bar's basement where the men form Fight Club, which routinely meets for the men to fight recreationally. Marla overdoses on pills and telephones the Narrator for help; he ignores her, but Tyler picks up the phone and goes to her apartment to save her. Tyler and Marla get sexually involved, and Tyler warns the Narrator never to talk to Marla about him. The Narrator blackmails his boss and quits his job.

Sentence 1: Alas, the text could have done with more Shrum, who, let's hope, did not pen the line, Home is about freedom. This sentence implies that the presence of Shrum in the text would have improved its quality or content. It also suggests a hope that Shrum did not write a specific line in the text, which is assumed to be of lower quality or not in line with their usual content. Sentence 2: There is no way Shrum would have helped the text. This sentence states that it is impossible for Shrum's involvement to have helped the text in any way. Now, if we take the first sentence to be true, presuming that Shrum could have improved the text, we find a contradiction with the second sentence, which claims that Shrum could not possibly have helped the text.

The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a powerful and majestic bird, native to North America. Though it can sometimes be found in locations throughout the United States, Canada, and Northern Mexico, the bald eagle generally avoids heavily-populated areas such as big cities. Instead, bald eagles prefer more serene, natural environments where they can thrive and find ample food. The preferred habitat for bald eagles includes large, open bodies of water with abundant fish populations, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshlands. These areas often provide tall trees or cliffs for nesting sites, as well as plenty of space for soaring and hunting. The countryside, with its open spaces, undeveloped land, and natural water sources, is an optimal environment for bald eagles. While it is true that bald eagles can be found in various locations within the United States, Canada, and Florida, those choices do not exclusively describe the eagle's preferred habitat.

Identify the list: The list you are given is [80, 80, 70, 97, 48, -14, -30, 24, 61, 7]. You'll need to work with these numbers. 3.

Context: Anaukpetlun would not spend his scarce resources on subjugating Siam. His strategy was to pick off Siam's peripheral regions rather than launch a full-scale invasion. On 30 November 1613, he sent a small army of 4,000  to drive out the Siamese from upper Tenasserim coast. On 26 December 1613, the army defeated the Siamese at Tavoy. The Burmese followed down to Tenasserim port itself. But the Burmese were driven back with heavy losses by the wealthy port's Portuguese broadsides in March 1614. The Siamese tried to retake Tavoy but failed. Anaukpetlun then switched theatres to Lan Na, which like Martaban before was only a nominal vassal of Siam. His armies of 17,000 invaded Lan Na on 30 April 1614 from Martaban in the south and Mone in the north. Lan Na's ruler, Thado Kyaw, desperately sought help. Help came from Lan Xang, not his overlord Siam. Despite the logistical troubles and the rainy season conditions, the Burmese armies finally achieved encirclement of Lan Na and Lan Xang forces in the Chiang Mai and Lanphun pocket in August 1614. After nearly five months, on 22 December 1614, the city surrendered. Siam would not make any attempts to recover Lan Na until 1663. Question: How many more soldiers did Anaukpetlun use at Lan Na than at the Tenasserim coast? Answer:","output":"To determine the difference in the number of soldiers used in Lan Na compared to the Tenasserim coast, we need to look at the number of soldiers deployed to each location. Anaukpetlun sent 4,000 soldiers to drive out the Siamese from the upper Tenasserim coast. Later, his armies of 17,000 invaded Lan Na. To find the difference in the number of soldiers, we subtract the smaller number (Tenasserim coast) from the larger number (Lan Na). 17,000 (Lan Na) - 4,000 (Tenasserim coast) = 13,000 more soldiers Anaukpetlun used 13,000 more soldiers in Lan Na than at the Tenasserim coast."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Organizers of a Baptist church convention said it will use guns giveaways across the state to attract nonbelievers who are more prone to go duck hunting than sit in a church pew, The Courier-Journal reported. The goal of the Kentucky Baptist Convention's \\"Second Amendment Celebrations\\" is to \\"point people to Christ,\\" the report said. \\"You have to know the hook that will attract people, and hunting is huge in Kentucky,” Chuck McAlister, a former pastor and ex host of an Outdoor Channel hunting show, told the paper. McAlister is also the convention’s team leader for evangelism. He said he can understand how the initiative can draw criticism. But he told the paper that traditional ways to reach out to the community have not been effective. \\"The days of hanging a banner in front of your church and saying you're having a revival and expecting the community to show up is over,\\" he told the paper. He insists that the gun giveaway is meant for hunters and for protection only, but that has not stopped critics who called the event a contradiction of the teachings of Jesus. One of those critics is Rev. Joe Phelps, the pastor of a Louisville Baptist church. Phelps quoted Jesus who said, \\"Put away the sword.\\" \\"Can you picture Jesus giving away guns or toasters or raffle tickets?... He gave away bread once, but that was a sign -- not a sales pitch,\\" he reportedly said. Organizers point to past events and say there's evidence of effectiveness. They expect about 1,000 people to attend one service at Paduch's Lone Oak Baptist Church, where attendees will be served steak dinners and have a chance to win 25 handguns, long guns and shotguns, the report said.

Hydroelectric power generation does not require burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, or natural gas, which are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. By replacing fossil fuel-based power plants with hydroelectric plants, we can significantly reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. As a result, there will be fewer greenhouse gas molecules present in the atmosphere to trap and retain heat, allowing more of it to escape into space. This would help slow down the process of global warming and reduce its impact on the planet.

The title of the review, \\"Beauty is Skin Deep,\\" immediately hints at a potential issue with the product's functionality. The reviewer praises the aesthetic aspect of the toaster by calling it \\"The most stylish toaster out there\\", and even suggests that \\"If you are looking for a striking accent for your counter top but don't intend to use it, this is the toaster for you.\\" These statements underline that while the toaster has a pleasing appearance, it may not fulfill the actual purpose of toasting bread to the customer's satisfaction.  The mention of the customer initiating a return further cements the idea that they were not content with their purchase. The customer service experience seems to have been positive (\\"When I called to return it, no questions were asked.

Finally, the clincher comes with the statement, \\"This will be my last Delonghi purchase.\\" This strongly suggests dissatisfaction and loss of faith in the brand, indicating a negative experience. Therefore, while there are elements of satisfaction (related to customer service and the product's design), the primary function of the product—to correctly toast bread—appears unsatisfactory, and the user's determination not to buy from the same brand again underlines a generally negative review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 1779, during the Battle of New Haven, British soldiers captured Black Rock Fort and burned the barracks to the ground. The fort was reconstructed in 1807 by the federal government (on orders from the Thomas Jefferson administration), and rechristened Fort Nathan Hale, after the Revolutionary War hero who had lived in New Haven. The cannons of Fort Nathan Hale were successful in defying British war ships during the War of 1812. In 1863, during the Civil War, a second Fort Hale was built next to the original, complete with bomb-resistant bunkers and a moat, to defend the city should a Southern raid against New Haven be launched. The United States Congress deeded the site to the state in 1921, and all three versions of the fort have been restored.

Additionally, Dean Elliott, the music composer for this Tom and Jerry cartoon, contributed to the uniqueness of the series during that era. Duel Personality is historically significant as it marks the beginning of a new era for Tom and Jerry, as it was directed by the legendary Chuck Jones, who previously had played a major role in the development of other popular animated characters like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck in Warner Bros' Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series. Jones brought his distinct style to Tom and Jerry, resulting in some notable changes in the characters' designs and personalities. This era of Tom and Jerry cartoons is referred to as the \\"Chuck Jones era.\\" Additionally, Duel Personality is significant due to Dean Elliott's involvement as the music composer. Scoring animated films and series requires unique skills in capturing the feel, pace, and emotions evoked through the story and character interactions. In this Tom and Jerry cartoon, Elliott played a vital role in establishing the mood and overall atmosphere, and his music composition during this period added another layer of depth to the series.

Question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Who is an English film and stage actor, Peter Glenville or Ridley Scott? Answer:","output":"Peter Glenville is an English film and stage actor, whereas Ridley Scott is an English film director and producer. They both have made significant contributions to the world of arts and entertainment, but they have pursued different career paths within the industry. Peter Glenville (1913-1996) was born in London, England. He began his career as an actor in the early 1930s, making his stage debut in 1932. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Glenville appeared in numerous plays both in London and on Broadway. In addition to his work as an actor, he also directed numerous stage productions, successfully transitioning from acting to directing. Some of Glenville's notable stage directing credits include \\"The Glass Menagerie\\" (1948) by Tennessee Williams, \\"The Living Room\\" (1953) by Graham Greene, and \\"Becket\\" (1960) by Jean Anouilh. In the 1950s, he began directing films as well, with notable works such as \\"The Prisoner\\" (1955), \\"Me and the Colonel\\" (1958), and \\"Becket\\" (1964), the latter being an adaptation of the play he had directed earlier. On the other hand, Ridley Scott (born in 1937) is an English film director and producer, known for his incredible visual storytelling and the creation of worlds that immerse the audience completely. Unlike Glenville, Scott did not have a career as an actor but has worked primarily behind the camera. He began his career directing television commercials before venturing into feature films. Scott has an extensive list of highly influential films under his belt, such as \\"Alien\\" (1979), \\"Blade Runner\\" (1982), \\"Thelma & Louise\\" (1991), \\"Gladiator\\" (2000), \\"Black Hawk Down\\" (2001), \\"The Martian\\" (2015), and \\"Alien: Covenant\\" (2017), among others. His contribution to the sci-fi genre has been particularly substantial, with \\"Alien\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\" serving as prime examples. In conclusion, Peter Glenville was an English film and stage actor who transitioned into a successful directing career for both stage and screen. Ridley Scott is an English film director and producer who has had a significant impact on the film industry, particularly in the science fiction genre. While both have made exceptional contributions to the world of arts and entertainment, Peter Glenville is the figure who began his career as an actor before moving into directing roles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This statement refers to the idea that the Russian leader is attempting to strike a balance in the political landscape by catering to various groups of Russian voters who might hold differing views and priorities, in terms of their political affiliations or vision for the country. By \\"embracing old dictators,\\" the author seems to imply that the Russian leader is possibly maintaining close relations with leaders who have traditionally held autocratic power structures, likely as a way to garner support from those Russian voters who value a strong, centralized government that isn't afraid to make bold decisions. On the other hand, the statement also points out the Russian leader's efforts in \\"getting closer to the West.\\" This likely means that, in parallel with catering to voters who prefer strong, autocratic-like leadership, the Russian leader is also reaching out to the more liberal, Western-oriented political factions in an effort to accommodate their interests and perspectives as well. This could include, for example, promoting economic and diplomatic ties with Western countries who share democratic values, a move that would appeal to those Russian voters who support more open borders and increased international cooperation. This balancing act could be an attempt by the Russian leader to prevent any potential political or social unrest that may arise from neglecting either of these two diverse, yet influential, groups of voters. By trying to satisfy the interests of both ends of the political spectrum, the Russian leader may hope to maintain overall social stability and secure popular support throughout the country. In conclusion, the statement implies that the Russian leader is strategically juggling the interests of various Russian voters in order to cater to their differing political priorities, thereby ensuring both the stability of the country and their own political support.

UPDATED:. 09:45 EST, 24 January 2014. Desirable suburban areas with sky-high house prices suffer from a disproportionate number of burglaries, a survey of household thefts has revealed. Chorlton, in Greater Manchester, home to a large number of upmarket shops and bars, has more burglaries than anywhere else in Britain, with almost one in 20 people saying they have suffered a home invasion. Herne Hill and Muswell Hill, well-heeled suburbs of London where the average house price is more than £600,000, came second and third on the list of the country's top 20 burglary hotspots. Scroll down for the full list and Video. Burglary capital: London had the highest rate of burglaries with 12 out of the 20 worst areas. Hotspots: All of the top 10 postcodes were in cities, but 20th-placed was in Buckinghamshire. A spokesman for MoneySupermarket.com, which compiled the figures, said that burglars like to target wealthy areas as homes there are more likely to have desirable objects to steal. Its staff examined more than three million insurance quotes for burglary over the course of a year, noting where and when people declared they had been burgled before. The M21 postcode was the worst-hit with 45.2 claims per thousand people, or one in 22. SE24, in south London, was close behind - followed by the leafy north London suburb of Muswell Hill, home to middle-class icons like opera singer Lesley Garrett. Low crime: The area with the lowest number of burglaries was Basingstoke in Hampshire. More than half the postcodes on the. top 20 list were from London, including trendy neighbourhoods in the. east of the city such as Dalston, Hackney and Stoke Newington. Perhaps most surprisingly of all, the number 20 spot was taken by a clutch of sleepy towns in Buckinghamshire. Out. of all 20 postcodes featured on the list, all but three have house. prices which are higher than the national average of £176,000, according. to data from property website Zoopla. Suburban: But Chorlton-cum-Hardy in Manchester is the UK's worst burglary hotspot. Some relatively rural areas proved to be the safest spots in Britain - the Hampshire towns of Basingstoke, Chandler's Ford and Havant topped a list of the postcodes with the fewest burglaries. Bideford in Devon, the East Riding of Yorkshire and beauty spots on the Scottish coast were also listed among the least crime-ridden areas. Kevin Pratt, from MoneySupermarket, said: 'While the M21 postal district in Manchester is the country's most notorious burglary claim hotspot, it is London that dominates the top 20 rankings. 'But just because somewhere is named a claim hotspot, it doesn't actually mean the area in question is not a nice place to live. 'Thieves often target areas with wealthy residents and desirable properties where the rewards are potentially greater or quieter areas where they think there is less risk of being caught red-handed.' 1.

Please answer the following question: This article: In selecting his crew, De Long's priority was men with Arctic experience. For his second-in-command he chose lieutenant Charles W. Chipp, who had served with him on the Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George W. Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William F. C. Nindemann, a Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John W. Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was syphilis, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.Two others from Jeannette's voyage from Le Havre, carpenter Albert Sweetman and boatswain John Cole, were enlisted, as was the Herald's meteorologist, Jerome Collins. Dubbed \\"chief scientist,\\" he was in charge of the Edison apparatus and of a rudimentary telephone system that De Long hoped to utilize. The remaining places were filled from a long list of applicants; the cook and steward were recruited by Danenhower from San Francisco's Chinatown. contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the navigator for whose medical lapses Ambler felt the probable cause was syphilis?, what is it ?

Question: A scientist, John, has two containers of the same noble gas. John sends electricity through container A. Just as he is about to activate the electricity for container B, the power goes out, and he is unable to do so. Frustrated, John goes to find the circuit breaker to see if a fuse has blown.  Will the gas in container A have a higher or lower energy level than container B? Answer:","output":"The gas in container A will have a higher energy level than container B due to the effect of the electric current passed through container A before the power went out. A noble gas is a chemical element that belongs to group 18 of the periodic table. These gases have similar properties, including their full electron shells, which make them chemically inert and stable. Some common noble gases include helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon. When an electric current is passed through a noble gas, the gas molecules absorb energy from the electric field, causing their electrons to move to higher energy levels, or excited states. This process is called electrical discharge or excitation. When John sends electricity through container A, the noble gas inside it absorbs energy from the electric current. Electrons in the gas atoms jump to higher energy levels, consequently increasing the overall energy state of the gas in container A. Since the power goes out before John has the chance to apply the same electric current to container B, the gas in container B remains in its original, lower energy state. In conclusion, the gas in container A will have a higher energy level than the gas in container B as a result of the electric current passed through container A before the power went out. As the noble gas in container A has absorbed energy from the electric current and its electrons have been excited to higher levels, it possesses more energy than the noble gas in container B, which hasn't undergone the same excitation process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information:  - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.  - \`\` When the People Fell '' is a science fiction short story by Cordwainer Smith , set in his \`\` Instrumentality '' universe . It was originally published in Galaxy Science Fiction magazine in April , 1959 , and is most recently collected in The Rediscovery of Man , and in the collection of which it is the title story . The story takes place relatively early in the Instrumentality timeline , and a \`\` scanner Vomact '' appears both in this story and the classic story \`\` Scanners Live in Vain '' . The story recounts , in \`\` flashback '' form -- an interview between a reporter and a crusty old - timer -- a risky attempt by a future Chinese government to claim and settle the planet Venus , at a time when China is the only ethnic nation on Earth which has survived as a separate entity through a global nuclear war and a long dark age which followed . The story implicitly compares Western and Chinese approaches to solving an impossible problem and has the Chinese solution succeed , but at a cost Westerners would find repugnant .  - In the science fiction of Cordwainer Smith, the Instrumentality of Mankind refers both to Smith's personal future history and universe and to the central government of humanity. \\"The Instrumentality of Mankind\\" is also the title of a paperback collection of short stories by Cordwainer Smith published in 1979 (now superseded by the later \\"The Rediscovery of Man\\", which collects all of Smith's short stories).  - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.  - East Asia is the eastern subregion of the Asian continent, which can be defined in either geographical or ethno-cultural terms. Geographically and geopolitically, it includes China, Hong Kong, and Macao; Mongolia and Taiwan; North and South Korea; and Japan; it covers about , or about 28% of the Asian continent, about twice the area of Europe.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - A science fiction magazine is a publication that offers primarily science fiction, either in a hard copy periodical format or on the Internet.  - Horace Leonard \\"H. L.\\" Gold (April 26, 1914  February 21, 1996) was an American science fiction writer and editor. Born in Canada, Gold moved to the United States at the age of two. He was most noted for bringing an innovative and fresh approach to science fiction while he was the editor of \\"Galaxy Science Fiction\\", and also wrote briefly for DC Comics.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Galaxy Science Fiction was an American digest-size science fiction magazine, published from 1950 to 1980. It was founded by an Italian company, World Editions, which was looking to break into the American market. World Editions hired as editor H. L. Gold, who rapidly made \\"Galaxy\\" the leading science fiction (sf) magazine of its time, focusing on stories about social issues rather than technology.  - NESFA Press is the publishing arm of the New England Science Fiction Association, Inc. The NESFA Press primarily produces three types of books:  - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".  - The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith (ISBN 0-915368-56-0) is a 1993 book containing the complete collected short fiction of science fiction author Cordwainer Smith. It was edited by James A. Mann and published by NESFA Press.  - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis. Among its occasional nicknames are \\"Old Line State\\", the \\"Free State\\", and the \\"Chesapeake Bay State\\". The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England.   - Cordwainer Smith was the pen-name used by American author Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger (July 11, 1913  August 6, 1966) for his science fiction works. Linebarger was a noted East Asia scholar and expert in psychological warfare. (\\"Cordwainer\\" is an archaic word for \\"a worker in cordwain or cordovan leather; a shoemaker\\", and a \\"smith\\" is \\"one who works in iron or other metals; esp. a blacksmith or farrier\\": two kinds of skilled workers with traditional materials.) Linebarger also employed the literary pseudonyms \\"Carmichael Smith\\" (for his political thriller \\"Atomsk\\"), \\"Anthony Bearden\\" (for his poetry) and \\"Felix C. Forrest\\" (for the novels \\"Ria\\" and \\"Carola\\").  He died of a heart attack in 1966 at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, at age 53.  - Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology.  - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - \\"Scanners Live in Vain\\" is a science fiction short story by Cordwainer Smith (pen name of Paul Linebarger), set in his Instrumentality of Mankind future history. It was originally published in the magazine \\"Fantasy Book\\" in 1950. It was judged by the Science Fiction Writers of America to be one of the finest short stories prior to 1965 and was included in the anthology \\"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 19291964\\". A revised text, based on Linebarger's original manuscript, appears in the 1993 NESFA Press collection \\"The Rediscovery of Man\\" (where it is accompanied by a facsimile of his original cover letter) and the 2007 collection \\"When the People Fell\\". The story was nominated for a Retro Hugo award in 2001. It has been published in Hebrew, Italian, French, German and Dutch translations.  - The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 19291964 is a 1970 anthology of science fiction short stories, edited by Robert Silverberg. It is generally considered one of the best of the many science fiction anthologies. Author Lester del Rey said that \\"it even lives up to its subtitle\\", referring to the volume's boast of containing \\"The Greatest Science-Fiction Stories of All Time\\".   - Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from ) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Its abundance in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars, where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a supernova, which scatters the iron into space.  - A future history is a postulated history of the future and is used by authors in the subgenre of speculative fiction (or science fiction) to construct a common background for fiction. Sometimes the author publishes a timeline of events in the history, while other times the reader can reconstruct the order of the stories from information provided therein.

Problem:I am a musician and a subway commuter. I bought these earplugs for reading on the train and long evenings at rehearsal. I find that they are among the best earplugs I have tried in terms of fidelity. They cut volume down to a comfortable level for extended exposure while still letting enough mid and high frequencies through that I can understand what I am hearing. They wouldn't be great for total sound blockage, but they're very nice for reducing ear fatigue in loud environments. Unfortunately, they are also rather small and easy to lose, especially since they're clear. The canister that they come in is a bit narrow, and it can be hard to fish the plugs out. Sometimes I use a car key, and I worry that it may look like I am about to perform some sort of illicit sniffing activity. This whole ordeal also led to me losing one of the plugs within a week or two of getting them-- it got dropped on the floor of a dark club while I was trying to fish it out of its canister. Whoops.

In 1997, Martina Hingis became the first to earn over 3 million during a single year.  In 2003, Kim Clijsters surpassed 4 million in earnings for a single year. In 2006, Venus Williams and the WTA pushed for equal prize money at both the French Open and The Championships, Wimbledon.  Both of these Grand Slam (tennis) events relented in 2007 and awarded equal money for the first time.  This enabled Justine Henin, who won the French Open in 2007, to earn over 5 million that year, becoming the first woman in sports to do this. In 2009, Serena Williams went over the six million mark by earning over 6.5 million in a single year. Then in 2012 both Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka became first players to exceed 7 million in prize money in a single season. In 2013 Serena Williams went over the twelve million dollar mark winning 12,385,572 in a single year. By virtue of winning the 2014 US Open (tennis) and the 2014 US Open series, Serena Williams had the largest payday in the history of tennis (men or women) at four million dollars. Additionally, Serena Williams has won the most Grand Slams (23 as of 2017) in the Open era, beating out tennis legend, Steffi Graf. Serena is only one behind Margaret Court for total singles titles in womens tennis. Her career prize money of 84 million is more than twice as much as any other female athletes.

Martina Hingis earned 3 million in one season in 1997. To find out how many years passed between these two events, you can subtract the earlier year (1982) from the later year (1997). So, 1997 minus 1982 equals 15 years. Therefore, it took 15 years from when Navratilova set the record for Hingis to earn 3 million in one season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"The VECTOR/CAN tool and the term \\"vector\\" are not inquiring about the same information, as they refer to two entirely different concepts. In this answer, I will provide a detailed explanation of both: VECTOR/CAN tool and vectors in general. 1. VECTOR/CAN tool The VECTOR/CAN (Controller Area Network) tool refers to a suite of hardware and software tools developed by Vector Informatik, a German-based company specializing in the development and sales of software tools and embedded components for the development of electronic systems, particularly focusing on those systems embedded in automobiles. The VECTOR/CAN tool is designed to assist engineers and developers in their work related to CAN, CAN FD (CAN with Flexible Data-Rate), and LIN (Local Interconnect Network) communication protocols, enabling reliable data exchange for automotive and industrial applications. The VECTOR/CAN tool consists of various hardware tools and software solutions, some of which include: a) CANoe: A development and test tool for CAN, LIN, and other network simulation/analytics b) CANalyzer: A measurement and analysis tool for the observation, analysis, and testing of CAN systems c) CANape: A software tool for measurement, calibration, and diagnostic tasks in automotive electronic systems d) CANcaseXL: A compact interface device supporting different protocols (CAN, LIN, J1708, J1939, and others) e) VN series interface devices: A line of versatile high-performance interfaces specialized for different applications and protocols These tools help engineers ensure the effective design, development, testing, and calibration of networked electronic systems, specifically those utilizing CAN, LIN, and similar communication protocols. 2. Vector (in general) In a broader context, the term \\"vector\\" refers to a mathematical and geometric concept used in various disciplines, such as physics, engineering, computer science, and biology. A vector is primarily characterized by its magnitude (or length) and direction. It is often depicted graphically as an arrow with an initial point (tail) and a terminal point (head), representing the directional movement from one point to another. Vectors are utilized in different fields for various purposes, and some of the applications include: a) Physics: Vectors are used in physics to represent physical quantities that not only have a magnitude, but also a direction. Examples include force, velocity, and acceleration. b) Engineering: Engineers use vectors for calculating mechanical stresses and strains, determining fluid flow directions, and analyzing electrical fields. c) Computer Science: In computer graphics, vectors are applied to operations like image scaling, rotations, and transformations. d) Biology: Vectors are employed in molecular biology, mainly as vehicles to transfer genetic material between organisms or cells, such as plasmids in bacteria. In summary, VECTOR/CAN tools are specialized software and hardware tools designed for CAN, LIN, and other networked systems' development and analysis, specifically in the automotive industry. On the other hand, the term \\"vector\\" refers to the mathematical concept of an entity possessing direction and magnitude, which is useful in various scientific disciplines, including physics, engineering, and computer science.

Context: Joan Croft Halt railway station was a small halt on the East Coast Main Line (ECML) situated by a level crossing at Joan Croft Junction in South Yorkshire, England. The junction gives access from the ECML to the Skellow line of the West Riding and Grimsby Railway and eventually to Hull, Immingham and Grimsby Docks. Hypothesis: Joan Croft Junction was in North Yorkshire, England","output":"No, the hypothesis that Joan Croft Junction was in North Yorkshire, England seems inaccurate based on the context provided. According to the context, Joan Croft Halt railway station, the railway halt by which the level crossing at Joan Croft Junction was situated, is distinctly mentioned to be located in South Yorkshire, England, not North Yorkshire. Let's delve deeper into this geographical aspect to understand it better. Yorkshire is a historic county in northern England which is currently divided into four parts namely North Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, and East Riding of Yorkshire. The context indicates that Joan Croft Halt which is in turn connected to Joan Croft Junction is in South Yorkshire. Joan Croft Halt railway station was a small station located on the East Coast Main Line (ECML). The ECML is a major railway artery in the UK that connects London to Edinburgh, passing through several counties including North Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. This junction at Joan Croft gave access from ECML to the Skellow line of the West Riding and Grimsby Railway. The context further states that this line further connects to places such as Hull, Immingham, and Grimsby Docks. Based on the information available in the context, it is clear that it is in South Yorkshire. The geographical location of Joan Croft Junction being at South Yorkshire is a significant fact as it would have served this part of the county and provided strategic railway connectivity across the country. Should it have been in North Yorkshire, it would serve a different demographic and geography, and possibly have different strategic implications too.  Thus, based on the given information, it’s adequately clear that the Joan Croft Junction was distinctly located in South Yorkshire, England, and not North Yorkshire.

News article: CHICAGO |      CHICAGO (Reuters) - Eating bacon, sausage, hot dogs and other processed meats can raise the risk of heart disease and diabetes, U.S. researchers said on Monday in a study that identifies the real bad boys of the meat counter.      Eating unprocessed beef, pork or lamb appeared not to raise risks of heart attacks and diabetes, they said, suggesting that salt and chemical preservatives may be the real cause of these two health problems associated with eating meat.      The study, an analysis of other research called a meta-analysis, did not look at high blood pressure or cancer, which are also linked with high meat consumption.      \\"To lower risk of heart attacks and diabetes, people should consider which types of meats they are eating,\\" said Renata Micha of the Harvard School of Public Health, whose study appears in the journal Circulation.      \\"Processed meats such as bacon, salami, sausages, hot dogs and processed deli meats may be the most important to avoid,\\" Micha said in a statement.      Based on her findings, she said people who eat one serving per week or less of processed meats have less of a risk.      The American Meat Institute objected to the findings, saying it was only one study and that it stands in contrast to other studies and the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans.      \\"At best, this hypothesis merits further study. It is certainly no reason for dietary changes,\\" James Hodges, president of the American Meat Institute, said in a statement.      Most dietary guidelines recommend eating less meat. Individual studies looking at relationships between eating meat and cardiovascular diseases and diabetes have had mixed results.      But studies rarely look for differences in risk between processed and unprocessed red meats, Micha said.      She and colleagues did a systematic review of nearly 1,600 studies from around the world looking for evidence of a link between eating processed and unprocessed red meat and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.      They defined processed meat as any meat preserved by smoking, curing or salting, or with the addition of chemical preservatives. Meats in this category included bacon, salami, sausages, hot dogs or processed deli or luncheon meats.      Unprocessed red meat included beef, lamb or pork but not poultry.      They found that on average, each 1.8 oz (50 grams) daily serving of processed meat a day -- one to two slices of deli meats or one hot dog -- was associated with a 42 percent higher risk of heart disease and a 19 percent higher risk of developing diabetes.      They found no higher heart or diabetes risk in people who ate only unprocessed red meats. ||||| Pooling the study results, the researchers found that eating unprocessed red meat was not associated with heart disease or diabetes. But people who ate at least one serving a day of processed red meat -- one hot dog or two deli slices -- had a 42 percent higher risk of heart disease and a 19 percent higher risk of diabetes than people who did not eat processed red meat.      Renata Micha of the Harvard School of Public Health and her colleagues systematically reviewed more than 1,500 studies about the relationship between red meat, processed meat, and total meat consumption and heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. They selected 20 studies involving more than 1.2 million participants from 10 countries who were followed for up to 18 years. More than 23,000 people developed heart disease, more than 2,200 had strokes, and more than 10,000 had diabetes.      Red meat has long been cast as a bad player in heart disease and diabetes. But a new analysis from Harvard suggests that processed red meat -- think bacon, salami, and hot dogs -- may be the true dietary villain.      Total consumption of processed and unprocessed meat fell in between, with a 12 percent increased risk of diabetes compared to non-meat eaters. Results for heart disease were not conclusive. Neither kind of meat was tied to stroke, but because only 3 of the 20 studies looked at stroke, the sample was too small to draw statistically valid conclusions, the authors said.      Recommendations to cut down on red meat usually focus on the fat and cholesterol they contain, which can clog coronary arteries. But both processed and unprocessed meat contain similar amounts, the researchers found. People who ate the two kinds of meats were alike when it came to smoking, exercise, and other lifestyle factors.      The researchers say the salt and preservatives found in processed meat may account for the difference. Some processed meat has four times the salt that unprocessed meat has, and salt is a known contributor to high blood pressure, which can cause heart disease. Processed meat preservatives such as nitrates have been linked to lowered glucose tolerance, which is a factor in diabetes.      The American Meat Institute Foundation took issue with the study. \\"At best, this hypothesis merits further study. It is certainly no reason for dietary changes,\\" James H. Hodges, the trade group's president, said in an e-mailed statement. \\"The body of evidence clearly demonstrates that processed meat is a healthy part of a balanced diet. Meat contains protein, amino acids and essential nutrients like iron and zinc that are the keys to good health.\\"      The Harvard analysis, published online today in the journal Circulation, doesn't prove cause and effect between processed meat and these diseases, but it does make a compelling argument for studying processed and unprocessed meat separately. And unprocessed meat isn't off the hook, having been linked in other research to higher rates of colon cancer.      \\"People should not use this finding as an excuse to eat all the unprocessed meat you like,\\" Micha, a research fellow in epidemiology, said in an interview. \\"We know fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish are associated with lower risk. People should put more emphasis on increasing foods in their diet that are shown to be protective.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Eating processed meats such as bacon, sausage, hot dogs, and deli meats can raise the risk of heart disease and diabetes, according to a study by U.S. researchers. Unprocessed meats like beef, pork, and lamb do not appear to raise these risks, suggesting that salt and chemical preservatives in processed meats might be the actual cause of health problems. The study analyzed 1,600 studies and found that each 50-gram daily serving of processed meat was associated with a 42% higher risk of heart disease and a 19% higher risk of developing diabetes.

However, it does not provide any direct information about the past accessibility of the mansion when it was not owned by the city.  The hypothesis suggests that the mansion was open to visitors before it became city property. Since the information provided in the premise does not allow us to establish a causal relationship or direct correlation between city ownership and the closure of the mansion, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the provided premise. In order to establish the validity of the hypothesis, we would need additional evidence that would either confirm or refute the mansion's accessibility before its city ownership. This evidence could be available in the form of historical documents, testimony from local residents, or records from the previous property owners, highlighting whether the property was open to visitors before it was owned by the city or not. It is important to differentiate between the possible scenarios while evaluating any hypothesis in the context of a given premise. The following scenarios can be considered: 1. The mansion was open to visitors before the city took ownership, and the change in ownership led to its closure for visitors. 2. The mansion was inaccessible to visitors even before the city took ownership, and the current property status has no impact on the access policy. 3. The mansion's accessibility status has not changed with the change in ownership, indicating that it was closed to visitors even before the city acquired it. Due to the presence of multiple possible scenarios and a lack of substantial evidence to support or contradict the hypothesis based solely on the premise, it would be premature to conclude that the hypothesis is true. Therefore, if the premise is true, we cannot deduce with certainty that the hypothesis is true as well.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - A dam is built in an area prone to flooding - A large amount of rain occurs - The water builds up behind the dam - The dam opens its floodgates when it starts to get full - The water flows into a river below the dam - The dam closes its gates - The dam will occasionally open its gates again to gradually release more water - Eventually all of the floodwater will be slowly released into the river without causing any flood damage.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose water levels rise due to global warming happens, how will it affect floodgates are destroyed.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Step 1: Understand the original process The original process describes the proper functioning of a dam in preventing flood damage. The dam controls the water flow by opening and closing its floodgates when needed. Step 2: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis states that water levels rise due to global warming, and as a result, floodgates are destroyed. Step 3: Examine the effect of the perturbation on the process In the case of the perturbation hypothesis, the destruction of the floodgates causes the dam to lose its primary method of controlling water flow. This will lead to improper water management during heavy rainfall or floods. Step 4: Assess the consequences of the perturbation With the floodgates destroyed: 1. The dam cannot open to release water when it gets full.  2. The overflow of water will no longer be controlled.  3. The water in the river below the dam will rise more rapidly without controlled water release.  4. The risk of flooding increases for the surrounding areas.  Step 5: Conclusion Yes, the supposed perturbation of rising water levels due to global warming and the destruction of the floodgates has a direct effect on the process of flood management. By destroying the floodgates, the dam cannot perform its function efficiently, thus increasing the risk of floods and flood damage in the surrounding areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write an article based on this summary: – Next month, a Spanish court will hear arguments in a most unusual case: A woman who claims to own the sun has sued eBay for blocking her extraterrestrial real estate sales. Though it sounds a little nuts, a court in Madrid has ruled that 54-year-old Maria Angeles Duran has the right to have her case heard, reports the International Business Times. The court won't rule on the larger issue of whether Duran's claim of ownership is legit, but on the narrower one of whether she violated eBay's seller agreement. She had been selling parcels of about 11 square feet for about 1 each and had racked up 600 orders before eBay shut her down. Because nothing tangible was sold, it feared a scam. Duran says she was never able to collect her money and is suing for about 11,000 in damages, reports the Consumerist. “I am not a stupid person and I know the law,” Duran has said of her solar real estate gambit. She's basing her claim on a loophole in the UN's Outer Space Treaty that says no nation can stake ownership to a heavenly body but makes no mention of individuals—borrowing the strategy used by this entrepreneur's claim on the moon. Duran, as you might imagine, is an eclectic character, observes the Washington Post. \\"She’s studied nursing and law, dreamt up her own religion, and penned a kinky romance novel,\\" writes Caitlin Dewey. The story notes that Duran is framing her sun fight as a statement against the corporate world and promises that any profits will go to charity.

This quest leads him to challenge Lancey \`\` The Man '' Howard , an older player widely considered to be the best , culminating in a climactic final poker hand between the two . The script , adapted from Richard Jessup 's novel , was written by Ring Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern ; it was Lardner 's first major studio work since his 1947 blacklisting as one of The Hollywood Ten . The film was directed by Norman Jewison and stars Steve McQueen in the title role and Edward G. Robinson as Howard . Jewison , who replaced original director Sam Peckinpah shortly after filming began , describes The Cincinnati Kid as his \`\` ugly duckling '' film . He considers it the film that allowed him to transition from the lighter comedic films he had previously been making and take on more serious films and subjects . The film garnered mixed reviews from critics on its initial release ; supporting actors Robinson and Joan Blondell earned award nominations for their performances .  - A card game is any game using playing cards as the primary device with which the game is played, be they traditional or game-specific. Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such as poker). A small number of card games played with traditional decks have formally standardized rules, but most are folk games whose rules vary by region, culture, and person.  - Poker is a family of gambling card games, but is often considered a skill based game. All poker variants involve betting as an intrinsic part of play, and determine the winner of each hand according to the combinations of players' cards, at least some of which remain hidden until the end of the hand. Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt, the number of shared or \\"community\\" cards, the number of cards that remain hidden, and the betting procedures.  - Gambling is the wagering of money or something of value (referred to as \\"the stakes\\") on an event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning money and/or material goods. Gambling thus requires three elements be present: consideration, chance and prize. The outcome of the wager is often immediate, such as a single roll of dice, a spin of a roulette wheel, or a horse crossing the finish line, but longer time frames are also common, allowing wagers on the outcome of a future sports contest or even an entire sports season.

Question: Information:  - Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds to create internal rhyming within phrases or sentences, and together with alliteration and consonance serves as one of the building blocks of verse. Assonance does not have to be a rhyme; the identity of which depends merely on sequence of both vowel and consonant sounds.  - A strophe is a poetic term originally referring to the first part of the ode in Ancient Greek tragedy, followed by the antistrophe and epode. The term has been extended to also mean a structural division of a poem containing stanzas of varying line length. Strophic poetry is to be contrasted with poems composed line-by-line non-stanzaically, such as Greek epic poems or English blank verse, to which the term \\"stichic\\" applies.  - Decasyllable (Italian: \\"decasillabo\\", French: \\"décasyllabe\\", Serbian: \\"\\",\\"deseterac\\" ) is a poetic meter of ten syllables used in poetic traditions of syllabic verse. In languages with a stress accent (accentual verse), it is the equivalent of pentameter with iambs or trochees (particularly iambic pentameter).  - Epode, in verse, is the third part of an ode, which followed the strophe and the antistrophe, and completed the movement.  - In poetry, a stanza (from Italian \\"stanza\\" , \\"room\\") is a grouped set of lines within a poem, usually set off from other stanzas by a blank line or indentation. Stanzas can have regular rhyme and metrical schemes, though stanzas are not strictly required to have either. There are many unique . Some stanzaic forms are simple, such as four-line quatrains. Other forms are more complex, such as the Spenserian stanza. Fixed verse poems, such as sestinas, can be defined by the number and form of their stanzas. The term \\"stanza\\" is similar to \\"strophe\\", though strophe is sometimes used to refer to irregular set of lines, as opposed to regular, rhymed stanzas.  - Poetry made up of lines of the same approximate meter and length, not broken up into stanzas, is called stichic (as opposed to stanzaic, e.g.). Most poetry from the Old English period is considered stichic. A more contemporary example is Joanna Baille's \\"Hay making\\"  - A laisse is a type of stanza, of varying length, found in medieval French literature, specifically medieval French epic poetry (the \\"chanson de geste\\"), such as \\"The Song of Roland\\". In early works, each laisse was made up of (mono) assonanced verses, although the appearance of (mono) rhymed laisses was increasingly common in later poems. Within a poem, the length of each separate laisse is variable (whereas the metric length of the verses is invariable, each verse having the same syllable length, typically decasyllables or, occasionally, alexandrines.  - Medieval French literature is, for the purpose of this article, literature written in Oïl languages (particularly Old French and early Middle French) during the period from the eleventh century to the end of the fifteenth century.  - The chanson de geste, Old French for \\"song of heroic deeds\\" (from \\"gesta\\": Latin: \\"deeds, actions accomplished\\"), is a medieval narrative, a type of epic poem that appears at the dawn of French literature. The earliest known poems of this genre date from the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, before the emergence of the lyric poetry of the trouvères (troubadours) and the earliest verse romances. They reached their apogee in the period 11501250.   - Alexandrine is a name used for several distinct types of verse line with related metrical structures, most of which are ultimately derived from the classical French alexandrine. The line's name derives from its use in the Medieval French \\"Roman d'Alexandre\\" of 1170, although it had already been used several decades earlier in \\"Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne\\". The foundation of most alexandrines consists of two hemistichs (half-lines) of six syllables each, separated by a caesura (a word break, though often realized as a stronger syntactic break):  - A rhyme is a repetition of similar sounds (or the same sound) in two or more words, most often in the final syllables of lines in poems and songs. The word \\"rhyme\\" is also a \\"pars pro toto\\" (\\"a part (taken) for the whole\\") that means a short poem, such as a rhyming couplet or other brief rhyming poem such as nursery rhymes.  - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - An epic poem, epic (from Latin \\"epicus\\", from the Ancient Greek adjective , \\"epikos\\", from , \\"epos\\", \\"word, story, poem\\"), epos (from Latin \\"epos\\", from Greek , \\"epos\\"), or epopee (from French \\"épopée\\", from neo-Latin \\"epopoeia\\", from Ancient Greek , \\"epopoiia\\") is a lengthy narrative poem, ordinarily concerning a serious subject containing details of heroic deeds and events significant to a culture or nation. Milman Parry and Albert Lord have argued that the Homeric epics, the earliest works of Western literature, were fundamentally an oral poetic form. These works form the basis of the epic genre in Western literature. Nearly all Western epic (including Virgil's \\"Aeneid\\" and Dante's \\"Divine Comedy\\") self-consciously presents itself as a continuation of the tradition begun by these poems. Classical epic employs dactylic hexameter and recounts a journey, either physical (as typified by Odysseus in the \\"Odyssey\\") or mental (as typified by Achilles in the \\"Iliad\\") or both. Epics also tend to highlight cultural norms and to define or call into question cultural values, particularly as they pertain to heroism.  - Ode (from ) is a type of lyrical stanza. A classic ode is structured in three major parts: the \\"strophe\\", the \\"antistrophe\\", and the \\"epode\\". Different forms such as the \\"homostrophic ode\\" and the \\"irregular ode\\" also exist. It is an elaborately structured poem praising or glorifying an event or individual, describing nature intellectually as well as emotionally.  - Silva , in Spanish poetry , a strophe , laisse ( Sp. tirada ) consisting of in eleven - and seven - syllable lines : hendecasyllables ( endecasílabos ) and heptasyllables ( heptasílabos ) , the majority of which are rhymed although there is no fixed order or rhyme , nor is there a fixed number of lines . Silvas are used by persons of high rank , usually in soliloquies , and for highly emotional narration and description . The use of Silva can be found in Góngora 's Soledades .  - Medieval Spain. The Medieval period covers 400 years of different poetry texts and can be broken up into five categories  - The Song of Roland is an epic poem based on the Battle of Roncevaux in 778, during the reign of Charlemagne. It is the oldest surviving major work of French literature and exists in various manuscript versions, which testify to its enormous and enduring popularity in the 12th to 14th centuries.  - Blank verse is poetry written with regular metrical but unrhymed lines, almost always in iambic pentameter.

You upload your electronic file and they convert it into an eBook. You then include information about the book and choose a sales price. If you choose not to go through one of these platforms, then you'll need to create your own eCommerce site and fight for visibility. The most popular platforms include the following:  Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing Apple iBooks Barnes and Noble Nook Press Google Play Kobo Writing Life Each has different rules for publishing content. You should look around the sites and find each site's terms of service. Read it thoroughly to see whether the vendor allows you to publish public domain content and what terms/conditions apply.  Kobo, for example, will only give you a 20% royalty for public domain titles.  Apple iBooks and Nook Press have also refused to sell public domain work in the past. Amazon won't allow you to publish a public domain title if there is already a free version in their store. You should search the Amazon site to see if a title already is for sale. It's okay if there is a title so long as it is not for sale for free. Amazon, for example, will let you publish the public domain title if you differentiate your book. Your book will be differentiated if you do the following:  Offer a unique translation. This means you translate the book. Don't use an online translation app or use a translation that is in the public domain. Include unique annotations, such as literary critiques, study guides, detailed biographies or historical context. Provide 10 or more unique illustrations that relate to the book. Don't assume that because you found a book on the Internet that it is in the public domain. Also, you shouldn't assume a work isn't copyrighted because it lacks a copyright notice. Instead, you need to individually analyze each book based on the following:  Certain work is not eligible for copyright protection because it is common property, such as calendars or works by the U.S. government.  In the U.S., a book is in the public domain if it was published before 1923. Pre-1923 material is the safest material you can use. If the work was published after 1923 but before 1978, then it is in the public domain if it was published without a valid copyright notice. If the book was published after 1923 but before 1964, it is in the public domain if the copyright was not renewed. You can check if a work was renewed by searching at the Copyright Office. Be careful, however. Works might have been registered under different names. You're inviting a copyright infringement lawsuit if you publish a work that is protected. The copyrights for books published after 1978 will not expire until the middle of this century. The only way it is in the public domain is if the author dedicated it to the public domain. There should be a notice to that effect on the work. Online publishing changes rapidly. Vendors change their terms and conditions at will, and what was legal six months ago might no longer be allowed. Accordingly, stay up to date on publishing requirements.  Join different message boards for indie publishers so that you can keep up on changes to each publisher's terms and conditions. Also check your accounts regularly.

In music, sampling is the act of taking a portion, or sample, of one sound recording and reusing it as an instrument or a sound recording in a different song or piece. Sampling was originally developed by experimental musicians working with musique concrete and electroacoustic music, who physically manipulated tape loops or vinyl records on a phonograph. By the late 1960s, the use of tape loop sampling influenced the development of minimalist music and the production of psychedelic rock and jazz fusion. Hip hop music was the first popular music genre based on the art of sampling - being born from 1970s DJs who experimented with manipulating vinyl on two turntables and an audio mixer. Usually taken from movies, television, or other non-musical media, spoken word samples are often used to create atmosphere, to set a mood, or even comic effect. The American composer Steve Reich used samples from interviews with Holocaust survivors as a source for the melodies on the 1988 album Different Trains, performed by the Kronos Quartet.  Many genres utilize sampling of spoken word to induce a mood, and Goa trance often employs samples of people speaking about the use of psychoactives, spirituality, or science fiction themes. Industrial is known for samples from horror/sci-fi movies, news broadcasts, propaganda reels, and speeches by political figures. The band Ministry frequently samples George W. Bush. Paul Hardcastle used recordings of a news reporter, as well as a soldier and ambient noise of a protest, in his single \\"Nineteen,\\" a song about Vietnam war veterans and Posttraumatic stress disorder. The band Negativland samples from practically every form of popular media, ranging from infomercials to children's records. In the song \\"Civil War\\", Guns N' Roses samples from the 1967 film Cool Hand Luke, on the album Use Your Illusion II. Sludge band Dystopia make frequent use of samples, including news clips and recordings of junkies to create a bleak and nihilistic atmosphere.  Other bands that frequently used samples in their work are noise rockers Steel Pole Bath Tub and death metal band Skinless. The extreme metal band Mortician makes extensive usage of horror movie samples, which can sometimes be longer than the actual song itself. The American rapper and producer MF Doom frequently uses spoken word samples, taken from anything from old Spider-Man and Fantastic Four cartoons to Charles Bukowski's \\"Dinosauria, We\\" poem. Oasis used a clip from a John Lennon interview for their song \\"I'm Outta Time\\". Living Colour samples Malcolm X, John F. Kennedy, and Franklin D. Roosevelt in \\"Cult of Personality\\".

Market participants were starting to worry about rising inflation, which could have potentially hindered economic growth and put pressure on interest rates. However, data from the latest factory report has demonstrated a more stable and reassuring environment. As the factory report revealed a decline in input prices, market analysts have readjusted their predictions to reflect the decreased likelihood of rapid inflation. This decrease in input prices indicates a more sustainable growth pattern for manufacturing industries, alleviating previous concerns over inflation. Investors, who had been wary of the bond market due to the perceived threat of inflation, have now reassessed their positions, leading to increased demand and subsequent gains in U.S. bonds. Moreover, bond yields have retreated, suggesting that there is still sufficient demand for these fixed-income securities. This can be seen in the 10-year Treasury note, which has experienced a decline in its yield, resulting in greater demand for U.S. bonds in the market. In conclusion, the U.S. bond market is on an upward trajectory, thanks to a factory report that has successfully alleviated worries of rapidly rising inflation. Market participants are now less concerned about the bond market as well as overall economic growth, given the downward shift in input prices and more sustainable growth patterns. As a result, U.S. bonds are experiencing gains and bond yields have retreated, signaling increased demand for these fixed-income securities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Copper compounds in liquid form are used as a wood preservative, particularly in treating original portion of structures during restoration of damage due to dry rot. Together with zinc, copper wires may be placed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss.[citation needed] Textile fibers use copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics, as do ceramic glazes, stained glass and musical instruments. Electroplating commonly uses copper as a base for other metals such as nickel. What is used to implode structures for dry rot? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The question seems to be asking about the methods used to treat structures affected by dry rot, rather than the actual implosion of structures. Implosion is a technique primarily associated with the controlled demolition of large buildings, not the treatment of dry rot in structures. However, I can provide information on how copper compounds are used in treating wood affected by dry rot, as well as some other methods for addressing dry rot in structures. Dry rot is a type of wood decay caused by certain fungi that digest the cellulose and hemicellulose of the wood, leaving behind the lignin and resulting in a weakened, brittle structure. It typically occurs in areas with high humidity and poor ventilation, and can lead to significant damage to wooden structures over time if left untreated or improperly managed. Copper compounds have long been used as a wood preservative, particularly for treating areas affected by dry rot. They are generally applied in liquid form and may be used in conjunction with other methods or materials. Copper compounds work by creating a toxic environment for fungi, preventing their growth and spread throughout the wood. One common method of treating dry rot is to remove all affected wood and replace it with new, treated wood. This involves identifying the source of moisture that led to the initial fungal growth, eliminating it, and then removing any affected wood or other materials. New, treated wood is then installed to replace the damaged sections. It is important to ensure that the new wood is properly treated and protected from moisture to prevent future occurrences of dry rot. Another approach to treating dry rot involves using a borate-based treatment, which is a type of chemical that can penetrate into wood to kill the fungi causing dry rot. Borate treatments are generally considered less toxic and more environmentally friendly than traditional copper-based treatments. Fungi require moisture to thrive, so controlling the moisture levels in the affected area is a crucial step in preventing and treating dry rot. This may include improving ventilation, sealing any leaks or cracks that may be allowing moisture into the structure, and using dehumidifiers to reduce ambient humidity levels. Proper maintenance and inspection of wooden structures can also help in early detection of dry rot and prompt corrective action. To summarize, the implosion of structures is not a method used for treating dry rot. Instead, copper compounds, borate treatments, replacement of affected wood, and moisture control are common methods employed to address dry rot in wooden structures. Timely detection and treatment can help prevent significant damage and preserve the integrity of the structure in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Arundhati Bhattacharya is talking about the need for more women on the boards of Indian companies. And as the first female boss of India's largest public sector bank, State Bank of India, she knows what she's talking about. A 2013 ruling making it mandatory for publicly listed firms to have a minimum of one woman director on their boards has helped improve gender diversity, but \\"we need to stay on it for a few more years for it to have the desired impact,\\" says Mrs Bhattacharya. In 2015 females made up 11.2% of board members on Indian firms, double the 5.5% in 2010, according to a report by Credit Suisse which analysed 2,400 companies worldwide. The global average in 2015 was 14.7%, with Norway (46.7%) and France (34%) topping the list. While India has done well compared with China and South Korea, it still lags behind other Asian countries such as Thailand and Malaysia. But there are real advantages to increasing the number of female directors. Mrs Bhattacharya believes that companies with women directors make better quality decisions due to a wider diversity of views. Her views are echoed by Naina Lal Kidwai, former head of HSBC India, who is currently an independent director on the board of several companies in India. She says it will take a bit of time for everyone to become comfortable with the new dynamic but says that men are embracing the change. \\"Many women directors tell me it hasn't been easy but they are enjoying it. And in many instances, men have been very encouraging - which is a good sign,\\" says Mrs Kidwai. Like Mrs Bhattacharya, Mrs Kidwai feels that companies should not restrict themselves to just one female director. \\"The rule says a 'minimum of one woman' director but I think the ideal number will be two. This will help women have a stronger voice on the board.\\" India's recent improvements on female representation have partly been driven by the fact that it was starting from a low base. But another driver has been that many family-controlled companies - the majority of Indian firms - have appointed female family members, like their mothers, wives and daughters as directors. One example is India's richest man and chairman of Reliance Group, Mukesh Ambani, who appointed his wife Nita Ambani to the company board in 2014. Other big private corporations that have followed suit include Raymond Group and Godfrey Phillips. Pranav Haldea, managing director of research firm Prime Data, says many companies have done this just to comply with the new rules. \\"Women directors who come from the family have no voice on the board. In some cases, firms have also appointed independent directors, who may not be from the family but have friendly relations with the promoter,\\" he says. Mrs Kidwai is not too concerned about this. She believes that women in family-controlled businesses have remained on the sidelines because of the patriarchal mindset of Indian society, and says their board induction will give them a chance to prove that they are also capable of running a company, just like their husbands and brothers. \\"It's taken for granted that the son will inherit the business but now the daughter in the family will also get a chance to prove her mettle. And this may have a positive impact on succession planning in the future,\\" she says. While India has made progress in appointing females to board positions, this hasn't been matched by the number of women in senior management posts. In fact, the number of senior positions held by women has fallen, dropping from 7.8% in 2014 to 7.2% in 2016 and compared with a global average of 13.8%, according to the Credit Suisse study. Mrs Bhattacharya says the main reason for this is that many women quit or drop out midway through their careers to take up responsibilities at home. \\"In India, women are still considered the primary caregivers. And it is expected that they will be the ones to sacrifice [their careers] if someone is needed to look after the family.\\" Between 2005 and 2014, the number of working-age Indian women with a job dropped by 10%, according to data from the International Labour Organization. The drop was the largest of any country in the world during that period. While a handful of companies have introduced flexible working hours to help women juggle their responsibilities at home and work, at some stage most women face a difficult choice between career and family responsibilities. \\"Women feel more guilt as compared to men while taking that decision. At the core of it all is guilt. Women need more support systems,\\" says Mrs Kidwai. Nearly 10 million people are entering India's job market every year and nearly half of those are women. Without that support - which includes men taking up more responsibilities at home - it's unlikely that India will realise its ambition of becoming an economic superpower.

Title: Transmorphers Movie plot: In 2009, a race of aliens piloting giant robots have conquered Earth and forced humanity to live underground. They have done this by altering the environment, causing constant rainfall and darkness. Over 300 years later, after many generations of living underground, a small group of human rebels plan to finally take back their world from the mechanical invaders. They soon learn however that the aliens do not pilot the robots, but are the robots. A patrol, led by Lt. Blackthorn (Thomas Downey), is sent out to capture one of the robots, a Z-bot, so its operating ability can be studied. The patrol is suddenly ambushed by several robots, with some being able to reconfigure themselves, revealing different weapon systems. These units, the 'transmorphers', ambush humans by appearing as mundane features of the terrain, even fooling detection systems. The robots use \\"brain scans\\" to read the minds of humans to know their battle plans. After Blackthorn's patrol is destroyed by the machines, a female lead officer of the human resistance group, General Van Ryberg (Eliza Swenson), argues with fellow officers of the Military and Science Guilds about how to fight the war. Despite some protests, Van Ryberg decides to reinstate a disgraced soldier named Warren Mitchell (Matthew Wolf), who was court-martialed along with his right-hand man, Itchy (Griff Furst), and cryogenically frozen for insubordination. They had killed their unit officer five years earlier. Mitchell is glad to be reinstated, but learns that his former lover, Karina Nadir (Amy Weber), a fighter pilot, is now married to General Van Ryberg. Mitchell assembles a small military patrol with Itchy as his second-in-command, and Flight Commander Xandria Lux (Shaley Scott), as his military adviser. The patrol is sent out to capture a Z-bot, intact, so its fuel cells can be studied. They hope to shut the machines down by contaminating the fuel cell and placing it in a large radio tower which supposedly controls the machines. Mitchell and his group ambush and destroy a...

Please briefly summarize this news article: Ebola outbreak threatens food security in hardest-hit countries The world's worst Ebola epidemic has put harvests at risk and sent food prices soaring in West Africa, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said on Tuesday, warning the problem would intensify in coming months. The FAO issued a special alert for Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the three countries most affected by the outbreak, which has killed around 1,550 people since the virus was detected in the remote jungles of southeastern Guinea in March. Restrictions on people's movements and the establishment of quarantine zones to contain the spread of the hemorrhagic fever has led to panic buying, food shortages and price hikes in countries ill-prepared to absorb the shock. \\"Even prior to the Ebola outbreak, households in some of the most affected areas were spending up to 80 per cent of their incomes on food,\\" said Vincent Martin, head of an FAO unit in Dakar which is coordinating the agency's response. \\"Now these latest price spikes are effectively putting food completely out of their reach,\\" Martin said in a statement, adding the food crisis could hinder containment of the disease, which is typically spread via the bodily fluids of the sick. Rice and maize production will be scaled back during the fast-approaching main harvest season as migration and movement restrictions cause labour shortages on farms, FAO said. Cash crops like palm oil, cocoa and rubber will be seriously affected, squeezing the purchasing power of many families, who will also lose income and nutrition due to the ban on bush meat. Border crossing closures and the reduction of trade through seaports have tightened food supplies in the three countries, which are all net cereal importers, and propelled prices upwards, exacerbated by higher transport costs. The UN World Food Programme and FAO have approved an emergency program to deliver 65,000 tonnes of food to 1.3 million people affected by Ebola over a three-month period. The price of cassava at a market in the Liberian capital Monrovia rose 150 per cent in the first weeks of August, the FAO said, adding that currency depreciation in Sierra Leone and Liberia was likely to force prices up further. Elsewhere, the World Health Organization said Tuesday that tests show no link between Ebola outbreaks in West Africa and Congo. \\"Results from virus sequencing of samples from the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) were received last night,\\" WHO said in a statement. \\"The virus is the Zaire strain, in a lineage most closely related to a virus from the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, DRC. \\"These findings are reassuring, as they exclude the possibility that the virus has spread from West to Central Africa.\\" Summary:","output":"The Ebola outbreak is causing problems with food in West Africa. People are having trouble growing and getting food because many people are sick from Ebola. This leads to some families not having enough food and the prices of food increasing. The United Nations is trying to help by giving food to the people affected by Ebola."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Look for new hobbies to seem more interesting to other people.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Power of Being Yourself: Boosting Your Self-Esteem, Confidence, and Personal Growth Introduction In a world filled with constant pressure to conform, it can be quite challenging to truly be ourselves and embrace our individuality. However, being true to ourselves is essential for cultivating a healthy self-esteem and having fulfilling relationships. This article discusses the importance of being yourself, acting confidently around others, treating people with politeness and respect, having an optimistic attitude, focusing on others during conversations, being outgoing, and exploring new hobbies to seem more interesting to others. By incorporating these tips into your life, you can achieve personal growth, happiness, and a more positive outlook on life. 1. Be Yourself for Good Self-Esteem Your self-esteem is built on the foundation of your authentic self. When you embrace your true personality, beliefs, and values, you create a strong sense of self-worth. This, in turn, helps you navigate life's challenges and obstacles with more confidence and resilience. Accept and appreciate your unique qualities, and remember that nobody is perfect. By being yourself, you allow others to connect with you on a deeper level, fostering more meaningful relationships in the process. 2. Act Confident Around Others Confidence can be a powerful force that impacts how others perceive you and how you perceive yourself. Even if you don't feel confident all the time, acting as if you do can help you gradually develop genuine confidence. Make a conscious effort to maintain good posture, speak clearly, and make eye contact during conversations. Remember that people are drawn to confidence, and by projecting self-assurance, you’re more likely to earn the respect and admiration of others. 3. Treat Others with Politeness and Respect Being courteous and respectful in your interactions not only creates a positive atmosphere but also reflects well on your character. When you treat others with kindness and thoughtfulness, they are more likely to reciprocate that goodwill. This mutual respect can contribute to stronger relationships, better communication, and less conflict. Additionally, being polite and respectful to others contributes to a greater sense of self-worth and personal integrity. 4. Adopt an Optimistic Attitude An optimistic attitude can significantly influence your overall happiness and well-being. When you choose to focus on the positive aspects of life and recognize opportunities for growth and learning, you demonstrate resilience and adaptability. Others are more likely to enjoy being around you when you project a positive outlook. Take time to practice gratitude, reframe negative thoughts, and surround yourself with positive influences to cultivate a healthier mindset. 5. Focus on the Other Person in Conversations Showing genuine interest in the person you are speaking with can considerably enhance your communication skills and deepen your connections. Active listening, asking thoughtful questions, and providing meaningful feedback demonstrates to the other person that you value their opinions and are engaged in the conversation. By focusing on the other person and their needs, you create a supportive and empathetic environment that fosters trust and mutual understanding. 6. Be Outgoing and Open to New Experiences Being open to new experiences and engaging with others can greatly enrich your life. Embrace opportunities for personal growth, exploration, and self-discovery by participating in social events, taking up new hobbies, or even traveling to new places. By facing any fears and stepping outside your comfort zone, you can become a more well-rounded and interesting individual, attracting like-minded people and inspiring others along the way. 7. Explore New Hobbies to Seem More Interesting Pursuing new hobbies not only keeps your life engaging but also makes you a more interesting person to others. Find activities and interests that genuinely excite you and dedicate time to develop your skills and knowledge in those areas. By doing so, you allow others to connect with you based on shared interests and offer a chance for them to learn from your unique experiences. Conclusion In a world where individuality can sometimes be overshadowed by societal expectations, it is vital to stay true to ourselves and cultivate self-esteem, confidence, and personal growth. By incorporating the tips mentioned above into your life, you can achieve a more fulfilling and happy life while inspiring others to do the same. Remember, the power of being yourself cannot be underestimated – it is the key to unlocking your true potential and making a lasting impact on those around you."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics.  Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said.  Democrat Jones told supporters that Moore's character is the issue. \\"We know who we are, Alabama, we know who we are. This is an election to tell the world who we are and what we stand for.\\" President Trump likely believes that the Alabama Senate election: - not worthwhile to endorse heavily or to bring too much national attention to. - will be highly contended and drastically impacted by Roy Moore's allegations of sexual misconduct. - not enough information - swayed and in favor of the Republican candidate.","output":"The Alabama Senate election is highly contended and drastically impacted by Roy Moore's allegations of sexual misconduct.

Quality assurance: Department stores tend to carry reputable brands, which ensures that the leather jackets they sell are of good quality and durability. 4. Customer service: Department stores typically have staff members available to assist customers with their needs, answer questions, and provide recommendations. This can be especially helpful when looking for a specific type of leather jacket. 5. Return and exchange policies: If a customer has issues with the fit, style or sees any defects in the leather jacket, department stores generally offer hassle-free return or exchange policies. Comparing the other options provided: - Car seats: This choice is irrelevant for buying leather jackets, as car seats refer to the seating inside of a vehicle. - Grocery store: While some larger grocery stores might carry clothing items, it is not a typical location to shop for something as specific as leather jackets. - Stable: A stable is a place where horses are kept, and is not related to buying clothing items like leather jackets. - Sex shop: A sex shop is mainly focused on selling adult novelty items and lingerie, not leather jackets. Based on these reasons, choosing \\"department stores\\" as the answer is the most reasonable option when looking to purchase leather jackets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nora's aunt is being treated by Dr. Marcello Bassi (John Saxon). Nora's aunt passes away on the first night of Nora's visit and she walks to the nearby hospital to notify Dr. Bassi. On the way, she is mugged and knocked out in Piazza di Spagna. When she wakes up, she sees the body of dead woman, lying on the ground near her; a bearded man pulls a knife out of the woman's back. Nora reports this to the police in the hospital, who don't believe her when they find no evidence and think she's hallucinating. Later, at a cemetery, Nora meets a close friend of her aunt's, Laura Torrani (Valentina Cortese), who lives in the Piazza di Spagna. Laura plans to vacation soon and allows Nora to stay in her house for the remaining time of the vacation. Nora later explores Laura's closet and drawers and comes across newspaper clippings of articles on a serial killer dubbed the \\"Alphabet Killer\\" due to his having alphabetically killed people according to their surnames.

What can judging something wrong lead to? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options：  A. eat cake  B. responsibility  C. resentment  D. controversy  E. go to jail The answer to this question is:","output":"D. controversy, and C. resentment. Judging something wrong can lead to both controversy and resentment, coming from different aspects. When you judge something as being wrong, you are essentially expressing a personal opinion or standpoint. This could lead to controversy (D), especially if your judgment contradicts the opinions of others. In society, personal judgments on moral, legal, or ethical issues often lead to public debates and disagreements. For instance, differing judgments on political issues, civil rights, and other topics have sparked many controversies throughout history. Controversy arises from conflicting views and can escalate, causing further division among individuals or groups. Discussions could become heated and result in arguments or even hostility if not handled properly. However, although controversies can be a source of conflict, they also serve as a catalyst for change and progress by bringing important issues into the spotlight. Simultaneously, judging something wrong can lead to resentment (C). If your judgment negatively affects others, particularly if they do not believe they are in the wrong, it can breed resentment. This is particularly common in personal relationships when one person feels unfairly judged or criticized by another. Resentment can lead to bitterness, strained relationships, and even a breakdown of communication. An individual who feels judged may harbor negative emotions or feelings of animosity towards the person passing judgment, damaging interpersonal dynamics. Resentment can linger for a long time, hindering the healing of relationships and often leading to regrets. Thus, it is crucial, when passing judgment, to express oneself objectively and constructively, keeping the feelings of others in mind. Options A (eat cake) and E (go to jail) do not apply to the results of judging something wrong in general terms. Option B (responsibility) could be relevant in some contexts; for instance, if someone takes responsibility after being judged wrong, but it doesn't pertain as a direct consequence of the act of judgement. In conclusion, judging something wrong could lead to controversy due to conflicting views and to resentment from those who feel unfairly judged. It's important to navigate these situations carefully to maintain harmonious relationships and productive dialogues."},{"instruction":"Given that the center of ellipse C is at the origin O, and one of its foci F is at (sqrt{3},0).

This implies that the distance from the center to a focus, denoted as c, is sqrt{3}. Therefore, we have c=sqrt{3}. The semi-major axis is denoted as a, and the semi-minor axis is denoted as b. The relationship between a, b, and c for an ellipse is given by c^2 = a^2 - b^2. Since c=sqrt{3}, we have: [c^2 = 3 = a^2 - b^2] [a^2 = b^2 + 3] Given that the area of triangle OFB is frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, and knowing that the area of a triangle is given by frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}, we can deduce that: [frac{1}{2} times a times b = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}] [ab = sqrt{3}] Solving the system of equations a^2 = b^2 + 3 and ab = sqrt{3}, we find: [a = 2, quad b = 1] Therefore, the standard equation of the ellipse C is: [frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1] [boxed{frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1}] 2. **Finding the Coordinates of Point M** Let M(x_0, y_0) where x_0 > 0 and y_0 > 0.

The slope of a line through two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is given by frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}. Therefore, we have: [frac{y_0}{x_0 + 2} + frac{y_0}{x_0 - 2} = -frac{3}{4}] Solving these equations, we find: [x_0 = frac{6}{5}, quad y_0 = frac{4}{5}] Therefore, the coordinates of point M are: [boxed{Mleft(frac{6}{5}, frac{4}{5}right)}] 3. **Finding the Range of Real Number lambda** The equation of line MA_1 can be written as y = k_1(x + 2), which gives the y-intercept at point P(0, 2k_1). Similarly, the equation of line MA_2 is y = k_2(x - 2), giving the y-intercept at point Q(0, -2k_2). Given point B(0,1), we have: [overrightarrow{PB} = (0, 1 - 2k_1), quad overrightarrow{BQ} = (0, -1 - 2k_2)] Since overrightarrow{PB} = lambdaoverrightarrow{BQ}, we get: [lambda = frac{1 - 2k_1}{-1 - 2k_2}] Also, given that k_1k_2 = -frac{1}{4}, we find: [lambda = 2k_1] Since k_1 = sqrt{frac{1}{2 + x_0} - frac{1}{4}} and x_0 in (0, 2), we have k_1 in (0, frac{1}{2}).

This can be achieved by using the following expression:    [    frac{f(x, y, z, w) + f(-x, y, z, w) + f(x, -y, z, w) + f(-x, -y, z, w)}{4}    ] 3. **Substitute ( x ) for all variables:**    To find the total number of words of a given length ( n ), we substitute ( x ) for all four variables:    [    frac{f(x, x, x, x) + f(-x, x, x, x) + f(x, -x, x, x) + f(-x, -x, x, x)}{4}    ] 4. **Simplify the generating function:**    We simplify the generating function as follows:    [    f(x, x, x, x) = frac{1}{1 - 4x}    ]    [    f(-x, x, x, x) = frac{1}{1 - 2x}    ]    [    f(x, -x, x, x) = frac{1}{1 - 2x}    ]    [    f(-x, -x, x, x) = frac{1}{1}    ]    Therefore, the generating function becomes:    [    frac{1}{4} left[ frac{1}{1 - 4x} + frac{2}{1 - 2x} + 1 right]    ] 5. **Find the coefficient of ( x^n ):**    The coefficient of ( x^n ) in the generating function is:    [    frac{4^n + 2 cdot 2^n + 1}{4}    ]    For positive ( n ), this simplifies to:    [    frac{4^n + 2 cdot 2^n}{4} = 4^{n-1} + 2^{n-1}    ] The final answer is ( boxed{4^{n-1} + 2^{n-1}} )."},{"instruction":"f 80 percent of the test takers taking an old paper and pencil GMAT exam answered the first question on a given math section correctly, and 75 percent of the test takers answered the second question correctly, and 5 percent of the test takers answered neither question correctly, what percent answered both correctly?","output":"Let's assume there are 100 test takers for simplicity.

Differentiating both sides with respect to x, we get    [    {f'}(x) = {f'}(2)e^{x-2} - f(0) + x.    ] 2. **Solve for f(0)**: Setting x=2 in the derivative equation, we have    [    {f'}(2) = {f'}(2)e^{2-2} - f(0) + 2,    ]    which simplifies to    [    {f'}(2) = {f'}(2) - f(0) + 2.    ]    This implies    [    f(0) = 2.    ] 3. **Determine {f'}(2)**: Knowing f(0)=2, we substitute back into the equation derived from the given condition to find {f'}(2):    [    2 = {f'}(2)e^{-2}.    ]    Solving for {f'}(2), we find    [    {f'}(2) = 2e^{2}.    ] 4. **Express f(x) with known values**: With f(0)=2 and {f'}(2)=2e^{2}, we rewrite f(x) as    [    f(x) = 2e^{x} - 2x + frac{1}{2}x^{2}.    ] 5. **Analyze {f'}(x) for monotonic behavior**: We find the derivative of f(x) to be    [    {f'}(x) = 2e^{x} - 2 + x.    ]    At x=0, {f'}(0) = 2e^{0} - 2 + 0 = 0.

Therefore, the wholesale price of meat floss and salted egg yolk Qingtuan per box would be (a - 10) yuan, given that it's 10 yuan cheaper. The merchant bought the same number of boxes of each type, spending 800 yuan on sesame Qingtuan and 600 yuan on meat floss and salted egg yolk Qingtuan. This leads to the equations: - For sesame Qingtuan: frac{800}{a} boxes - For meat floss and salted egg yolk Qingtuan: frac{600}{a - 10} boxes Setting these equal to each other gives us the equation to solve for a: frac{800}{a} = frac{600}{a - 10} Cross-multiplying and solving for a yields: 800(a - 10) = 600a  800a - 8000 = 600a  200a = 8000  a = 40 Thus, the wholesale price of sesame Qingtuan per box is 40 yuan, and for meat floss and salted egg yolk Qingtuan, it's 40 - 10 = 30 yuan. boxed{text{Sesame Qingtuan: } 40 text{ yuan/box, Meat Floss and Salted Egg Yolk Qingtuan: } 30 text{ yuan/box}}  Part 2: Maximizing the Profit from Selling Sesame Qingtuan Let the selling price of sesame Qingtuan per box be x yuan.

The problem states that the number of deliveries grew from 100,000 in March to 121,000 in May, over a period of two months. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows: [100,000 cdot (1+x)^2 = 121,000] Dividing both sides by 100,000 to simplify: [(1+x)^2 = 1.21] Taking the square root of both sides: [1+x = sqrt{1.21}] [x = sqrt{1.21} - 1] [x = 1.1 - 1] [x = 0.1] Thus, the monthly average growth rate is 10%. However, we also find another solution when solving the quadratic equation: [x = -2.1] This solution does not make sense in the context of the problem, as a negative growth rate of this magnitude would imply a shrinking rather than growing number of deliveries. Therefore, we discard this solution. The monthly average growth rate of the total number of deliveries of this express delivery company is boxed{10%}.  Part 2: Calculating the Delivery Capability in June and Additional Agents Required Given the growth rate from part 1, we can calculate the expected number of deliveries in June: [121,000 cdot (1+0.1) = 133,100] Converting to thousands for easier comparison: [13.31 text{ thousand deliveries}] The current capacity of the 20 express delivery agents: [0.6 text{ thousand deliveries/agent/month} times 20 text{ agents} = 12 text{ thousand deliveries}] Since 12 < 13.31, the current team cannot handle the deliveries expected in June.

Since we have an obtuse triangle, 90^circ < 60^circ + alpha, which implies alpha > 30^circ. Also, since it's an angle of a triangle, 60^circ - alpha > 0^circ, which gives us alpha < 60^circ. Therefore, we have the range 30^circ < alpha < 60^circ. Let side a be opposite the angle 60^circ + alpha, and side b be opposite the angle 60^circ - alpha. By the law of sines, we have frac{a}{b} = frac{sin(60^circ + alpha)}{sin(60^circ - alpha)}.

Using the double-angle formulas, we get: tan alpha = frac{sqrt{3}(m - 1)}{m + 1}. Since 30^circ < alpha < 60^circ, we know that frac{sqrt{3}}{3} < tan alpha < sqrt{3}. Now, consider the function tan alpha = frac{sqrt{3}(m - 1)}{m + 1} as a function of m: 1. As alpha approaches 60^circ, tan alpha approaches sqrt{3}, which occurs when m approaches infinity. 2.

Since it intersects the y-axis at (0, -2), we know b = -2. Thus, the equation simplifies to y = kx - 2. To find k, we use the fact that the line passes through A(-1,0). Substituting x = -1 and y = 0 into the equation gives us 0 = k(-1) - 2. Solving for k, we get: [ 0 = -k - 2 implies k = -2. ] Therefore, the analytical expression of the linear function is: [ y = -2x - 2. ] # Part 2: Finding the Coordinates of Point C For a point C on the line AB such that the area of triangle BOC is 4, we denote the coordinates of C as (m, -2m - 2). The area of a triangle can be calculated as frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}. Here, OB serves as the base with a length of 2, and the distance from C to the y-axis (i.e., the absolute value of m) serves as the height.

Substituting these values back into the equation for the line gives us two possible coordinates for C: - For m = 4, we get C(4, -2(4) - 2) = C(4, -10). - For m = -4, we get C(-4, -2(-4) - 2) = C(-4, 6).

What is the minimum number of segments in this broken line?","output":"To determine the minimal number of segments in a broken line (polyline) that passes through the centers of all the squares in an ( n times n ) grid, we can use a careful counting argument. Here’s the detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Understanding the Problem:**    The problem is to find the minimal number of segments in a broken line that traverses through the centers of all ( n^2 ) squares in an ( n times n ) grid. The broken line (polyline) may intersect itself. 2. **Example Analysis for ( n = 5 ):**    Let's consider a concrete example for ( n = 5 ) as shown in the picture accompanying the problem.        ![Example Polyline](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_0918ecac094e52bfe73bg-19.jpg?height=500&width=552&top_left_y=1122&top_left_x=753)        The polyline in this example starts at a center of a square, follows a path through eight points in a 4-segment spiral configuration, and continues, capturing all points. 3. **General Strategy for any ( n ):**     To draw a polyline for any ( n ), we can use a similar spiral configuration starting from the center and spiraling out to cover all ( n^2 ) points.     This results in a polyline consisting of exactly ( 2n-2 ) segments. 4. **General Case Proof:**     Let's prove that fewer than ( 2n - 2 ) segments won't suffice.     Let:     - ( l ) be the number of horizontal segments.     - ( m ) be the number of vertical segments.     Each segment must pass through at least one row or column of centers in the grid.  5. **Counting Segments:**     - If ( l geq n ): The line must visit all rows at least once, plus an additional ( n-1 ) columns. So, the minimum number of segments would be ( n + (n - 1) = 2n - 1 ).          - If ( l = n - 1 ): There’s one entire horizontal row left, requiring at least ( n ) vertical segments to cover ( n ) points not lying on the horizontal segments, totaling ( (n - 1) + n = 2n - 1 ).     - If both ( l, m leq n - 2 ):          - Deleting all points on the lines formed by these segments leaves a subgrid of ( (n - l) times (n - m) ) points.         - The boundary of this subgrid contains ( 2n - l - m - 2 ) points, needing ( 2n - l - m - 2 ) segments.

The average price of the 30 pieces of fruit is 56 cents, so the total cost of the 30 pieces of fruit is 30 * 56 = 1680 cents. We can write the equation for the total cost as: 40A + 60O = 1680 We also know that A + O = 30, so we can express O in terms of A: O = 30 - A Substituting this into the total cost equation, we get: 40A + 60(30 - A) = 1680 40A + 1800 - 60A = 1680 -20A = 1680 - 1800 -20A = -120 A = 6 So Mary selects 6 apples.

The total cost of the apples she keeps is 6 * 40 = 240 cents. The total cost of the oranges she keeps is 9 * 60 = 540 cents. The total cost of the fruit she keeps is 240 + 540 = 780 cents.

He wrote down four numbers in his notebook: (a, a+2, b), and (b+2). Then he listed on the board all six pairwise products of the numbers from the notebook. What is the maximum number of perfect squares that can be among the numbers on the board?","output":":  1. Observe that no two squares of natural numbers differ by 1. This is based on the difference of squares formula:    [    x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)    ]    Since ( x ) and ( y ) are natural numbers, the term ( (x+y) ) will always be greater than 1, making it impossible for ( x^2 ) and ( y^2 ) to differ by 1. 2. Consider the four numbers written in the notebook: ( a, a+2, b, ) and ( b+2 ). We need to consider their products. Specifically, examine the following products:    - ( a(a+2) = a^2 + 2a )    - ( b(b+2) = b^2 + 2b )    - ( ab )    - ( a(b+2) )    - ( (a+2)b )    - ( (a+2)(b+2) ) 3. From step 1, since ( x^2 - y^2 neq 1 ) for natural numbers ( x ) and ( y ), ( a(a+2) ) and ( b(b+2) ) cannot be perfect squares because:    [    a(a+2) = (a+1)^2 - 1 quad text{and} quad b(b+2) = (b+1)^2 - 1    ]    These expressions demonstrate that ( a(a+2) ) and ( b(b+2) ) are always close to but not perfect squares. 4. Next, check the products ( a(b+2) ) and ( ab ):    - If ( ab ) and ( a(b+2) ) were both perfect squares, then their product:      [      a^2 b (b+2)      ]      would also need to be a perfect square. Consequently, ( b (b+2) ) would be required to be a perfect square, contradicting step 3. 5. Similarly, consider products involving ( a+2 ):    - If ( (a+2)b ) and ( (a+2)(b+2) ) were both perfect squares, then their product:      [      (a+2)^2 b (b+2)      ]      would also need to be a perfect square. This again would mean ( b (b+2) ) needs to be a perfect square, which contradicts step 3. 6. Thus, at most one of the products fits the criteria for ( ab, a(b+2), (a+2)b, ) or ( (a+2)(b+2) ) to be a perfect square. This indicates that no more than two of the six products can be squares simultaneously. 7. As a concrete example, take ( a = 2 ) and ( b = 16 ):    - Compute ( a times (b+2) = 2 times 18 = 36 = 6^2 )    - Compute ( (a+2) times b = 4 times 16 = 64 = 8^2 ) Thus, two perfect squares can be achieved through this setup.

Since 2 is the least number to be added to 3198 to make it divisible by the divisor, the divisor must be a factor of 3200 but not a factor of 3198. Let's find the prime factorization of 3200 to determine its factors: 3200 = 2^6 * 5^2 This means that 3200 is divisible by 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 5, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, and 3200. Now, we need to find which of these factors is not a factor of 3198. We can do this by checking if 3198 is divisible by any of these factors. Since 3198 is an even number, it is divisible by 2. We can continue checking the divisibility by the factors in ascending order until we find one that does not divide 3198. Let's check the divisibility by 4: 3198 ÷ 4 = 799.5 Since this is not a whole number, 4 is not a factor of 3198. Therefore, the divisor we are looking for is boxed{4,}  as 3200 is divisible by 4, but 3198 is not. Adding 2 to 3198 makes it 3200, which is divisible by 4."},{"instruction":"f the function y=frac{1}{2}sin omega x is monotonically decreasing on the interval [frac{π}{8}, frac{π}{12}], then the range of values for omega is ____.","output":"To analyze the monotonic behavior of the function y=frac{1}{2}sin omega x on the interval [-frac{π}{8}, frac{π}{12}], we need to consider the derivative of y with respect to x, which gives us information about the function's increasing or decreasing nature. The derivative of y with respect to x is given by y'=frac{1}{2}omegacos omega x. For the function to be monotonically decreasing on the given interval, y' must be less than or equal to zero. This condition implies that cos omega x must be negative if omega > 0 and positive if omega < 0 due to the multiplication by omega in the derivative. However, since the cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1, and without specific values of omega, we cannot directly conclude the sign of cos omega x over the interval. Instead, we rely on the given information about the function's monotonic behavior. Given that the function is monotonically decreasing, and considering the nature of the sine function, which is increasing in its first period from -frac{pi}{2} to frac{pi}{2}, we infer that for the function y=frac{1}{2}sin omega x to be decreasing, omega must be negative. This is because a negative omega would effectively reflect the sine function across the y-axis, making the increasing parts of the sine function (when omega > 0) now decreasing as required. Thus, we consider omega < 0 and rewrite the function as y=-frac{1}{2}sin (-omega x). Since sin (-omega x) is increasing for -omega x in the interval [-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}], we set up inequalities to ensure that -omega x falls within this interval for x in [-frac{π}{8}, frac{π}{12}]: 1. For x = -frac{π}{8}, we have -omega cdot left(-frac{π}{8}right) geqslant -frac{π}{2} Rightarrow omega leqslant 4. 2. For x = frac{π}{12}, we have -omega cdot frac{π}{12} leqslant frac{π}{2} Rightarrow omega geqslant -4. Combining these inequalities, we find that the range of values for omega that satisfies the condition for the function to be monotonically decreasing on the interval [-frac{π}{8}, frac{π}{12}] is -4 leqslant omega < 0. Therefore, the range of values for omega is: boxed{[-4,0)}"},{"instruction":"Let n in mathbb{N}^*, and let f(x) = frac{ln x}{x^n} and g(x) = frac{e^x}{x^n} for x > 0.

Since f'(x) > 0 for 0 < x < e and f'(x) < 0 for x > e, the function f(x) is increasing on (0, e) and decreasing on (e, +infty). Notice that f(e) = frac{1}{e} > 0 and f(frac{1}{e}) = -e < 0. Therefore, the function f(x) has exactly one zero in (0, e). For x in (e, +infty), we have f(x) = frac{ln x}{x} > 0, so there are no zeros in this interval. In conclusion, the function f(x) has a unique zero in (0, +infty). (2) We have f(x) = frac{ln x}{x^n} and f'(x) = frac{1 - nln x}{x^{n+1}} for x > 0. Since f'(x) > 0 for 0 < x < e^frac{1}{n} and f'(x) < 0 for x > e^frac{1}{n}, the function f(x) is increasing on (0, e^frac{1}{n}) and decreasing on (e^frac{1}{n}, +infty). Thus, f(x) attains its maximum value f(e^frac{1}{n}) = frac{1}{ne} at x = e^frac{1}{n}. For g(x) = frac{e^x}{x^n}, we have g'(x) = frac{(x - n)e^x}{x^{n+1}} for x > 0. Since g'(x) > 0 for x > n and g'(x) < 0 for 0 < x < n, the function g(x) is decreasing on (0, n) and increasing on (n, +infty). Thus, g(x) attains its minimum value g(n) = (frac{e}{n})^n at x = n. For all n in mathbb{N}^*, the maximum value of f(x) is frac{1}{ne} < 1. So, the graph of y = f(x) is below the line y = 1. We need g(n) = (frac{e}{n})^n > 1, which implies that n < e.

Let the circumcenters of triangle ABC and triangle BKN be denoted as O_1 and O_2 respectively. 2. By the problem statement, O, O_1, and O_2 are not collinear. This is essential because, if they were collinear, points B and M would coincide, which cannot be the case here. 3. The circles odot O, odot O_1, and odot O_2 intersect in lines AC, KN, and BM respectively. These lines are known as radical axes of the circles. By the properties of radical axes, they must intersect at a single point. Let this point be P. 4. From the geometrical properties of odot A B C (circle passing through A, B, and C) and odot B K N (circle passing through B, K, and N), it follows that:    [    angle PMN = angle BKN = angle NCA.    ]    Hence, P, M, N, C are concyclic (they lie on a common circle). 5. Since B is on the common circle odot PMNC with P, M, N, and C, and B, we know:    [    BM cdot BP = BN cdot BC = BO^2 - R^2,    ]    where R is the radius of odot O (the circumcircle of triangle ABC). 6. Also, point P being on the circumcircle odot O_2 implies:    [    PM cdot PB = PN cdot PK = PO^2 - R^2.    ] 7. Subtracting the two previous equalities, we get:    [    PO^2 - BO^2 = BP(PM - BM) = (PM + BM)(PM - BM).    ]    This simplifies to:    [    PM^2 - BM^2 = OM^2 - BO^2,    ]    which implies:    [    OM perp BP.    ] 8.

(Answer with a number)","output":"First, let's calculate the total number of arrangements for the 5 books without any restrictions. This is a permutation problem, as the order of the books matters. The formula for permutations is P(n, r) = frac{n!}{(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to arrange. In this case, n = r = 5, so the total number of arrangements is P(5, 5) = frac{5!}{0!} = 120. Next, we need to subtract the arrangements where books of the same subject are adjacent. We'll consider two cases: 1. Two Chinese books are adjacent: We can treat these two books as a single unit, so now we have 4 units to arrange (2 math books, 1 physics book, and the unit of 2 Chinese books). The number of arrangements for these 4 units is P(4, 4) = frac{4!}{0!} = 24. However, within the unit of 2 Chinese books, there are P(2, 2) = frac{2!}{0!} = 2 possible arrangements. Therefore, the total number of arrangements with the two Chinese books adjacent is 24 times 2 = 48. 2. Two math books are adjacent: This case is similar to the previous one. Treating the two math books as a single unit, we have 4 units to arrange (2 Chinese books, 1 physics book, and the unit of 2 math books). The number of arrangements for these 4 units is again P(4, 4) = 24, and the number of arrangements within the unit of 2 math books is P(2, 2) = 2. So, the total number of arrangements with the two math books adjacent is also 24 times 2 = 48. However, we've double-counted the arrangements where both the Chinese books and the math books are adjacent. To correct this, we need to add back these arrangements. If both pairs of books are adjacent, we have 3 units to arrange (the unit of 2 Chinese books, the unit of 2 math books, and the 1 physics book). The number of arrangements for these 3 units is P(3, 3) = frac{3!}{0!} = 6. Within each unit of 2 books, there are P(2, 2) = 2 arrangements, so the total number of arrangements with both pairs of books adjacent is 6 times 2 times 2 = 24. Finally, to find the number of arrangements where books of the same subject are not adjacent, we subtract the arrangements with adjacent books from the total arrangements: 120 - 48 - 48 + 24 = boxed{48}."},{"instruction":"A distributor sells a product through an online store, which takes a commission of 20% of the price set by the distributor.

The tax is 8% of the sale price, so the tax amount is 0.08S. The distributor wants to maintain a 20% profit on the total cost, including taxes and shipping fees. The profit is calculated on the total cost before tax, so the desired profit is 20% of 25, which is 0.20 * 25 = 5. Now, let's calculate the total amount the distributor wants to earn per item, which is the sum of the total cost before tax, the tax amount, and the profit: Total amount = Total cost before tax + Tax amount + Profit Total amount = 25 + 0.08S + 5 Since the online store takes a 20% commission, the sale price 'S' must be set so that after the commission, the distributor is left with the total amount they want to earn. The commission is 20% of the sale price, so the commission amount is 0.20S. The distributor receives S - 0.20S after the commission, which is 0.80S. So, we have the equation: 0.80S = 25 + 0.08S + 5 Now, let's solve for 'S': 0.80S - 0.08S = 25 + 5 0.72S = 30 S = 30 / 0.72 S = 41.67 (rounded to two decimal places) This is the price the buyer observes online without the coupon code.

Adding these inequalities, we get:    [    AB + AC < BD + CD    ]    However, from the given conditions, we have:    [    AD = AB + AC quad text{and} quad AD = BD + DC    ]    Therefore,    [    AB + AC = BD + CD    ]    This leads to a contradiction since ( AB + AC < BD + CD ) implies ( AD < AD ), which is impossible. Hence, at least one of the assumptions ( AC < BD ) or ( AB < CD ) must be false. 4. Assume ( AB ge CD ). Then,    [    AB + AC ge CD + AC implies AD ge CD + AC    ]    By the triangle inequality, the points ( A, C, D ) must be collinear. Therefore, equality must hold, i.e.,    [    AB = CD    ] 5. Since ( AD = BD + DC ) and ( AB = CD ), we have:    [    AD = BD + AB    ]    Again, by the triangle inequality, the points ( A, B, D ) must be collinear. 6. Since ( A, B, D ) and ( A, C, D ) are collinear, all four points ( A, B, C, D ) must lie on a single line. (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"The area of a square field is 4802 m^2. What is the length of its diagonal?","output":"To find the length of the diagonal of a square field, we first need to find the length of one side of the square. Since the area of a square is given by the formula: Area = side^2 We can find the length of one side by taking the square root of the area: side = sqrt(Area) Given that the area is 4802 m^2, we have: side = sqrt(4802 m^2) side ≈ 69.3 m Now, to find the length of the diagonal (d) of the square, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In a square, the diagonal forms two right-angled triangles with the sides of the square. Therefore: d^2 = side^2 + side^2 d^2 = 2 * side^2 Substituting the value of the side we found: d^2 = 2 * (69.3 m)^2 d^2 = 2 * 4802 m^2 d^2 = 9604 m^2 Now, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the diagonal: d = sqrt(9604 m^2) d ≈ 98 m So, the length of the diagonal of the square field is approximately boxed{98}  meters."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},Y={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],_={key:0},F={key:1};function N(n,e,h,m,o,s){const f=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),k(f,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",Y,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
