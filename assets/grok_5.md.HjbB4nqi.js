Input: Abstract: Following cell surface receptor activation, the alpha subunit of the Gq subclass of GTP-binding proteins activates the phosphoinositide signalling pathway. Here we examined the expression and localization of Gq protein alpha subunits in the adult mouse brain by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Of the four members of the Gq protein alpha subunits, Galphaq and Galpha11 were transcribed predominantly in the brain. The highest transcriptional level of Galphaq was observed in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and hippocampal pyramidal cells, while that of Galpha11 was noted in hippocampal pyramidal cells. Antibody against the C-terminal peptide common to Galphaq and Galpha11 strongly labelled the cerebellar molecular layer and hippocampal neuropil layers. In these regions, immunogold preferentially labelled the cytoplasmic face of postsynaptic cell membrane of PCs and pyramidal cells. Immunoparticles were distributed along the extra-junctional cell membrane of spines, dendrites and somata, but were almost excluded from the junctional membrane. By double immunofluorescence, Galphaq/Galpha11 was extensively colocalized with metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1alpha in dendritic spines of PCs and with mGluR5 in those of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Together with concentrated localization of mGluR1alpha and mGluR5 in a peri-junctional annulus on PC and pyramidal cell synapses (Baude et al. 1993, Neuron, 11, 771-787; Luján et al. 1996, Eur. J. Neurosci., 8, 1488-1500), the present molecular-anatomical findings suggest that peri-junctional stimulation of the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors is mediated by Galphaq and/or Galpha11, leading to the activation of the intracellular effector, phospholipase Cbeta..

Some reviewers say the decor is elegant, but it looks like the inside of an Irish bar to me.  I believe that because of its location in Circus Circus there is an illusion of classiness created by juxtaposition.  On the night that a friend and I went almost every item we ordered was awful.  They were out of sauteed mushrooms, so we opted for crab legs and grilled shrimp.  The shrimp were ok, but the crab legs were horrible.  Too briny and salty, we couldn't even finish them, and the friend I was with is a fat bastard.  The waiter ended up not charging us for those because he could tell our meal wasn't starting out well.  Next we got our side salads, which were fine, but they weren't anything special.  Besides, we were there for steak.  My friend got the porterhouse and I got a ribeye.  Mine was edible, whereas I had one bite of my friend's and could not have imagined eating much more than the single bite.  Having learned our lesson, we didn't opt for dessert.

Plot title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Movie plot: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher. He decides that creating the perfect smell will prove his worth.Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of the naive Laura Richis (Rachel...

Dr. Feldman tells B-Rad's parents Bill and Bess that B-Rad has the most serious case of \\"gangstaphrienia\\" that he has ever seen. Tom then has an idea to hire two actors, PJ and Sean James to try to scare B-Rad back to normal. Although Bill thinks it could get dangerous, he reluctantly agrees. With the help of PJ's cousin Shondra, they kidnap B-Rad and take him to the ghetto. Shondra tries to convince B-Rad that if he stops acting like a gangster, they will let him go. B-Rad tries to tell Shondra he cannot, it is who he is. The actors then try plan B, forcing B-Rad to rob a convenience store owned by a Korean American family. After sending B-Rad end, however, Sean and PJ then realize they forgot to call and tell the shop owner that the robbery was fake and they begin to worry the plan will get out of hand and/or fail, possibly ending with them in jail. B-Rad finds his emergency stash of cash in his pants and pays for the alcohol he was supposed to steal for the two gangsters. B-Rad lies to them and says he stole it. When they find a receipt in the back, B-Rad says he stole that, too. Answer:","output":"The politician's son, B-Rad, gets the money to pay for the alcohol from his emergency stash of cash in his pants. As an upperclass and privileged young man, it is likely that B-Rad has access to money through his family's wealth. Additionally, his father, Bill Gluckman, is a politician running for governor of California, further suggesting that the family has financial means. This money from the family's wealth would then have been allocated for B-Rad's personal use, allowing him to maintain an emergency stash of cash."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Outworld A:","output":"Title: The Chronicles of Outworld: Sonya's Redemption Genre: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, Fantasy Plot Summary:  Following the mysterious disappearance of her sister, Sonya, a former Earth Realm Special Forces agent, finds herself transported to a dangerous parallel world called Outworld. With the help of an unexpected group of allies, she must navigate through this mystical, treacherous land and unite the fractured realms against a shared enemy. Time is ticking as Sonya races to uncover the truth about her sister's whereabouts, the secret behind the portals connecting Earth and Outworld, and ultimately the key to preventing a full-scale cosmic war. Act 1: The Catalyst The movie kicks off with Sonya, a tough and fearless martial arts expert trying to enjoy her life back on Earth as she grapples with the loss of her sister, Sarah. Following a mysterious series of events, Sonya comes into possession of a strange artifact - an amulet that supposedly holds the power to open portals between different worlds.  Intrigued by the artifact, Sonya examines the amulet at her apartment and accidentally activates it. Suddenly, a portal opens before her, and she's pulled through into the brutal and alien realm of Outworld.  Act 2: The Ascent Upon arrival in Outworld, Sonya is captured by a group of imposing warriors loyal to Shao Kahn, the ruthless Emperor of Outworld. As she is being transported through the unforgiving landscape, a chaotic battle breaks out when a group of rebels led by Prince Goro, descendant of the previous, more benevolent, Outworld rulers – attacks the convoy. Sonya is freed in the midst of the conflict and reluctantly joins forces with Prince Goro and his ragtag group of rebels, which includes Ellada, a skilled archer and strategist; Lycus, a wise and seasoned swordsman; and Vega, a cunning and nimble thief. Together, they set off on a treacherous journey to liberate Outworld from Shao Kahn's tyrannical rule and uncover the truth behind Sonya's sister's disappearance. Throughout their journey, the group uncovers clues about Sarah's involvement with the amulets and the prophecy foretelling the convergence of Earth Realm and Outworld. It is revealed that Sarah is being held captive by Shao Kahn, acting as his adviser on Earthly matters. It turns out that she unwillingly played a crucial role in the emperor's plan to connect Earth and Outworld permanently, which would unleash a catastrophic war between realms. Act 3: The Final Stand As the alliance between Sonya and the rebels grows stronger, they manage to infiltrate the palace of Shao Kahn. In a thrilling, action-packed sequence, the group confronts the emperor and his underlings. Sonya and Goro take on Shao Kahn himself, while the rest of the team faces off against the fearsome fighters loyal to their evil ruler. Sonya's unbreakable will and exceptional combat skills, combined with the support of her loyal friends, ultimately overpower Shao Kahn. The emperor is defeated, and the group rescues Sonya's sister, Sarah - the last remaining piece of the puzzle for regaining control over the portals. In the film's climactic moments, Sonya and her sister join forces to use the amulets and close the portals connecting Outworld and Earth. The realms return to their natural states of existence, averting the impending cosmic war. Epilogue: The Aftermath The movie concludes with Outworld making a hopeful transition into a new era. Prince Goro is crowned king, vowing to restore the realm to its former glory and bring peace to its people. Sonya, finally reunited with Sarah, returns to Earth with a newfound sense of closure. Their lives and perspectives enriched by the challenges they have faced and the friendships they have made. In one of the closing scenes, Sonya hands over the amulet to an otherworldly guardian, who promises to keep it safe and hidden from any malicious parties seeking to exploit their power. A sense of new beginnings washes over Earth and Outworld, as the credits roll and their stories continue. \\"The Chronicles of Outworld: Sonya's Redemption\\" is a thrilling, action-packed, and character-driven adventure through a fantastical world that entertains while examining themes of family, loyalty, and the fight for what's right."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The carpal tunnel within the wrist is a narrow passageway made from small carpal bones attached by ligaments. The tunnel protects nerves, blood vessels and tendons. The primary nerve that allows for movement and sensation in your hand is the median nerve. Thus, avoid activities that compress and irritate the median nerve, such as repeatedly flexing your wrists, lifting heavy weights, sleeping with bent wrists and punching solid objects.  Make sure to keep your wrist watch and any bracelets loose around your wrists — having them too tight may irritate the median nerve. In most cases of CTS, a single cause is hard to identify. CTS is typically caused by a combination of factors, such as repetitive wrist strain combined with arthritis or diabetes. Wrist anatomy can make a difference — some people have naturally smaller tunnels or oddly shaped carpal bones. Stretching your wrists daily can be helpful for reducing or minimizing CTS symptoms. In particular, extending your wrists helps to make more space for the median nerve within the carpal tunnel because it stretches the surrounding ligaments. The best way to extend / stretch both wrists at the same time is making the \\"prayer pose.\\" Place your palms together about 6 inches in front of your chest and raise your elbows until you feel a stretch in both wrists. Hold it for 30 seconds and repeat 3-5x per day.  Alternatively, grab the fingers of the affected hand and pull back until you feel a stretch in the front of your wrist. Wrist stretches may temporarily trigger more CTS symptoms, such as tingling in the hand, but don't stop them unless you actually feel pain. The symptoms will diminish with time. In addition to hand tingling, other symptoms commonly associated with CTS include: numbness, throbbing pain, muscle weakness and/or color changes (too pale or red). If you notice your hand(s) falling asleep or feel achy pain in your wrist / hand, a quick (albeit temporary) fix is to give your hands a good shake for between 10-15 seconds — sort of like you're trying to shake water off your hands in order to dry them. The shaking can help to promote blood circulation and nerve flow within the median nerve and temporarily get rid of symptoms. Depending on what your job is, you may have to resort to shaking your hands out many times throughout the day to keep CTS symptoms at bay.  CTS symptoms most often occur (and begin) in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and part of the ring finger, which is why people who have the condition often drop things and feel clumsy. The little finger is the only part of the hand not affected by CTS because its not innervated by the median nerve. Wearing a semi-rigid wrist support, brace or splint during the day can help prevent CTS symptoms because they keep the wrist in a neutral position and prevent it from flexing. Splints or wrist braces should also be worn during potentially aggravating activities, such as typing on a keyboard, carrying groceries, driving and bowling. Wearing wrist supports during sleep can help relieve the occurrence of nighttime symptoms, particularly if you have a habit of tucking in your hands to your body.  You may need to wear wrist supports for several weeks (day and night) to get significant relief from CTS symptoms. However, for some, supports only provide negligible benefit. Wearing wrist splints at night is a good idea if you're pregnant and have CTS because pregnancy tends to increase swelling in the hands (and feet). Wrist supports, splints and braces can be bought at most pharmacies and medical supply stores. Some sleeping postures can definitely aggravate the symptoms of CTS, which leads to reduced amount and quality of sleep. More specifically, sleeping with your fists clenched tightly and/or hands tucked into your body (flexed wrists) is the worst position for triggering CTS symptoms, although extending your arms above your head is not a good position either. Instead, sleep on your back (supine) or sides with your arms close to your body, and keep your hands open and wrists in a neutral position. This will promote normal blood circulation and nerve flow.  As noted above, wearing wrist supports while sleeping is helpful for preventing aggravating positioning, but it may take some time to get used to. Don't sleep on your stomach (prone) with your wrists compressed under your pillow. People who have this habit often wake up with numbness and tingling in their hands. Most wrist supports are made of nylon and fasten with velcro, which can irritate your skin. Therefore, cover your support with a sock or thin cloth to reduce skin irritation. In addition to your sleep position, your CTS symptoms may also be caused or aggravated by a poorly designed work station. If your computer keyboard, mouse, desk or chair isn't properly positioned to accommodate your height and body proportions, it can put strain on your wrists, shoulders, neck and mid back. Thus, make sure your keyboard is positioned so your wrists are not constantly extended back while typing. Consider getting an ergonomic keyboard and mouse, which are designed to reduce stress on wrists and hands. Your employer might cover the costs for you.  Put thin cushioned pads underneath your keyboard and mouse to reduce the impact on your hands and wrists. Have an occupational therapist review your work station and suggest ergonomic changes tailored to your body. People who work on computers and registers (such as cashiers) for a job are at much higher risk of CTS. The symptoms of CTS are often related to inflammation / swelling that develop in the wrist, which secondarily irritates the median nerve and nearby blood vessels. Thus, taking OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Aleve), can be very helpful for reducing CTS symptoms, at least in the short term. Painkillers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol), can also be used to combat the achy pain of CTS, but they don't impact the inflammation / swelling.  NSAIDs and analgesics should be considered short-term strategies for controlling pain. There isn't any evidence that these medications cure or improve CTS in the long run.  Taking NSAIDs for too long (or too much at any time) significantly increases your risk of stomach irritation, ulcers and kidney failure. Always read the labels for dosage information. Taking too much acetaminophen or taking it for too can cause liver damage.","output":"This article discusses carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) prevention and management, emphasizing wrist stretches, wearing supportive wrist braces, maintaining proper sleep and workstation posture, and using over-the-counter pain relief for short-term symptom relief."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He needed to increase production and efficiency, so he started using herbicides. Danny was one of his farmer friends, he had a small acreage farm and he practiced permaculture, so no pesticides.  Which farmer didn't perform any applications of herbicide as a preventive measure?  Hint: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.

News 4's Chris Gordon reports. (Published Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016)      A Maryland nanny has been charged in the death of a baby girl after she was allegedly caught on surveillance camera forcefully feeding her two bottles, police said.      Eight-month-old Enita Salubi of Glenarden died Monday afternoon after she was rushed to a hospital, Prince George's County Police said.      Authorities said video camera footage shows the events that led to the little girl's death.      The nanny, 66-year-old Oluremi Oyindasola, was asleep on a couch inside the house Monday when the baby, who was in a walker, began crying and woke the nanny, police said.      Police said a video surveillance camera shows the nanny tried to feed the baby, but without success. Oyindasola then pulled the baby from her walker, removed the nipple from her bottle and forcefully fed her, police said.      \\"She forcefully poured the two bottles of what looks to be milk down the baby's mouth, causing her to not be able to breathe, suffocating her, and eventually she died at the hospital,\\" said Col. Harry Bond of Prince George's County Police.

The baby became unresponsive, and Oyindasola called the baby's father, who dialed 911 as he raced home.      Clifton Wanzer, a neighbor, said he saw the little girl's father carry her to an ambulance.      She was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead.      More than one neighbor told News4 they'd been concerned about the baby for some time.      \\"That baby just cried [and] cried,\\" said neighbor Walker. \\"Every time I came outside, I'd hear that baby cry.\\"      Police said an autopsy revealed Salubi's cause of death was asphyxiation, and the manner of death was homicide.

For 25 seconds, the child “appeared to squirm and aggressively resist as the defendant continued to force a large amount of liquid inside her mouth,” records state.      After the first bottled was drained, Oyindasola then forced the child to consume the contents of a second bottle.      During the feedings the baby “displayed difficulty breathing and signs of medical distress,” records state.      After the second bottle, the child became unresponsive and at about 4:10 p.m. was rushed to the hospital and pronounced dead.

Article: The prefix = st1 /USgovernment has announced plans to list polar bears as a threatened species because of concerns that the ice where they live is melting. But as the BBC's Owen Clegg reports, theUSplans are also important for other reasons. It's estimated that there are no more than twenty-five thousand polar bears living in the wild, and this number could go down by a large amount as the floating ice upon which the bears survive melt away. Now, without admitting the cause of this melt, the US Fish and Wildlife Services are reviewing the bear's living conditions.    That action is being taken at all, and marks an important change for the Bush administration; for the first time, it may be forced to acknowledge a link between global warming and its effect on a species. Such a conclusion by an unwilling Bush administration could force far wider changes inWashington's policy towards the environment.    This review only came about after a union of environmental groups brought a legal case against the government to take action. Environmentalists, like David Doniger, believe that by calling on the protections of the Endangered Species Act, theUSgovernment may finally be forced to cut back on its sending out greenhouse gases:    \\"It is a very important thing today to have the Bush administration notice that global warming is threatening the existence of the polar bear. Now, it's up to the administration to do something to stop the global warming that's threatening the polar bear.\\" ( David Doniger)    The United States is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases which are blamed for trapping heat from the sun and changing the earth's climate. Since taking office in 2001, President Bush has refused to make the link with global warming, but the bad, serious situation of the polar bear may force that position to change. Question: What is the significance of US Fish and Wildlife Services' reviewing the bear's living conditions? - It brought a legal case against the government. - It marks an important change for the Bush administration. - It is a conclusion by a Bush administration. - It makes the protections of the Endangered Species Act possible.

Rio +20, a major international environmental conference begins in Brazil on Wednesday, billed by its organizers as a \\"once in a lifetime\\" opportunity to safeguard our planet for generations to come. For three days from June 20, scores of world leaders and tens of thousands of people from all over the world will descend on Rio de Janeiro in the hope of reaching consensus on how to achieve this. Some critics have already dismissed the event as a hugely expensive talking shop that stands little more chance of succeeding than previous environmental summits. Others are more optimistic. Here we look at some of the key issues surrounding the conference. What is Rio + 20? Rio+20 is a summit that takes place from June 20 - 22, organized by the United Nations to tackle environmental issues. Its name signifies it is being held in Rio de Janeiro 20 years after a similar \\"Earth Summit\\" in the same city. The biggest U.N. conference in years, it is being billed as a major effort to improve mankind's relationship with the planet. See also: Five cities fight for climate survival. Who will be there? The 1992 event was attended by U.S. President George H.W. Bush but President Barack Obama is not expected to show at this year's event, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will head the U.S. delegation. British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the entire European Parliament have also declined to turn up. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart Francois Hollande have confirmed they will be going. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will also be there, as will India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with China's Premier Wen Jiabao expected to attend. Also present will be representatives of so-called \\"stakeholder\\" groups deemed crucial for future environmental decision making. These include organizations speaking for children, indigenous peoples, workers, farmers and the business sector. A huge security operation will also be deployed to safeguard the summit. In all an estimated 50,000 representatives from 190 countries are expected, including around 120 heads of state and government. See also: Teenager gives world leaders her vision for the future. What will they talk about? The summit will essentially look at how to safeguard global economic growth without destroying the planet in the process. It also aims to ensure that any new environmental policies will transcend international borders. Within these goals, there are key areas of discussion, including food security, water and energy -- and a focus on developing countries. Drafting an agenda and getting everyone to agree to talk about it is has not been easy, however. Ahead of the summit there have been weeks of haggling between participants. With so many vested interests, organizers have struggled to whittle down hundreds of pages of recommendations and goals into a manageable document. Why is it important? The world's environment has continued to suffer since the 1992 summit. The World Wildlife Fund's recent Living Planet report said the ever-swelling global population is still consuming far more than can be replenished. The report said there was a widening and \\"potentially catastrophic\\" gap between the ecological footprints of rich and poor nations. Global consumption of natural resources, carbon emissions and poverty have all continued to increase. Although some contest such claims, scientific research points to a steady rise in world temperature which, if unchecked, is forecast to have catastrophic consequences for the planet. See also: Extinction threat 'a call to leaders' at Rio summit. What do organizers hope to achieve? It is hoped that the conference will lay the groundwork for a set of sustainable development goals (SDGs) that can be adopted worldwide. A text produced by negotiators, but still to be approved by world leaders at Rio, lists processes to establish \\"action-oriented\\" SDGs. If adopted the text would also strengthen the U.N. Environment Program and ultimately lead to better protection for the world's oceans. Will they succeed? Few expect hard and fast policies to be put in place after three days of discussion and the likelihood is that participants will sign up to a document committing themselves to further action in the future. What is open to question is how effective that document will be given the struggle to build consensus ahead of the conference. The absence of key players like Obama has cast a shadow, as has the relative failure of the 1997 \\"Kyoto Protocol\\" on limiting greenhouse gases, which was set in motion at the 1992 Rio summit. There are also numerous sticking points. Wealthy and poorer nations are likely to argue over sharing the burden of cutting carbon emissions. There have been concerns over the exclusion of references to basic human rights, such as access to water. Environmental monitoring methods are also expected to spark dissent. Pessimists say any agreement will be negated by the compromises needed to win universal approval. In a statement released by environmental group WWF on Tuesday, director general Jim Leape criticized revisions to the Rio +20 negotiating text made in recent days, calling it a \\"colossal failure of leadership and vision from diplomats.\\" He said the summit is \\"doomed to ridicule\\" unless world leaders \\"get serious about sustainable development.\\" But others, including UK Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman, have commended the commitment to SDGs outlined in the negotiating text. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1. Rio+20 is a United Nations summit held in Rio de Janeiro from June 20-22, focusing on addressing environmental issues and sustainable development.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

Read this article and answer this question The Navarrese Civil War of 1451-1455 pitted John II of the Kingdom of Navarre against his son and heir-apparent, Charles IV. When the war started, John II had been King of Navarre since 1425 through his first wife, Blanche I of Navarre, who had married him in 1420. By the marriage pact of 1419, John and Blanche's eldest son was to succeed to Navarre on Blanche's death. When Blanche died in 1441, John retained the government of her lands and dispossessed his own eldest son, Charles , who was made Prince of Viana in 1423. John tried to assuage his son with the lieutenancy of Navarre, but his son's French upbringing and French allies, the Beaumonteses, brought the two into conflict. John was supported by the Agramonteses. From 1451 to 1455, they were engaged in open warfare in Navarre. Charles was defeated at the Battle of Aybar in 1452, captured, and released; and John tried to disinherit him by illegally naming his daughter Eleanor, who was married to Gaston IV of Foix, his successor. In 1451, John's new wife, Juana Enríquez, gave birth to a son, Ferdinand. In 1452, Charles fled his father first to France, where vainly sought allies, and later to the court of his uncle, John's elder brother, Alfonso V at Naples. Charles was popular in Spain and John was increasingly unpopular as he refused to recognise Charles as his \\"first born\\", probably planning to make Ferdinand his heir.

Turn off lights, your television, and your computer when you've stopped using them. To make electricity, fossil fuels are burned in big factories. But burning fossil fuels also makes greenhouse gases. You should also try to watch less TV. (2) Plant trees. Not only is it a fun thing to do, but it is also a great way to lower the number of greenhouse gases in the air. Trees take carbon dioxide out of the air when they grow. (3) Don't throw away your rubbish, try to recycle it. If rubbish is not recycled, it is put in the ground. There it rots  and makes a greenhouse gas called methane .So try to recycle cans, bottles, plastic bags and newspapers. It'll make you feel great! And it'll help the Earth.

Again, it mostly affects the organs, such as the brain, skin, kidneys, and joints. The disease is also chronic, which means it lasts for the long-term. It causes the body to become inflamed as the immune system attacks healthy tissue.  There is no cure for lupus; however, treatments can ease the symptoms. When people refer to lupus, they usually refer to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This type of lupus affects your skin and your organs, especially your kidneys, lungs, and heart. There are other types of lupus, including cutaneous lupus erythematosus and drug-induced lupus.  Cutaneous lupus erythematosus only affects the skin and does not threaten the other organs of your body. It rarely develops into SLE. Drug-induced lupus can affect the skin and your interior organs, but it is induced by the use of specific medications. It usually goes away once those medications are out of the patient's system. The symptoms associated with this form of lupus are typically rather mild. Although it has been difficult for doctors to understand lupus, over time they have identified its characteristics. Lupus appears to be triggered by a combination of your genes and your environment. In other words, if you have a genetic predisposition for lupus, environmental factors can trigger it.  Common lupus triggers include medications, infections, or contact with sunlight. Lupus might be triggered by sulfa drugs, drugs that make you more sensitive to sunlight, penicillin, or antibiotics.  Physical conditions that can trigger lupus include infections, the common cold, a virus, being exhausted, getting an injury, or emotional duress. It is the ultraviolet rays from sun that can trigger lupus. Ultraviolet rays from fluorescent light bulbs can do the same thing. What is a summary?","output":"Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the immune system to attack healthy tissues in the body, resulting in inflammation and primarily affecting organs such as the brain, skin, kidneys, and joints. The most common form is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which impacts both the skin and internal organs. Other types include cutaneous lupus erythematosus, affecting only the skin, and drug-induced lupus, which is caused by specific medications and typically presents with milder symptoms. The exact cause of lupus remains unknown, but it is believed to be triggered by a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental factors, such as medications, infections, sunlight exposure, physical conditions, or emotional stress.

Dale Earnhardt Jr. out of New Hampshire race due to concussion symptoms Hendrick Motorsports has announced that Dale Earnhardt Jr. will not race at the upcoming NASCAR Sprint Cup Series event at New Hampshire Motor Speedway due to concussion-like symptoms. Hendrick Motorsports released a statement saying Earnhardt was not cleared to race by physicians. “I wasn’t feeling great the week going into Kentucky [Speedway] and thought it was possibly severe allergies,” Earnhardt said in the statement. “I saw a family doctor and was given medication for allergies and a sinus infection. When that didn’t help, I decided to dig a little deeper. Because of my symptoms and my history with concussions, and after my recent wrecks at Michigan and Daytona, I reached out and met with a neurological specialist. After further evaluation, they felt it was best for me to sit out. “I’m disappointed about missing New Hampshire this weekend. I’m looking forward to treatment with the goal of getting back in the race car when the doctors say I’m ready.” [Dale Earnhardt Jr. plans to donate his brain for concussion research] Alex Bowman will be Hendrick Motorsports’ substitute driver in the No. 88 Chevrolet on Sunday. No timetable for Earnhardt’s return has been established. But on Friday, Hendrick Motorsports general manager Doug Duchardt said a decision regarding next weekend’s race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway would most likely be made by Wednesday. If Earnhardt remains out, Jeff Gordon will be driving the No. 88 at Brickyard. Yes. You read that right. “If Dale is not able to go at Indianapolis, we’ll put Jeff Gordon in the car,” Duchardt said during Friday morning’s press conference. Gordon is an equity owner in Hendrick Motorsports and retired after the 2015 season. But Earnhardt’s most likely going to be careful. This is his fourth documented time with a concussion or concussion-like symptoms. His first came in 2002. In 2012, he had two concussions in six weeks. “You can’t (ignore) concussions,” Earnhardt said in 2012. “It’s really dangerous doing that.” Earnhardt missed two races in the Chase back in fall 2012 with a concussion as well, after crashing at Talladega in a 25-car pileup in the last lap. “I’m proud of Dale for standing up,” said Rick Hendrick, owner of Hendrick Motorsports in a statement. “The number-one priority is his health, so we’re going to give him all the time he needs. We completely support the decision by the doctors and will be ready to go win races when he’s 100 percent. In the meantime, we have full confidence in Greg (Ives) and the team, and we know they’ll do a great job.” Earnhardt is currently sitting 13th in the Sprint Cup Series Standings with 461 points. Stewart-Haas’ Kevin Harvick leads the standings with 599 points.

Given these facts, what lacks chlorophyll among the following options: - mushrooms  - alpacas  - bacteria  - acetic acid  - Leptospirosis  - salamanders  - deserts  - Conifers The answer is:","output":"Mushrooms.  Mushrooms are a type of fungi and so, just like other fungi, they lack chlorophyll. In biology, chlorophyll is a green photosynthetic pigment found in plants, algae, and some bacteria. It is an essential component for photosynthesis, the process through which plants and other organisms convert sunlight into chemical energy to fuel their activities.  Fungi, including mushrooms, however, are not capable of photosynthesis due to the absence of chlorophyll in their cells. This is a key point of difference between fungi and plants, which possess chlorophyll. Instead of photosynthesis, mushrooms and other fungi get their nutrients from decaying organic matter in the environment, thus playing a key role in decomposition and nutrient recycling in ecologies.  Looking at the other options, alpacas and salamanders are animals and don't have chlorophyll because they obtain their energy and nutrients through consuming plants or other animals. Bacteria is a broad classification of microorganisms, and while some bacteria do possess chlorophyll and can perform photosynthesis (like cyanobacteria), many types don't.  Acetic acid is a type of organic compound used widely as a chemical reagent and is the main component of vinegar. It is not an organism and therefore does not possess chlorophyll. Similarly, Leptospirosis is an infectious disease caused by a bacterial pathogen; it is not an organism and does not have chlorophyll.  Lastly, deserts and conifers involve a little bit more complexity. Deserts are a type of landscape and contain a variety of organisms including plants, animals, and microorganisms. The plants living in deserts, like cacti, do contain chlorophyll as they are capable of photosynthesis.  Conifers are a group of gymnosperm plants commonly found in cooler parts of the world. They include trees like pines, firs, cedars, among others. These plants have chlorophyll in their needles (which function like leaves in other plants) which lets them perform photosynthesis, even in winter. So, based on the information provided, mushrooms are the entity that lacks chlorophyll among the options given."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It shows the smallest whole number ratio of the atoms in a molecule, kind of like when you break down a big recipe for a smaller portion. Now let's learn how to find the molecular formula: Step 1: First, we need to know the empirical formula of the substance. This will give us the basic pattern of atoms in the molecule. Step 2: We will need to know the molar mass of the substance. This is like the weight of the molecule; it tells us how heavy it is. Step 3: Divide the molar mass of the substance by the molar mass of the empirical formula (like finding out how many mini-recipes make up the big recipe). Step 4: You will get a whole number (or close to a whole number) from step 3.

Non-stick pans will make your sear less crispy. Opt for a cast iron skillet. Make sure the meat isn’t dripping with marinade before you put it on the pan. Before the oil starts to smoke, lay the meat down in the center of the pan, or spread out smaller pieces of meat evenly so the meat isn’t crowded. Don’t move the meat around the pan once you’ve dropped it in. Use tongs or spatula to try and lift the meat off of the pan to check on the sear’s color. If the meat sticks to the pan, wait to flip it. Once you see a dark sear or the breading is golden brown, flip your meat over. The size and type of meat will affect the time it takes for it to cook. A 6 oz (170 g) chicken breast will take approximately 5 minutes for each side to cook through. A beef steak or pork tenderloin that’s 1 in (2.5 cm) thick will take 3-4 minutes on each side. If your meat isn’t at the right temperature and you’re afraid of the pan burning it, remove the meat from the skillet and place it on a baking pan. Put it into your oven on the broil setting for 2-3 minutes before checking the temperature again. Summary:","output":"To effectively sear meat, use a cast iron skillet with cooking oil covering its surface, heat until oil ripples, place non-crowded, non-dripping meat in the center, flip only once a dark sear or golden browning appears, and adjust cooking times based on meat type and size."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls. In 2010, the Manchester Local Education Authority was ranked last out of Greater Manchester's ten LEAs – and 147th out...

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What addition would raise the number of persons aboard a ship?\\"  Context: \\"The Royal Navy is constructing two new larger STOVL aircraft carriers, the Queen Elizabeth class, to replace the three now retired Invincible-class carriers. The ships are HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. They will be able to operate up to 40 aircraft on peace time operations with a tailored group of up to 50, and will have a displacement of 70,600 tonnes. HMS Queen Elizabeth is projected to commission in 2017 followed by Prince of Wales in about 2020. The ships are due to become operational starting in 2020. Their primary aircraft complement will be made up of F-35B Lightning IIs, and their ship's company will number around 680 with the total complement rising to about 1600 when the air group is embarked. The two ships will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The addition that would raise the number of persons aboard a ship, specifically in the context of the Royal Navy's Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, would primarily involve increasing the air group personnel count and the vessel's crew capacity, as well as accommodating support personnel and special mission teams. In the case of HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, there are several factors that can contribute to raising the number of persons aboard:  1. Expanding the air group: The primary aircraft complement of the Queen Elizabeth-class carriers consists of F-35B Lightning IIs. By increasing the number of aircraft deployed on the carriers, the Royal Navy can enhance their air projection capabilities, necessitating an increase in air group personnel. This includes pilots, ground crew, maintenance personnel, and aircraft handlers, among others. The text mentions that the tailored air group could consist of up to 50 aircraft, which would require additional personnel accordingly. 2. Augmenting the ship's company: The ship's company of the Queen Elizabeth-class carriers is expected to number around 680. To raise the number of persons aboard, the Royal Navy could consider adding more crew members to enhance operations, maintenance, safety, and overall efficiency. This could involve hiring additional skilled personnel such as engineers, navigators, communications officers, and medical staff, among others. 3. Support personnel and mission-specific teams: Depending on the specific mission and operational requirements, the Royal Navy may opt to increase the number of support personnel and specialized teams aboard the carriers. This could include members of the Royal Marine Commandos, special forces units, staff from intelligence and reconnaissance teams, and personnel from other branches of the UK military. By accommodating these specialized teams, the carriers can take on a broader range of missions, thus raising the overall number of persons on board. 4. Improving infrastructure and on-board facilities: To accommodate a larger number of personnel, the Royal Navy may need to make modifications to the infrastructure and facilities onboard the Queen Elizabeth-class carriers. This could involve redesigning living quarters, expanding mess halls and galleys, enhancing recreational spaces, and upgrading medical facilities. Additionally, adjustments may be necessary to optimize storage and workspace areas so that increased personnel and equipment can be efficiently managed.  5. Increased training and exercise opportunities: The Queen Elizabeth-class carriers may also raise the number of persons aboard by facilitating and participating in international training exercises and joint operations with allied nations. During these exercises, personnel from other participating nations may temporarily be embarked on the UK's carriers, which would contribute to a higher number of persons on board. These joint efforts foster collaboration and enable an exchange of knowledge and skills, ultimately enhancing the operational capabilities of all involved. In summary, the number of persons aboard a ship, specifically the Royal Navy's Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, can be raised through the expansion of the air group, augmentation of the crew, accommodation of support personnel and special mission teams, improvements to on-board facilities and infrastructure, and participation in training and joint exercises."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: The Killing Movie plot: Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a veteran criminal planning one last heist before settling down and marrying Fay (Coleen Gray). He plans to steal 2 million from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer). George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he once made her, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money from George and his associates. The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by the police. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears and holds them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George is the sole survivor. He goes home and shoots Sherry before dying. Johnny, on his way to the apartment, sees George staggering in the street and knows that something is wrong. He buys the biggest suitcase he can find to put the money in (and struggles to lock it properly). At the airport Johnny and Fay aren't allowed to take the suitcase along as hand luggage because of its size, and instead must check it in as regular luggage. Johnny reluctantly complies. While waiting to board their plane they watch as the suitcase falls off a cart onto the runway, breaks open, and the loose banknotes are swept away by the backdraft from the plane's propellers. Fay and Johnny leave the airport but are unable to hail a cab before officers...

Field Marshal Henry William Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey,  (17 May 1768 - 29 April 1854), styled Lord Paget between 1784 and 1812 and known as the Earl of Uxbridge between 1812 and 1815, was a British Army officer and politician. After serving as a Member of Parliament for Carnarvon and then for Milborne Port, he took part in the Flanders Campaign and then commanded the cavalry for Sir John Moore's army in Spain during the Peninsular War; his cavalry showed distinct superiority over their French counterparts at the Battle of Sahagun, where his men captured two French lieutenant colonels and so mauled the French chasseurs that they ceased to exist as a viable regiment. He also commanded the cavalry at the Battle of Benavente, where he defeated the elite chasseurs of the French Imperial Guard. Paget's support of the proceedings against Queen Caroline, alleging her infidelity, made him for a time unpopular, and when he was on one occasion beset by a crowd, who compelled him to shout \\"The Queen!\\", he added the wish, \\"May all your wives be like her\\". At the coronation of George IV in July 1821, Paget acted as Lord High Steward of England. He was also given the additional honour of captain of Cowes Castle on 25 March 1826. In April 1827, he became a member of the Canningite Government, taking the post of Master-General of the Ordnance. Under the Wellington ministry, he accepted the appointment of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in February 1828.  In December 1828, Paget addressed a letter to the Roman Catholic primate of Ireland stating his belief in the need for Catholic emancipation, which led to his recall by the government; on the formation of Earl Grey's administration in November 1830, he again became lord-lieutenant of Ireland. In this capacity he introduced state-aided education for 400,000 children. In July 1833, the ministry resigned over the Irish question.

He noticed that countries like Japan and Russia are having a demographic shift. They have a growing population of late adulthood. He recorded the late adulthood population as population A. On the other hand, many developing countries have growing population of younger people. He recorded younger population as population B.  Which population would have shorter reflex time, population A or population B?  Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Population B (the younger population) would have shorter reflex time compared to Population A (the late adulthood population). This is because, during late adulthood, individuals typically experience a decline in physical abilities, including a decrease in strength, stamina, sensory function, and an increase in reflex time. Additionally, older adults may have a higher risk of developing diseases and health issues that can further affect their reflexes and overall physical capabilities.

Q:Breathing is when a gill converts from oxygen in water into oxygen in blood, and shark gills remove the oxygen from the water. Given these facts, what breathing use gills to convert oxygen in blood among the following options: - sharks  - octopus  - hippos  - a fish  - Lobsters  - water bugs  - trout  - alligators A:","output":"Breathing through gills is primarily used by aquatic animals as it enables them to extract oxygen from the surrounding water and convert it into oxygen that can be utilized by their blood. Out of the given options, these animals use gills to support respiration: 1. Sharks: Sharks are fish and have gill slits on the sides of their heads, enabling them to extract oxygen from the water that flows through their gills. This oxygen is then bound to hemoglobin in their blood, which transports it to the tissues throughout their bodies. 2. Octopus: Octopuses have gills for respiration, and these gills are located inside their mantle cavities. Water is drawn into the mantle cavity, passing over the gills, where the octopus extracts the dissolved oxygen. Once the oxygen is bound to hemocyanin in their blood, it's transported to the body's cells. 3. Fish: Fish, in general, use gills to breathe, which is their primary respiratory organ. These gills are located on either side of the pharynx, and water flows over them, enabling the fish to extract oxygen from the water. This oxygen is then transported through the blood to supply cells and tissues throughout the body. 4. Lobsters: Lobsters also use gills to breathe. Their gills are located in the branchial chamber under their carapace. Water is circulated over the gills by the motion of the paddle-shaped structures called gill bailers. When oxygen is extracted from the water, it binds to hemocyanin in their blood, ensuring the oxygen's delivery to the lobster's body tissues. 5. Water bugs: Aquatic insects, such as water bugs, have specialized structures called gills for underwater respiration. These gills are not the same as those in fish but function similarly by extracting oxygen from the water. In some water bugs, the gills are internal and only extract oxygen through the tracheal system. 6. Trout: Trout is a type of fish, and like other fish, they use gills to extract oxygen from water. These gills are situated at the sides of their heads and serve as their primary respiratory organs. Water flows through the gill arches, allowing the trout to obtain oxygen for use in their bodies. In contrast, hippos and alligators do not use gills for respiration as they are non-aquatic mammals and reptiles respectively. Hippos have lungs and primarily breathe air but are known to stay submerged underwater for long periods. They can hold their breath for up to five minutes or more before needing to resurface for air. Alligators are primarily air-breathing reptiles, and despite being highly adapted to aquatic environments, they possess lungs to exchange gases and breathe air. Their nostrils are designed to close while submerged, and they are capable of remaining underwater for up to 2 hours in some instances, although they typically surface more frequently for oxygen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Two layers of sedimentary rock are exposed on the side of a hill. Only one of the layers has fossils. The lack of fossils in one layer of sedimentary rock is most likely due to What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? Available options:  (a). changing environments..  (b). volcanic activity..  (c). changing rates of erosion..  (d). evaporation of sea water..","output":"To find the correct answer, let's analyze each option. (a). Changing environments: A variation in the environment may result in different conditions for the preservation of fossils. This could mean that one layer was deposited in an environment that favored the preservation of fossils, while the other layer did not. This is a possible explanation for the lack of fossils in one of the layers. (b). Volcanic activity: Although volcanic activity can sometimes cause the destruction of fossils (not creating the ideal environment for their preservation), sedimentary rocks are typically formed from the accumulation of sediments in water-based environments away from volcanic activity. Moreover, volcanic activity would more likely leave traces of volcanic deposits in the rock record rather than completely removing fossils. Therefore, this option is less likely to be the correct explanation. (c). Changing rates of erosion: Erosion involves the removal of sediments and rocks through processes such as water flow or wind. It wouldn't directly affect fossil formation, only the exposure of fossils on the hillside. Hence, this option isn't an appropriate explanation for the lack of fossils in one layer. (d). Evaporation of sea water: While the evaporation of sea water could cause changes in water chemistry and deposition of minerals, it doesn't directly affect the formation of fossils. Therefore, this option is less likely to be the right answer. Given the analysis, the most likely explanation for the lack of fossils in one layer of sedimentary rock is (a). changing environments, as it directly influences the conditions necessary for fossil formation and preservation."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Subscribe or Sign up for free access to six premium articles Subscribe Log in / Sign up Haaretz unlimited. Only 1 for the first month ||||| NEW YORK — In the closing years of the 16th century, as the Holy Inquisition reached across the ocean to Spanish and Portuguese territories, Luis de Carvajal the Younger was put on trial by the Mexican Inquisition, suspected of being a Jew. The Spanish-born de Carvajal (1567–1596) was from a family of “converso” Jews who had converted to Catholicism. He was living in Mexico, where his uncle served as the governor of Leon.      Under torture, de Carvajal betrayed more than 120 people who continued to practice their faith in secret. He and many of his family were burned at the stake.      Long a familiar name to scholars, de Carvajal kept a meticulously written diary, penned under the pseudonym Joseph Lumbroso. While there were some transcriptions, the original diary disappeared in 1939 from the National Archives of Mexico.      Earlier this year, though, a keen-eyed collector spotted the de Carvajal diary at auction and helped orchestrate its return.      Now, for the first time in more than 75 years, the newly recovered memoir — measuring only four inches by three inches — along with other de Carvajal religious manuscripts, are on view as part of “The First Jewish Americans: Freedom and Culture in the New World,” a stunning and eye-opening exhibit that runs through February 26, 2017, at the New-York Historical Society.      The exhibit, which boasts more than 170 objects including rare early portraits, drawings, paintings, maps, books, documents and ritual objects, traces the arrival of Jews in the New World and sheds light on the ways in which Jews were influenced by and left an enduring mark on the emerging nation. A trio of de Carvajal’s handwritten books are believed to be the earliest extant Jewish manuscripts from the Americas.      There’s a common misconception that American Jewish history is a story of the middle-to-late 19th and early-20th centuries, says Debra Schmidt Bach, the historical society’s curator of decorative arts.      “But there’s a very rich history of American settlement and Jewish community in the Colonial period. They made very important inroads that paved the way,” for later generations, Bach told The Times of Israel.      Much of the exhibit’s material is from the collection of Leonard L. Milberg, a 1953 alumnus of Princeton University. Today, Milberg’s alma mater houses a large portion of his collection. Last spring, the Princeton University Art Museum mounted a similar exhibit and published “By Dawn’s Early Light,” the essay-rich catalog with 75 full-color illustrations that accompanies the current show.      By drawing on its own extensive collection along with other sources, the New York Historical Society presents a fascinating visual historical narrative for this little-known but influential period in the emergence of Jewish life in America.      Milberg’s ‘amazing find’      It was just a few months before the exhibit opened in late October when Milberg, a learned and savvy New York City collector, noticed the de Carvajal items listed in a catalog from Swann Auction Galleries.      “It was too good to be true. They must be either copies or forgeries,” he recalled thinking at the time. He headed over to the gallery to get an up-close look at the manuscripts. “I thought they were extraordinary,” he recalled in a phone conversation with The Times of Israel.      The gallery removed the items from its auction and over the next few days and weeks scholars examined the manuscripts and authenticated them as the originals that had disappeared. Through diplomatic channels, Milberg arranged the repatriation of de Carvajal’s diary to the Mexican National Archives, which agreed to loan the manuscripts to the NYHS for the exhibit.      Milberg’s recovery of the diary was remarkable, noted Bach. “It was an amazing find,” she said.      The museum’s conservation department digitized the fragile documents and donated copies of the folio to the Mexican government, Princeton University and to Brown University.      Jewish life from the Caribbean to New Amsterdam      The first section of the exhibit opens with the world of Jewish life in the Caribbean colonies. Even as late as the mid-18th century, there were more Jews in Curacao, Suriname and Jamaica than in all of North America, according to accompanying wall texts. A 1718 map shows the Jewish settlement of Suriname, founded in 1667. A rabbinical letter from 1767 certifies as kosher a shipment of food from Philadelphia to Barbados.      Several documents reveal the ways in which Jews found themselves on both sides of the issue of slavery, from Barbados to New York.      In the section on North America, the exhibit focuses on Jewish colonial life in New York, Philadelphia and Charleston, home to the largest Jewish community in North America until the 1830s.      Several items relate to New York’s Congregation Shearith Israel, the first Jewish congregation in colonial North America, including a large Torah scroll, one of two burned by British soldiers during the Revolutionary War, and a beautifully illustrated ketubah, a Jewish wedding contract. A delicately crafted set of silver Torah finials (1775-1776) were made for the synagogue by Myer Myers, one of the top silversmiths of colonial America, who served as the congregation’s president.      The Levy-Franks family, among early New York’s most prominent Jewish families, is captured in a stunning series of six portraits by New York artist Gerardus Duyckinck I.      In the section on Philadelphia, there’s an exquisite Thomas Sully portrait of Rebecca Gratz (1831), that calls attention to this influential Philadelphia-born Jewish woman, a forward-thinking innovator who initiated the creation of Jewish Sunday schools and the benevolent society for Jewish women.      Women, including Penina Moise (1797-1880), a Charleston poet who left her mark in both secular and Jewish circles, played a significant role in reforming religious practice tailored for American-born Jews. Her book of hymns for Charleston’s Beth Elohim is on display, as is her portrait by Theodore Sidney Moise (1808-1885), her nephew.      An oil painting of the interior of Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim by Moise’s contemporary, Solomon Nunes Carvalho (1815-1897), was made by the artist based entirely on memory of his childhood synagogue after it burned in 1838 in the city’s devastating fire.      Carvalho was a pioneering daguerreotype photographer who accompanied explorer John Fremont on his 1853 fifth westward expedition across the Rockies. His bestselling chronicle about the expedition is on view along with other paintings related to the trip.      A new documentary, “Carvalho’s Journey,” by Steven Rivo, chronicles the little known story. A later painting, “Abraham Lincoln and Diogenes” (1865), owned by the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, makes a rare appearance.      The closing section describes an age of experimentation in intellectual and artistic expression by Jewish Americans that includes a wealth of plays, poetry, religious texts and musical compositions, many part of Milberg’s collection. There’s also a large portrait of Uriah Phillips Levy, who rose to the rank of Commodore in the US Navy, along with his sword and scabbard. Levy is credited with persuading Congress to end the practice of flogging in the Navy.      There are two paintings by the renowned 19th century artist Camille Pissarro. The impressionist artist, whose mother was Jewish, was born on St. Thomas. Both paintings depict scenes from his native Caribbean island.      For his part, Milberg said that he hopes the exhibit brings to light the ways in which Jews were part of America from its beginnings.      “I wanted to show that Jews were an important part of the fabric of America,” he said.      Two related programs are scheduled at The New-York Historical Society. Monday, January 30: Jews in America: From the Colonial Period to the Civil War, with Dale Rosengarten, Rabbi Meir Y. Soloveichik, and Louis Mirrer. Wednesday, February 15: Jews and the Making of Modern America, with Abraham Foxman ||||| It is perhaps the most significant artifact documenting the arrival of Jews in the New World: a small, tattered 16th-century manuscript written in an almost microscopic hand by Luis de Carvajal the Younger, the man whose life and pain it chronicled.      Until 1932, the 180-page booklet by de Carvajal, a secret Jew who was burned at the stake by the Inquisition in Spain’s colony of Mexico, resided in that country’s National Archives.      Then it vanished. The theft transformed the manuscript into an object of obsession, a kind of Maltese Falcon, for a coterie of Inquisition scholars and rare-book collectors. Almost nothing was heard about the document for more than 80 years — until it showed up 13 months ago at a London auction house. The manuscript was on sale for 1,500, because the house had little sense of its value.      But last year the relic caught the eye of a prominent collector of Judaica, Leonard Milberg, when it showed up for resale at the Swann Galleries in Manhattan. It was now priced at more than 50 times what it had sold for just a few months earlier in England. Mr. Milberg consulted a variety of experts, who told him it might be the actual manuscript, and worth as much as 500,000. They also warned him to be careful — the original had been reported stolen. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In the late 16th century, Luis de Carbajal the Younger, a Spanish-born \\"converso\\" Jew living in Mexico, was put on trial by the Mexican Inquisition and, under torture, betrayed more than 120 people practicing their faith in secret. Carbajal, who kept a meticulously written diary under a pseudonym, was executed along with many of his family members. His original diary, assumed lost since 1939, was recently rediscovered at an auction and has now resurfaced at an exhibit in the New-York Historical Society. This exhibit, which includes over 170 objects shedding light on the early Jewish American experience, runs through February 26, 2017 and features the earliest known Jewish manuscripts from the Americas. The recovered diary was spotted by Leonard L. Milberg, a savvy New York collector, who arranged for its return to the Mexican National Archives and its subsequent loan to the New-York Historical Society for the exhibit. Once it was back in the museum's hands, the fragile document was digitized and copies were given to the Mexican government, Princeton University and Brown University.  The exhibit seeks to challenge the commonly held belief that American Jewish history begins in the mid-19th to early-20th centuries and highlights the contributions made by Jewish communities in the colonial period. Among the other displayed items, it also showcases a collection of plays, poetry, religious texts, and musical compositions, along with a large portrait of Uriah Phillips Levy, the naval officer who persuaded Congress to end flogging in the Navy, and two paintings by the 19th-century artist Camille Pissarro.  Two related programs are lined up at the New-York Historical Society: 'Jews in America: From the Colonial Period to the Civil War' and 'Jews and the Making of Modern America'. Milberg's ultimate hope with the exhibit is \\"to show that Jews were an important part of the fabric of America\\" from its beginnings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: In the U.S., power plants emit significant amounts of air  67 percent of all sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, 37 percent of mercury emissions, and 25 percent of all nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Hypothesis: In the U.S., the power plants contribute greatly to emissions pollutants. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The information provided in the premise establishes a clear connection between power plants in the U.S. and their significant contribution to emissions of pollutants. The premise lists the following percentages of emissions that can be attributed to power plants in the U.S.: - 67 percent of all sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions - 37 percent of mercury emissions - 25 percent of all nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions These percentages are quite substantial, which supports the hypothesis that power plants contribute greatly to emissions of pollutants in the U.S. Let's analyze each of these pollutants further to understand the implications of these percentages. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a toxic gas primarily associated with the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, in power plants. SO2 emissions can lead to the formation of fine particles and acid rain, both of which can have detrimental effects on human health and the environment. With power plants responsible for 67% of all SO2 emissions in the U.S., they play a significant role in contributing to this specific type of pollution. Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal that can be released into the air through industrial activities, such as coal combustion in power plants. Once released, mercury can travel long distances, eventually settling in water bodies and contaminating fish populations. This has serious consequences for both human and ecosystem health. Given that power plants are responsible for 37% of mercury emissions in the U.S., they are a key source of this hazardous pollutant. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are a group of reactive gases that contribute to the formation of smog, ground-level ozone, and fine particles. These pollutants can cause respiratory problems, aggravate pre-existing heart and lung conditions, and have adverse effects on the environment. Power plants are responsible for 25% of all NOx emissions in the U.S., which demonstrates their substantial contribution to this type of pollution. Considering the significant percentages of SO2, mercury, and NOx emissions attributable to power plants in the U.S., the premise clearly supports the hypothesis that the power plants contribute greatly to emissions pollutants. This highlights the need for further research and implementation of strategies to reduce emissions and mitigate the associated health and environmental risks. Such strategies may include transitioning to cleaner energy sources, implementing emissions control technologies, and enforcing stricter regulations on air pollutants from power plants."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

London (CNN) -- In the week between her death and her funeral, Britons are having an awkward time coming to terms with the legacy of Margaret Thatcher, a prime minister who last held office 23 years ago -- meaning no one under 40 could have voted for her, yet the mix of anger and admiration is spread across the generations.  The emotional outpouring in this famously undemonstrative nation is matched in recent memory only by the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, when flowers piled up outside royal palaces and Elton John's mawkish \\"Candle in the Wind\\" surged to the top of the charts. But while Diana was mourned in unity by millions as the \\"people's princess,\\" Thatcher's death is being marked in widely different and unpredictable ways.

Let's solve this math problem step by step, like we're talking to a five-year-old. We have this equation: 3*i = -31 + 16 First, we need to add the numbers on the right side of the equation, which are -31 and 16. When we add those together, we get: -31 + 16 = -15 Now, our equation looks like this: 3*i = -15 Next, we need to find out what number 'i' is. To do this, we're going to divide both sides of the equation by 3: (3*i) / 3 = -15 / 3 3 divided by 3 is 1, so now we have: 1*i = -5 And guess what? 1*i is just the same as 'i', so the final answer is: i = -5 So, the value of 'i' in this math problem is -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other, although they appear to be conveying a similar idea. Let's break each sentence down and take a closer look at the subtle differences between them. Sentence 1: \\"Talks about the marriage of Meena have started, and Chandra has begun looking for a Jodi for Chandra.\\" In this sentence, it indicates that there are discussions regarding Meena's marriage. Additionally, Chandra has taken the initiative to find a suitable partner (Jodi) for Chandra, which could be a reference to either himself or someone else with the same name. It is important to note the possible self-reference or confusion caused by mentioning Chandra twice in the same sentence. Sentence 2: \\"Talks about Chandra's marriage have begun, and Meena has started looking for a Jodi for Chandra.\\" In this sentence, the discussions are about Chandra's marriage, not Meena's. Furthermore, it is Meena who is searching for a suitable partner (Jodi) for Chandra. The roles of Meena and Chandra are reversed, compared to Sentence 1. In conclusion, although both sentences discuss the theme of marriage and involve finding a partner, they have different subjects and intentions.

Title: Octopussy Movie plot: British agent 009 is found dead at the British embassy in East Berlin, dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake FabergÃ© egg. MI6 immediately suspects Soviet involvement and, after seeing the real egg appear at an auction in London, sends James Bond to investigate and find out the identity of the seller. At the auction, Bond is able to swap the real egg with the fake and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan, forcing Khan to pay Â£500,000 for the fake egg. Bond follows Khan back to his palace in Rajasthan, India, where Bond defeats Khan in a game of backgammon. Bond escapes with his Indian colleague Vijay, evading Khan's bodyguard Gobinda's attempts to kill them both. Bond is seduced by one of Khan's associates, Magda, and notices that she has a blue-ringed octopus tattoo. Bond permits Magda to steal the real FabergÃ© egg fitted with a listening device by Q, while Gobinda captures Bond and takes him to Khan's palace. After Bond escapes from his cell he listens in on the bug in the FabergÃ© egg and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov, a Soviet general, who is seeking to expand Soviet control into West-Central Europe. After escaping from Khan's palace, Bond infiltrates a floating palace in Udaipur, India, and there finds its owner, Octopussy, a wealthy business woman and smuggler and an associate of Khan. She also leads the Octopus cult, of which Magda is a member.

For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur.  In his chemistry lab David is experimenting with how NaOH and HCl gas reacts with each other. He conducted two experiments, experiment A and experiment B.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which farm generated more marine litter?  Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Hill farm, which practiced conventional agriculture, likely generated more marine litter.

Late in the 18th century the first wave of Romantics such as Goethe and Turner came to admire the scenery; Wordsworth visited the area in 1790, writing of his experiences in The Prelude.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what animal can regrow middle segments when broken?\\" is \\"geckos\\", given that  earthworms have the ability to regrow segments that break off? The answer is:","output":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what animal can regrow middle segments when broken?\\" is not \\"geckos,\\" even though they have regenerative capabilities. Geckos can regenerate their tails but not middle segments of their body. Instead, a more accurate answer would be \\"planarians\\" or \\"flatworms,\\" which possess the remarkable capability to regrow entire body sections when broken apart, including middle segments. Earthworms, as mentioned in the question, can regenerate some parts of their body if mishaps occur, but their regenerative capacity is somewhat limited compared to planarians. When an earthworm is injured or loses a small portion of its posterior or anterior end, it can regrow the missing parts to some extent. However, if they lose a significant part of their body or if the damage occurs in the middle segments, they may not survive or adequately regenerate. On the other hand, planarians, a type of flatworm, are renowned for their extraordinary regenerative capabilities. When a planarian gets severed, each fragment can regrow entire missing body parts, resulting in the formation of a new, complete organism. Their regenerative prowess is due to a large number of pluripotent stem cells, called neoblasts, which can differentiate into various cell types and restore the missing tissues. These neoblasts participate in the process of regeneration, not only in response to injuries but also as a means of asexual reproduction. This astounding regenerative ability allows planarians to rebuild any body part, including middle segments, from a small fragment. In conclusion, although both earthworms and geckos possess regenerative capabilities, their abilities are limited in comparison to planarians. While geckos can regenerate their tails, they cannot regrow entire middle segments when broken. Earthworms, too, can regrow missing portions of their body but may struggle if the damage involves significant parts or middle segments. Therefore, the most accurate answer to the given question would be \\"planarians\\" or \\"flatworms,\\" as their regenerative capabilities are truly remarkable, allowing them to regrow entire body sections, including middle segments, when broken apart."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer to this question? actor who played stefano dimera on days of our lives?","output":"The actor who played Stefano DiMera on the popular American soap opera Days of Our Lives is Joseph Mascolo. Born on March 13, 1929, in West Hartford, Connecticut, Mascolo was introduced to the world of acting and music at a young age. Before venturing into acting, he was an accomplished musician, playing the clarinet and studying at several prestigious music institutions, including the University of Miami. Joseph Mascolo's acting career began in the 1960s when he appeared on stage in various Off-Broadway productions. He later made his way into television and film roles. His first major role on television began in 1968 with the TV series The Doctors, but his big breakthrough came in 1982 when he joined Days of Our Lives as the iconic villain, Stefano DiMera. The character of Stefano DiMera, also known as \\"The Phoenix,\\" is a powerful and ruthless crime lord, central to many convoluted plots that drive the storylines in the fictional town of Salem. Mascolo's brilliant portrayal of Stefano earned him widespread recognition, and he became a fan-favorite villain on the soap opera. Mascolo played the role on and off from 1982 to 2016, and his character was known to \\"rise from the ashes\\" multiple times, often returning from presumed death to wreak havoc on the citizens of Salem. During his time on Days of Our Lives, Joseph Mascolo also appeared in several other television series and films. He played roles in popular shows such as All My Children, General Hospital, and The Bold and the Beautiful. Mascolo received multiple awards for his role as Stefano DiMera, including the Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Villain in 1984, 1985, and 1992. In 2005, he was honored once again with the Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Villain - Lifetime Achievement. Unfortunately, the talented actor passed away on December 8, 2016, after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease. Despite his demise, Joseph Mascolo's magnificent portrayal of Stefano DiMera continues to live on in the memories of Days of Our Lives' fans, contributing to the show's enduring legacy as one of the longest-running television series in American history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I read the reviews on Tripadvisor, but somehow I thought how bad could the hotel be, it is in such a good neighborhood. I knew right away I had made a bad choice of hotels when we took the elevator to our room and it smelled of urine. When we got to our room, the door was wide open and the electricity didn't work. The carpets were utterly filthy. I had an asthma attack immediately. I almost broke down into tears, knowing I had booked 7 days, and it was nonrefundable, but I couldn't cry in front of my kids. I went back to the front desk and asked if he could change us to a clean room or a remodeled room, which would mean cleaner carpet. He kindly upgraded us to a suite, which was a lot better.

Russian language: The language was first introduced in North America when Russian explorers voyaged into Alaska and claimed it for Russia during the 1700s. Although most colonists left after the United States bought the land in 1867, a handful stayed and preserved the Russian language in this region to this day, although only a few elderly speakers of this unique dialect are left. Sizable Russian-speaking communities also exist in North America, especially in large urban centers of the U.S. and Canada, such as New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Los Angeles, Nashville, San Francisco, Seattle, Spokane, Toronto, Baltimore, Miami, Chicago, Denver and Cleveland. In a number of locations they issue their own newspapers, and live in ethnic enclaves (especially the generation of immigrants who started arriving in the early 1960s). Only about 25% of them are ethnic Russians, however. Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the overwhelming majority of Russophones in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn in New York City were Russian-speaking Jews. Afterward, the influx from the countries of the former Soviet Union changed the statistics somewhat, with ethnic Russians and Ukrainians immigrating along with some more Russian Jews and Central Asians.

Sourdough and whole wheat bread can also be good options. Starting with bread that has some moisture will result in less dry toast. Step 2: Adjust the toaster setting - Set the toaster to a lower or medium setting to prevent over-toasting the bread, which can cause excessive dryness. In case you don't have a toaster, you can use an oven or a pan on the stovetop. Step 3: Time it right - Keep an eye on the toast as it cooks. Remove it from the toaster, oven, or pan before it becomes too brown or crispy. This will help retain some moisture in the toast.  Step 4: Add some spread - As soon as the toast is done, apply a thin layer of butter, margarine or any other spread of your choice. This will not only add flavor but also trap some moisture in the bread, preventing it from drying out. For a healthier option, you can use avocado or hummus. Step 5: Serve immediately - Toast has a tendency to dry out quickly as it cools down, so serve it as soon as possible. This ensures you enjoy the toast when it's still moist and warm. By following these steps, you can create toast that is not dry and retains its moisture for an enjoyable eating experience."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In this case, the eruption might cause more magma to rise and cool inside the Earth's crust.  When analyzing the effect of this event on the second step (magma crystallizes), we can conclude that more magma cooling in the crust could result in more magma crystallizing. This is because the cooling process promotes the formation of crystals as the temperature drops and the solidification process occurs.

In this context, it serves as a filler word used to show agreement or to indicate that what you're about to say is related to the previous conversation topic. \\"No\\" in Czech often retains a similar conversational function as \\"well\\" does in English. - \\"He said\\" translates to \\"řekl,\\" with \\"ře\\" (pronounced like a softly rolled \\"rzh\\" sound), \\"k\\" and \\"l\\" sounds. This word indicates that it is a statement made by a male third person, referring to what he said in the past. - \\"He'd be\\" can be translated as \\"že bude.\\" \\"Že\\" (pronounced \\"zheh\\") is used to introduce a subordinate clause, and it corresponds to the English word \\"that.\\" In this case, it refers to the information the man shared about his attendance to the wedding. \\"Bude\\" (pronounced \\"boo-deh\\") is a future tense form of the verb \\"být\\" (to be) and shows that he would be attending the event in the future. - \\"At your\\" translates to \\"na tvé\\" (pronounced \\"na tveh\\"). \\"Na\\" (pronounced \\"nah\\") is a preposition that can be translated in various ways, with \\"on\\", \\"at\\", \\"in\\" being some of its possible meanings. In this context, it means \\"at\\" since it relates to attending an event (the wedding). \\"Tvé\\" (pronounced \\"tveh\\") is the possessive form of \\"you\\" in Czech, which shows that the wedding belongs to the person being addressed. - \\"Wedding\\" translates to \\"svatbě\\" (pronounced \\"svat-beh\\"), which is a dative form of the word \\"svatba,\\" meaning \\"wedding\\" or \\"marriage.\\" In this context, the dative form is used because it is required by the preposition \\"na\\" in phrases referring to attending events.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk, and antelope for hides?, using the article: There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection.   This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"To answer your first question: 1. Assess your comfort level: Start by evaluating how comfortable you are in your current situation. Determine the aspects of your life that you find comfortable and those where you feel challenged. 2. Define your goals: Clearly define the goals you want to achieve, both short-term and long-term. These should be realistic and in line with your capabilities and interests. 3. Develop a plan: Create a step-by-step plan to gradually push yourself out of your comfort zone. This should involve breaking down your goals into smaller, achievable tasks and allocating time for each task. Make sure to set specific deadlines and be accountable. 4. Practice self-awareness: Continually check in with yourself to gauge your emotional well-being. It's essential to maintain a balance between comfort and challenge, ensuring that you don't push yourself too hard or too quickly, which could lead to stress and burnout. 5. Seek support: Reach out to friends, family, or mentors who can provide encouragement and guidance as you work on stepping out of your comfort zone. 6. Reflect and adjust: Regularly reflect on your progress and personal growth. Celebrate your successes and learn from your setbacks. Be willing to adjust your plan as needed to maintain a healthy balance. For your second question, steps to push yourself out of your comfort zone can be: 1. Identify your fears: Understand the fears that hold you back from stepping out of your comfort zone. Acknowledge and accept these fears as natural. 2. Start small: Begin with small challenges that are manageable and gradually build upon them. This will build your confidence and prevent overwhelm. 3. Set realistic goals: Set achievable and meaningful goals that align with your personal growth and interests. 4. Develop a growth mindset: Embrace a mindset of continuous learning and improvement. Recognize that trying new things and stepping out of your comfort zone can lead to personal growth and success. 5. Be persistent: Even if you face setbacks, continue to push yourself and learn from your experiences. 6. Build a support system: Surround yourself with people who support and encourage your efforts to push yourself out of your comfort zone. In conclusion, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question focuses on balancing the need for comfort and pushing oneself out of their comfort zone, while the second question specifically asks for ways to push oneself out of their comfort zone.

(II) anagram was easier..","output":"To determine the ending of the sentence, we will analyze the context and the two options given.  Step 1: Analyze the context The sentence describes a situation where Danni is trying to solve a mystery and ends up solving an anagram. Step 2: Examine Option I In the first option, the mystery was easier, it implies that the anagram was harder than the mystery. Since Danni only managed to solve the anagram, this option seems less appropriate, as it would be logical for Danni to solve the easier mystery rather than the harder anagram. Step 3: Examine Option II In the second option, the anagram was easier, which implies that Danni could solve the anagram because it was easier than the mystery itself. This makes more sense, as Danni would have likely chosen the easier task of solving an anagram over the more difficult mystery. Based on our analysis, the sentence should end as follows: Danni was looking for clues to solve the mystery but could only solve an anagram, for the anagram was easier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: The Amazing Colossal Man Movie plot: We open in the desert of Nevada on a lonely stretch of highway; a convoy of military vehicles passes. The narrator tells us, \\"The time is 2:45 a.m., two hours and fifteen minutes before time zero. At time zero a new type of atomic explosion, a plutonium bomb, will be detonated at Desert Rock, Nevada. These soldiers are to experience the Plutonium Explosion under simulated combat conditions.\\" Credits roll.Over a loudspeaker the troops are warned that in thirty seconds the explosion will happen. The countdown is started, but when zero is announced there is no explosion. The bombsite control officer (William Hughes) explains that there has been a malfunction and they must not leave their position and keep their dark glasses on. Col. Glenn Manning (Glenn Langan), on the phone with control, tells the soldiers around him they will need to wait. Manning, again on the phone, reports a civilian plane in the area and it seems to be in trouble. It crashes and Manning, against orders, runs out to render assistance. The bomb explodes, Manning covers his face, and we see the nuclear explosion.At the base hospital, Manning is brought into surgery; a nurse brings in an additional unit of blood. A team of doctors and nurses are working on a very charred Manning. The nurse is ordered to get another unit of blood and she is stopped by Mannings fiancé, Carol Forrest (Cathy Downs) as she returns to surgery. She asks, \\"How is he?\\" The nurse shakes her head, no, and rushes back to surgery. A newspaperman arrives and talks to Carol. He is a little insensitive in his questions, but he does provide her more information than the military, as he witnessed the test. She tells him they were to be married in Las Vegas that evening.In surgery one of the doctors comments that with third degree burns on almost 100 percent of his body it is amazing Manning is still alive.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, the raccoon is now distributed in several European and Asian countries. Sightings have occurred in all the countries bordering Germany, which hosts the largest population outside of North America. Another stable population exists in northern France, where several pet raccoons were released by members of the U.S. Air Force near the Laon-Couvron Air Base in 1966. Furthermore, raccoons have been known to be in the area around Madrid since the early 1970s. In 2013, the city authorized \\"the capture and death of any specimen\\". It is also present in Italy, with one reproductive population in Lombardy.About 1,240 animals were released in nine regions of the former Soviet Union between 1936 and 1958 for the purpose of establishing a population to be hunted for their fur. Two of these introductions were successful—one in the south of Belarus between 1954 and 1958, and another in Azerbaijan between 1941 and 1957. With a seasonal harvest of between 1,000 and 1,500 animals, in 1974 the estimated size of the population distributed in the Caucasus region was around 20,000 animals and the density was four animals per square kilometer (10 animals per square mile). Answer:","output":"The introduction of raccoons was a success in several areas throughout Europe and Asia. The most significant successful populations can be found in: 1. Germany: Hosting the largest population outside of North America, raccoons can be found in all countries bordering Germany due to escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century. 2. Northern France: A stable population exists here, originating from pet raccoons released by members of the U.S. Air Force near the Laon-Couvron Air Base in 1966. 3.

Chihuahua (state) Hidalgo is hailed as the Father of the Nation even though it was Agustin de Iturbide and not Hidalgo who achieved Mexican Independence in 1821. Shortly after gaining independence, the day to celebrate it varied between September 16, the day of Hidalgo's Grito, and September 27, the day Iturbide rode into Mexico City to end the war. Later, political movements would favor the more liberal Hidalgo over the conservative Iturbide, so that eventually September 16, 1810 became the officially recognized day of Mexican independence. The reason for this is that Hidalgo is considered to be \\"precursor and creator of the rest of the heroes of the (Mexican War of) Independence.\\" Hidalgo has become an icon for Mexicans who resist tyranny in the country. Diego Rivera painted Hidalgo's image in half a dozen murals. José Clemente Orozco depicted him with a flaming torch of liberty and considered the painting among his best work. David Alfaro Siqueiros was commissioned by San Nicolas University in Morelia to paint a mural for a celebration commemorating the 200th anniversary of Hidalgo's birth. The town of his parish was renamed Dolores Hidalgo in his honor and the state of Hidalgo was created in 1869. Every year on the night of 15–16 September, the president of Mexico re-enacts the Grito from the balcony of the National Palace. This scene is repeated by the heads of cities and towns all over Mexico. The remains of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla lie in the column of the Angel of Independence in Mexico City. Next to it is a lamp lit to represent the sacrifice of those who gave their lives for Mexican Independence.

Then dozens of protesters, some of whom had come from hours away, arrived. \\"They would like to perpetuate this Hollywood version of Gandhi so you (do not) pay attention to the fact that Americans here are supporting the brutalization of minorities back in India,\\" one protester told KCRA. Added another, \\"I don't understand why America is supporting him when America stands for freedom and Gandhi is not the ideal person for freedom.\\" The statue was a gift from the Indian government and was unveiled on Gandhi's birthday, the UN's International Day of Non-Violence, the Sacramento Bee reports. Protesters shouted things like, \\"Gandhi, Gandhi you can’t hide, you committed genocide.\\" The Bee notes that most of the supporters watching the statue's unveiling were Indian-Americans. The protesters said Gandhi was a racist and a child molester, which KCRA notes \\"is a narrative that is not supported by mainstream historical scholars.\\" Others called him sexist and said he was a proponent of India's caste system; some have gone so far as to accuse him of genocide and of starting ISIS. The Bee has some background on their accusations, noting that the pedophile comments come from Gandhi's practice of testing his chastity vow by sleeping naked with his teen grandnieces and that even Gandhi's own grandson has admitted that Gandhi was \\"at times ignorant and prejudiced about South Africa's blacks.\\" Even so, Rajmohan Gandhi has said, his grandfather paved the way for the civil rights movement.

The controversial reception of the statue, a gift from the Indian government, began peacefully but soon saw dozens of protestors arrive, expressing their discontent with the representation of Gandhi. Protesters criticized the \\"Hollywood version\\" of Gandhi, accusing Americans of supporting the oppression of minorities in India. Despite America standing as a symbol of freedom, some argued that Gandhi was not the ideal icon of freedom.

The protesters claimed that Gandhi was racist, a child molester, sexist, and an advocate of India's caste system. They further accused him of genocide and even of starting ISIS. However, these narratives are not supported by mainstream historical scholars.

Don’t assume they have disabilities.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Importance of Respectful Communication and Assistance to the Elderly Introduction In today's fast-paced society, it is quite easy to overlook the importance of treating everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their age or physical abilities. While younger generations may not often consider how their actions affect others, it is important to remember that building an inclusive and supportive community requires genuine efforts of empathy and assistance. This article aims to emphasize the significance of addressing people with respectful titles, offering assistance proactively, and debunking assumptions based on appearances. 1. Addressing People with Respectful Titles Referring to individuals as \\"sir\\" or \\"ma'am\\" is a display of courtesy and recognition of their personhood. It demonstrates that you acknowledge them as someone deserving of respect and politeness. This is particularly important when interacting with older individuals, who may be accustomed to such formalities and appreciate the gesture of being addressed with proper honorifics. By using respectful titles when addressing elderly people, you are not only honoring their age and experience but also providing them with an environment conducive to positive communication and interaction. As the old saying goes, \\"respect is earned, not given.\\" Therefore, when you offer your respect to others, they are more inclined to reciprocate, leading to healthier, more harmonious interpersonal relationships. 2. Offer Your Help Another critical aspect of creating a supportive community is consciously offering help to those around you, especially elderly individuals who may require assistance at times – be it crossing the street, carrying groceries, or finding a misplaced item. However, it's essential to first gauge the situation before lending your aid. Many older individuals value their independence and may feel uncomfortable if help is forcefully provided. Instead, approach the person with genuine concern and politely offer your assistance, allowing them to accept or decline your offer. In some situations where elderly people are hesitant to ask for help, your proactive display of goodwill can be an immense relief. By respectfully offering your aid, you create an atmosphere of kindness and empathy that ultimately benefits everyone. 3. Be Patient Cultivating patience while dealing with older individuals is vital. As we age, our cognitive abilities and reaction times may slow down. This can cause frustration for both the elderly and those around them. It's essential to remember that exhibiting patience and understanding can soothe any tension and create a more inclusive environment. Showing patience reflects your empathy towards the challenges older people may face and reinforces a positive mindset that acknowledges and accommodates their needs. By providing them with the time and space they require, you are sending a clear message of your commitment to treating them with genuine respect and care. 4. Debunking Assumptions of Disabilities It is important not to assume that older individuals have disabilities, just as it's crucial not to assume that all disabilities are visible. Treat each person as an individual with their unique set of abilities and challenges. Painting everyone with the same brush based on age is both disrespectful and unfair. Instead, take the time to know the person, understand their circumstances, and tailor your approach to respect their individuality. Just as younger people should not be underestimated, neither should older individuals be stereotyped. Conclusion In conclusion, fostering a community of understanding and support requires not only words but also actions. Addressing people with respect, offering help when needed, being patient, and not succumbing to assumptions can make all the difference for the elderly population. By affirming their dignity and personhood, we contribute to building a more inclusive society, where everyone thrives regardless of their age or physical abilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a question about the following article: On 12 April 1204, the weather conditions finally favoured the crusaders. A strong northern wind aided the Venetian ships in coming close to the walls, and after a short battle approximately seventy crusaders managed to enter the city. Some were able to knock holes in the walls, large enough for only a few knights at a time to crawl through; the Venetians were also successful at scaling the walls from the sea, though there was fighting with the Varangians. The Anglo-Saxon \\"axe bearers\\" had been amongst the most effective of the city's defenders, but they now attempted to negotiate higher wages from their Byzantine employers, before dispersing or surrendering. The crusaders captured the Blachernae section of the city in the northwest and used it as a base to attack the rest of the city. While attempting to defend themselves with a wall of fire, however, they burned even more of the city. This second fire left 15,000 people homeless. The crusaders completely took the city on 13 April. The crusaders sacked Constantinople for three days, during which many ancient Greco-Roman and medieval Byzantine works of art were stolen or ruined. Many of the civilian population of the city were killed and their property looted. Despite the threat of excommunication, the crusaders destroyed, defiled and looted the city's churches and monasteries. It was said that the total amount looted from Constantinople was about 900,000 silver marks. The Venetians received 150,000 silver marks that was their due, while the crusaders received 50,000 silver marks. A further 100,000 silver marks were divided evenly up between the crusaders and Venetians. The remaining 500,000 silver marks were secretly kept back by many crusader knights.

Is Thereafter, a distinctly Canadian army and navy was established, followed by an air force, that, because of the constitutional arrangements at the time, remained effectively under the control of the British government until Canada gained legislative independence from the United Kingdom in 1931, in part due to the distinguished achievement and sacrifice of the Canadian Corps in the First World War. a good answer to this question?","output":"Yes, the given statement provides a brief overview of the formation of the Canadian Armed Forces. However, to provide a more detailed and long answer, consider the following: The origins of the Canadian Armed Forces can be traced back to the early colonial militias in the 1600s. By the 19th century, Canada had a regular army comprised of British troops, as well as its own volunteer militia forces. The British garrison stationed in Canada was gradually reduced during the latter half of the 19th century, which led to the formation of a distinctly Canadian army and navy to fill the defensive void. In 1910, the Naval Service Act was passed, and the Royal Canadian Navy was officially founded on May 4, 1910. It played an important role during the First World War and continued to develop throughout the subsequent decades. The Canadian army, which had primarily been organized regionally through militia units in the early 20th century, significantly contributed to the war effort in the First World War. The Canadian Expeditionary Force was formed in 1914, and it included the Canadian Corps, which gained distinction for its efforts, particularly during battles such as Vimy Ridge and Passchendaele. After the end of the war, the Canadian government focused on creating a national military force. This led to the formation of the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1924 (established by the Air Force Act), a separate branch that would eventually become a crucial component of the Canadian Armed Forces. Despite having these separate military entities, Canada's military branches remained effectively under the control of the British government due to the constitutional arrangements at the time. This changed when the Statute of Westminster was passed in 1931, which granted Canada legislative independence from the United Kingdom. Afterward, the Canadian government had full authority over its military forces. In 1940, during World War II, the National Defence Act was amended, which centralized the control of all Canadian military forces under a single department, the Department of National Defence. This was a major step toward consolidating the Canadian military services. In 1968, as a result of the efforts to further integrate the Canadian military, the Canadian Armed Forces were established through the unification of the Royal Canadian Navy, the Canadian Army, and the Royal Canadian Air Force under one entity. In conclusion, the development of the Canadian Armed Forces spans over many years and involves the establishment of distinct branches such as the army, navy, and air force. The military forces were originally under British control but eventually gained full autonomy after Canada achieved legislative independence in 1931. Throughout the years, these various branches have been integrated into one cohesive military force, the Canadian Armed Forces, which serves and protects Canada and contributes to international peacekeeping missions and alliances, such as NATO."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Communist Party, which was isolated in this way, did indeed initiate a guerrilla war, but it was either assimilated by the alliance or militarily crushed.\\" To further elaborate, this is detailing a period of history in Venezuela where two political parties - the Democratic Action party (AD) and the Christian Democratic COPEI - banded together to retain political control. This was formalized in their Punto Fijo Pact, which essentially divvied up the political power between them, ensuring that they maintained rule over the country. Simultaneously, the Communist Party found itself isolated and marginalized as they were not included in this pact. In response to their exclusionary treatment, they resorted to initiating a guerrilla war - typically a form of irregular warfare that utilizes small, mobile armed groups in opposition to traditional military forces. However, they faced significant challenges as they found themselves either being coerced or assimilated into the existing alliance between the AD and COPEI, or conversely, being militarily defeated.  It concludes a phase of Venezuelan history where power was concentrated in the hands of these two parties. The alliances, deals, and division of power meant that other political entities, such as the Communist Party, found it challenging to assert their influence or change the political setup of the country.

The goods that were being purchased were more useful than the displays since the","output":"consumers recognized the inherent value they held in their daily lives, offering practicality and utility unlike the ostentatious displays often understood to be more of a status symbol. The rise in demand for these practical goods could be attributed to various factors, including changing societal priorities, financial considerations, and the pursuit of simplicity and minimalism in modern life. As people began to emphasize the importance of experiences over material possessions, they started to look for products that could enhance their lives in tangible ways rather than merely presenting an image of luxury or success. One major contributor to this shift was the global economic climate, which had inevitably impacted consumer behavior. Following a period of instability, many found themselves questioning the need to constantly acquire new and expensive items to assert their status. Furthermore, a significant portion of the population had become more conscious about the environment, making efforts to reduce waste and adopt more sustainable practices in their lifestyles. This has also affected consumption patterns, as sustainable and reusable goods are often seen as more practical and long-lasting investments. Regarding societal changes, the rapid development of technology has led to a faster pace of life where people are constantly connected and easily overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information and digital stimuli. As a result, individuals have started seeking simplicity in their environments, which in turn has given rise to the popularity of minimalist design and living. This inclination towards minimalism has prompted consumers to reassess their priorities and identify the true value of products. In such a context, the usefulness of a product becomes more crucial than its visual appeal. Another factor that has influenced the preference for useful and practical goods is the growing popularity of DIY and self-sufficiency culture. Many individuals are embracing the idea of creating, repairing, and maintaining items on their own rather than relying on others for these services. This trend has brought about a higher demand for products that enable and facilitate these endeavors, such as tools, materials, and equipment. It has also encouraged the notion of investing in durable and high-quality goods, which are expected to endure regular wear and tear and offer consistent performance for longer periods. Moreover, consumer education has played a pivotal role in shaping the demand for practical goods. As people become more aware of the impact of their purchases on their health, well-being, and the environment, they are more likely to choose products that align with their values. For instance, there has been an increase in demand for organic food, eco-friendly cleaning products, and natural personal care items, as these goods are perceived to benefit both the users and the planet. Lastly, consumers have come to recognize that practical goods do not necessarily sacrifice aesthetics. There is a growing appreciation for items that integrate form and function seamlessly, providing visually appealing objects that also serve meaningful purposes. Thus, the idea that practical goods are somehow plain or boring has gradually dissipated. In conclusion, the preference for practical goods over flashy displays in the market can be ascribed to a multitude of factors that reflect evolving consumer mindsets and values. Amidst economic uncertainties, environmental concerns, and a fast-paced digital world, people have sought solace in items that offer true usefulness and durability. These goods, which prioritize functionality without disregarding design, ultimately contribute to a more simplified, sustainable, and meaningful way of living."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.

Kim Kardashian's naked butt cover: a historical perspective With a brief to “break the internet”, New York-based style magazine Paper has unveiled their latest cover – an oiled Kim Kardashian displaying her naked backside. In fact, there are two covers – the second is a more demure shot showing Kim fully clothed and balancing a glass of champagne on her bum. While Kardashian – with her trajectory from sex tape to reality star to the cover of Vogue, and now back to her birthday suit – is a very 21st-century kind of celebrity, the photographer, Jean-Paul Goude, did his pioneering work in the 70s and 80s. The champagne shot is a recreation of a 1976 photograph of model Carolina Burmont. Made art director of Esquire in 1969, despite having little experience laying out pages, Goude’s career took a different turn when he met Grace Jones in 1977 (or ’78 – the photographer can’t remember as “it was a period of decadence”). Jones was a Jamaican model with stunning androgynous looks. A dedicated hedonist and habituee of Studio 54, she had already made a disco album and was massively popular on the New York gay scene. “She was singing her hit song I Need a Man to a roomful of shrieking, gay bobbysoxers,” remembered Goude. “The ambiguity of her act was that she herself looked like a man. A man singing I Need a Man to a bunch of men.” Goude not only fell in love with her, but decided to take control of her image, treating her a bit like a living artwork. Decades before photoshop, armed with little more than his own surrealist, sexually charged vision and a steady hand, Goude created astonishing images of Jones with the primitive technology available at the time – not much more than scalpels, glue and multiple contact sheets. You can see him at work in the very first seconds of this video for Jones’s Slave to the Rhythm. He described the process in his book Jungle Fever, copies of which now go for hundreds of pounds. “I photographed her in different positions. I cut her legs apart, lengthened them, turned her body to face the audience.” For the cover of her third album, Nightclubbing, which abandoned disco for a much more avant-garde fusion of reggae and new wave, Goude turned Jones’s already dark skin blue-black, making her look forbidding, masculine, and drop dead cool. Goude and Jones’s work is still deeply influential; moments from the live concert they created, called A One Man Show, regularly crop up in film, advertising and other live concerts. However, even at the time he was criticised for objectifying the bodies of black women. Kim Kardashian’s enlarged, glazed buttocks show that while his techniques have changed – he almost certainly used a computer – his predilections have not, only now they seem to be shared by the whole of the internet. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text include: 1. Paper magazine's cover featuring Kim Kardashian's naked oiled backside was an attempt to \\"break the internet.\\" 2. The photographer, Jean-Paul Goude, has a history of work ranging from the 70s and 80s, and the Kim Kardashian cover was a recreation of his 1976 photograph of model Carolina Burmont. 3. One of Goude's significant collaborations was with Grace Jones, wherein he controlled her visual image and treated her like a living artwork, creating striking images through a surrealist, sexually charged vision. 4. Goude's methods in his work with Jones were primitive and involved techniques like cutting, lengthening, and turning her body using scalpels, glue, and contact sheets. 5. His work with Jones is still influential today, and the techniques he used have evolved with technology. 6. Goude has faced criticism for objectifying the bodies of black women in his work, which raises discussions about the representation of women and race in the media."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What would be built on a foundation of rock? Possible A: pillars, mountains, bridge, mountain range, surface of earth  Why is \\"bridge\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"The answer \\"bridge\\" is aligned with human common sense when discussing a structure built on a foundation of rock for several reasons. These reasons take into account the practical and functional aspects of bridges, their historical development, and human experience with rock foundations. 1. Engineering and design principles: Bridges are engineered structures designed to span physical obstacles such as bodies of water, valleys, or roads, and they need a strong and stable foundation to support their weight and the loads they bear. A rock foundation provides the required strength and stability as rocks are naturally strong, unyielding, and highly resistant to various forces such as compression, tension, and erosion. 2. Geological benefits: Rock foundations typically offer better support and structural integrity compared to other foundations, such as those built on soil or marshy ground. Rock foundations minimize settlement, erosion, and other issues that could compromise the stability of a bridge. Building on rock ensures that the foundation remains intact and secure for an extended period, reducing the likelihood of bridge failure and maintenance costs. 3. Historical context: Throughout history, many important bridges have been built on rock foundations. The Pont du Gard in France, for example, is an ancient Roman aqueduct bridge built on limestone bedrock. Notably, these structures have withstood the test of time and are considered marvels of engineering and design. This historical association reinforces the human understanding of why bridges are built on rock foundations. 4. Safety and reliability: Human common sense also emphasizes the importance of safety and reliability when constructing structures like bridges. Building a bridge on a rock foundation essentially ensures that the structure is more secure, as it remains less susceptible to damage caused by natural occurrences like floods, landslides, or earthquakes. This sense of safety and stability resonates with people's intuitive understanding of engineering requirements for a secure and long-lasting bridge. 5. Environmental impact: When selecting a site for constructing a bridge, it is essential to minimize the impact on the surrounding environment, including the natural landscape and local ecosystems. By building a bridge on a rock foundation, the need for extensive excavation or land modification is significantly reduced. This choice often aligns with environmentally friendly and sustainable construction practices. In conclusion, the answer \\"bridge\\" is aligned with human common sense when discussing structures built on a foundation of rock due to its strong engineering and design principles, geological benefits, historical context, emphasis on safety and reliability, and minimal environmental impact. These factors combined create a general understanding and acceptance of the rationale behind using rock foundations for bridge construction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But it's really like when you're building with blocks, and some of the pieces fit well together while others don't. The phrase you mentioned is like a block tower with some blocks not sitting right. The start of the sentence, \\"Although Bob may not be a nut\\" is okay - it's like the first few blocks of our tower being solid and stable. 'Nut' is a funny way of saying somebody is a little crazy or goofy. Then comes, \\"many people have claimed and I think so too.\\" This is like our tower getting wobbly. You see, in our block tower, each block should connect properly to the previous one, or our tower might fall. Here, it isn't clear what 'claimed' and 'think so too' are referring to. Do they mean 'claimed Bob is a nut' and 'think Bob is a nut too'?

The hour-long encounter will undoubtedly still be carefully managed, with representatives ensuring that the conversation remains within predefined boundaries. Some might argue that this goes against the spirit of a relaxed, friendly coffee date, but considering the context and the influential individual involved, it can be understood why such measures would be taken. The winning bidders may be anticipating the chance to gain personal insights, discuss innovative ideas, or even receive exclusive information about Apple's current projects. While these expectations might be ambitious, it remains clear that the primary purpose of the event is to benefit The RFK Center for Justice and Human Rights. Participants should keep in mind that their contributions will contribute to the center's mission of advancing global human rights, societal equality, and social justice. These high-value charity auctions have become increasingly popular among celebrities and global influencers, with Elton John and Warren Buffet among those who have already offered their time in support of good causes. With this in mind, Tim Cook's decision to auction off an exclusive hour-long coffee date can be seen as further commitment to social responsibility and philanthropy. The awareness and funds raised by Cook's participation in the auction will undoubtedly impact countless projects, many of which may never make global headlines. While the conversation shared during the coffee date might be restricted, the real outcome will be heard in the voices of those whose lives have been affected by the work of The RFK Center for Justice and Human Rights.

Friesian and Merino are well-known sheep breeds noted for their milk production and high-quality wool, respectively. The Berrichon du Cher is a French breed used typically for its meat. 5. \\"as well as rams of the English Leicester, and Cotswold breeds\\": Additional crossbreeding partners comprise rams from the English Leicester and Cotswold breeds. The English Leicester is known for its meat and long, lustrous wool, and the Cotswolds breed is also renowned for its fleece, with their wool being long, lustrous, and in good demand. The whole sentence could be rephrased in simpler language as: \\"A particular breed was developed by crossbreeding local breeds with rams from the Friesian, Merino, Berrichon du Cher, English Leicester, and Cotswold breeds.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hint: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal.

I've been keeping count of how often people sing around the house these days. The fact is, they don't. My earliest memories are of my mother crooning lullabies  in a gentle low voice as she rocked each infant in turn. She said she \\"didn't have a singing voice,\\" but her low, wavering alto will always mean comfort to me. Every time I have sat through the night with a feverish body or held a pre - schooler through a nightmare, the melodies returned, words appearing and disappearing like fragments of a dream but held together by the hum  of love. Today, young mothers are routinely presented with lullaby tapes at the baby shower. When baby cries, the idea goes, they will be able to switch on the high-tech audio system and _ with the voices of strangers in his ears, perfectly on pitch. If I had my way, new parents would learn the songs themselves, throw out their stereos, and give their child the gift of their own sleepy voices through the midnight hours. These days, when we go on a trip, my daughters take along tiny personal stereos and headphones. They are lost in their private worlds, and I can't help wishing that at least here, in the car my girls would be forced to listen to their mother's voice again, sure I'm out-of-tune songs that they might then pass down to another generation. Those sophisticated earphones have robbed them of something I think every kid should carry from childhood car trips into adulthood. I drove away from that party humming, and all the way home the good old songs kept tumbling out. Damm it  , I thought, why did I ever stop singing in the car and start turning on the radio ? Why don't I sing anymore while I'm doing the dishes? I'm going to pull those stereo wires right out of the wall when I get home. We're going to sing grace before meals, sing carols around the piano, sing in the shower instead of switching on that waterproof radio that stole away our voices and our souls.

The author argues that the act of singing by parents — even though they might be out of pitch — has a valuable role in producing comforting, lasting memories and a stronger bond between parent and child. This human connection, or \\"motherly love\\", is perceived by the author as missing when using recorded audio, regardless of how pleasant the recorded voices might sound. The author even advocates for a family practice of home-sung songs and lullabies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: You might not know it, but there is something wonderful at your fingertips. You can make people happier, healthier and more hard-working just by touching their arms or holding their hands. Doctors say that body contact is a kind of medicine that can work wonders. When people are touched, the quantity of hemoglobin  -a type of matter that produces the red color in blood increases greatly. This results in more oxygen reaching every part of the body and the whole body benefits. In experiments, bottle-fed baby monkeys were separated from their mothers for the first ten days of life. They became sad and negative. Studies showed the monkeys were more probable to become ill than other babies that were allowed to stay with their mothers. Human babies react in much the same way. Some years ago, a scientist noticed that some well-fed babies in a clean nursery became weak. Yet babies in another nursery were growing healthily, even though they ate less well and were not kept as clean. The reason, he concluded, was that they often had touches from nurses. Experiments show that most people like being touched. And nearly all doctors believe touch helps to reduce patients' fear of treatment. Of course there is time when a touch is not welcome. But even if we don't like being touched, a smile can make us feel better. Smiling increases blood flow and starts the production of \\"happy brain\\" chemicals. So let's have a big smile and don't forget to keep in touch.

Please answer the following question: Question: When you are asleep at night and dreaming about monsters what are they?  Choices:  - nightmares - confusion - frightening - car accident - fantasy  The rationale to choose \\"nightmares\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"Nightmares are the most fitting answer to the question about monsters appearing in one's dreams at night. The reason behind choosing \\"nightmares\\" over other options like confusion, frightening, car accident, and fantasy is that nightmares specifically refer to the distressing and fearful experiences we have while dreaming. Let us take a closer look at the rationale for selecting \\"nightmares\\" as the answer: 1. Nightmares: Nightmares are vivid, intense, and often unpleasant dreams that evoke negative emotions, such as fear, anxiety, sadness, or despair. The appearance of monsters in one's dreams at night can be categorized as nightmares due to the frightful and disturbing nature of such encounters. Experiencing nightmares might lead to a feeling of being threatened, endangered, or overwhelmed. 2. Confusion: While confusion might sometimes occur within the context of nightmares or other types of dreams, it doesn't specifically relate to the monsters appearing in one's dreams at night. Confusion in this context refers to the lack of clarity or uncertainty that might arise during a dream. The presence of monsters within a dream might contribute to this confusion, but it is not the most accurate answer. 3. Frightening: Frightening experiences or emotions might be an outcome of having a nightmare, but it doesn't accurately define the monsters within the dream. Frightening merely describes a feeling or reaction towards an experience, whereas nightmares are more related to the actual distressing and fearful dreams themselves. 4. Car accident: A car accident is a very specific situation that does not directly relate to the monsters appearing in one's dreams at night. While it is possible to dream about car accidents and experience nightmares as a result of them, it doesn't specifically describe the monsters within the dream. 5. Fantasy: While a fantasy could potentially involve monsters, fantasy as a concept generally refers to imaginative or creative scenarios that aren't based on reality. Though monsters might be present within those scenarios, it doesn't accurately represent the distressing and terrifying nature of the situation as described in the question. In conclusion, the appearance of monsters in one's dreams at night can be best described as nightmares due to their typically fearful and distressing qualities. While other options like confusion, frightening, car accident, and fantasy might hold some relevance to the overall experience of encountering monsters in dreams, none of them specifically pertain to the frightening, anxiety-inducing dream itself.

Recording sessions for The Joshua Tree began in January 1986 in Danesmoate House in Dublin and continued throughout the year. U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour of benefit concerts. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer Bono met René Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led regime that seized power in 1973 during a coup d'état. Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the Mission District that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina. He also learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, a group of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Argentine government. The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the Dirty War, and the coup d'état that brought Jorge Rafael Videla to power. The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.Inspired by the mural, Bono took an extended break from recording into July, traveling to Nicaragua and El Salvador with his wife, Alison Hewson, to see first-hand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and US military intervention. While there, they worked with the Central American Mission Partners (CAMP), a human rights and economic development organization. In El Salvador they met members of the Comité de Madres Monsignor Romero (COMADRES: Committee of the Mothers Monsignor Romero), an organization of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Salvadoran government during the Civil War because they opposed the military regime that was in power. At one point during the trip, Bono, Alison, and a member of CAMP were shot at by government troops while on their way to deliver aid to a group of farmers. The shots were a warning...

Please write a short summary for the following article: What Golf Stars Snack On Before And During Competition By Molly Aronica By The Daily Meal The United States Golf Association's U.S. Open is underway in San Francisco, and maintaining a diet plan and fueling up with the right foods is vitally important for professional athletes getting ready for a big tournament. Here's a collection of insights into what the players eat before a match and while they're on the course. Bill Haas, winner of the 2011 FedEx Cup and player in the U.S. Open, is known for not eating much on the course, but when he does, he munches on a mixture of dried berries and nuts. His opponent, Jim Furyk is more inclined to eat during a match, opting for energy bars (and Larabars, specifically) between rounds. Tiger Woods, the 2008 U.S. Open champion, is often seen eating a piece of fruit, like an apple or banana, during a match. He also recently tweeted that his favorite thing to snack on while on the course is a peanut butter and banana sandwich and almonds. Furyk, the 2003 U.S. Open champion, maintains a healthy diet filled with fruits, vegetables, and plenty of Vitamin D and calcium to keep his bones strong. On the course he likes to keep energy bars on hand to sustain him; Furyk is particularly fond of Larabars. Acclaimed golfer Phil Mickelson initially adopted a vegetarian diet in 2010 after being diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, but after five months he went back to eating meat. Mickelson still maintains a vegetable-heavy diet, but supplements with lean meats and proteins. He has been spotted eating fruit, specifically bananas, and drinking water on the course. Swedish golf pro Carl Pettersson takes a fairly unconventional approach to dieting — after winning his fifth PGA Tour event this year he was quoted as saying that his diet, \\"10 beers and a tub of ice cream before bed,\\" was the key to his success. He says that he tried maintaining a strict diet a few years ago but it poorly affected his golf game. When he's out on the course, Keegan Bradley likes to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on multigrain bread, almonds, raisins, peanuts, trail mix and always packs a few Clif Bars.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:  Planet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth. In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth.  Which planet would travel longer distance, Neptune or Earth? A:","output":"Neptune would travel a longer distance than Earth in its orbit around the Sun. This is due to multiple factors, such as the difference in their orbital paths and their respective distances from the Sun. First, let's discuss the shape of a planet's orbit. A planet's orbit is an ellipse, with the Sun at one of the two foci (periastron and apastron). The distance from the Sun varies as the planet moves along its orbital path, coming closest at perihelion and farthest away at aphelion.  The semi-major axis is the longest diameter of the ellipse and serves as an average distance between a planet and its star. In the case of the Solar System, the semi-major axis of Earth's orbit is approximately 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) and Neptune's orbit is about 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers) from the Sun. This difference means that Neptune's orbit is about 30 times larger than Earth's orbit. Now let's consider the circumference of each planet's orbit, which we can use to determine the distance traveled by each planet during its complete revolution around the Sun. The circumference of an ellipse can be estimated using the formula: C ≈ π * (3(a + b) - ((3a + b)(a + 3b))^0.5), where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor axis of the ellipse. However, for simplicity's sake and since all the planets in the Solar System have orbits close to being circular, we can rely on the formula for the circumference of a circle to approximate the distance traveled: C ≈ 2π * a. Using this estimation, we can see that, given the longer semi-major axis of Neptune's orbit, it would travel a longer distance than Earth during one complete orbit around the Sun.  Additionally, the period of one revolution (sidereal period, or year) for a planet is affected by its distance from the star. The farther a planet is from its star, the longer it takes for it to complete one orbit due to the weaker gravitational force it experiences from the star. Neptune has a sidereal period of about 165 Earth years, while Earth, of course, takes only one year to complete an orbit. This means Neptune's year, and therefore its orbit, is substantially longer than Earth's. In conclusion, based on the differences in the planets' orbital paths, distances from the Sun, and their sidereal periods, Neptune travels a much longer distance than Earth in its orbit around the Sun."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"The oldest tricolour flag in the world, first appearing in 1572, is the flag of the Netherlands. The Dutch flag, also known as the \\"Flag of the Prince,\\" has a rich history and a significant place in the annals of world flags. The flag of the Netherlands is a horizontal tricolour composed of red, white, and blue bands of equal width. The red band is on the top, followed by the white band in the middle, and finally the blue band at the bottom. It is important to note that the original flag, created in 1572, actually featured an orange band instead of the red one; this was due to the Dutch association with the House of Orange and William of Orange, who led the Dutch revolt against Spanish rule, initiating the Eighty Years' War. The flag was an important symbol for the newly formed Dutch Republic as the Netherlands fought for its independence from the Spanish Empire. The use of the orange, white, and blue colours represented the struggle for freedom and was adopted by Dutch nationalists, known as the \\"Geuzen,\\" who used the flag as a symbol of defiance. Orange-white-blue tricolour, known as the \\"Prinsenvlag\\" (Prince's flag), was inspired by the heraldic colours of William of Orange, which are seen in his coat of arms. The flag also represented the union of the Dutch provinces that joined together to fight against Spanish rule. In 1650, the orange band in the Dutch flag was replaced by the red one. The change is attributed to various factors, including different interpretations of the colours in the original flag, the fading of the orange dye into a shade too close to red, and the political allegiance of Holland (one of the seven United Provinces of the Dutch Republic) to the English commonwealth. Throughout history, the flag of the Netherlands has continued to be of significant importance. During the French occupation of the Netherlands in the late 18th century, the red-white-blue flag was temporarily replaced by a flag inspired by the French tricolour. However, once the French were expelled in 1813, the Dutch flag was reinstated, and since then, it has remained the national flag of the Netherlands. In conclusion, the Dutch flag has a long and storied history stretching back to 1572, and its tricolour design has earned it the title of the oldest tricolour flag in the world. It is not only a symbol of the Dutch nation but a testament to the country's history and its struggle for freedom and independence over the centuries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Greg Tenorly and Cynthia Blockerman had been through quite an ordeal together--being hunted by police for the murder of her abusive husband while they ran from the real killer. But all that was behind them now. All charges against them had been dropped, and Cynthia's husband had been buried. And the rumors would have died down eventually if they had gone their separate ways. They could feel the stares as they walked to their table.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.  Paragraph: Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which squirrels would most likely reproduce in smaller numbers, lighter or darker? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided about natural selection and the specific context of Mike's observation in a cold mid-western city with less predator-prey interaction, it is likely that the squirrels with lighter coats would reproduce in smaller numbers compared to the darker coated squirrels. The reasoning behind this conclusion is that darker coats are more suitable in cold environments, as they help the organisms retain heat more effectively. Since Mike's city is cold, squirrels with darker coats would have a better chance of surviving the harsh conditions and comfortably adapting to their environment. This advantage would naturally lead to higher chances of reproduction for darker coated squirrels. In contrast, squirrels with lighter coats would struggle more in a cold environment, as their coats would not provide them with the same level of heat retention. This disadvantage would make their survival more difficult, and consequently, these squirrels would reproduce in smaller numbers. Over time, as natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common and unfavorable traits to become less common in a population, the number of lighter coated squirrels would likely decrease, while the darker coated squirrels become more prevalent in the area. It is important to note that other factors, such as availability of food resources and the presence of specific predators, might also influence the coat color variations observed in the squirrel population. However, based on the given context and the concept of natural selection, it is plausible to conclude that the lighter coated squirrels would most likely reproduce in smaller numbers compared to their darker counterparts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Auburn University (then known as Alabama Polytechnic Institute) in 1901. He had already decided on a military career and had become first sergeant of a cavalry company in the Alabama National Guard. However, he obtained his Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Alabama in 1903 and practiced law in Montgomery, Alabama for a year. After the latter assignment, General Smith assumed command of the 1st Marine Brigade at Quantico, taking that unit to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for extended amphibious training in October 1940. In February 1941, when the brigade was redesignated the U.S. 1st Marine Division, he became that organization's first commander. He returned with the division to Quantico in April 1941, and in June of that year he was detached from it to take command of the organization that eventually became the Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet. Under this command, the 1st Marine Division and the 1st and 9th Army Divisions received their initial training in amphibious warfare.  Moving to San Diego in August 1942, the general took command of the Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, under which he completed the amphibious indoctrination of the 2d and 3d Marine Divisions before they went overseas, and the 7th Army Division and other units involved in the Aleutians operation. The Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, was later redesignated the V Amphibious Corps, and in September 1943, as commander of that unit, General Smith arrived at Pearl Harbor to begin planning for the Gilbert Islands campaign. He continued to head the V Amphibious Corps until August 1944, when he was named Commanding General, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, at Pearl Harbor. Subsequently, he commanded the Fleet Marine Force. In addition to that post, he commanded Task Force 56 in the Battle of Iwo Jima before returning to the United States in July 1945, to head the Marine Training and Replacement Command at Camp Pendleton, California. Holland was known for the quote \\"In our corps without responsibility and discipline we would not have won the Battle of Iwo Jima.\\"  U.S. Navy Admirals Raymond Spruance and Richmond Turner wanted General Smith to command the Okinawa invasion forces. They were overruled by CinCPac, Admiral Nimitz because General Smith had sacked a U.S. Army General, Ralph Smith, during the Saipan campaign, and justifiable animosity between senior U.S. Army staff existed towards General Smith due to his service chauvinism.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"If more magma condensation occurs, it will directly impact a step of the process of mineral formation. To understand how this perturbation will affect mineral formation, let's take a closer look at the process and how each step is involved in producing minerals. 1. Magma moves closer to the Earth's crust: The movement of magma is driven by various factors such as temperature, pressure, and the composition of the magma itself. As magma rises closer to the Earth's crust, it experiences changes in its surrounding conditions that promote the cooling and condensation process. 2. The magma starts to cool: Cooling starts as the magma comes into contact with the cooler rocks of the Earth's crust. The change in temperature causes the magma to lose heat, which aids its transition from a molten to a solid state. 3. The cooling causes atoms in the magma to condense: As the magma cools, the atoms within it lose thermal energy and begin to slow down, eventually condensing and becoming more tightly packed. At a specific temperature called the saturation temperature, the magma becomes supersaturated, which means it can no longer maintain all the dissolved minerals within it. 4. The condensed magma solidifies: Once atoms in the magma have condensed and become closely packed, they will begin to bond together and solidify, forming mineral crystals. 5. The solidified magma forms minerals: As solidification progresses, different minerals will form based on the chemical composition of the magma, its temperature, and pressure. These minerals make up the various igneous rocks that result from the solidification process. Now, suppose more magma condensation occurs. This perturbation would directly impact the process, specifically at step 3, where the cooling causes atoms in the magma to condense. The increase in condensation will lead to a higher concentration of mineral elements in the remaining magma and could potentially increase the likelihood of mineral formation. This is because more atoms are condensing together and reaching the saturation point faster, thus promoting the solidification process. With more magma condensation, we can expect that more minerals will form, as there will be a higher concentration of mineral components in the magma. Different minerals might also form by influencing factors like cooling rates and chemical composition. Additionally, the overall rate at which minerals form could be affected, as the increased condensation could lead to quicker solidification and the subsequent formation of minerals. In conclusion, an increase in magma condensation would directly impact a step of the process, specifically, the step where cooling causes atoms in the magma to condense. This perturbation can lead to the formation of more minerals and potentially impact the rate at which minerals form and the types of minerals that result from the overall process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkish pronunciation: [re'dZep taj'jip 'aerdo(W)an] ( listen); born 26 February 1954) is a Turkish politician serving as the current President of Turkey, holding the position since 2014. He previously served as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2014 and as Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. He founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001, leading it to general election victories in 2002, 2007 and 2011 before standing down upon his election as President in 2014. In 2001, Erdogan established the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The elections of 2002 were the first elections in which Erdogan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as Ecevit, Bahceli, Yilmaz and Ciller, resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdogan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gul became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003. By this time, party leader Erdogan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdogan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gul handed over the post.  On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in Ankara to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdogan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as President, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdogan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated Abdullah Gul as the AKP candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Canakkale, and one million in Izmir on 13 May.  The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdogan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey's history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support. On 14 March 2008, Turkey's Chief Prosecutor asked the country's Constitutional Court to ban Erdogan's governing party. The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party's public funding by 50%.  In the June 2011 elections, Erdogan's governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdogan the only prime minister in Turkey's history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%). how long was he in power for?","output":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been in power for a significant amount of time, with different roles throughout his political career.

When I was in middle school, if you didn’t have homework completed or goofed off in some way, teachers could make you stay after school for ‘after school help.’ It was essentially a mandatory study hall and if a teacher called you out, you had no choice in the matter. Now, I was in Biology class towards end of my middle school career and was sitting at one of those lab tables next to another student. We both had newspaper routes (yes, people actually delivered actual newspapers to people’s homes in the 1980s), so it would make us late for our deliveries if we were made to stay after school. This biology teacher would check our vocabulary assignment every week and I totally spaced it this week - Oh Crap! Now, my lab mate had most of his done, but just didn’t quite finish.

Article: The term \\"Industry 4.0\\" refers to the fourth industrial revolution. The first industrial revolution was the production of goods with machines like steam engines, which was followed by the second industrial revolution that introduced mass production with the help of electric power, followed by the digital revolution --the use of electronics and IT in production. Industry 4.0 is a high-tech project, which promotes the computerization of manufacturing  . The basic principle of Industry 4.0 is that by connecting machines, work pieces and systems, we are creating intelligent networks along the entire value chain that can control each other automatically. The goal is the Smart Factory, which adapts well and uses resources efficiently as well as linking customers and business partners with great intelligence. Technological basis are the Internet systems and advanced factories. Experts believe that Industry 4.0 could be a reality in about 10 to 20 years. So, what effects does this change have on the classic manufacturing? According to an expert, \\"it is highly likely that the world of production will become more and more networked until everything is connected with everything else.\\" Networks and processes have so far been limited to one factory. But in the time of Industry 4.0, the boundaries   of individual factories will most likely no longer exist. Instead, they will be lifted in order to inter-connect multiple factories or even geographical regions. How is an Industry 4.0 factory different from a today's factory?

In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

Movie title: Dolls Movie plot: Jody Bower (Carrie Lorraine) is an imaginative child on holiday with her annoying father, called David Bower (Ian Patrick Williams), a man only worried about the money of his second wife and Jody's stepmother, Rosemary (Carolyn Purdy-Gordon), a wealthy lady who finds Jody annoying. This lady is so mean that she throws Jody's teddy bear into the bushes - Jody imagines her teddy to become a huge real teddy who kills both her father and stepmother. Their car gets stuck close to a countryside house. Nobody answers when they knock the main door, but a storm breaks out, it's dark, they're lost, tired and cold, so they enter the place through a broken door.When the elderly owners of the house, Gabriel Hartwicke (Guy Rolfe) and Hilary Hartwicke (Hilary Mason), startle them. They are kind, they look like an old-fashioned marriage and they prepare dinner.There are three more people who appear that night at the mansion: two hitchhikers, Enid (Cassie Stuart) and Isabel Prange (Bunty Bailey), who are a kind of punk best friends - Isabel has the look of Madonna in her  Who's That Girl? phase - and the childish man who pick them up, a kind young man called Ralph Morris (Stephen Lee). The Hardwickes say that they used to be toy makers. After dinner, they distribute everybody in different bedrooms. Isabel and Enid play loud music in their room, but Ralph is sent to another different room, and Jody is sent to her own room. Hilary gives Jody Mr Punch, a puppet-looking doll. There are weird dolls in every room.Isabel wants to steal the antiquities at the mansion, because Gabriel and Hilary they were old. Isabel is attacked, and bleeds after being pushed against the walls. We never see who the killer is.Jody sees the bloodied body. She tells her parents, but they don't pay any attention to her. She tells Ralph, who dismisses her, until he notices Jody's blood-stained slippers. He goes with Jody to check on Isabel. They don't find the body at first, but when they try to tell Enid, she panics. She blames Ralph, the same as Rosemary... The answer is:","output":"In the movie \\"Dolls,\\" it is heavily implied that the dolls are responsible for the death of Isabel. While the killer is never explicitly shown, the film's plot and atmosphere suggest that Gabriel and Hilary Hartwicke's dolls are more than simple inanimate objects. The elderly couple's background as toy makers, along with the presence of numerous creepy dolls throughout the mansion, serve to create an eerie setting where the supernatural is entirely possible. Isabel's death is mysterious and brutal, with her being attacked and bleeding out after being pushed against the walls. This gruesome scene puts into question the real motives and nature of the Hartwickes and their collection of dolls. It also demonstrates the film's theme of deception and hidden agendas, as the seemingly innocuous dolls turn out to be malevolent. Additionally, Jody's imagination and her experience with her teddy bear, which she imagines as a real-life entity capable of killing her father and stepmother, further supports the idea that the dolls could be the ones responsible for Isabel's death. Jody's unique perspective and active imagination seem to hint at a connection between her and the supernatural occurrences taking place within the mansion. In conclusion, although the movie \\"Dolls\\" does not explicitly reveal who kills Isabel, the overall plot, tone, and character dynamics strongly suggest that the dolls themselves are responsible for her death. This supernatural twist adds to the film's suspense and horror elements, leaving audiences questioning the true nature of the seemingly innocent toy makers and their eerie collection of dolls."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.  and the situation: Kathy and Jacob are two coworkers out having a drink at a bar after a day at the office. They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted. They both laugh at the opposite nature of their eye condition, and then both look at the menu on the other side of the room to decide what drinks to order next.  Answer the following question: Which person doesn't have hyperopia? A:","output":"Kathy B: Jacob To answer the question, let's analyze the given information: - Farsightedness, or hyperopia, means nearby objects appear blurry while distant objects are seen clearly. - Kathy is farsighted - Jacob is nearsighted Given these points, we can conclude that: A: Kathy has hyperopia, as she's farsighted.

Budget 2015: GST on the cards for overseas internet downloads GST will be imposed on internet downloads from overseas providers under the so-called Netflix tax, next week’s budget papers are expected to reveal. The assistant treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has been a long-time proponent of charging GST on films, music, books and video games downloaded from overseas providers, saying the measure “provides a level playing field” for domestic providers who are charged GST. “This is an area that we’ve been working with international partners on, trying to get a good understanding of where Australia’s tax system should be for the future,” Frydenberg told ABC TV on Thursday. “We have a growing digital and e-commerce world and the tax system needs to stay up with that game, because if we don’t, the taxpayer will be shortchanged and that won’t be a good outcome for either consumers or for taxpayers.” Tony Abbott would not be drawn on the details of the tax. He told 3AW radio on Thursday: “There are a number of these internet-based online businesses like iTunes which are paying GST in Australia. There are some, I understand, which aren’t paying GST in Australia. We will have more to say about that on budget night.” State and territory treasurers pledged their in-principle support for the integrity measures when they met the federal treasurer, Joe Hockey, in Canberra last month. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said that Labor would consider the GST proposal. A 2012 review into GST by the former NSW premier Nick Greiner and former Victorian premier John Brumby estimated that in 2010-11 the government lost 1bn in revenue by not charging the tax on intangibles. The number of downloads from overseas providers has skyrocketed since then. The government also wants to apply GST to online goods and services worth less than 1,000, although consumer groups have warned that websites might also add a fee to cover processing costs. Shorten said lowering the threshold should be considered only if revenue exceeded the cost of setting up the new system. “If you are going to bring in a new tax which goes to peoples’ cost of living and it costs more to collect than raise, it sort of defeats the purpose,” Shorten told ABC Radio on Monday. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Australian government is planning to add a tax called GST (Goods and Services Tax) on things like movies, music, books, and video games that people download from websites in other countries.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the given equation -24c - 11c = 12c - 94 for c, we will first combine the like terms on both sides of the equation, and then we will isolate the variable c. Let's go step-by-step. Given equation: -24c - 11c = 12c - 94 Step 1: Combine the like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side of the equation, we have two terms with the variable c, -24c and -11c. We can combine these terms by adding them: (-24c + (-11c)) = -24c - 11c = -35c So, the equation becomes: -35c = 12c - 94 Step 2: Isolate the variable c. To isolate c, we want to move the term with c from the right side to the left side of the equation. We can do this by adding (-12c) to each side of the equation: -35c + (-12c) = 12c - 12c - 94 -47c = -94 Now, we need to get c by itself. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of c, which is -47: -47c / -47 = -94 / -47 c = 2 And the answer is: c = 2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When she's in the mood to push my buttons, my significant other, the delightful and charming Ms. D, frequently alludes to the questionable timeline concerning my birth date.

Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends.

The correction heavily depends on what \\"2\\" stands for in \\"2 at 25 C.\\". An assumption could be made that it refers to Fahrenheit (F), considering the sentence refers to a temperature measurement. With this assumption, the sentence can be rewritten as: \\"The temperature measurement's accuracy is 2°C or 2°F at a nominal 25°C, whichever is greater.\\" In this revised sentence, I've added the appropriate degree symbols, capitalized the 'C' in '°C' to ensure consistency, and added the assumed 'F' in '2°F'. I also added additional words and altered the sentence structure to make it more clear. The usage of such corrections helps to improve comprehension and readability."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: This is my first reading of the Stalingrad and to my most disappointment: author Anthony Beevor put his political view above such history event in the human history. I have no doubt that the author is a strong anti-communist for he display the most of the darkest side of Russian's account on the War, but such prejudice put him to the view point of the Nazis: those Russians in his description are cold-blooded running dogs, and the German soliders are proud of their professionalism and only \\"home sickness and Christmas\\".Although author has access to a lot of the most recent revealed archives on the Russia side, his bias makes such book unsuitable for any kind of serious academic references nor debates. Anyway, this would be a great book of source of information for whoever pro-Nazis, anti-Russian, and anti-communists. Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the analysis of the given product review, it is evident that the review is predominantly negative. There are several reasons to reach this conclusion, which are outlined below. 1. The title of the review itself indicates a negative perspective: \\"A political manipulation of war history than history itself.\\" This suggests that the reviewer believes the author's presentation of history is compromised by political biases, resulting in a distorted and untrustworthy portrayal of the events. 2. The reviewer explicitly expresses disappointment with the book, stating, \\"to my most disappointment.\\" This clearly indicates dissatisfaction with the author's approach and the overall quality of the work. 3. The reviewer questions the author's motives and biases, accusing him of being \\"a strong anti-communist\\" and having a prejudiced viewpoint. Such accusations imply that the reviewer doubts the credibility and objectivity of the historical account provided in the book. 4. The reviewer critiques the author's portrayal of both the Russians and the Germans in the book. They argue that the author's bias leads him to \\"the view point of the Nazis\\", presenting the Russian side in a negative light and the German side in a more favorable manner. This criticism further supports the negative tone of the review. 5. The reviewer goes on to argue that the author's bias makes the book \\"unsuitable for any kind of serious academic references nor debates.\\" This statement further reinforces the negative perspective on the book, suggesting that it is not a valuable academic resource due to the perceived bias. 6. Lastly, the reviewer offers a sarcastic remark, implying that the book would be \\"a great source of information for whoever pro-Nazis, anti-Russian, and anti-communists.\\" This final comment further cements the negative nature of the review, as the reviewer essentially argues that the book would only be suitable for those who share the author's perceived biases. In conclusion, considering the above points and the overall tone of the review, it is clear that this product review is negative. The reviewer strongly criticizes the author's objectivity, credibility, and portrayal of historical events, ultimately suggesting that the book is unsuitable for academic purposes and only serves to reinforce certain biased perspectives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Before venturing out into the snow, Ash should have taken several precautionary measures to ensure their safety and well-being. Based on the context, it would have been crucial for Ash to follow these steps: 1. Weather check: Ash should have checked the local weather forecast to get an idea of the current conditions and any potential snowstorms or severe weather that might pose a risk to their safety. 2. Inform someone: Before leaving, Ash should have informed a family member, friend, or nearby neighbor about their planned route and expected time of return. This would allow for an easier search and rescue effort if required. 3. Appropriate clothing: Wearing proper, layered clothing is essential for protection against the cold. This includes a durable, insulated, and waterproof outer layer, a warm middle layer, and moisture-wicking base layers. Additionally, Ash should have donned thermal socks, insulated boots, gloves, a hat, and perhaps even a neck gaiter or balaclava. 4. Food and water: Ash should have packed enough high-energy, non-perishable food items such as granola bars, nuts, and chocolate, as well as sufficient water to stay hydrated throughout the journey. 5. Communication devices: Bringing a fully charged mobile phone, preferably with GPS capabilities, would be beneficial for emergencies and navigation. A handheld GPS device and a whistle can also come in handy to signal for help. 6. Navigation tools: A physical map of the area, along with a compass, would be invaluable in case electronic devices lose power or fail. 7. Emergency gear: A basic first aid kit, a small multi-tool, a flashlight with extra batteries, a waterproof lighter or matches, and a compact emergency blanket should be part of Ash's gear. 8. Vehicle preparations: If Ash used a vehicle to reach the destination, they should have ensured it was in good working order, had adequate fuel levels, and was equipped with snow chains, a windshield ice scraper, a shovel, and a bag of sand or kitty litter for traction if needed. 9. Know the signs of hypothermia and frostbite: Familiarizing themselves with the symptoms and appropriate responses to hypothermia and frostbite would be crucial in making informed decisions during a snowy ordeal. By following these precautionary measures, Ash could have significantly reduced the chances of getting stranded in the snow or facing other life-threatening situations. Although it's too late for Ash to go back in time to take these steps, anyone else planning a winter excursion should keep these tips in mind for a safer and more enjoyable experience."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the full name of the man that the titular counselor studied under starting in 1861?  Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky...

Following her column about Hollywood’s influence on alleged Santa Barbara shooter Elliot Rodger, The Post’s Ann Hornaday received swift and divided feedback on social media. Here is her response to critics. (Davin Coburn/The Washington Post)      Following her column about Hollywood’s influence on alleged Santa Barbara shooter Elliot Rodger, The Post’s Ann Hornaday received swift and divided feedback on social media. Here is her response to critics. (Davin Coburn/The Washington Post)      As deranged manifestos go, the final YouTube video made by suspected Isla Vista, Calif., mass murderer Elliot Rodger was remarkably well-made. Filmed by Rodger in his black BMW, with palm trees in the background and his face bathed in magic-hour key light, the six-minute diatribe — during which he vows revenge on all the women who rejected him and men who were enjoying fun and sex while he was “rotting in loneliness” — might easily have been mistaken for a scene from one of the movies Rodger’s father, Peter Rodger, worked on as a director and cinematographer.      Indeed, as important as it is to understand Rodger’s actions within the context of the mental illness he clearly suffered, it’s just as clear that his delusions were inflated, if not created, by the entertainment industry he grew up in. With his florid rhetoric of self-pity, aggression and awkwardly forced “evil laugh,” Rodger resembled a noxious cross between Christian Bale’s slick sociopath in “American Psycho,” the thwarted womanizer in James Toback’s “The Pick-Up Artist” and every Bond villain in the canon.      As Rodger bemoaned his life of “loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desire” and arrogantly announced that he would now prove his own status as “the true alpha male,” he unwittingly expressed the toxic double helix of insecurity and entitlement that comprises Hollywood’s DNA. For generations, mass entertainment has been overwhelmingly controlled by white men, whose escapist fantasies so often revolve around vigilantism and sexual wish-fulfillment (often, if not always, featuring a steady through-line of casual misogyny). Rodger’s rampage may be a function of his own profound distress, but it also shows how a sexist movie monoculture can be toxic for women and men alike.      How many students watch outsized frat-boy fantasies like “Neighbors” and feel, as Rodger did, unjustly shut out of college life that should be full of “sex and fun and pleasure”? How many men, raised on a steady diet of Judd Apatow comedies in which the shlubby arrested adolescent always gets the girl, find that those happy endings constantly elude them and conclude, “It’s not fair”?      Movies may not reflect reality, but they powerfully condition what we desire, expect and feel we deserve from it. The myths that movies have been selling us become even more palpable at a time when spectators become their own auteurs and stars on YouTube, Instagram and Vine. If our cinematic grammar is one of violence, sexual conquest and macho swagger — thanks to male studio executives who green-light projects according to their own pathetic predilections — no one should be surprised when those impulses take luridly literal form in the culture at large.      Police were examining this video posted on YouTube in which a man who identifies himself as Elliot Rodger says he is planning an attack in Isla Vista because he had been snubbed by women. Editor's note: This video contains language that some may find disturbing. (YouTube)      Part of what makes cinema so potent is the way even its most outlandish characters and narratives burrow into and fuse with our own stories and identities. When the dominant medium of our age — both as art form and industrial practice — is in the hands of one gender, what may start out as harmless escapist fantasies can, through repetition and amplification, become distortions and dangerous lies.      Every year, San Diego State University researcher Martha Lauzen releases a “Celluloid Ceiling” report in which she delivers distressing statistics regarding the state of women in Hollywood. This year, she found that women made up just 16 percent of directors, writers, producers, cinematographers and editors working on the top 250 movies of 2013; similarly, women accounted for just 15 percent of protagonists in those films.      View Graphic The California shooter’s path      Even if 51 percent of our movies were made by women, Elliot Rodger still would have been seriously ill. But it’s worth examining who gets to be represented on screen, and how. It makes sense to ask, as cartoonist Alison Bechdel does in her eponymous Bechdel Test, whether a movie features (1) at least two named female characters who (2) talk to each other about (3) something besides a man. And it bears taking a hard look at whether we’re doing more subtle damage to our psyches and society by so drastically limiting our collective imagination. As Rodger himself made so grievously clear, we’re only as strong as the stories we tell ourselves. ||||| Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow criticized Washington Post critic Ann Hornaday for writing that films such as the ones produced by Rogen and Apatow -- as well as many others -- are part of what led Elliot Rodger to kill six people near the University of California's Santa Barbara campus on May 23.      \\"How many students watch outsized frat-boy fantasies like 'Neighbors' and feel, as Rodger did, unjustly shut out of college life that should be full of 'sex and fun and pleasure'?\\" Hornaday wrote, referencing the recent comedy starring Rogen. \\"How many men, raised on a steady diet of Judd Apatow comedies in which the shlubby arrested adolescent always gets the girl, find that those happy endings constantly elude them and conclude, 'It’s not fair'?\\"      Hornaday, who also cited \\"American Psycho,\\" James Bond movies and \\"The Pick-Up Artist\\" in her piece, blamed \\"male studio executives\\" for promoting films that value \\"violence, sexual conquest and macho swagger.\\"      \\"No one should be surprised when those impulses take luridly literal form in the culture at large,\\" she wrote.      On Monday, Rogen responded to Hornaday via Twitter.      .@AnnHornaday I find your article horribly insulting and misinformed. — Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) May 26, 2014 .@AnnHornaday how dare you imply that me getting girls in movies caused a lunatic to go on a rampage. — Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) May 26, 2014      Apatow, too, used social media to comment on Hornaday's piece.      The tweets posted by Rogen and Apatow created lots of discussion in online circles, with Awards Daily editor Sasha Stone being one of the most vocal in her defense of Hornaday's ultimate point.      \\"What Hornaday says is that misfit creeps look to movies like that, unrealistic depictions of unattractive males getting hot women, and feel even more slighted by women or society as a result,\\" Stone wrote in a lengthy piece on her site. \\"Why aren't THEY recognized? Why can't they have what that guy has? Haven't American films flipped since the 1970s to give everyone a deserved happy ending? Travis Bickle didn't get one, nor did many of the protagonists in the major motion pictures back then. But we had bizarre murders like Charles Manson and serial killers were on the rise. But mass shootings? That's a new thing. Can we look at movies as at least part of the whole culture around entitlement?\\"      Stone and Apatow also discussed the issue on Twitter.      UPDATE: Later on Tuesday, Hornaday released a video to comment on her piece and the critiques lobbed at her from Rogen and Apatow.      \\"In singling out 'Neighbors' and Judd Apatow, I by no means meant to cast blame on those movies or Judd Apatow's work for this heinous action,\\" Hornaday said. \\"But I do think, again, it bears all of us asking what the costs are of having such a narrow range of stories that we constantly go back to. [...] As a film critic, what I wanted to do was think about what echoes we heard from the larger culture and maybe pose some questions that might be useful.\\"      Watch Hornaday's full response in the video below.      Apatow, meanwhile, also commented on the coverage his tweets about Hornaday received:      Here is how it all works. Anne says something thoughtless. I say it is wrong then CNN asks everyone to debate and it becomes TV. — Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) May 27, 2014 I said no. I wonder if Anne can prevent herself from going on and becoming part of how these tragic events become profit centers for media — Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) May 27, 2014      To read Hornaday's op-ed, head to the Washington Post's website. Sasha Stone's editorial on the story can be found here.      CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the name of University of California Santa Barbara. ||||| Movie critic Ann Hornaday’s Washington Post column, linking the California gunman to Hollywood, has proven controversial. And not for the usual reasons. Her primary error was seeming to implicate the works of Judd Apatow — a move that drew the scorn of conservative writer Ed Morrissey, among others.      Hornaday invites this criticism, but it would be a shame if it overshadowed her larger point: That Hollywood creates a toxic worldview that influences vulnerable and impressionable people.      To be sure, Hornaday’s notion that the entertainment world’s values are an inexorable result of films being created mostly by “white men” — not the logical conclusion of films being created largely by peddlers of a consumerist and nihilistic culture — is where we part ways. White men are not, I would argue, genetically predestined to produce misogynistic or sexist (or otherwise horrific) films.      But Hornaday does make a valid (and some would say courageous) point about the way movies can and do influence us. (In this case, the fact that the shooter’s father was a director and cinematographer of some consequence makes the connection a bit easier.)      This may be her most important graf:      Movies may not reflect reality, but they powerfully condition what we desire, expect and feel we deserve from it. The myths that movies have been selling us become even more palpable at a time when spectators become their own auteurs and stars on YouTube, Instagram and Vine. If our cinematic grammar is one of violence, sexual conquest and macho swagger — thanks to male studio executives who green-light projects according to their own pathetic predilections — no one should be surprised when those impulses take luridly literal form in the culture at large.      There are, of course, a myriad of factors involved in something like this, including the availability of weapons, mental health, parental guidance, etc. Nobody serious would suggest that a perfectly well-adjusted person would see a TV show and then suddenly snap. But the notion that media cannot — does not — over the course of decades, sell a certain weltanschauung seems an absurd argument — undermined by the billions in advertising dollars spent by large companies to get us to purchase their products (and don’t get me started on product placement). If they can sell products, they can sell ideas. (In fact, they usually use the latter to sell the former; people don’t buy widgets, they buy freedom or sex or…whatever.)      (The irony, of course, is that Hollywood is, as previously noted, largely run by liberals — the very people who, in many cases, make a lot of money glamorizing the very values they will later condemn if one were to act them out in real life. For more on that, see my post on Game of Thrones.)      None of this, of course, is a new idea. In fact, conservative columnist Mike Adams echoes much Hornaday’s take. Both mention American Psycho, but Adams also brings in other examples, including Dexter. Citing [murderer Elliot] Rodger’s manifesto, Adams concludes that “Rodger sees himself playing the morally justified role of killing women who deserve to be killed, in his own mind.” “Although he is clearly twisted and demented at some level,” Adams continues, “TV shows like Dexter drive home the message that ‘it’s okay to kill people if they deserve it.'” The real question then becomes who decides who deserves it.      It’s probably dangerous to hypothetically implicate specific movies or shows or directors. But it is, I would argue, fair to raise questions about the culture and the media industrial complex.      There may very well be positive and negative externalities that come from the “products” Hollywood sells. To be sure, the vast majority of us are able to watch Breaking Bad and enjoy the complex well-produced story, without deciding to go into the meth business. We might even be inspired to grapple with some complex questions that need grappling with.      I’m not suggesting we ought to run only Leave it to Beaver episodes, on the off chance that a mentally disturbed person might tune in to Hill Street Blues and go on a rampage. We shouldn’t let a deranged lunatic force us to surrender our First Amendment protections any more than we would allow him to force us to surrender the Second Amendment freedoms.      But what I am suggesting that freedom comes with responsibilities, and that culture has consequences. And a culture that spends decades selling consumerism and violence shouldn’t be surprised to have to deal with the results. Ideas, as they say, have consequences. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Ann Hornaday, a film critic for The Washington Post, wrote an op-ed linking the alleged Isla Vista, California mass murderer, Elliot Rodger, to Hollywood, citing the influence of movies on his actions and worldview.

Interestingly, a surgeon earning 500,000 a year and a bus driver earning 50,000 a year both regard themselves as the middle class! Power refers to the amount of control a person has over other people. Obviously, people in positions of great power (such as governors) exercise big power, but people who take orders from others have less power. Power and class do not always go hand in hand, however. For example, the governor of a state has great power, but he or she may not belong to a corresponding  economic class. Generally, however, there is a relationship between power and class. To our knowledge, there aren't too many people who aren't millionaires in the U.S. Senate! Status is the honor or respect attached to a person's position in society. It can also be affected by power and class, but not necessarily so. For example, a university professor may have a high status but not belong to a high social class or have a lot of power over others.   Question: According to the text, we know that   _  .   Options: (A) power and class do not always correspond with each other (B) status refers to a person's economic position in society (C) people with high status have a lot of control over others (D) class is less important in deciding a person's social rank","output":"A"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls.

The musical is based on Lynn Riggs' 1931 play, Green Grow the Lilacs. Set in Oklahoma Territory outside the town of Claremore in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry. A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fiancee, Ado Annie. The original production of Oklahoma! was an unprecedented critical and popular success. John Anderson of the New York Journal American pronounced the musical \\"a beautiful and delightful show, fresh and imaginative, as enchanting to the eye as Richard Rodgers's music is to the ear. It has, at a rough estimate, practically everything\\". In the New York Herald Tribune, Howard Barnes wrote, \\"Songs, dances, and a story have been triumphantly blended.... The Richard Rodgers score is one of his best, and that is saying plenty. Oscar Hammerstein 2nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics; Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes, while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship.\\" Louis Kronenberger of PM opined that \\"Mr. Hammerstein's lyrics have less crispness and wit than Lorenz Hart's at their best, but the songs in Oklahoma! call for less sophisticated words, and Mr. Hammerstein has found very likeable ones.\\"  In the New York Daily News, Burns Mantle declared that \\"Oklahoma! really is different - beautifully different. With the songs that Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, Oklahoma! seems to me to be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since Edna Ferber's Show Boat\\". New York World-Telegram critic Burton Rascoe particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that \\"Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet [corps], is actually the biggest hit of the show. The \\"Out of My Dreams\\" and \\"All Er Nuthin'\\" dances are such supreme aesthetic delights.... They are spinetingling, out of this world.\\" In The New York Sun, Ward Morehouse commented that \\"Oklahoma! is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical,\\" as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. \\"It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B.\\" Lorenz Hart himself \\"pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in Sardi's restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life.\\"  The only negative review of the musical appeared in the New York Post: The critic wrote that \\"it all seemed just a trifle too cute\\", stating that the score consisted of \\"a flock of Mr. Rodgers's songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation.\\" She concluded that the show was \\"very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm is apt to become a little tiresome.\\" What did critics say?","output":"Critics were overwhelmingly positive and impressed with Oklahoma!, praising its fresh and imaginative approach to musical theater.

Agnes de Mille's choreography and Rouben Mamoulian's direction also garnered acclaim, contributing to the musical's overall charm and appeal. Louis Kronenberger of PM remarked on Hammerstein's lyrics, stating that although they might lack the crispness and wit of Lorenz Hart's work, they were appropriately and enjoyably suited to the themes and setting of Oklahoma! In the New York Daily News, Burns Mantle described the musical as \\"beautifully different,\\" highlighting Rodgers's contribution and the atmospheric lyrics by Hammerstein II. Burton Rascoe of the New York World-Telegram emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that Richard Rodgers's music and Agnes de Mille's choreography were the highlights of the show, with the \\"Out of My Dreams\\" and \\"All Er Nuthin'\\" dances being particularly impactful. Ward Morehouse of The New York Sun appreciated the musical's charm and leisurely feel, noting that even Lorenz Hart, Rodgers's former collaborator, applauded the show from the audience and expressed his delight at the show's premiere. However, there was one negative review from the New York Post, which criticized the musical as being slightly too cute and that the songs tended to sound alike without much variety.

As the trial unfolds, new and disturbing information continues to emerge about the accused couple – Michael and Mairead Philpott. The two, along with a third defendant, Paul Mosley, vehemently deny their involvement in this horrific crime, facing six separate counts of manslaughter. The prosecution alleges that the inferno at the Philpott's home was not a tragic accident but a calculated, cold-blooded act of revenge against Michael's ex-mistress, Lisa Willis. According to court testimony, Michael Philpott had four additional children with Willis, and the bond between the two reportedly began to sour in the weeks before the fire. At the crux of the court case lies a twisted web of love, jealousy, and betrayal. As detailed by the prosecution, the relationship between Philpott and Willis had become increasingly tumultuous, culminating in a series of chilling death threats. Witnesses in court recall Michael Philpott confiding in them about the alleged phone calls from a determined and vengeful Lisa Willis. Philpott had reportedly informed investigating officers about these persistent threats but felt unsatisfied with the perceived lack of action taken against Willis. Frustrated by what he believed to be a negligent response from law enforcement, Philpott allegedly took matters into his own hands. In the dead of night on May 11, 2012, the prosecution claims that Michael Philpott, with the assistance of his wife, Mairead, and their friend, Paul Mosley, conspired to execute a calculated and heinous act of revenge on Lisa Willis by starting the fire. The devastating fire tore through the house in just minutes, leading to the untimely deaths of the Philpott's six children – Jade, 10; John, nine; Jack, eight; Jesse, six; Jayden, five; and Duwayne, 13, for whom Mairead was the stepmother. The deliberate act of arson was, as the prosecution asserts, inextricably linked to the ongoing animosity and rage Michael Philpott and Lisa Willis shared. However, the defense tells a different story. They insist that the accusations facing Michael and Mairead Philpott and their accomplice, Paul Mosley, are nothing but the culmination of a series of unfortunate and unconnected events. With the testimonies set to continue, the trial will reveal the true nature of the relationships embroiled within this case and potentially unveil the dark secrets surrounding the fire that engulfed the Derby home and destroyed the lives of six innocent children. As the battle continues in court, the public is left to wonder if the deaths of these young children were indeed the tragic fallout of a twisted love triangle or merely the victims of an unfortunate accident. As evidence and testimonies come forth, the judge and jury must assess how much blame can be placed upon Michael and Mairead Philpott and Paul Mosley for the heartbreaking end that tore this family apart in the blink of an eye."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  and the situation: A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there  overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first.

The story turns on how difficult it was for the invidual to change his life style and go in another direction. There was always another tough guy wanting to challenge the reputation of the main character. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"In this analysis, the product review portrays a first rate Western in a predominantly flattering light, while showcasing some of its potential challenges and inherent difficulties for the main character. The description of the story as \\"realistic\\" and \\"true life\\" adds a sense of credibility and depth to the narrative, setting it apart from other typical Westerns that may be more fictionalized or glamorized. The focus on the main character's struggle to change his life and escape the constant confrontations with other gunfighters provides readers with an interesting insight into the internal and external conflicts of a person living in the old west. This portrayal suggests a more nuanced and humanizing view of the characters, which can be appreciated by an audience seeking a more grounded and mature story. Additionally, the review notes the relentless pursuit of the main character by other \\"tough\\" individuals seeking to challenge his reputation. This element not only adds tension and intrigue to the plot, but also serves as a commentary on the dangerous and often brutal lifestyle of gunfighters and those living in the old west. It gives the reader an understanding of the hardships and troubles faced by those who tried to navigate this tumultuous era, making it appealing to those who are intrigued by the grittiness and realism of historical fiction. However, one could argue that the mention of the main character's inability to fully escape his past or dodge the confrontations with other gunslingers might be seen as somewhat unflattering. This could depict the story as somewhat tragic or disheartening, which may not appeal to everyone. Nevertheless, this portrayal adds depth and complexity to the story, providing a more well-rounded experience for readers, who may appreciate the exploration of the different facets of the human condition in the context of the old west. In conclusion, this review paints a picture of a first-rate Western product that offers a realistic, engaging, and multifaceted story about the life and struggles of a gunfighter in the old west. While it does touch on some of the more challenging and somber aspects of the main character's life, the overall tone of the review is flattering and highlights the unique qualities of this particular narrative. The product is presented as an immersive story that provides readers with a deeper understanding of the complexities, confrontations, and consequences faced by those who lived during this time period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish...

When we were young we both had affairs, but never with the opposite sex. As we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs. This story is not far fetched.

UPDATED:. 04:29 EST, 18 November 2013. Doris Lessing, the grand old lady of letters who has died at 94, lived long enough to turn against practically all the strongly held convictions of her youth. An avid Communist in her younger days, she later rejected not just communism but feminism and political correctness, too. Still, though, she retained some shocking political thoughts. Days after the attack on the World Trade Centre in 2001, she was belittling the act of terrorism, saying: ‘It was neither as terrible nor as extraordinary as the Americans think.’ Some years earlier, Englishmen were in her sights. In her 1962 feminist classic novel, The Golden Notebook, she attacked their uselessness, particularly their inability to satisfy their wives sexually. But, despite her scorn, it was to England that  she came, from colonial Rhodesia — now Zimbabwe — more than 60 years ago, settling into a gloriously ramshackle, tall, slim house in London’s West Hampstead. Titan: Writer Doris Lessing, pictured in 2006, has died peacefully aged 94 at her home in London. She derided literary prizes, but scooped them all including, in 2007, the Nobel Prize. At 88, she was the oldest woman ever to win it and only the 11th woman to receive the award. Her triumph came as no surprise to a woman formidably confident in her own intellectual abilities. While the Swedish Academy praised Lessing for her ‘scepticism, fire and visionary power,’ when informed about winning the prize, the writer responded: ‘Oh Christ! . . . I couldn’t care less.’ But she later said: ‘I’ve won all the prizes in Europe, every bloody one. So I’m delighted to win them all. It’s a royal flush.’ Born Doris Tayler in 1919 in Persia (now Iran), she moved as a child with her British family to Southern Rhodesia. Her father, who lost a leg in World War I, ran a rundown maize farm, where he was looked after by an increasingly desperate wife, a former nurse, whom the young Doris was at odds with from earliest childhood. Her mother was refined, cold and unemotional, always beautifully dressed and more interested in perfectly polished silver and whether the piano was in tune than in Doris and her brother. ‘I have sacrificed myself to my children,’ she would complain in their hearing. Still, it was her mother who helped to forge  Lessing’s extraordinary literary career, shipping huge parcels of books from England for her daughter. Recognition: Lessing who was born in Persia - now Iran - was awarded the Nobel Prize aged 88 in 2007. She was the oldest woman ever to win it. ‘I was never educated, you see,’ said Lessing, who left convent school at 14. ‘Without the books, I would have come to grief.’ Determined to escape what she described as a stifling, provincial, expat world, she entered a doomed marriage to Frank Wisdom, a civil servant ten years her senior. She was only 19 and it was the eve of World War II. ‘Everyone got married,’ she explained. A fter less than five years and with two children, John and Jean, the marriage came to an end. Rather than subject the boy and girl to the cool neglect she had suffered from her own mother, she decided it would be preferable if she abandoned them, leaving their father to bring them up. In due course, in 1944, she married a German internee, Gottfried Lessing, and had another child. That marriage, too, failed after five years. In 1949, she fled to London with her youngest son. Honor: Lessing shows off her Nobel Prize. She responded to the accolade by saying 'I couldn't care less' Lessing later said: ‘I’m very proud of myself that I had the guts to do it. I’ve always said that if I hadn’t left that life, the intolerable boredom of colonial circles, I’d have cracked up and become an alcoholic or had a mental breakdown.’ Such callousness was hard to forgive. Her older son, John, later told her: ‘I understand why you left, but it doesn’t mean I forgive you for it.’ Just as the Cold War began, Lessing joined the Communist Party, but later came to see that it had been a mistake. ‘We believed this rubbish, absolutely. But I think there is something about politics that makes people mad, really.’ Whatever the shortcomings of her political and private life, she was undeniably a literary titan. Controversial: Doris Lessing's novel The Golden Notebook has been hailed as a classic feminist text. The Grass Is Singing, her 1950 debut novel about the racism of white colonials in Forties Rhodesia, was a sensation. A tide of novels, poems, operas, autobiographies and short stories followed. Over 60 years she published almost 60 books. They were not all rapturously received. After she won the Nobel Prize, the acerbic American literary critic Harold Bloom said: ‘Although Ms Lessing at the beginning of her writing career had a few admirable qualities, I find her work for the past 15 years quite  unreadable . . . fourth-rate science fiction.’ Those early, admirable qualities were most in evidence in her controversial novel The Golden Notebook. Explaining its genesis, she said: ‘I had been listening to women talk about women’s issues and about men. Suddenly when I wrote down these private conversations, people were astounded. It was as though what women said didn’t exist until it was written.’ The sexually graphic book tells the story of Anna Wulf, a deeply frustrated woman at the dawn of the sexual revolution and women’s liberation movement. It is unremitting in its detail. It deals candidly with menstruation, the female orgasm and men’s sexual shortcomings. Lessing called England a country ‘full of men who are little boys and homosexuals and half-homosexuals’. She made it clear that she thought that public boarding schools had a lot to answer for. The Golden Notebook was widely venerated by feminists and declared ‘the Bible of the women’s movement’, though Lessing refused to become a feminist poster girl. She said: ‘What I really can’t stand about the feminist revolution is that it produced some of the smuggest, most unself-critical people the world has ever seen. They are horrible.’ Indeed, in the introduction for  a 1993 reissue of The Golden  Notebook, she said it was not a ‘trumpet for women’s liberation’. ‘I think a lot of romanticising has gone on with the women’s movement,’ she said a few years ago. ‘Whatever type of behaviour women are coming up with, it’s claimed as a victory for feminism — doesn’t matter how bad it is. We don’t seem to go in very much for self-criticism.’ And she told the Edinburgh book festival that modern men were ‘cowed’ by women. ‘They can’t fight back,’ she said. ‘And it’s time they did.’ Return: Lessing's novel was reissued in 1993 - a move called a 'trumpet for women's liberation' Lessing wrote her later works from a messy, chaotic home in Hampstead, North London, with worn-out carpets — more student digs than elegant literary salon. Her black and white cat Yum Yum (named after a character in Gilbert and Sullivan’s light opera The Mikado) would keep her company. So fond was she of her various cats that she wrote three books about them. She was desperate to escape categorisation as a particular kind of writer. Lessing noted that over the years she had been given ‘every conceivable label’ — starting off as a writer about the colour bar, then a Communist, then a feminist, then a mystic. The mystic label came about because of her interest in later life in Sufism, a form of Islamic mysticism. She saw herself as none of these things, but as a storyteller. ‘Just being a writer was the thing,’ she told this newspaper when she was in her 70s. ‘For me, it still is.’","output":"1. Doris Lessing, the renowned writer, passed away at the age of 94, leaving behind a legacy of literary works that both inspired and challenged societal norms. 2. A former communist, Lessing later rejected ideologies such as communism, feminism, and political correctness but still retained some controversial political views. 3. The Golden Notebook, Lessing's 1962 feminist classic novel, criticized Englishmen for their perceived inability to satisfy their wives sexually, earning the book the label \\"the Bible of the women's movement.\\" 4. Lessing won numerous literary prizes throughout her career, including the Nobel Prize in Literature at the age of 88, making her the oldest woman ever to receive the award. 5. Despite her personal and political controversies, Lessing published almost 60 books over 60 years, tackling themes such as racism, women's liberation, and even science fiction, solidifying her legacy as a literary titan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.  Paragraph: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which crop would be more beneficial to farmers, crop A or crop B? Answer:","output":"Crop A would be more beneficial to farmers, as it has been genetically engineered to be herbicide tolerant. This means that it can better withstand the effects of herbicides, allowing for improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. The introduction of herbicide-tolerant crops like crop A has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, ultimately increasing crop yield. In contrast, crop B is not tolerant of herbicides, and may suffer damage and reduced yield when herbicides are used for weed control. Therefore, crop A is the better option for farmers looking to optimize weed management and boost their crop production."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Input: BACKGROUND Population-based estimates of prevalence, risk distribution, and intervention uptake inform delivery of control programmes for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We undertook the third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3) after implementation of national sexual health strategies, and describe the epidemiology of four STIs in Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) and the uptake of interventions.     METHODS Between Sept 6, 2010 and Aug 31, 2012 , we did a probability sample survey of 15,162 women and men aged 16-74 years in Britain. Participants were interviewed with computer-assisted face-to-face and self-completion questionnaires. Urine from a sample of participants aged 16-44 years who reported at least one sexual partner over the lifetime was tested for the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis, type-specific human papillomavirus (HPV), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and HIV antibody. We describe age-specific and sex-specific prevalences of infection and intervention uptake, in relation to demographic and behavioural factors, and explore changes since Natsal-1 (1990-91) and Natsal-2 (1999-2001).     FINDINGS Of 8047 eligible participants invited to provide a urine sample, 4828 (60%) agreed. We excluded 278 samples, leaving 4550 (94%) participants with STI test results. Chlamydia prevalence was 1·5% (95% CI 1·1-2·0) in women and 1·1% (0·7-1·6) in men. Prevalences in individuals aged 16-24 years were 3·1% (2·2-4·3) in women and 2·3% (1·5-3·4) in men. Area-level deprivation and higher numbers of partners, especially without use of condoms, were risk factors. However, 60·4% (45·5-73·7) of chlamydia in women and 43·3% (25·9-62·5) in men was in individuals who had had one partner in the past year. Among sexually active 16-24-year-olds, 54·2% (51·4-56·9) of women and 34·6% (31·8-37·4) of men reported testing for chlamydia in the past year, with testing higher in those with more partners. High-risk HPV was detected in 15·9% (14·4-17·5) of women, similar to in Natsal-2. Coverage of HPV catch-up vaccination was 61·5% (58·2-64·7). Prevalence of HPV types 16 and 18 in women aged 18-20 years was lower in Natsal-3 than Natsal-2 (5·8% [3·9-8·6] vs 11·3% [6·8-18·2]; age-adjusted odds ratio 0·44 [0·21-0·94]). Gonorrhoea (<0·1% prevalence in women and men) and HIV (0·1% prevalence in women and 0·2% in men) were uncommon and restricted to participants with recognised high-risk factors. Since Natsal-2, substantial increases were noted in attendance at sexual health clinics (from 6·7% to 21·4% in women and from 7·7% to 19·6% in men) and HIV testing (from 8·7% to 27·6% in women and from 9·2% to 16·9% in men) in the past 5 years.     INTERPRETATION STIs were distributed heterogeneously, requiring general and infection-specific interventions. Increases in testing and attendance at sexual health clinics, especially in people at highest risk, are encouraging. However, STIs persist both in individuals accessing and those not accessing services. Our findings provide empirical evidence to inform future sexual health interventions and services.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Al Sharpton and the George Zimmerman Controversy: A Call for Justice Introduction: The tragic shooting of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman in 2012 shook the city of Sanford, Florida. The case quickly became a touchstone in the nation's ongoing conversation about race, gun control, and self-defense. The incident has drawn extensive media attention, public demonstrations, and even the intervention of high-profile figures such as civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton. Al Sharpton Leads the Charge: Reverend Al Sharpton, a renowned civil rights activist and television personality, led the charge for justice by calling for the arrest of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot and killed Martin. He organized a series of rallies demanding the arrest and trial of Zimmerman, accusing the police of racial bias in their handling of the case. Police Chief Resignation: Sharpton's activism and the national outcry over the handling of the case resulted in the resignation of Sanford Police Chief, Bill Lee Jr. Lee faced widespread criticism for his department's initial handling of the case, which included not arresting Zimmerman immediately after the shooting. Following public protests and calls for his firing, the Police Chief temporary stepped down from his position in March 2012, before ultimately resigning in June later that year. Investigating Officer's Controversial Past: The investigation of the Trayvon Martin shooting was led by Officer Anthony Raimondo, who was also at the center of a separate racially charged incident where a white teenager, Justin Collison, was caught on video assaulting a black homeless man. Despite the video evidence, Collison did not face any immediate criminal charges, leading to accusations of racism and preferential treatment by the police department. The lack of action in both cases fueled public distrust in the Sanford Police Department's ability to fairly investigate cases, particularly those involving racial tensions. Public Reaction: The killing of Trayvon Martin and initial lack of legal consequences for Zimmerman ignited a firestorm of controversy and national media attention. Many saw the case as emblematic of racial bias in the American criminal justice system. The Justice for Trayvon Martin movement, joined by Al Sharpton and thousands of people across the country, demanded that Zimmerman be held accountable for his actions. Conclusion: The Trayvon Martin case exposed deep-seated racial tensions in the United States and raised critical questions about the fairness of our legal system. Through the efforts of Al Sharpton and countless other activists, the case sparked a massive outcry that led to changes in Sanford's police leadership, the eventual trial of George Zimmerman, and a renewed focus on the pervasive issue of racial profiling. Despite the progress, we must continue to address these issues to ensure that justice is served for all citizens, regardless of their race or background."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Cannibal Holocaust Movie plot: In 1979, an American film crew disappears in the Amazon rainforest while on an expedition to film a documentary about indigenous cannibal tribes. The team consists of Alan Yates, the director; Faye Daniels, his girlfriend and script girl; and two cameramen, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. Harold Monroe, an anthropologist at New York University, agrees to lead a rescue team in hopes of finding the missing filmmakers alive. In anticipation of his arrival, the military conducts a raid on a local tribe known as the Yacumo and takes a young Yacumo male hostage in order to help negotiate with the natives. Monroe flies in via floatplane and is introduced to his guides, Chaco and his assistant, Miguel. After several days of trekking through the jungle, the group encounters the Yacumo tribe. They arrange the release of their hostage in exchange for being taken to the Yacumo village. Once there, the group initially meets hostility and learns that the film team had caused great unrest among the people. The next day, Monroe and his guides head deeper into the rainforest to locate two warring cannibal tribes, the YaÌ§nomamÃ¶ and the Shamatari. They encounter a group of Shamatari warriors and follow them to a riverbank where they save a smaller group of YaÌ§nomamÃ¶ from certain death. Grateful, the YaÌ§nomamÃ¶ invite Monroe and his team back to their village, yet they treat the outsiders with suspicion. To gain their trust, Monroe bathes naked in a river. A group of friendly YaÌ§nomamÃ¶ women emerge to join him and playfully bathe with him. After, they take him to a shrine where he discovers the rotting remains of the missing American filmmakers. Upset and angered, Monroe decides it is of utmost importance to recover the films. He confronts the YaÌ§nomamÃ¶, during which time he plays a tape recorder of tribal music for them. The intrigued natives agree to trade it for the first team's surviving reels of film during a cannibalistic ceremony, in which Monroe has to take part.

Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis will forever have a presence at Grand Central Terminal in New York City following the opening of an entrance named in her honor on Monday. The entrance at Park Avenue and East 42nd Street is a tribute to Kennedy’s important role in fighting to save the station in the 1970s when plans were at an advanced stage to build a 53-story tower built atop the iconic structure. The newly renovated entrance has being named the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Foyer and features a large plaque bronze relief of Onassis and a description of her role in saving the terminal. Jackie Onassis, pictured in 1977, stands beside a huge photo of Grand Central Station during a news conference by the Committee To Save Grand Central, to plead that the terminal be spared demolition. People walk past a plaque of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis after a ceremony on Monday to dedicate Grand Central Terminal's renovated main entry vestibule in memory of the former first lady. Her efforts led to the U.S. Supreme Court upholding the city's Landmark Law in 1978 and saving the station from having its facade and Man Waiting Room destroyed. The Beaux-Arts train terminal first opened in 1913 and by 1947, over 65 million people - the equivalent of 40 percent of the population of the United States - were traveling through it each year. Soon after the railroads fell into a major decline with competition from government subsidized highways and intercity airline traffic. In 1954, a plan was floated - then quickly abandoned - to replace the station with an 80-story structure taller than the Empire State Building. Kennedy's efforts led to the U.S. Supreme Court upholding the city's Landmark Law in 1978 and saving the station from having its facade and Man Waiting Room destroyed. 'Is it not cruel to let our city die by. degrees, stripped of all her proud monuments, until there will be. nothing left of all her history and beauty to inspire our children?'- Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, 1975. The New York Central Railroad continued to dramatically decline and in 1968, plans were unveiled for a Marcel Breuer-designed tower to be built over Grand Central. The terminal had originally been designed to support a tower above it and Breuer’s design would have utilized the existing tower support structure but wouldn’t have preserved the facade or the Main Waiting Room. The plans drew huge opposition, particularly as the orate Pennsylvania Station had been demolished in 1964 despite pleas to preserve it. One of the most prominent supporters of the campaign to save Grand Central was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Her efforts included a handwritten letter in 1975 urging then Mayor Abe Beame not to give up in a court battle to defeat the development plan. The newly renovated entrance has being named the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Foyer and features a large plaque bronze relief of Onassis and a description of her role in saving the terminal. The Beaux-Arts train terminal first opened in 1913 and by 1947, over 65 million people - the equivalent of 40 percent of the population of the United States - were traveling through it each year. ‘Is it not cruel to let our city die by degrees, stripped of all her proud monuments, until there will be nothing left of all her history and beauty to inspire our children? If they are not inspired by the past of our city, where will they find the strength to fight for her future?,’ she wrote. ‘Americans care about their past, but for short term gain they ignore it and tear down everything that matters. Maybe… this is the time to take a stand, to reverse the tide, so that we won't all end up in a uniform world of steel and glass boxes.’ Beame announced that the city would fight to save Grand Central and six months prior to the unveiling of the. Breuer plans, the New York City Landmarks Preservation. Commission designated the station a 'landmark.' In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the city Landmarks Law, which had been challenged by developers. Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis will forever have a presence at Grand Central Terminal in New York City following the opening of an entrance named in her honor on Monday. In 2011, travel magazine Travel + Leisure rated Grand Central the sixth-most-visited tourist attraction for its roughly 21.6 million annual visitors. The landmark case was the first time that the Supreme Court ruled on a matter of historic preservation. 'Mrs. Onassis is one of America's most cherished historical figures and she is considered by many a renowned savior of Grand Central,' Metro-North Railroad President Joseph Giulietti said. 'This landmark building, universally acclaimed as one of the world's great public spaces, is still here today because of her leadership.'

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper. Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: Polioviruses with a G64S mutation in the 3D polymerase have enhanced replication fidelity and are attenuated in animal models. Here we describe the mouse virulence properties of high replication fidelity 3D polymerase variants of human enterovirus 71 (HEV71), with mutations at positions 3D-S264L, 3D-G64R or at 3D-S264L plus 3D-G64R. Mouse-adapted strains (MP-G64R, MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R) were constructed in order to compare the virulence of the 3D polymerase variants with that of mouse-adapted parental virus (MP-26M). MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R were attenuated in mice (mean survival time 7.0 and 7.5 days p.i., respectively) compared to MP-G64R and MP-26M (mean survival time 6.5 and 6.0 days p.i., respectively). MP-26M and MP-G64R infection induced early onset, severe generalised necrotising myositis, whereas MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R infection induced a later onset, mild and focal skeletal muscle myositis. Our findings demonstrate that only the 3D-S264L mutation attenuates HEV71 in mice, suggesting that the high replication fidelity phenotype is not essential for virulence attenuation in this model.   Title: A study of the virulence in mice of high copying fidelity variants of human enterovirus 71","output":"To come up with the answer, I carefully analyzed the given paragraph and compared it with the provided title. The paragraph discusses the virulence properties of 3D polymerase variants of human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) in mice. It involves comparing the survival times of mice infected with different strains of HEV71 and the type of muscle inflammation induced by the infections. The title, \\"A study of the virulence in mice of high copying fidelity variants of human enterovirus 71,\\" accurately represents the content of the paragraph, as it clearly mentions studying virulence in mice of high replication fidelity 3D polymerase variants of HEV71.

His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who decided to devote themselves to portrait painting in 1856?, what is it ?

Additionally, MTV's reality television show \\"Jersey Shore\\" was primarily filmed along the coast of New Jersey. The show, which premiered in 2009, gained significant national and international popularity, making \\"Jersey Shore\\" synonymous with New Jersey's coastal region. While the USA option is also a correct choice geographically since New Jersey is located within this country, the New Jersey option is more specific and accurately portrays the location of the motorway, famous turnpike, and the even MTV-made famous shore mentioned in the question. The other three options (race track, England, and city) do not fit the context or characteristics stated in the question: - Race track: A race track is a specialized venue or facility for racing events, such as automobile or horse racing. In this scenario, \\"race track\\" cannot be determined as the location described by the question. - England: While also located in a first-world country with similar infrastructure, England is an entirely separate nation across the Atlantic Ocean from the United States and has no direct connection to MTV's famous shore. - City: This option is too vague and does not provide the level of specificity required to accurately identify the location mentioned in the question.

So a week ago I stopped talking and with four of my long time buddys. We have known each other for around ten years now but I moved to a different country so we only keep in touch via gaming. In the last few years we were gaming together almost every day and a bit of mocking here and there was pretty much normal but it suddenly got way worse towards me.  I don't really have a lot of money and I don't learn anything because I'm taking care of my father who has cancer. When I finished school, I never looked for a job but helped in the house and  with my little sister. My father is much better now and I've been searching for work for a year now but it's really hard with such a big gap in the history. My Friends know this! Because of that of course I'm not able to afford any new games or any new hardware which leaves me left out a lot. This wouldn't be a problem for me if my friends wouldn't constantly mock me because of it. It started off as a bit of fun but with the time it got a lot worse. Because I sometimes had lag or couldn't afford a newer game or pc they mocked me To a point where they refused to play any games with me and just started all rounds alone (with me listening to it in voice chat).. and they started insulting me calling me a poor shit and making jokes how i will soon sleep on the street and eat junk.. that wasn't even the worst thing they told me too. I told them to stop multiple times but they just called me a crybaby After that has been going on for a few months I decided to just delete them and never talk to them again. This was not an easy decision scince they were pretty much my closest friends  but I couldn't take it anymore.  Two of them have been messaging me on phone and asking what's wrong and if I wouldn't have money for the power bill or what.. I now blocked their numbers as well Now im kind of sitting here alone and have no one to play with and I'm asking myself if I overreacted and if im acting like an Asshole. Thoughts?  I'm sorry for spelling mistakes English is not my main language  TLDR My friends constantly mocked and insulted me for not being able to afford new games or Hardware despesite knowing my situation -i deleted and blocked them.

NPR recently published a piece for the 40th anniversary of the modern sports bra, a clever piece of sportswear innovation produced by Hinda Miller and Lisa Lindahl, which made it way more comfortable for women with breasts to participate in sports and up their exercise game. While it’s a seemingly small thing, and while government interventions like Title IX make far more difference in women’s athletics, it was undoubtedly a game-changer. At least, I definitely appreciate the difference when I’m running.      Thinking about the effects of this invention, I got to thinking: what else do we need from women’s athletic wear?      Of course, there have been a number of innovations in women’s sportswear since the sports bra. Sports bras themselves are now available in plus sizes (you know, for the women who arguably need them the most?) at many outlets, though certainly not enough of them. Athletic hijabs, which have been around for a while now, are finally getting big-name promotion from brands like Nike. Leggings are less see-through. At the Rio Olympics, the South Korean team even wore jackets meant to protect them from mosquito bites (and therefore Zika).      These things may seem small, but they lower the barrier for women’s participation in sports, and they make it less uncomfortable and more enjoyable for us to exercise – particularly when we want to exercise in public. The sports bra is also a great example of how some necessary innovations will only get made when women are involved in the process, and can speak to their own needs and discomforts.      Thinking about what a difference a sports bra makes, I was curious what other innovations we might be missing. For example, how can athletic wear better serve trans women? I know from my own friend group that it can often be damn-near impossible for trans women to find a women’s swimsuit that fits them. Or how could sportswear better serve religiously observant women, or women with disabilities? How can small clothing changes make it a little bit easier for women in rural areas, or women without access to athletic facilities, to exercise safely and comfortably?      Clothes obviously aren’t the end-all or be-all, but they’re a start – and they’re a way to address the ways that athletic wear is often made, first and foremost, with men in mind, and the ways that women’s athletic gear is often designed to fit a narrow, prescriptive body type.      What do you, personally, most need from your sportswear that you’re not getting? Let’s invent!      (Via NPR; image via Shutterstock)      Want more stories like this?

In 1977, Hinda Miller had just started working at the University of Vermont and had taken up jogging. But she found she had a problem: What to do with her breasts? \\"I used two bras,\\" she says. \\"You know, everyone has their stories of what they did.\\"      Across campus, Lisa Lindahl was in the same predicament. She reached out to a friend — Polly Smith, who made costumes for the university's theater department, where Miller also worked — and the three of them got together to build a better bra.      \\"We bought some bras, tore them apart,\\" Miller remembers. \\"I was taking notes; Lisa was running. 'Does that feel good? Does that feel good?' \\"      None of it felt good. See, breasts move — a lot. Up and down, side to side, even back to front. And they can be really heavy. Try as they might, the women couldn't figure out how to make a bra that could stop the painful bounce. At one point, Lindahl's then-husband came downstairs with two jockstraps slung over his chest. He was teasing them, but it led to an idea. Miller remembers thinking, \\"That's what we want to do — we want to pull everything close to the body.\\"      Enlarge this image toggle caption Jane Lindholm/VPR Jane Lindholm/VPR      She ran to the store, bought two jockstraps and brought them back to the costume shop. \\"The waist band became our rib band,\\" Miller says. \\"We crossed the straps in the back because we didn't want them to fall, and it went over our head. And that was it.\\"      They thought about calling their creation the Jockbra, but decided Jogbra was a better fit. The design caught on, and Miller and Lindahl made Jogbra into a national brand.      Two decades later, at the 1999 World Cup, the sports bra got its moment in the sun. U.S. women's national team star Brandi Chastain scored the winning penalty kick of the championship game. Then, filled with emotion, Chastain pulled off her shirt in celebration, revealing a simple black sports bra. Images of that moment were featured on the covers of Newsweek and Sports Illustrated, and on the front pages of countless newspapers.      These days, women have all kinds of options when it comes to their sports bras: There are sports bras as outerwear and sports bras that are glittery, patterned or have crisscrossing straps that peek out prettily when you're doing yoga. They're big business: Global sales topped 7 billion in 2014. But the foundational truth remains: The best sports bra is the kind that allows girls and women to move the way they want to move, without worrying about their anatomy.      Chastain says sports bras are more than clothing — they're an essential piece of equipment. \\"I couldn't play without my cleats, and I wouldn't and couldn't play without my sports bra.\\"      The sports bra may be the unsung hero in the rise of women in sports, quietly claiming its place under a T-shirt. And it all comes back to two jockstraps sewn together in 1977.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the Reserve that was renamed the Cascade National Forest in 1907? is inside the article: The Three Sisters area was occupied by Amerindians since the end of the last glaciation, mainly the Northern Paiute to the east and Molala to the west. They harvested berries, made baskets, hunted, and made obsidian arrowheads and spears. Traces of rock art can be seen at Devils Hill, south of South Sister. The first Westerner to discover the Three Sisters was the explorer Peter Skene Ogden of the Hudson Bay Company in 1825. He describes \\"a number of high mountains\\" south of Mount Hood. Ten months later in 1826, the botanist David Douglas reported snow-covered peaks visible from the Willamette Valley. As the Willamette Valley was gradually colonized in the 1840s, Euro-Americans approached the summits from the west and probably named them individually at that time. Explorers, such as Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth in 1839 and John Frémont in 1843, used the Three Sisters as a landmark from the east. The area was further explored by John Strong Newberry in 1855 as part of the Pacific Railroad Surveys.In 1862, to connect the Willamette Valley to the ranches of Central Oregon and the gold mines of eastern Oregon and Idaho, Felix and Marion Scott traced a route over Scott Pass. This route was known as the Scott Trail, but was superseded in the early 20th century by the McKenzie Pass Road further north. Around 1866, there were reports that one of the Three Sisters emitted some fire and smoke.In the late 19th century, there was extensive wool production in eastern Oregon. Shepherds led their herds of 1,500 to 2,500 sheep to the Three Sisters. They arrived in eastern foothills near Whychus Creek by May or June, and then climbed to higher pastures in August and September. By the 1890s, the area was getting overgrazed. Despite regulatory measures, sheep grazing peaked in 1910 before being banned in the 1930s at North and Middle Sister, and in 1940 at South Sister.In 1892, President Grover Cleveland decided to create the Cascades Forest Reserve, based on the authority of the Forest Reserve Act of 1891.

Context: The Indian Massacre of 1622 took place in the English Colony of Virginia, in what is now the United States, on Friday, 22 March 1622. John Smith, though he had not been in Virginia since 1609 and was not a first hand eyewitness, related in his History of Virginia that braves of the Powhatan \\"came unarmed into our houses with deer, turkeys, fish, fruits, and other provisions to sell us\\". The Powhatan grabbed any tools or weapons available and killed all English settlers they found, including men, women, and children of all ages.  Chief Opechancanough led a coordinated series of surprise attacks by the Powhatan Confederacy that killed 347 people, a quarter of the English population of the Virginia colony. Jamestown, founded in 1607, was the site of the first successful English settlement in North America, and was then the capital of the Colony of Virginia. Its tobacco economy led to constant expansion and seizure of Powhatan lands, which ultimately provoked a violent reaction. Question: How many people in percent of the English population was Chief Opechancanough responsible for killing. Answer:","output":"Chief Opechancanough was responsible for killing 347 people, which was a quarter of the English population in the Virginia colony at that time. To convert this to a percentage, we will perform the following calculation: Percentage = (Number of people killed / Total English population) * 100 First, we need to determine the total English population by using the information that a quarter of the population was killed: Total English population = 347 people killed * 4 (since it is a quarter) = 1388 Now, we shall calculate the percentage: Percentage = (347 people killed / 1388 total English population) * 100 ≈ 25% Chief Opechancanough was responsible for killing approximately 25% of the English population in the Virginia colony during the Indian Massacre of 1622."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An FDA advisory panel has cleared a treatment from Kythera Pharmaceuticals called ATX-101, reports the Wall Street Journal. If the FDA goes along with the recommendation, as it usually does, the injections could win final approval in May and be available from dermatologists a month or two later. Reuters offers this explanation of how it works: The drug \\"is a formulation of synthetically derived deoxycholic acid, which destroys fat under the chin, leaving surrounding tissue largely unaffected.\\" It would be the first such treatment designed to remove specific fat deposits, and the company's stock has tripled since it went public in 2012. Kythera hasn't released pricing, but the treatment—actually a series of shots that would be given in a doctor's office—would presumably be cheaper than than below-the-chin liposuction, which can cost more than 5,000. “My biggest concern is once it is approved, people will start to use it for other areas of the face or for larger volumes (of fat) in other areas,” the president of the Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery tells NBC News. In the wrong hands, it could make things worse, he adds. The FDA panel gave the green light after 19 clinical trials involving 2,600 patients.

This date marks the culmination of a long and challenging process of drafting, discussion, amendments, and ultimate adoption of India's foundational legal document. The day itself is celebrated as Republic Day, a national holiday across India, in honor of this historic occasion. India gained independence from British colonial rule on August 15, 1947. Thereafter, the Constituent Assembly of India was formed to draft and adopt a constitution for the newly independent nation. The Constituent Assembly, consisting of 299 members, most of whom were elected, was charged with creating a constitution that would embody the aspirations and ideals of all Indians. The task of drafting the constitution was a monumental effort. Members grappled with various challenges, including how to accommodate the diverse social, linguistic, and religious groups within the country's vast population. The drafting committee, headed by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, undertook extensive research and study of constitutions from around the world to inform their work. They carefully analyzed the structure, provisions, and effectiveness of these documents in order to create a constitution that would best serve India's unique needs. After almost three years of deliberation, the Constituent Assembly completed the final draft of the constitution on November 26, 1949. The constitution was then adopted by the Constituent Assembly and signed by its members on January 24, 1950. Two days later, the Constitution of India became the principal guiding document for the country's governance, paving the way for India to be officially declared as a sovereign, democratic, federal, and secular republic. The Constitution of India is the longest-written constitution for any sovereign country in the world. It contains 395 original articles, divided into 22 parts and 8 schedules. The document outlines the fundamental rights of Indian citizens, provides guidelines to be followed by the central and state governments, and establishes the separation of powers among the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches. Since its adoption, the Constitution of India has undergone multiple amendments, with the most recent amendment enacted in 2019. The constitution remains a living document that has evolved over time to address changing social and political dynamics and continue to guide India as a nation that values diversity, democracy, and the rule of law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick your answer from: -- description. -- entity. -- abbreviation. -- human. -- numeric. -- location. Answer:","output":"The question \\"Where did the name Daniel originate?\\" is asking about the origin of a specific name, in this case, Daniel. In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let's explore the different categories you have suggested and determine which one the question fits into best. 1. Description: This category typically involves descriptive information about objects, events, or concepts. The question is not asking for a description, but rather the origin of a name. So, it does not fit into this category. 2. Entity: Entity-based questions refer to specific objects, people, or events that are tangible and factual. The question is asking about the origin, which could be an event or concept, and it involves the name Daniel, which is a proper noun used for humans. In this sense, the question can be classified as an entity-based question. 3. Abbreviation: Abbreviation questions focus on understanding shortened or abbreviated forms of words or phrases. Since the question is about the origin of a name and not an abbreviation, it does not fit into this category. 4. Human: Human-based questions deal with people, their roles, actions, ideas, and creations. The name Daniel is a human name, and its origin is connected to human culture and history. Therefore, the question fits well into this category. 5. Numeric: Numeric questions involve numbers, quantities, and measurements. The question is about the origin of a name and does not involve any numerical information, so it does not fit into this category. 6. Location: Location-based questions usually ask about geographical places, coordinates, or details about specific locations. Although the question asks \\"where\\" the name originated, it refers to the cultural or historical origin of the name rather than a specific geographical location. Considering all the categories, the best fit for the question \\"Where did the name Daniel originate?\\" is the \\"human\\" category because it involves the name of a human, and the answer would include information about this name's cultural and historical origins. To provide a further understanding, the name Daniel originates from the Hebrew name דָּנִיֵּאל (Daniyyel), which means \\"God is my judge\\". It is found in the Hebrew Bible and Christian Old Testament and has been a popular name in many cultures and time periods throughout history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You may wonder if there are other examples of static discharge. The answer is yes. Lightning is a form of static discharge. It is much more dramatic than what happens between you and the door knocker, but it is the same principle. You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation. You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below. The ground then becomes positively charged. Over time the differences increase. Eventually the electrons are discharged. This is what we see as lightning. You can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike below.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are two examples of static discharge?\\" is \\"Lightning, and what happens between you and a door knocker\\"?","output":"Yes, that is correct. According to the paragraph provided, two examples of static discharge are lightning and the discharge that occurs between you and a door knocker. Both phenomena involve the buildup and sudden release of electrical energy due to differences in charge. Lightning is a more dramatic and large-scale occurrence of static discharge. It happens during a rainstorm, when clouds develop differently charged regions due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges accumulate at the base of the clouds, while the positive charges accumulate at the top. As these charge differences increase over time, the negatively charged base of the cloud repels electrons in the ground below, causing the ground to become positively charged. Eventually, the electrons are discharged, creating a lightning bolt. On a smaller scale, the static discharge that happens between a person and a door knocker is also due to the buildup of charge difference. When a person walks across a carpet, for example, they can accumulate an excess of electrons, resulting in a negative charge on their body. When they then touch a metallic door knocker, which could be a good conductor of electricity, the excess electrons on their body are quickly released, leading to a small electric shock. This is static discharge on a much smaller and less dramatic scale compared to lightning, but the underlying mechanism is the same: the difference in charge is the driving force that causes the static discharge to occur."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Short movie review: me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the short movie review provided, it can be inferred that the critic had a negative experience while watching the movie. The phrase \\"me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch\\" suggests that the film may have contained content that was nauseating, disturbing, or difficult to watch, leading the reviewer to feel ill or unsettled. This is not a positive reaction and indicates that the movie was not enjoyable for the critic. Furthermore, it conveys a sense of discomfort that may be consistent with disappointment or dissatisfaction with the film's content or execution. Negative reactions like these often come from movies that involve excessive gore, unsettling themes, or poor execution of the plot or storyline. The reviewer might feel that the movie offered little in terms of aesthetic or emotional satisfaction and that the negative aspects outweighed any possible positive attributes. The discomfort experienced might have stemmed from various factors like an inappropriate use of violence, crude humor, or unwarranted shock value. It's also possible that the critic found the pacing, cinematography, or storytelling to be disorienting or confusing, leading to a less-than-ideal viewing experience. In summary, the critic's short review of the movie evokes a sense of negativity and dissatisfaction. By mentioning their extreme discomfort and the prospect of almost \\"losing their lunch,\\" the reviewer warns potential viewers that the film may be overwhelming and unpalatable.

Summarize this article: World      Headed into the holiday season this week, you’re bound to start hearing about people doing good deeds for those in need. Some of these are quiet, anonymous acts and some are more flashy. Others are just plain odd.      Take a Scottish man named Armstrong Baillie who isn’t just committing random acts of kindness this week and through the holidays but has been doing so for the past six months … in a giraffe suit. In fact, he is calling this his “year of the giraffe tour.”      The Courier in Scotland reported that the 32-year-old unemployed man from Dundee got the idea while “on the loo.”      “[...] I wondered ‘what would happen if I dressed up as a giraffe and went around doing good deeds?’” The Courier reported Baillie saying.      Going by the moniker Good Giraffe, Baillie has handed out water and bananas at a local marathon, cleaned beaches, passed out free coffee and more recently, according to the Courier, watched a black Labrador retriever for the day. They were a happy pair.      Here are some answers questions you might have about the Good Giraffe:      Where did the costume come from? His mother made it.      His mother made it. How does he get around/fund some of his endeavors? He hitchhikes and receives donations through what The Courier calls “busking,” which is defined as street performing.      He hitchhikes and receives donations through what The Courier calls “busking,” which is defined as street performing. What is his favorite good deed to date? Cleaning up the beaches at Oban and Stonehaven.      Watch the Good Giraffe share some more about himself in this YouTube video while he was on a local beach:      Baillie said although he spends some of his time in costume doing good works, he is still looking for a full time job and writing an adventure novel.      ”I am looking for work but I would like to think the Good Giraffe would be part of that one day. Even if it’s not, I would still want to do this at least once a week,” Baillie said according to to The Courier.      Read more about the Good Giraffe here. Keep up with the Good Giraffe’s thoughts and doings on Baillie’s blog here.      (H/T: NPR) ||||| Scotland is growing to love the Good Giraffe's high ideals      A Dundee man who carries out random acts of kindness while dressed as a giraffe admits the bizarre wheeze came to him during a trip to the toilet.      For the past six months, Armstrong Baillie has been spotted across Scotland in his eye-catching animal suit, performing good deeds such as handing out bananas and water to runners at the Edinburgh Half Marathon.      He has also completed beach cleans and even given free coffee to chilly strangers.      Dubbed the Good Giraffe, the unemployed 32-year-old was spotted in Dundee on Thursday, where he lives with his girlfriend, fulfilling his latest selfless act — looking after an energetic black labrador for the day.      When asked why the giraffe was his animal of choice, Mr Baillie replied: ''I was on the loo and I wondered 'what would happen if I dressed up as a giraffe and went around doing good deeds?'      ''That is the truth — that was where it started.''      Despite being unemployed, Mr Baillie, who is originally from Glasgow, funds his kind-hearted trips through busking. He hitchhikes to cities and towns in the long-necked outfit, made by his mother.      Mr Baillie continues to look for employment but says he has no plans to hang up his homemade hide even if he secures a full-time job.      ''I feel good when I do it,'' he continued. ''When I carry out these acts it seems to have a knock-on effect and people seem to have a positive response. That's my whole thing — what comes around goes around.      ''There have been happy and sad moments from my life that have led to the creation of the Good Giraffe.''      He added: ''I am looking for work but I would like to think the Good Giraffe would be part of that one day. Even if it's not, I would still want to do this at least once a week.''      The Good Giraffe has become a much-loved figure in many communities and attracted widespread media coverage.      He has also been given the celebrity seal of approval by comedian Greg McHugh, of Gary Tank Commander fame, who bumped into the giraffe while in a Glasgow pub.      Despite the attention he now receives, Mr Baillie remains focused on continuing his novel venture.      He spoke of his favourite selfless act to date.      ''I really enjoyed tidying the beach at Oban and Stonehaven,'' said Mr Baillie. ''I liked the smells of the sea. I remember things in my life from smells of different places and tastes of food in those places.''      cmcmanamon@thecourier.co.uk |||||","output":"The Good Giraffe is a persona created by Armstrong Baillie, a 32-year-old Scottish man from Dundee.

Question: Given the below context:  Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that \\"I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy\\" and complaining of \\"the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth\\" which he considered \\"such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it\\". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student.

However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron.

Making his way through thick woods, he encounters a drifter who is violently slashed to death after Billy leaves. Billy stumbles on an old mansion where a room is decorated for birthday celebrations. Thinking it is a surprise by his parents, he opens a present to discover a severed head. Running away, he is attacked by the drifter's killer, a werecat with a hook on one hand, and subsequently buried alive. Meanwhile, a group of teenagers and some older adults come across the mansion intending to have a party, believing the mansion to be abandoned. However, a sorcerer named Kreon resides there, keeping watch over his bride who he has kept preserved for over 70 years using an unrevealed method, but it is known that he needs human victims in order to do it. He possesses one of teenagers in the group to use a Ouija board and summons a variety of monsters to pick off the group one by one. These include muck-men, small reptilian demons, giant spiders, an arachnid woman, an octopus-like creature with electric tentacles, a skeletal witch, a Grim Reaper statue, a vampiric boy in a monk's habit, and a large group of zombies.

Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”.

The move south came when, in 1934, the Land Settlement Association established 20 sites where jobless families were given smallholdings. Families of 120 men relocated to the largest of the farms at Sidlesham. Their story is being retold at Chichester's Novium museum. The creation of the smallholdings was to alleviate mass unemployment which had hit the North East. Each tenant was given a house, piggery, chicken battery, access to a glasshouse and four acres of land, with the smallholdings run as a cooperative. Norman Dixon, now 86, was just 10 when he arrived with his family from Gateshead. Mr Dixon, who left Tyneside with his family in 1939, said: \\"I was a little boy when we came down here with the whole family. \\"My father had been down the coal mines looking after the old pit ponies, but he ended up on the dole for about 13 years. \\"He put his name down for the scheme and was given a place here at Sidlesham. \\"When we left home it was the only time I saw my mother cry.\\" The family eventually established a successful agricultural business, producing vegetables and keeping pigs and hens. Mr Dixon worked for his father for 13 years and later took over the smallholding when he retired in the late 1950s. He still lives in the same house his family took over as a tenant. He added: \\"We fitted in all right. In fact there were four new classrooms built at the school to take the LSA children.\\" Bill Martin, who carried out the research for the exhibition, compared the success of the LSA scheme to the disappointment of the Jarrow marchers of 1936, who walked to London to lobby for help for the unemployed but returned empty handed. Mr Martin said: \\"The 200 who marched from Jarrow returned with nothing. The 120 [at Sidlesham] were to begin a multi-million pound horticultural industry which still exists today, The families who moved to Sidlesham have remained in the area, with many of the smallholdings being passed down through generations. Chichester District Council said the LSA officially closed in 1983 and a group of tenants formed their own company which traded until the late 1990s. Most of the properties are now privately owned, but independent growers remain there, the local authority added. Museum experts have described the development of Sidlesham's LSA as a significant historical event. Other LSA schemes were established at Dunstable in Bedfordshire, Fen Drayton in Cambridgeshire and Harrowby in Lincolnshire. Manager of the Novium, Cathy Hakes, said: \\"It's a story that is living history and in living memory. She added that to be able to tell the story was \\"just fantastic\\".

Sex after illness, loss and infidelity Life changes such as illness, aging and infidelity can tax a couple's intimacy. Editor's note: Iris Krasnow's book \\"Sex After ... Women Share How Intimacy Changes as Life Changes\\" was recently released by Gotham Books. She is a professor at American University, where she teaches journalism and women's studies courses. (CNN) -- During the past two years, I have been digging into the intimate relationships of 150 women, ages 20 through 90, for my new book, \\"Sex After ... Women Share How Intimacy Changes as Life Changes.\\" I take readers from the honeymoon hots through tepid midlife to some surprisingly steamy senior sex. Many of my subjects describe easy and sexy romances; others are pushing through emotional and physical roadblocks. Here are snapshots of some of those stories of tough love. Between 10-15% of women suffer from postpartum depression that affects sexual desire and can cause serious rifts in a young marriage. Texas psychologist Christine Hall's struggle through the blues after childbirth led her to create a specialty practice in treating clients with postpartum mood disorders. Hall's own depression was so severe that for a flash she considered taking her own life. With the help of a supportive husband, therapy and anti-depressants, she fought her way back. Here is a snippet of our interview that appears in the \\"Sex After Baby\\" chapter: I see in my practice that sex can really cause a lot of distance between the couple. The spouse is thinking, \\"All right, the OB said we could have sex after six weeks. Let's go to it, honey.\\" And the new mom is telling me, \\"Oh my God, I can't do this yet. I am still fat and sad and I am not ready to have anyone close to me -- other than the baby!\\" I tell them my own story, that there is hope -- I'm at a really good place now. You go from not feeling sexy at all and trying to get across to your partner, \\"Hey these are not your boobs right now' to feeling 'hey I'm ready, let's do it'. Richaela's husband, Derek, was deployed to Afghanistan three weeks after their wedding. She was 20, and he was 22. Six months later, Derek stepped on an improvised explosive device and lost part of his right leg. To add to the bedlam of this tragedy, Richaela gave birth to their daughter, Madeline, early on in Derek's treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. After excruciating hard work to become intimate again, emotionally and physically, they are now enjoying \\"full-on sex,\\" Richaela told me, and a very sturdy marriage. Here is a portion of her story: When this first happened to Derek, I just felt helpless, like I would never get my husband back. He was so depressed and angry, and he also had post traumatic stress disorder. I felt like leaving the marriage, and it was hard to become intimate again. He'd want to have sex, but with the pain in his leg, he couldn't bear weight. Once we figured out how to finally do it, every time we'd finish with an orgasm, his leg would jolt with pain. It made me feel really bad because he would say \\"I want to have sex with you,\\" but it would hurt him afterward. Honestly, we don't have sex in long sessions any more like we used to because he just gets tired more quickly. I don't really mind. At least I have my husband! You come to realize that love in marriage comes from so many other things than what our bodies can do. It's only a leg; I've seen far worse when we were at Walter Reed. There were many men with two and three limbs missing, plus genital injuries. Five years ago, Sophia was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer at 37. She had her left breast removed and reconstructed, then endured months of chemotherapy and radiation that left her weak and bald and frightened that she would not live to see her two young kids enter kindergarten. Tanned in a low-cut sundress, today Sophia is cancer-free, and she offers a hopeful message to the one in eight American women who will be struck with breast cancer in their lifetimes. Here is a swatch of our conversation: Don't miss out on the conversation we're having at CNN Living. for the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life. My husband was surprisingly turned on by my new look. It was like he got to sleep with another woman. Though I am not thrilled with the way my chest looks. I prefer to have sex with my shirt on now, because it makes me think less about how my breasts used to be. Recovering from cancer, while the physical intimacy was good, I would often feel like I needed more emotional support from him. And I should have asked for it; this is a lesson I can pass on to other women in my situation. I created the problem really, because in my efforts to be strong in front of the kids and to just keep going forward, I let my husband assume I was invincible. And he was so turned on by how tough I was, this Warrior Woman, I didn't let myself be weak with him. In retrospect, I should have told him the truth, that I was often tired. That I was scared the cancer would come back. That I was vulnerable and just needed him to hold me. Let's talk about sex ... and cancer The 15-year mark in a marriage is a popular juncture for divorce and infidelity. Affairs that are outed can either wreck a marriage or open communication lines, as remorse leads to forgiveness and potentially a more honest union. Increasingly, though, I found in composing this book that many people who take on lovers do so in secret, so as not to rock the boat. Pamela, 53, is a married mother of five who last year reconnected with the \\"soul mate who got away.\\" They are now lovers, and she is determined to keep both men in her life. Here is part of her story in the \\"Sex After Infidelity\\" chapter: This previous boyfriend was my first love and my greatest lover. And he still is. Yet I do not want to leave my husband and hurt him. My marriage is a good one. I love both men, and I have chosen to keep both men. A secret life can be very sexually affirming if it stays a secret. If I went to a therapist, she would say \\"choose.\\" I can't choose. I get the best of both worlds: I have the stability and security of my husband, an intact family for my children, and I have the passion that I want and need in my life. While researching \\"Sex After ...,\\" I looked for older women whose husbands had died recently and had been their only lovers. Those wives who had nursed husbands through long illnesses were clearly grieving, yet they admitted to some relief. Patricia was married for 55 years in what she described as a \\"wonderful love affair.\\" Her husband suffered from a chronic heart condition for most of those years and finally succumbed to leukemia. At 80, she has found solace with an old friend her age who had also lost his wife. I love Patricia's story, a portion of which she tells below, and the hopeful stories like hers in the \\"Giddy Golden Girls\\" chapter that shatter myths of the little old lady as fragile and dried up. I never thought I would ever want to get involved with another man. Our friend Steven would ask me out, and I would say, \\"I'm not ready.\\" He was very romantic and persistent, though. He would send me long-stemmed white roses every two weeks. I finally went on a date with him on New Year's Eve. But I was still afraid to touch another man. At midnight, I wouldn't go near him. Then about a year after my husband died, Steven asked me to go to Paris with him. I said, \\"OK, I guess it's time to try you out.\\" My husband was the only man I'd ever slept with, so being intimate with another man was very scary. Without giving you details, let me just say things are going well. I feel wonderful, like a teenager. The love, the making love -- it's so romantic it's almost electrifying. After taking care of someone so ill for so many years, this is fantastic. Finding love in my 80s is like opening another world I never knew could exist. Not only do I have a golf partner and a life partner, but the sex part is very, very good. It is not \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" but it is definitely erotic and warm and beautiful.

Jackson), a deeply religious farmer and former blues guitarist, and Rae Doole (Christina Ricci), a young sex addict. Lazarus' wife and his brother were having an affair, which has left him bitter and angry. Rae's boyfriend Ronnie Morgan (Justin Timberlake) leaves for deployment with the 196th Field Artillery Brigade, Tennessee National Guard, and in his absence, she indulges in bouts of promiscuity and drug use. During one of Rae's binges, Ronnie's friend Gill Morton (Michael Raymond-James) tries to take advantage of her. She laughs at his advances, comparing him unfavorably with another man, and he severely beats her. Believing she's dead, Gill dumps Rae and leaves her for dead in only a shirt and panties by the side of the road and drives away. Lazarus discovers Rae unconscious in the road the next morning and brings her home to nurse her back to health. Lazarus goes to see Tehronne (David Banner) - the man who Lazarus thought had beaten her - and learns of her promiscuity. Over the course of several days, Rae, delirious with fever, occasionally wakes up and tries to flee from Lazarus. He chains her to the radiator to keep her from running away. After Rae regains her wits, Lazarus announces that it is his spiritual duty to heal her of her sinful ways and refuses to release her until he does so. Rae makes several attempts to escape, and even briefly has sex with a teenage boy who helps out on Lazarus' farm. She eventually comes to tolerate her position. Lazarus buys her a conservative dress to wear, plays the guitar for her, and feeds her home-cooked meals. Lazarus' pastor and close friend, R.L.

Options：  A. embarrassment indictment  B. tension  C. going to jail  D. penalty  E. mistrial Answer:","output":"B. tension When someone is committing perjury, or knowingly lying after having sworn to tell the truth, especially in a legal procedure, they might feel a sense of tension. This feeling could stem from the fear of getting caught or the moral dilemma they are facing due to their dishonest actions. It's important to note that feelings can greatly vary depending on the individual's personality, conscience, and the circumstances under which they are committing perjury. However, 'tension' most suitably describes a psychological state one might experience under such conditions.  The other options aren't as suitable because 'embarrassment indictment', 'going to jail', 'penalty', and 'mistrial' are potential consequences that could follow after the act of perjury has been discovered and proven, rather than feelings experienced whilst committing the act."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history.

Question: Given the following context:  Pavement was formed in 1989 in Stockton, California, by Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg. Malkmus and Kannberg had previously performed together in the band Bag O' Bones. Pavement had its start playing at open mike nights at clubs and bars. The songs the band played during this time were mostly covers, although they also performed many original songs that would later be released on Slay Tracks. Malkmus recalls, \\"It was pretty reasonable to be able to make a single for 1,000, so we decided to go for it. We didn't have any real plans because we weren't a real band.\\" Two local studios existed in Stockton, the cheaper and less professionally minded of which was Gary Young's Louder Than You Think Studio. The band decided to record at Young's studio due to their admiration of other local punk bands who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities. Kannberg reportedly borrowed 800 from his father to record Slay Tracks.Slay Tracks was recorded during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing the studio and the recording process, said, \\"You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a guide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top.\\" Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, \\"[Malkmus and Kannberg] come in and they play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'\\" Kannberg said, \\"We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it.\\" The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the pseudonyms S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person that claimed they weren't a real band?

Carolingian art was produced for a small group of figures around the court, and the monasteries and churches they supported. It was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art, but was also influenced by the Insular art of the British Isles. Insular art integrated the energy of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic styles of ornament with Mediterranean forms such as the book, and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period. Surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are mostly illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, originally made for metalwork that has since been melted down. Objects in precious metals were the most prestigious form of art, but almost all are lost except for a few crosses such as the Cross of Lothair, several reliquaries, and finds such as the Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo and the hoards of Gourdon from Merovingian France, Guarrazar from Visigothic Spain and Nagyszentmiklós near Byzantine territory. There are survivals from the large brooches in fibula or penannular form that were a key piece of personal adornment for elites, including the Irish Tara Brooch. Highly decorated books were mostly Gospel Books and these have survived in larger numbers, including the Insular Book of Kells, the Book of Lindisfarne, and the imperial Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram, which is one of the few to retain its \\"treasure binding\\" of gold encrusted with jewels.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Running only seventy-two minutes, this small, overlooked 2006 dramedy is really just a two-character sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations. Taking place almost entirely in various, non-descript spots in southern Los Angeles, the story itself is inconsequential, but like Sofia Coppola's \\"Lost in Translation\\", the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly, find a common bond and go back to their lives enlightened for the momentous encounter. It also helps considerably that Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are playing the characters. Finally freed of the wise sages and authority figures beyond reproach that have become his big-screen specialty, Freeman seems comparatively liberated as a somewhat self-indulgent movie star. His character is driven to a low-rent grocery store in Carson, where he will be able to research a role he is considering in an indie film. Out of work for a few years, he is embarrassed when he sees DVDs of his films in the bargain bin, but his ego is such that he does not lack the temerity to watch and even mimic the enervated store staff. Of particular fascination to him is Scarlet, an embittered worker from Spain and relegated to the express line where she is the unsung model of efficiency. She has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company, but her deep-seeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already. Still looking like Penelope Cruz's Amazonian sister, the beautiful Vega (one of the few redeemable aspects of James L. Brooks' execrable \\"Spanglish\\") brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to Scarlet. She and Freeman interplay very well throughout the story, which includes stops not only at the grocery store but also at Target, Arby's and a full-service carwash. Nothing earth-shattering happens except to show how two people realize the resonating transience of chance encounters. Silberling keeps the proceedings simple, but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in Phedon Papamichael's vibrant cinematography (he lensed Alexander Payne's \\"Sideways\\") and the infectious score by Brazilian composer Antonio Pinto (\\"City of God\\"). There are fast cameos by Bobby Cannavale (as Scarlet's soon-to-be-ex-husband) and as themselves, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, as well as a funny bits with Jonah Hill (\\"Knocked Up\\") as the clueless driver and Jim Parsons (the \\"knight\\" in \\"Garden State\\") as a worshipful receptionist. The 2007 DVD is overstuffed with extras, including a making-of documentary, \\"15 Days or Less\\", aimed at film students and running a marathon 103 minutes; six extended scenes; a light-hearted but insightful three-way conversation between Silberling, Freeman and Vega in the middle of Target; and a couple of snippets that specifically advertise the DVD.","output":"This review has a positive sentiment.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- The legal troubles threatening to send Chris Brown to prison for several years began with the singer's arrest five years ago in the brutal attack on then-girlfriend Rihanna. Brown has spent almost all of the past six months either in rehab or jail. He's been locked up since he was booted from a court-ordered substance abuse and anger management program on March 14. Brown has two pending criminal cases, both stemming from his alleged inability to control his anger. Brown's D.C. assault case Brown, 24, and his bodyguard, Christopher Hollosy, allegedly punched Parker Adams after a quick exchange of words on a sidewalk blocks from the White House last October. Brown was arrested on a felony assault charge, but it was reduced to a misdemeanor and he was released on bond the next day. The trial is set to begin Wednesday in D.C. Superior Court. Hollosy did not take the stand in his own trial, but his lawyer indicated Hollosy would say that he hit","output":"Adams first to protect Brown, and that Brown did not punch Adams. The situation happened because Adams tried to get into a photo with Brown and a female fan, which upset Brown. Witnesses said that Adams then got into an altercation with both Brown and Hollosy.

Mrs Mujuru, once seen as a possible future leader of Zimbabwe, has denied plotting against the president. State media and Mr Mugabe's wife, Grace, have conducted a campaign against her for months. \\"President RG Mugabe has exercised his executive powers to release the Honourable Joice Mujuruâ€¦ with immediate effect,\\" said a statement issued by chief secretary to the cabinet Misheck Sibanda. Mrs Mujuru's conduct had been \\"inconsistent with the expected standard\\", it said. The ministers whose sacking was announced on Tuesday included State Security Minister Didymus Mutasa - another long-time ally of Mr Mugabe - and Energy Minister Dzikamai Mavhaire, who was seen as close to Mrs Mujuru. There was no immediate word on replacements. The sackings come a week after Mr Mugabe denounced his vice-president at a party congress and removed her from her post in the ruling party, Zanu-PF. Mrs Mujuru responded on Tuesday by saying her loyalty to Mr Mugabe was \\"unquestionable\\" and it was \\"repugnant\\" and \\"ridiculous\\" to suggest she had plotted to kill him or wanted to remove him from office. She said Zimbabwe's state media had \\"continued to publish malicious untruths\\" about her and that she had \\"become the fly in a web of lies whose final objective is the destruction of Zanu-PF\\". Her accusers, she said, had produced \\"not a single iota of evidence\\" against her. Mr Mugabe, 90, has been in power since Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. He is due to stand for election again in 2018. Mrs Mujuru fought alongside him in the 1970s guerrilla war against white-minority rule and had been thought a possible successor as president. But correspondents say her career ran into trouble when Mr Mugabe's wife entered politics earlier this year. Analysis - By Brian Hungwe, BBC News, Harare Mrs Mujuru's sacking was not a huge surprise. She has been under siege for the past three months and her relationship with Mr Mugabe had broken down. Grace Mugabe has been spewing vitriol at public rallies, telling the vice-president to resign or apologise. Mrs Mujuru has dug in despite the gravity of the allegations. Now her sacking is official, the public eagerly await her next move. She appears ready to face the consequences of the situation - but her options are limited. She is damned if she leaves the party, damned if she stays. Her supporters may press her to join the opposition trenches. That could be dangerous, given the threats by Mr Mugabe of imminent arrest. The intelligence services are known to keep files of \\"dirt\\" for use against those who defect. If she stays, she will be a diminished and disparaged figure, likely to demoralise those allies who would be prepared to leave with her. Mrs Mugabe repeatedly accused Mrs Mujuru of plotting against her husband and Mr Mugabe told delegates at the party congress that he welcomed his wife's action to expose the alleged treachery. Grace Mugabe, 49, once her husband's secretary, is now a senior party figure, having been appointed leader of Zanu-PF's women's wing last week. Speculation is building that she may seek to succeed Mr Mugabe when he retires or dies. Correspondents say another prominent figure expected to benefit from the political demise of Mrs Mujuru is the veteran Justice Minister, Emmerson Mnangagwa. What is a summary of this text?","output":"In a country called Zimbabwe, there was a president named Mr. Mugabe. He thought that his vice president, Mrs. Mujuru, was planning something bad against him. Because of this, he removed her from her job and also fired seven other people who worked for the government.

Here is a news article: NEW YORK — Hold the pickles, onions and special sauce. The Big Mac is becoming a victim of finicky tastes.      As sales continue to slide in the U.S., McDonald’s plans to expand a test that lets people build their own burgers by tapping on a touchscreen to pick the bread, cheese and toppings they want. The company says it will bring the option to 2,000 of its 14,000 U.S. locations next year.      The “Create Your Taste” program is a departure for McDonald’s, which was built to deliver food consistently, quickly and affordably. That model has come under pressure as people gravitate toward places like Chipotle, which lets people pick what goes on their bowls and burritos as they walk down a line.      According to industry executives and analysts, the ability to customize food orders is becoming more important, particularly among people in their 20s and 30s. McDonald’s has already been trying to adjust by installing new kitchen prep tables that can hold more toppings and sauces.      The plans to offer greater customization come as McDonald’s fights to boost declining sales and customer traffic. On Monday, it said U.S. sales fell 4.6 per cent in November at established locations. The figure fell 4 per cent in the unit that includes the Asia-Pacific region, where the company is fighting to recover from a food supplier scandal. Overall, global sales declined 2.2 per cent for the month.      Related      Back in the U.S., CEO Don Thompson has conceded the company hasn’t done enough to keep up with shifting habits and that changes are in store.      “We haven’t been changing at the same rate as our customers’ eating-out expectations,” Thompson said in October.      Offering greater customization could be a challenge for McDonald’s, however. For “complicated” orders, burgers might take as long as five to seven minutes to prepare, Greg Watson, senior vice-president of menu innovation, said in a phone interview. That’s more than the couple of minutes it should take for regular orders, he said.      The customized burgers are also more expensive than core items like Big Macs, Watson said. But it’s not clear whether people will be willing to wait longer or shell out more money for a burger from McDonald’s.      Watson said McDonald’s hasn’t yet decided on expansion of “Create Your Taste” beyond the 2,000 locations next year. In Australia, McDonald’s said earlier this year a customized burger option would be expanded nationally. The locations that have the “Create Your Taste” option still offer the regular menu as well.      As for the regular menu, McDonald’s plans to remove some items “with slower movement” from the national menu in the U.S. The Bacon Clubhouse burger, which McDonald’s introduced this year as a premium offering, could become a regional offering, Watson said.      In the meantime, McDonald’s is also trying to address long-held perceptions about the quality of its food. It recently launched a campaign that answers questions about its food, such as, “Does McDonald’s beef contain worms?” and is planning new marketing for the year ahead.      McDonald’s troubles aren’t isolated to the U.S. In Asia, the company has been trying to bounce back since the summer, when a TV report in China showed workers at one of its suppliers repackaging meat that was alleged to be expired. The claim has not been publicly confirmed by the supplier or the government.      The Oak Brook, Illinois, company said comparable sales for Europe fell 2 per cent in November with a strong performance in the U.K. more than offset by weakness in Russia, France and Germany.      McDonald’s has more than 35,000 locations in more than 100 countries. Its stock fell US2.81, or 2.9 per cent, to US93.50 before the market opened Monday.      The Associated Press ||||| December 8, 2014 4 min read      After months and months of depressing earnings reports, one question must be on every McDonald's exec's mind: How on earth can we turn things around?      Same-store sales fell 2.2 percent globally and 4.6 percent in the U.S. in November, McDonald's reported on Monday. The chain hasn't seen any growth in U.S. sales for over a year.      How can the fast-food chain pull itself out of the rapidly deepening rut? Here are four possible ways to turn things around.      Go fast-casual. As the fast-casual business increasingly cuts into the market for fast food, it may be time for McDonald's to try and ditch its cheap but low-quality reputation.      It seems the chain may be heading that way. \\"Today's consumers increasingly demand more choice, convenience and value in their dining-out experience,\\" McDonald's CEO Don Thompson said in a statement.      Related: Pizza + Doritos? Pizza Hut Says Yes.      At least some McDonald's locations are focusing on boosting the choice aspect, with a customizable menu that offers more options – and pricier burgers. McDonald's \\"Create Your Taste\\" test platform is now expanding from four California stores to 30 locations in five more states, reports USA Today. By 2015, 2,000 U.S. locations will offer the menu platform, which allows customers to order more high-end burgers with toppings like eggs, smoked bacon and grilled mushrooms via tablet-like kiosks. The higher-quality burgers cost substantially more, with a customer burger with a drink and fries coming in at around 8.29, according to USA Today.      The option is additionally expanding nationally in Australia, where the platform has also been widely tested. Incidentally, Australia was the only bright spot in McDonald's Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) same-store sales, which dropped 4 percent despite Australia's positive performance.      Serve more chicken. With the expansion of the \\"Create Your Taste\\" platform, McDonald's is adding a second meat to the menu: Chicken. Now customers will be able to build their own chicken sandwiches at the kiosks.      Chicken was the surprise MVP of the quick service industry in 2014, with chicken chains like Chick-fil-A and Bojangles thriving and restaurants across the industry adding more chicken to the menu. Servings of breaded chicken sandwiches have grown an average of 3 percent over the last four years.      Chicken is seen as a healthier option than burgers, whether or not the sandwiches actually have a higher calorie count, helping the trendy fowl to fit in with the fast-casual trend. Additionally, with increased beef and pork prices, chicken is an economically sound options for restaurants interested in expanding their menu. Maybe it's time for the biggest burger chain in the world to downplay the hamburger and focus on chicken instead.      Related: Taco Bell Is Hungry for Global Expansion      Simplify the menu. While the \\"Create Your Taste\\" menu sounds awesome in theory, it seems to run counter one of McDonald's plans: simplifying the overstuffed menu.      McDonald's maintains that to restore momentum in the U.S., it is \\"diligently working\\" to simplify the menu. However, in an October survey, the vast majority of franchisees stated that McDonald's had failed so far to fulfill its promise to streamline the menu, something that has been on the company's to-do list for about a year.      Regain China's trust. McDonald's U.S. same-store sales slump is disturbing for the chain in large part because there is no one problem the brand can focus on. At least in Asia, McDonald's knows what the issue is.      The scandal surrounding a McDonald's supplier selling expired meat has continued to damage McDonald's performance in Japan and China. Currently, the chain hopes to fix the problem by leveraging menu options and deals, but ultimately the only fix is to wait it out.      Yum Brands, who was also affected by the meat supplier scandal, estimated in October that recovery in the region would take at least six to nine months. So, internationally at least, it’s a waiting game for McDonald's.

Advances in technology, events, places, first contacts with new beings, names, dates, etc. ENTERPRISE pretty much disregards much of ST canon. An unfortunate fact for long time serious fans. As one, I assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of TOS and retro back from there -- but no. The phase pistols, like much of the technology, look much more modern than found in TOS. An old style Starfleet laser gun, a slow gold speckle transporter effect -- that's what I expected to see. Also, I did not expect to hear pure beep-based sound effects similar to TNG but far apart from TOS sound effects.  In the earliest view of TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE), we see a Starfleet with a more formal military aspect -- a bit of old earth Navy. With ENTERPRISE, we see a shocking disregard for rank. There is more military code in the cartoon STAR BLAZERS than in ENTERPRISE. It is fine that Captain Archer is unsure about the needs of the Universe (quite unlike Kirk who never lacked confidence in his application of human justice), but inside ENTERPRISE everyone seems like an equal. Unprofessional, unsure, more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any ST series -- and that says a lot! The casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vessel. ENTERPRISE looks to show us a mostly fun, warm-fuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic, bold, gritty, high-rick exploration of space. I would have selected Adrian Paul to play the Captain and an older human to be the doctor. Still, I liked the actors for the most part.

Step 2: Compare the duties, responsibilities, and required skills of both roles. Step 3: Provide the key differences between the two roles. Sales engineers are professionals who specialize in selling complex products or services, usually in the technology or industrial sectors. They possess strong technical expertise and understanding of the product and its features. This allows them to explain the benefits clearly to customers and help them make informed decisions. Salesmen do not necessarily have in-depth technical knowledge about the products they sell and might focus on promoting the product's highlights or benefits to customers. They rely on communication, negotiation, and persuasion skills. Key differences between the two roles include responsibilities, technical knowledge, and the scope of the products they sell. Question 2: When a car salesman says they got to go talk to their boss about an offer, are they in the back doing that, or is it just a negotiation tactic? Step 1: Understand the context of the question. Step 2: Consider the possible reasons behind the statement. Step 3: Explain whether it is a genuine action or a negotiation tactic. When a car salesman says they need to talk to their boss about an offer, it can be either a genuine action or a negotiation tactic. In some cases, they may consult their manager to get approval for a lower price or special deal to close the sale. However, it can also be a negotiation tactic where the salesman creates a sense of authority for their manager, giving them time to assess the customer's limits and expectations before returning with a counteroffer. Now, I will determine if the two questions have the same meaning. Step 1: Analyze the subject matter of both questions. Step 2: Compare the context and themes in both questions. Step 3: Determine if the questions share a common meaning. The first question focuses on the differences between two professional roles, while the second question relates to a specific scenario involving a car salesman and their negotiation tactics. The two questions do not have the same meaning, as they discuss different subject matters.

As emergency personnel work to reach some victims trapped underground, one rescuer tries to keep the victims calm by telling the story of how he came to have five fathers, all killed during the Great Patriotic War (World War II). The trapped victims are young German students and the rescuers are Russian. In 1942, after the initial attack on Stalingrad, a small group of Russian soldiers take cover in a large five story residential building that happens to provide cover for a Russian crossing point on the Volga river. Five of these soldiers become the five fathers in the story: Polyakov (\\"Angel\\") who had become embittered when his wife and daughter were killed in an air raid; Chvanov, whose hatred of the Germans comes from their cruel treatment and methodical murder of his family; Nikiforov, a talented tenor singer before the war, who had become a cruel and vicious fighter; Sergey, drafted into the war as a spotter; and Captain Gromov, a veteran and hero who leads the group after finding them. The soldiers encounter a young girl named Katya, living alone in the building after her family had been killed. As they spend the next few days together, the soldiers grow fond of her, and she of them. Germans encamped near the crossing are led by Hauptmann Kahn; a highly decorated, but disillusioned soldier who falls in love with a Russian woman named Masha, who resembles his late wife. She at first detests him, but soon begins to reciprocate his love, although they cannot speak each other's language. Oberstleutnant Henze arrives to take command of the Germans. He chides Kahn both for his attraction to Masha, as well as his failure to eradicate the Russian soldiers. Henze decides to set an example by rounding up the Russian civilians living in the bombed out buildings, then burning a woman and her daughter alive. This enrages the Russian soldiers who ambush the Germans, killing several, but losing several of their own men in the process. The Germans...

It has been forever since I went to a restaurant with the intention of getting pho. I came here with a group of friends to celebrate one of them getting a promotion. None of us ordered from the Vietnamese menu. It is probably for the best, because I am unforgiving most of the time.   Instead we got items off of the Chinese menu and did it family style. The eggrolls and crab rangoons are nothing special. I would rather skip the appetizers and just order more entree dishes. The Pepper Beef is generous and comes with a beautiful array of broccoli. Mongolian Beef was tender and had a decent flavor to it, but it lacked the kick. Kung Pao Chicken had me searching out for the hot peppers to make up for the previous dish.

Review the information provided in the initial statement. 2. Analyze the information for any instances of hurricanes hitting the west coast. 3. Draw a conclusion based on the analysis. Step 1: Review the information provided The initial statement provides information about California hurricanes. It states that only two tropical storms have hit California since 1900, one by direct landfall from offshore, and another after making landfall in Mexico. Step 2: Analyze the information for instances of hurricanes hitting the west coast The provided information mentions tropical storms, but it doesn't specifically say they were hurricanes. However, it is important to note that a tropical storm is a less intense version of a hurricane. Therefore, while there have been tropical storms hitting California, they were not necessarily classified as hurricanes. Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis Based on the provided information and analysis, it appears that hurricanes are extremely uncommon on the west coast, particularly in California. While there have been two tropical storms that hit California, it does not specifically mention any fully formed hurricanes.

The loquacious Texas Republican, with a penchant for memorable speeches, criticized President Barack Obama's executive orders on immigration Thursday by adapting an address from the orator Cicero, warning of the demise of the Roman Republic. \\"The words of Cicero, powerfully relevant 2077 years later,\\" the conservative said on the Senate floor. \\"When President Obama do you mean to cease abusing our patience. How long is that madness of yours still to mock us. When is there to be an end to that unbridled audacity of yours, swaggering about as it does now,\\" Cruz intoned. She said the speech, which ran about four minutes, is \\"almost verbatim\\" to how","output":"Cicero delivered it in 63 BC in the Roman Senate, passionately addressing the threat posed by the radical leader Catiline, who he believed was subverting the republic, undermining the rule of law, and ultimately leading to its downfall. Cruz's reference to the ancient orator serves as a stark reminder of the dangers that political leaders face when they attempt to overstep their bounds and undermine the foundations of democracy, as he clearly insinuates President Obama has done with his executive orders. Drawing on the historical significance and impact of Cicero's speech, the Senator from Texas uses it as a powerful tool in underlining the importance of preserving America's democratic values and upholding the Constitution. In a deeply polarized political environment, Cruz's choice of rhetoric might be seen as an attempt to bridge the gap between parties and unite them under a common cause – the protection of the American Republic. Cruz's decision to invoke Cicero can be interpreted in several ways. On one hand, he might be seen as paying homage to the classical roots of American democracy, with an intent to assert the continuity between ancient Rome and contemporary America, both being powerful republics with strong political institutions. On the other hand, the reference to Cicero highlights a prevalent issue in the American political debate: the challenge of balancing executive power and respecting the principle of separation of powers. As the debate on immigration policy continues to divide the Senate, Cruz's speech emphasizes the need for legislators to address the issue carefully and with respect for the constitutional limits placed upon their authority. In this respect, the comparison between Obama's actions and the threats posed by Catiline can be seen as a cautionary tale – a reminder of the dangerous consequences that may result from reckless political decisions. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Cruz's perspective on immigration, it is clear that his use of Cicero's words highlights the ongoing relevance of ancient political wisdom in the contemporary context. While some may criticize Cruz as being overly dramatic in his apparent equating of Obama's actions with the collapse of the Roman Republic, others may see it as a fitting tribute to the ongoing battle for the soul of America and the importance of maintaining a careful balance of power. Regardless of personal opinions, the Senator's speech, steeped in historical resonance and eloquent rhetoric, serves as a poignant reminder of the longstanding American tradition of building upon the rich intellectual legacy of ancient philosophers and statesmen in the pursuit of democratic ideals. It reflects the fragile nature of republics and the dangers of undermining their foundational principles. In sum, Senator Ted Cruz's adaptation of Cicero's address on the Senate floor underscores the enduring power of classical rhetoric in American politics and serves as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of executive overreach. The historical and symbolic weight of the speech, delivered \\"almost verbatim\\" to the original, offers a timely reminder of the significance of preserving the core principles that underpin American democracy – in the face of divisive issues such as immigration policy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The road to late president Hugo Chavez's final resting place in Caracas showed just how impoverished ordinary Venezuelans are, as parade pictures showed some of the most dangerous slums on the planet. While tens of thousands of mourners lined the streets to mourn former President Chavez's passage to the museum where he will be displayed indefinitely, it highlighted how severe problems in Venezuela are for who ever will lead the country next. Mr Chavez, who ruled for 14 years, died of cancer last week. Chavez's legacy: The funeral route of Venezuela's late President Hugo Chavez revealed the horrifying conditions in which many Venezuelans live. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans. gathered along that route today to watch the late president's body. cross the city in another choreographed show designed to keep Chavez. supporters in thrall, at least until an April 14 election scheduled to. replace him. All along the funeral route were. unmistakable signs that this 28 million-person country is not only. unsafe, but that its basic services no longer work. The parade showed bridges in dire need of repair and food shops looking sparse and understocked. Vying for power: Venezuela's acting President Nicolas Maduro drives a military vehicle while his Foreign Minister Elias Jaua (top centre), president of Congress Diosdado Cabello (top left) and other members of his government lead the funeral parade. Crumbling apartment towers and food lines often shared the pavement with cheering crowds eager to greet their departed Comandante. 'More than anything, the government continues fighting with everyone, and does everything badly,' said Francisco Olivero, a 54-year-old carpenter who lives with his wife and five children in the poor neighborhood of Catia, a few streets from the funeral route. Like many Venezuelans, Olivero said wartime-levels of street violence all over the city were his top worry. 'They kill people here every day,' he said. 'I've lost friends, relatives.' Elaborate mourning: Onlookers throw confetti as his body was being transferred from a military academy, where it has been lying in state, to the military museum. As thousands of bused-in police academy cadets gathered along the route, Olivero and his wife Yelitza Acuna were waiting in line to buy flour, coffee, butter and other food staples that they said have been hard to come by for about two years. The shop, which sat along the most trafficked part of the route, drew a crowd of people desperate for a few bags of flour. 'The word spread in the street, and we all came running here,' said Oliver's wife, Yelitza Acuna, a cook's assistant. Economists say government-imposed price controls designed to dampen inflation topping 20 percent have made it impossible for shop owners to sell basic foods at a profit, sparking widespread shortages. Pomp and ceremony: The presidential guard soldiers carry the coffin at the start of a procession in which Venezuelans lined up to bid their last farewell to Hugo Chavez. In the background a portrait of independence hero Simon Bolivar. Officials have accused suppliers of hoarding the goods and have invaded warehouses looking for sugar, flour and other food items in short supply. 'You can't find anything,' said 27-year-old lawyer Anglys Bericote, who rode a bus for four hours from the town of Cajigal to view the funeral cortege. Wearing a heart-shaped 'I am Chavez' badge, she said she was taking the opportunity to also stock up on basic goods. People in her town have even had to go without toothpaste and toilet paper, she said. 'It's all the plan of the private businesses,' she said, repeating the government's line of attack. 'They want to hold onto everything so that it riles up people.' A few blocks from the military museum, Jonathan Rodriguez watched government supporters pass by in red T-shirts bearing Chavez's image. Raw sewage trickled from a broken pipe down the street, and the 37-year-old insurance agent scolded his two sons for playing nearby. Lying in state: Religious and political ceremonies were held at the military museum, attended by Mr Chavez's chosen successor Nicolas Maduro. 'The majority of them don't complain about the problems here,' Rodriguez whispered about the passing Chavez supporters. 'It's as if they didn't exist.' Rodriguez said he doesn't have that luxury. Violent crime is so bad in his part of town that he and his family shut themselves inside their home every night by 6 p.m., only opening the iron gate covering his front door the next morning. Yet for Rodriguez, staying indoors might not be enough to protect him and his family from the war outside. Several weeks ago, a stray bullet penetrated the zinc roof of a neighbor's house. Almost all of Caracas' streets empty of people by dusk as residents with a homicide rate 20 times that of the United States. On Thursday, the U.N. Development Programme issued a study finding Venezuela had the world's fifth highest homicide rate, behind Honduras, El Salvador, the Ivory Coast and Jamaica. Many believe the police are a big part of the problem. Death of a strong leader: Chavez's brothers Adam Chavez, left, and Anibal Chavez, right carried his coffin, while thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the hearse. In an astounding revelation, former Justice Minister Tareck El Aissami said in 2009 that police were responsible for up to 20 per cent of the country's crimes. 'I just stay inside now,' Rodriguez said. 'Outside, it's not safe.' The hills around the military academy are covered with bare-brick slums. More Venezuelans have moved into such slums during Chavez's government, casualties of a housing deficit that the human rights group Provea estimates at 2 million units. Official figures show the number of houses deemed \\"inadequate\\" in the country grew from 295,000 in 1999 to more than 404,000 in 2011. The growth of such neighborhoods has contributed to other problems. Due to crumbling or inexistent infrastructure, sewage all over the city goes mainly to one place: the once-pristine Guaire River, which runs along most of Chavez's funeral route. In 2005, Chavez had famously promised that Venezuelans would one day be able to swim in its waters. Trying to do that today would be nothing less than life-threatening. Military might: Hugo Chavez was keen to show off his army credentials at parades in Caracas. Retired truck driver Miguel Mosquera said he remembered the idyllic scene there decades ago, when the river was a perfect place to spend a sunny day. He lives in the neighborhood of San Antonio, close to the river and within sight of the funeral route. 'The city grew too much,' the 67-year-old said. 'In the 30s and in the 40s, people bathed in this river. ... Here, when it rains, it's chaos, you see that the river sometimes spills over when it rains.' Jose Leal, who had stopped by a bakery near the route, said he had given up on any change under the current government, led by Chavez's hand-picked successor Nicolas Maduro. 'It isn't easy, brother,' Leal said as Chavez supporters headed to the river to watch the cortege pass. 'It's worrying. It creates stress, stress in the family, stress at work.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The funeral procession route of late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in 2013 revealed the impoverished and dangerous living conditions faced by many Venezuelans. The country's economic decline has led to a scarcity of basic goods, forcing people to queue for hours to buy necessities like flour, coffee, and butter. Government-imposed price controls aimed at curbing its soaring inflation rate have made it challenging for businesses to sell essential goods at a profit, resulting in widespread shortages. Furthermore, violent crime rates in the country have skyrocketed, with a homicide rate twenty times higher than the United States. The UN Development Programme reported in 2013 that Venezuela had the fifth-highest homicide rate globally, while crumbling infrastructure, insufficient sewage systems, and inadequate housing have exacerbated living conditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Harris' book avoided theological and biographical entries; instead it concentrated on science and technology. Published in 1704, the Lexicon technicum was the first book to be written in English that took a methodical approach to describing mathematics and commercial arithmetic along with the physical sciences and navigation. Other technical dictionaries followed Harris' model, including Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia (1728), which included five editions, and was a substantially larger work than Harris'.

Given the two facts above, what can feed at more than one trophic level? A:","output":"Given the two statements, we can understand that both consumers and plants have the potential to feed at more than one trophic level. It's important to understand the concepts of trophic levels and the roles of organisms in an ecosystem to provide a detailed analysis. Trophic levels refer to the position an organism occupies in a food chain or a food web. In an ecosystem, there are mainly four trophic levels: 1. Producers (or autotrophs) 2. Primary consumers (or herbivores) 3. Secondary consumers (or carnivores) 4. Tertiary consumers (or top carnivores) Now, let's discuss the given facts and their implications in detail: Fact 1: Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level.  This fact suggests that certain consumers in an ecosystem have diverse feeding habits or preferences. Such organisms are usually omnivores. Omnivores, like humans, bears, and some birds, can consume both plant and animal matter. They play a vital role in controlling the populations of both primary consumers (herbivores) and secondary consumers (carnivores) and contributing to nutrient cycling and energy flow in an ecosystem.  Fact 2: Plants are producers, and consumers are omnivores. This statement needs a slight correction to make it more coherent. Plants are indeed producers, as they use photosynthesis to produce their own food from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. On the other hand, consumers can be classified as herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores. Herbivores consume plant matter, carnivores feed on other animals, and omnivores consume both plants and animals. Given these facts, the answer to the question \\"what can feed at more than one trophic level?\\" can be elaborated as follows: 1. Omnivorous consumers: As they eat both plants and animals, omnivores feed at more than one trophic level. They often occupy the second and third trophic levels as primary and secondary (or even tertiary) consumers, depending on their feeding habits. Examples of omnivores include humans, pigs, and certain species of fish and birds. 2. Detritivores and decomposers: A special mention should be made to detritivores and decomposers like earthworms, fungi, and bacteria. Although they do not necessarily fit into the conventional trophic levels, these organisms feed on dead plants and animals, breaking them down and returning nutrients to the ecosystem. This process of nutrient recycling blurs the lines between trophic levels, as these decomposers can feed on the remains of organisms from multiple trophic levels. In summary, organisms that can feed at more than one trophic level mainly include omnivores, as well as detritivores and decomposers. Their ability to consume a wide range of food sources offers them a flexible and adaptive advantage, which helps maintain balance and stability in the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is about 9 trillion kilometres or 6 trillion miles. As defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a light-year is the distance that light travels in vacuum in one Julian year (365.25 days). Because it includes the word \\"year\\", the term light-year is sometimes misinterpreted as a unit of time.  - Amazing Stories is an American science fiction magazine launched in April 1926 by Hugo Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing. It was the first magazine devoted solely to science fiction. Science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but \\"Amazing\\" helped define and launch a new genre of pulp fiction.  - A planetary system is a set of gravitationally bound non-stellar objects in orbit around a star or star system. Generally speaking, systems with one or more planets constitute a planetary system, although such systems may also consist of bodies such as dwarf planets, asteroids, natural satellites, meteoroids, comets, planetesimals and circumstellar disks. The Sun together with its planetary system, which includes Earth, is known as the Solar System. The term exoplanetary system is sometimes used in reference to other planetary systems.  - The Skylark of Space by Edward E. \`\` Doc '' Smith was written between 1915 and 1921 while Smith was working on his doctorate . Though the original idea for the novel was Smith 's , he co-wrote the first part of the novel with Lee Hawkins Garby , the wife of his college classmate and later neighbor Carl Garby . The Skylark of Space is considered to be one of the earliest novels of interstellar travel and the first example of space opera . Originally serialized in 1928 in the magazine Amazing Stories , it was first published in book form in 1946 by the Buffalo Book Co.  - Lee Hawkins Garby (18921953) was the co-author with Edward Elmer Smith of the 1928 serial novel \\"The Skylark of Space\\", the first science fiction story in which humans left the solar system. She was the wife of Dr. Carl DeWitt Garby, a friend of Dr. Smith's from college at the University of Idaho.  - Hugo Gernsback (August 16, 1884  August 19, 1967), born Hugo Gernsbacher, was a Luxembourgish-American inventor, writer, editor, and magazine publisher, best known for publications including the first science fiction magazine. His contributions to the genre as publisher were so significant that, along with the novelists H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, he is sometimes called \\"The Father of Science Fiction\\". In his honour, annual awards presented at the World Science Fiction Convention are named the \\"Hugos\\".  - Experimenter Publishing was an American media company founded by Hugo Gernsback in 1915. The first magazine was \\"The Electrical Experimenter\\" (19131931) and the most notable magazines were \\"Radio News\\" (19191985) and \\"Amazing Stories\\" (19262005). Their radio station, WRNY, began broadcasting experimental television in 1928. In early 1929 the company was forced into bankruptcy and the Gernsback brothers lost control of Experimenter Publishing. The magazines did not miss an issue and were quickly sold to another publisher. The Gernsbacks promptly started new magazines to compete with their former ones.  - Interstellar travel is the term used for hypothetical piloted or unpiloted travel between stars or planetary systems. Interstellar travel will be much more difficult than interplanetary spaceflight; the distances between the planets in the Solar System are less than 30 astronomical units (AU)whereas the distances between stars are typically hundreds of thousands of AU, and usually expressed in light-years. Because of the vastness of those distances, interstellar travel would require a high percentage of the speed of light, huge travel time, lasting from decades to millennia or longer, or a combination of both.

One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set.

He also refused to sell Wadiya's oil fields, a promise he made to his father on his deathbed. After the United Nations Security Council resolves to intervene militarily, Aladeen travels to the UN Headquarters in New York to address the council. Shortly after arriving, Aladeen is kidnapped by Clayton (John C. Reilly), a hitman hired by his treacherous uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley), whom Aladeen's father passed over as successor in favor of his son. Tamir then replaces Aladeen with a dimwitted political decoy named Efawadh (Baron Cohen), whom he intends to manipulate into signing a document nominally democratizing Wadiya while opening the country's oil fields to Chinese and other foreign vested interests. Aladeen escapes after Clayton accidentally kills himself in a botched torture attempt; when his corpse is discovered Tamir thinks Aladeen has been killed.

The charismatic leader made his way onto the MS Berlin cruise ship, his eyes scanning the crowd, finally landing on Marita Lorenz. Little did she know that this serendipitous encounter would change her life forever, leading her down a path filled with love, intrigue, and danger. The connection between Lorenz and Castro was immediate and intense. As they spent more and more time together, Lorenz found herself drawn into Castro's world, a world that was vastly different from her life in New York City. Before long, the affair between the two blossomed, and Lorenz found herself living in Havana, swept up in the excitement of the Cuban Revolution and the man at its center. Despite the passion of their relationship, Lorenz's position as Castro's mistress placed her squarely on the CIA's radar. The United States government, alarmed by the growing influence of communism in the Western Hemisphere, was determined to undermine Castro's regime. They sought to exploit the unwitting Lorenz and her proximity to Castro to achieve this goal. In 1960, the CIA approached Lorenz with a shocking proposition: to assassinate Fidel Castro using poison pills concealed in her face cream. The young woman found herself trapped between love for Castro and pressure from the CIA, torn between loyalty to the man who had captured her heart and allegiance to her home country. As Lorenz stood at the crossroads of history, she faced the most difficult decision of her life, one that could alter the course of the Cuban Revolution and her own destiny. In that moment, the fateful meeting between Marita Lorenz and Fidel Castro aboard the MS Berlin in Havana harbor took on even greater significance, setting in motion a chain of events that would forever change their lives, their nations, and the world itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a breakdown of their differences: 1. In the first sentence, the meaning is: - Publisher: Kids Can Press - Printing Company: Everbest - Location: Hong Kong - Year: 1985 The first sentence tells us that the book was published by Kids Can Press in 1985 while the printing process was carried out by Everbest in Hong Kong. This sentence emphasizes that Kids Can Press is responsible for the publication and copyright acquisition for the book, which consists of functions like deciding on the content, working with the author(s), editing, and designing the cover. Everbest, on the other hand, is responsible for the actual production—physically printing and binding the book. 2. In the second sentence, the meaning is: - Publisher: Everbest - Printing Company: Kids Can Press - Location: Hong Kong - Year: 1985 The second sentence reverses the roles of the two companies: it states that Kids Can Press printed the book in 1985, while Everbest published it in Hong Kong. In this case, Everbest is responsible for the publication tasks, whereas Kids Can Press is responsible for the book's physical production. In summary, the two sentences are not synonymous because they convey different information regarding the roles of the companies involved in the process.

After a scoreless first quarter, the Titans got the second quarter lead as kicker Rob Bironas got a 42-yard field goal, along with quarterback Kerry Collins completing a 34-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Justin Gage. The Steelers would respond with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completing a 31-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Santonio Holmes. In the third quarter, Pittsburgh took the lead as Roethlisberger completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Hines Ward, yet Tennessee struck back with rookie running back Chris Johnson getting a 21-yard touchdown run. The Titans would then pull away in the fourth quarter with running back LenDale White's 1-yard touchdown run and safety Michael Griffin's 83-yard interception return for a touchdown. This was the first game of the year where the league-leading Steelers defense allowed more than 300 yards of total offense (allowing 332 yards).

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Pitchford was born in Honolulu, where he attended Catholic schools, graduating in 1968 from Saint Louis High School. He began his performance career as an actor and a singer with the Honolulu Community Theatre (now Diamond Head Theatre), the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra and the Honolulu Theatre for Youth, among others. While studying at Yale University, Pitchford performed with numerous campus drama groups, but his focus gradually turned off-campus, where he worked with the Wooster Square Revival, an experimental theatre company that offered acting opportunities to recovering addicts and alcoholics. In 1969, Pitchford returned to Honolulu as an assistant to authors Faye Hammel and Sylvan Levey in updating the popular guidebook Hawai'i on 5 and 10 A Day, and researching Trans World Airlines' Budget Guide to Hawai'i, the first of a series of guidebooks that would eventually turn into the popular series TWA Getaway Guides. Inspired by a 1979 news story about Elmore City, Oklahoma, a town which had finally lifted an 80-year-old ban on dancing, Pitchford wrote the screenplay for the motion picture Footloose (1984). He collaborated on the nine-song score with Kenny Loggins, Eric Carmen, Jim Steinman, Sammy Hagar and others. The film, directed by Herbert Ross, opened at #1 and was, at the time, the highest-grossing February release in film history.  When the soundtrack album hit #1 on the Billboard album charts, it deposed Michael Jackson's Thriller and held that position for 10 weeks. It went on top charts all over the world, eventually selling more than 17 million albums. Kenny Loggins's single of the title song hit #1 on March 31, 1984, and stayed there for three weeks. Five weeks later (May 26, 1984) Deniece Williams's \\"Let's Hear It for the Boy\\" went to #1, as well. Four more songs from the soundtrack charted in the Top 40; \\"Almost Paradise,\\" which reached #7, was co-written with Eric Carmen, and was performed by Mike Reno of Loverboy and Ann Wilson of Heart; \\"Dancing in the Sheets,\\" which reached #17, was co-written with Bill Wolfer, and was performed by Shalamar; \\"I'm Free (Heaven Helps the Man),\\" which reached #22 and, like the film's title track, was co-written with, and performed by, Kenny Loggins; and \\"Holding Out for a Hero,\\" which reached #34, was co-written with Jim Steinman, and was performed by Bonnie Tyler. \\"Footloose\\" was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Song; and \\"Footloose\\" and \\"Let's Hear It for the Boy\\" (co-written with Tom Snow) both received Academy Awards nominations (1985). Pitchford received two Grammy nominations: Best Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, and Best R&B Song \\"Dancing in the Sheets.\\"  Paramount Pictures's remake of Footloose, which was again based on Pitchford's original screenplay and featured six of his songs, was released in October 2011. Blake Shelton had a hit with his re-recording of the title song.  Next Pitchford wrote the screenplay of, and collaborated on the authorship and composition of all the songs for, the 1989 musical film Sing. whose soundtrack did Footloose overthrow?","output":"When the soundtrack album for Footloose hit #1 on the Billboard album charts, it deposed Michael Jackson's Thriller."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Quinn was the pastor at their church, so Quinn gave glory to god.  Given the context: Why did Quinn do this?  Possible answers: be blasphemous, give a sermon, praise the lord The answer is:","output":"Quinn did this to praise the Lord. As the pastor at their church, Quinn plays a significant role in guiding the congregation and fostering a sense of community among its members. This is done primarily through the sharing of religious teachings, values, and beliefs, which revolve around giving glory to God. By offering praises and acknowledging the greatness of the Lord, a pastor aims to inspire the congregation to strengthen their faith and live according to the principles of their religion. In Christianity, giving glory to God is considered an act of worship and gratitude, acknowledging His sovereignty, grace, and power over all aspects of life. This act is performed not just by pastors, but also by the entire Christian community. However, as a spiritual leader, Quinn has a special duty and influence in helping others deepen their faith and establish a relationship with God. The other possible answers provided, \\"be blasphemous\\" and \\"give a sermon,\\" are not accurate in this context. To be blasphemous would mean to show a lack of reverence for God or sacred things, which contradicts the role and intention of a pastor like Quinn. While it is true that giving a sermon is an essential part of a pastor's duties, it does not answer the question of why Quinn gave glory to God specifically. A sermon can have various topics and purposes, not exclusively devoted to praising God. However, offering praise to the Lord is an integral aspect of Christian worship that reflects one's devotion and faith in God's goodness and mercy. In summary, the main reason why Quinn, being the pastor at their church, gave glory to God is to praise the Lord. This act of worship allows the congregation to connect with their spirituality and the core beliefs of their faith, while also strengthening their bond as a community. By fulfilling this role, Quinn serves as a guide and support system for others in their spiritual journey, encouraging the congregation to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose abdication was demanded? , can you please find it?   At the time of the transfer of power, the state of Jammu and Kashmir (widely called \\"Kashmir\\") was ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh, a Hindu, although the state itself had a Muslim majority. Hari Singh was equally hesitant about acceding to either India or Pakistan, as either would have provoked adverse reactions in parts of his kingdom. He signed a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan and proposed one with India as well, but announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent. However, his rule was opposed by Sheikh Abdullah, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the National Conference, who demanded his abdication.Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared that it would have to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and the valley itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense fighting flagged with the onset of winter, which made much of the state impassable. Prime Minister Nehru, recognising the degree of international attention brought to bear on the dispute, declared a ceasefire and sought UN arbitration, arguing that India would otherwise have to invade Pakistan itself, in view of its failure to stop the tribal incursions.

He puts a bottle in the freezer but leaves it in too long so it freezes. Being impatient he then takes the bottle and runs it under soe hot water for a few minutes.  But I can use this background: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds.  What is an answer for this question: Will the energy of the water molecules in the bottle increase or decrease when Andrew runs hot water on the bottle? A:","output":"The energy of the water molecules in the bottle will increase when Andrew runs hot water on the bottle. This is because the hot water adds energy to the frozen water in the bottle, causing the molecules to gain energy and break the hydrogen bonds. This leads to a change of state from solid to liquid as the ice melts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which of these two canals was built first: Junction Canal or Duluth Ship Canal? Answer:","output":"After conducting extensive research, it is determined that among the two canals you mentioned – the Junction Canal and the Duluth Ship Canal – the first canal to be built was the Junction Canal. The Junction Canal, whose construction began around the early 1800s, predates the establishment of the Duluth Ship Canal. Initially, construction on the Junction Canal began in order to improve transportation, trade, and communication networks in the area. By connecting waterways of entire regions, building these canals created valuable and efficient navigational paths for transporting resources throughout the country. On the other hand, the Duluth Ship Canal was built much later in the 19th century, beginning in 1870 and completed in 1871. It was mainly constructed to ease water transportation in and out of Duluth, Minnesota. Located at the very western end of Lake Superior, the Duluth Ship Canal allows ships to access the adjacent natural harbor, which eventually spurred rapid growth in the local economy, trade, and commerce. The construction of the Duluth Ship Canal was spearheaded by some of Duluth's prominent citizens when they were denied funds by the federal government for dredging the St. Louis River. The canal was initially a narrow passage measuring just 30 feet wide and six feet deep. However, it was eventually funded and maintained by the federal government, who acknowledged its strategic importance. Over the years, the canal has been widened and deepened to accommodate the ever-increasing ship sizes and traffic. Today, the Duluth Ship Canal features the Aerial Lift Bridge, an iconic symbol of the city, built in 1905. In summary, the Junction Canal was built before the Duluth Ship Canal, and it played a crucial role in improving transportation and trade networks in the early nineteenth century. On the other hand, the Duluth Ship Canal had a significant impact in shaping the city of Duluth, Minnesota, and promoting commerce and economic growth in the area. Both canals hold historical significance for their respective regions and have contributed to the development of the United States' broader transportation and trade sectors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity.

Write an article based on this \\"The Decision Review System (DRS) could be introduced in Twenty20 internationals under new proposals from the International Cricket Council.\\"","output":"Title: \\"Revolutionizing Twenty20 Cricket: The Potential Introduction of the Decision Review System\\" Introduction The landscape of international cricket is set to witness a potentially significant change with the International Cricket Council (ICC) considering the introduction of the Decision Review System (DRS) in Twenty20 internationals. The DRS, hitherto reserved for Test cricket and One-Day Internationals (ODIs), aims to correct errors in on-field umpiring decisions by allowing teams to challenge specific rulings. With the infusion of technology improving the overall quality and fairness of the sport, the potential inclusion of the DRS in Twenty20 internationals stands to revolutionize the shortest format of the game. Background of the Decision Review System (DRS) The DRS was introduced in 2008 to minimize errors in on-field umpiring decisions by using advanced technology. By incorporating tools such as ball-tracking technology, infra-red imaging, audio sensors, and ultra-motion video analysis (among others), the DRS plays a critical role in ensuring a level playing field. Each team involved in a match is permitted a limited number of reviews, subject to successful challenges. The system is designed to aid umpires in adjudicating controversial or difficult decisions accurately, reducing the influence of human error in determining the outcome of matches. Benefits of introducing DRS in Twenty20 internationals 1. Improved Accuracy and Fairness: With the introduction of the DRS in Twenty20 internationals, the chances of incorrect decisions impacting the outcome of matches would be significantly reduced. This can increase the level of fairness in these high-stakes games, which often hinge on key moments or close decisions. 2. Enhanced Fan Experience: With the dramatic and high-tempo nature of Twenty20 internationals already appealing to cricket enthusiasts, the addition of the DRS could further enhance the viewing experience. The use of technology to scrutinize umpiring decisions often adds a layer of suspense and intrigue, making it more engaging for spectators both at the stadium and watching on television. 3. Increased Credibility: The DRS has been credited with improving overall confidence in the adjudication process and reducing the influence of human error. By introducing the DRS in Twenty20 internationals, the ICC sends a strong message about ensuring the highest level of accuracy and professionalism in the sport, emphasizing the importance of fairness and credibility. Potential Challenges in Implementing the DRS in Twenty20 Internationals While there are apparent benefits to introducing the DRS to Twenty20 cricket, there are potential challenges that must be taken into consideration. 1. Financial Implications: Using advanced technology to facilitate the DRS can be an expensive proposition. While wealthier cricket boards have readily adopted the DRS in Test and ODI cricket, the financial burden of implementing this system for Twenty20 internationals could be prohibitive for some host nations. 2. Time Constraints: Introducing the DRS in Twenty20 internationals may result in a slight extension of match duration. Given that the main attraction of T20 cricket is its fast-paced, time-efficient nature, any delay in reviewing decisions could potentially hinder the flow of the game. Conclusion The potential introduction of the Decision Review System (DRS) in Twenty20 internationals is a move that can bring a new dimension to the shortest format of cricket, bolstering the reputation of the sport while ensuring a more accurate and fair adjudication process for all participating teams. While challenges like financial constraints and time management need to be addressed, the possibility of engendering a more equitable and engaging experience for fans, players, and administrators alike makes the proposal an exciting prospect for the future of cricket."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: It’s October, which means it’s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time! Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

The SIS II is composed of a central system Central SIS II a Please fix the punctuation.","output":"The Schengen Information System II (SIS II) is composed of a central system, known as Central SIS II, and multiple national systems that connect to it.  SIS II is a sophisticated and secure database that serves as a vital tool for cross-border cooperation among the Schengen member countries. Primarily, it is designed for managing and sharing information related to border security, law enforcement, and visa administration. The Central SIS II, which is the heart of the system, processes, stores, and disseminates information to national systems that are comprised of terminals, workstations, and servers in each member country's competent authorities. Examples of these authorities include border control agencies, police stations, customs offices, and consular posts abroad. Data exchange in SIS II occurs in real-time, enabling prompt action to be taken by the authorities when a match is found between the inserted data and an existing record. To ensure a high level of security, advanced cryptographic techniques are used in the communication between the central system and the national systems. The information stored in SIS II includes categories such as alerts on persons, vehicles, stolen property, and documents. These alerts can be related to criminal investigations, monitoring of suspicious individuals, or missing persons. Additionally, data concerning entry bans, extradition requests, and visa applications are included in the database. The legal framework for the functioning of SIS II comprises of multiple legislative instruments: 1. The Schengen Convention - It sets the foundation for cooperation on border control and law enforcement among its signatory countries. 2. Council Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 - This regulation establishes the operational features of SIS II while focusing on the exchange of data for monitoring the external borders and coordinating the issuance of short-stay visas. 3. Council Decision 2007/533/JHA - This decision pertains to the law enforcement aspects of SIS II, such as police and judicial cooperation. In summary, the Schengen Information System II, with its central system (Central SIS II) and national systems, is a crucial mechanism for enhancing security, managing migration, and facilitating the free movement of individuals within the Schengen Area. Its advanced capabilities allow for seamless real-time communication and information sharing among member countries, thereby strengthening the overall protection of the area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact: a bicycle contains screws Question: Two wheeled conveyances are held together by What's the answer?","output":"The answer is that two-wheeled conveyances, such as bicycles, are held together by a combination of screws, bolts, and other mechanical fasteners. In detail, bicycles consist of different parts and components that are assembled and connected to create a functional and efficient mode of transportation. These components include the frame, wheels, tires, suspension, gears, brakes, and handlebars, among others. To ensure a strong and reliable bond between these parts, manufacturers make use of various types of screws and bolts, as well as other mechanical fasteners like nuts, washers, and clips. Screws and bolts are primarily used to hold the various components securely in place and to adjust or fine-tune their functioning. For example, screws are used to attach the various parts of the bicycle's frame, like the head tube, top tube, down tube, seat tube, chainstays and seatstays. They also play a crucial role in attaching components like the derailleur, brake calipers, chainring, and pedals to the frame. Different types of screws and bolts are used, depending on the size, material, and function of the particular component to which they are attached. Some common types of screws and bolts on a bicycle include hex bolts, Allen bolts or screws, socket-head screws, flat-head screws, and Phillips head screws. These screws and bolts are typically made from steel, aluminum, or titanium, which provides the necessary strength and durability while still being lightweight. Apart from screws and bolts, other mechanical fasteners, such as nuts, washers, and clips, also play a vital role in maintaining the integrity and performance of a bicycle. Nuts and washers are used with bolts to distribute pressure evenly when tightened, preventing damage to surfaces and improving the fastener's overall performance. Clips, on the other hand, can be used for attaching or securing cables or hoses related to the braking and shifting systems of a bicycle. In summary, two-wheeled conveyances, like bicycles, are held together through the strategic use of screws, bolts, and other mechanical fasteners. These fasteners provide the necessary structural integrity, ensure the smooth functioning of various components, and enable the efficient operation of the vehicle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I consider both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what Dan Reed could come up with but unfortunately it just didn't work for me. The problem lies in the fact that the film doesn't really seem to understand which genre it's falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama, horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well it's a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none. The premise (as with most revenge films) is simple, couple meet and go out, something bad happens and they get their revenge it's a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years. Unfotunately in this case it's as if Dan Reed thought, \\"It'd be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail....\\" Wrong! There are also a few key elements missing, in this type of movie there's generally some kind of warning. A don't do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but there's nothing of the sort here. It just simply happens, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting happens and then it ends. There's a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to Dan Reed for trying, I have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing...

Premise: \\"and um then you put it on a flour like you know you make your meat real um thin you know bite size pieces\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"It's easier to chew the meat when it's cut this way.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"and um then you put it on a flour like you know you make your meat real um thin, you know bite size pieces\\" is true, then it suggests that the person speaking has a preference for preparing meat in this specific way. The speaker has mentioned the process of making the meat thin and cutting it into bite-sized portions, which can be analyzed in relation to the hypothesis \\"It's easier to chew the meat when it's cut this way.\\" First, let's consider the fact that the speaker is using the term \\"thin\\" to describe the meat. When meat is prepared in a thin manner, it generally refers to the process of pounding or slicing it to reduce its thickness. This can be accomplished through various methods, such as using a meat tenderizer or a sharp knife, which results in a more delicate texture. Furthermore, thinner meat requires less force to chew and takes less time to break down in one's mouth. Moreover, when it comes to digestion, smaller particles of food are easier for the digestive system to process compared to larger chunks. Second, the reference to \\"bite-size pieces\\" suggests that the person speaking finds this method of cutting meat more convenient for consumption. By cutting the meat into smaller, more manageable portions, it potentially reduces the need for additional cutting during the meal and makes it easier for the person eating to enjoy their food without any hassle. Bite-sized pieces are more comfortable to handle, especially when using utensils such as forks or chopsticks. Now, let's examine the hypothesis, \\"It's easier to chew the meat when it's cut this way.\\" Based on the premise provided, it can be inferred that the preparation process for the mentioned meat (i.e., cutting it thin and into bite-size pieces) results in a more tender and manageable texture. The use of the term \\"easier\\" denotes that there is a comparison being made between different methods or ways of preparing and cutting meat. Since thin, bite-sized pieces require less force to chew and are more comfortable to handle, it is reasonable to assume that this method promotes enhanced ease in consumption, particularly when chewing. In conclusion, the premise provided by the person speaking does seem to entail the hypothesis that cutting meat into thin, bite-sized pieces makes it easier to chew. The preparation process results in tender and manageable portions, which can be more enjoyable and convenient for the person consuming the meat. Hence, it can be reasonably asserted that the premise supports the hypothesis, indicating that cutting meat this way indeed makes it easier to chew."},{"instruction":"Given the question: It was a Saturday in May.

Given the question: Information:  - A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2015, 294 million domain names had been registered.  - The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is a department of ICANN, a nonprofit private American corporation that oversees global IP address allocation, autonomous system number allocation, root zone management in the Domain Name System (DNS), media types, and other Internet Protocol-related symbols and Internet numbers.  - The DNS root zone is the top-level DNS zone in the hierarchical namespace of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet.  - The European Commission (EC) is an institution of the European Union, responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU. Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate.  - Cybersquatting (also known as domain squatting), according to the United States federal law known as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, is registering, trafficking in, or using an Internet domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price.  - The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet, and has been in use since the 1980s.  - EURid vzw / asbl ( European Registry for Internet Domains ) is a non-profit organisation appointed by the European Commission on 8 April 2003 as the domain name registry to operate the new . eu top - level domain . EURid is a consortium of three European ccTLD operators : DNS Belgium ( . be ) , IIT - CNR ( . it ) and NIC - SE ( . se ) . It has been established in Belgium , having its headquarters in Brussels . In October 2006 , they opened their first branch office in Stockholm . Two further branch offices have been opened in Italy and the Czech Republic . There are four associate members : the Academic and Research Network of Slovenia ( ARNES ) , the registry for . si , the national top - level domain for Slovenia , CZ.NIC , the registry for . cz , the national top - level domain for the Czech Republic , ISOC - ECC , the European chapter of the Internet Society , and BUSINESSEUROPE , a confederation of 39 industry - related federations from 33 countries . EURid uses the Extensible Provisioning Protocol ( EPP ) which enables registrars to perform operations on . eu domain names directly . The web site is available in all the official languages of the European Union : Bulgarian , Croatian , Danish , German , Czech , Estonian , English , Spanish , French , Italian , Latvian , Lithuanian , Hungarian , Dutch , Polish , Portuguese , Romanian , Slovak , Finnish , Swedish , Greek , Maltese , Irish and Slovenian .  - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.  - The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet.  - A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred to as an \\"absolute domain name\\", is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all domain levels, including the top-level domain and the root zone. A fully qualified domain name is distinguished by its lack of ambiguity: it can be interpreted only in one way.  - The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a nonprofit organization that is responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation. ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the central Internet address pools and DNS root zone registries pursuant to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function contract. The contract regarding the IANA stewardship functions between ICANN and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States Department of Commerce ended on October 1, 2016, formally transitioning the functions to the global multi-stakeholder community.  - A country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is an Internet top-level domain generally used or reserved for a country, sovereign state, or dependent territory identified with a country code.  - .eu is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the European Union (EU). Launched on 7 December 2005, the domain is available for organisations in and residents of EU member states. The TLD is administered by EURid, a consortium originally consisting of the national ccTLD registry operators of Belgium, Sweden, and Italy, joined later by the national registry operator of the Czech Republic. Trademark owners were able to submit registrations through a sunrise period, in an effort to prevent cybersquatting. Full registration started on 7 April 2006.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet. The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name, that is, the last label of a fully qualified domain name. For example, in the domain name www.example.com, the top-level domain is com. Responsibility for management of most top-level domains is delegated to specific organizations by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and is in charge of maintaining the DNS root zone.  - A domain name registry is a database of all domain names and the associated registrant information in the top level domains of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet that allow third party entities to request administrative control of a domain name. Most registries operate on the top-level and second-level of the DNS.  - The European Court of Justice (ECJ), officially just the Court of Justice, is the highest court in the European Union in matters of European Union law. As a part of the Court of Justice of the European Union it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its equal application across all EU member states. The Court was established in 1952 and is based in Luxembourg. It is composed of one judge per member state  currently 28  although it normally hears cases in panels of three, five or 15 judges.

Choices:  1). No;  2). Yes; Answer:","output":"2). Yes; A PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) port is used for connecting and communicating with various peripheral devices and components within a computer system. The statement \\"Typical PCI cards used in PCs include: network cards, sound cards, modems, extra ports such as USB or serial, TV tuner cards, and disk controllers\\" is indeed a reasonable answer to describe a PCI port's primary function. To provide a more detailed and long answer: A PCI port is a type of hardware interface, designed by Intel, which allows the motherboard to connect and communicate with peripheral devices and components, thereby enhancing the computer system's overall capabilities and performance. The PCI port is often found on the motherboard of most desktop and server computers, enabling the attachment of various peripheral cards known as expansion cards. These cards expand the functionality of a computer system by adding features or capabilities that are not provided by the motherboard. Each PCI port consists of a series of parallel data lines that transmit data between the expansion cards and the operating system (OS) for processing and integration. This enables the OS to manage multiple devices simultaneously and more efficiently, compared to earlier connection methods. Some of the typical PCI cards used in PCs are: 1. Network Cards: Also known as Ethernet cards or network interface cards (NICs), these allow a computer to connect to other computers or devices in a network, either via wired or wireless connections. 2. Sound Cards: These enable a computer to produce and process sound, input audio from external sources, and output audio to speakers, headphones, or other output devices. 3. Modems: Modem cards enable a computer to connect to the internet or transmit data over phone lines, cable lines, or other types of communication lines. 4. Extra Ports: Some PCI cards can provide additional USB or serial ports, enabling a computer to support more peripheral devices or facilitate quicker data transfer between devices. 5. TV Tuner Cards: These cards allow a computer to receive television broadcasts, enabling the user to watch TV shows, record live television, and schedule recordings. 6. Disk Controllers: Disk controller cards enhance data transfer rates, provide support for more advanced storage devices, and increase the number of drives that a computer can support. Thus, a PCI port plays a vital role in expanding a computer system's capabilities and customizability, giving users the freedom to tailor their systems to their unique needs and requirements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the article and select the best answer. Article: People have smoked cigarettes for a long time now. The tobacco which is used to make cigarettes was first grown in what is now part of the United States. Christopher Columbus, who discovered America, saw the Indians smoking. Soon the dried leaves were transported to Europe. In the late 1800s, the Turks made cigarettes popular. Cigarette smoke contains at least two harmful substances, tar and nicotine. Tar, which forms as the tobacco burns, damages the lungs and therefore affects breathing. Nicotine, which is found in the leaves, causes the heart to beat faster and increases the breathing rate. Nicotine in large can kill a person by stopping a person's breathing muscles. Smokers usually take in small amounts that the body can quickly break down. Nicotine can make new smokers feel dizzy  or sick to their stomachs. The heart rate for young smokers increases 2 to 3 beats per minute. Nicotine also lowers skin temperature and reduces blood flow in the legs and feet. It plays an important role in increasing smokers' risk of heart disease and stroke. Smoking cigarettes is dangerous. Cigarette smoking was the cause of lung cancer and several other deadly diseases. Question: What's the main idea of this passage? Options: A: Where did cigarettes come from?

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: As more and more books become movie adaptations  , I can't help but think how this will affect English classes in America. Thinking back to my years in middle and high school -- ten years ago, I would be rewarded if I had read a number of classics. Today, a majority of those books are now also movies Life of Pi, The Great Gatsby, Much Ado About Nothing and Anna Karenina, to name a few. Even modern books such as The Hunger Games and Harry Potter have been adapted for the big screen. In discussion with my students, I often hear them say they are not going to read books because movies will come out soon, which makes me wonder what effect movie adaptations have on modern-day students. Will the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) encourage them to read books more carefully or to use movies to improve their understanding of the text? The CCSS requires students to provide text-based evidence when reading and discussing a book. By focusing on such evidence, teachers can pull specific details from a book that may have not made the final cut when the book was adapted for the big screen. For instance, after reading and watching The Hunger Games, there were a number of details from the book that were missing from the film -- many people were disappointed with Rue's meek   movie role. A student who failed to read The Hunger Games would not quite understand Rue's impact on the games in the same way as someone who had read the book and remembered all the details that went into her death. I am not saying the CCSS will stop students from cutting corners, but I believe if teachers use the support the CCSS provides, it can be a great roadway to ensure all students are digging deep into texts and not just hitting the play button.

First, we need to find the sum of the numbers from 1 to 99. The sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers is given by the formula: [ S = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] For ( n = 99 ): [ S = frac{99 cdot 100}{2} = 4950 ] 2. Let the unknown number be ( x ). The average of the numbers ( 1, 2, 3, ldots, 99, x ) is given to be ( 100x ). The total number of terms is ( 100 ) (99 numbers plus ( x )). 3. The average of these 100 numbers can be expressed as: [ text{Average} = frac{text{Sum of all numbers}}{text{Number of terms}} ] Therefore: [ 100x = frac{4950 + x}{100} ] 4. To solve for ( x ), we multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to clear the fraction: [ 100 cdot 100x = 4950 + x ] [ 10000x = 4950 + x ] 5. Next, we isolate ( x ) by subtracting ( x ) from both sides: [ 10000x - x = 4950 ] [ 9999x = 4950 ] 6. Finally, we solve for ( x ) by dividing both sides by 9999: [ x = frac{4950}{9999} ] 7. Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 50: [ x = frac{4950 div 50}{9999 div 50} = frac{99}{199.98} approx frac{50}{101} ] Thus, the value of ( x ) is: [ x = frac{50}{101} ] The final answer is (boxed{frac{50}{101}})"},{"instruction":"Which of the following statements is incorrect?

This statement is correct because symmetry about a line implies that every point on one triangle has a corresponding point on the other triangle at the same distance from the line of symmetry but in the opposite direction. This means the two triangles have the same size and shape, thus they are congruent. - **Statement B**: Angles are symmetric figures. This statement is correct because an angle can be bisected by a line (the angle bisector), and each side of the bisector is a mirror image of the other. Therefore, angles inherently possess symmetry about their bisectors. - **Statement C**: An equilateral triangle has 3 axes of symmetry. This statement is correct because each axis of symmetry is an angle bisector that also bisects the opposite side, dividing the equilateral triangle into two congruent right triangles. Since an equilateral triangle has three angles, it naturally has three axes of symmetry corresponding to the bisectors of its angles. - **Statement D**: In an isosceles triangle, the altitude, median on one side, and angle bisector of the angle opposite that side coincide. This statement is incorrect because, although in an isosceles triangle the altitude, median, and angle bisector from the vertex angle to the base do coincide (due to the properties of isosceles triangles), the statement as phrased might imply a generalization that does not always hold true for any side or angle. The precise phrasing and understanding of geometric properties are crucial, and this statement fails to accurately represent the properties of isosceles triangles in all cases.

Additionally, the average scores from the tests for each of the 4 people are multiples of 20, lying between 450 and 650, inclusive.","output":"To find the difference between the maximum and minimum possible ranges of all their scores put together, we need to consider the scenarios where the ranges are maximized and minimized. Let's denote the four people as A, B, C, and D, with ranges of 40, 70, 100, and 130, respectively. **Maximizing the Range:** To maximize the range, we should have the lowest score of the person with the smallest range (A) as low as possible, and the highest score of the person with the largest range (D) as high as possible. Since no one scored below 400, the lowest A could have scored is 400. With a range of 40, A's highest score would be 440. For D, with a range of 130, to maximize the range, we want D's highest score to be as high as possible. Since no one scored over 700, D's highest score could be 700, making the lowest score 570 (700 - 130). So, the maximum possible range would be from 400 (A's lowest) to 700 (D's highest), which is a range of 300. **Minimizing the Range:** To minimize the range, we should have the highest score of the person with the smallest range (A) as high as possible, and the lowest score of the person with the largest range (D) as low as possible. Since the average scores are multiples of 20 and lie between 450 and 650, let's assume the averages for A, B, C, and D are 450, 490, 530, and 570, respectively (these are just examples that fit the criteria). For A, with an average of 450 and a range of 40, the scores could be 430, 450, and 470. So, A's highest score is 470. For D, with an average of 570 and a range of 130, the scores could be 505, 570, and 635. So, D's lowest score is 505. The minimum possible range would be from 470 (A's highest) to 505 (D's lowest), which is a range of 35. **Difference Between Maximum and Minimum Possible Ranges:** The difference between the maximum and minimum possible ranges is 300 - 35 = 265. Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum possible ranges of all their scores put together is boxed{265} ."},{"instruction":"A chemistry student needs to make a solution that is 70% water and 30% hydrochloric acid.

When the student adds 100 mL of water, the total volume of the mixture becomes V + 100 mL. The amount of water in the current mixture is 60% of V, which is 0.60V mL. After adding 100 mL of water, the amount of water becomes 0.60V + 100 mL. The amount of hydrochloric acid in the current mixture is 40% of V, which is 0.40V mL. This amount does not change because the student is only adding water. The student wants the final mixture to be 70% water and 30% hydrochloric acid. Therefore, after adding the 100 mL of water, the new volume of water should be 70% of the total volume (V + 100 mL). So we can set up the equation: 0.60V + 100 mL = 0.70(V + 100 mL) Now, let's solve for V: 0.60V + 100 = 0.70V + 70 100 - 70 = 0.70V - 0.60V 30 = 0.10V V = 30 / 0.10 V = 300 mL Therefore, the volume of the current mixture is boxed{300} mL."},{"instruction":"Given a quadratic function y=frac{1}{2}(m1)x^{2}+left(n6right)x+1 (mgeqslant 0, ngeqslant 0), when 1leqslant xleqslant 2, y decreases as x increases.

The axis of symmetry is at x=frac{6-n}{m-1}. For y to decrease as x increases from 1 to 2, the axis of symmetry must be to the right of x=2, which gives us: [ frac{6-n}{m-1} geqslant 2 implies 6-n geqslant 2(m-1) implies 2m+n leqslant 8 ] Solving for n in terms of m gives n leqslant 8 - 2m.

For y to decrease as x increases from 1 to 2, the axis of symmetry must be to the left of x=1, which gives us: [ frac{6-n}{m-1} leqslant 1 implies 6-n leqslant m-1 implies m+n leqslant 7 ] Solving for m in terms of n gives m leqslant 7 - n. The product mn can be expressed as: [ mn leqslant n(7-n) = -n^2 + 7n ] This is a quadratic expression in n which reaches its maximum when n=frac{7}{2}, leading to: [ mn leqslant -left(n-frac{7}{2}right)^2 + frac{49}{4} = frac{49}{4} ] However, since 0 leqslant m < 1, this case does not provide a valid solution for the conditions given. **Conclusion:** Comparing the outcomes of both cases, the maximum valid value of mn is 8.

This is because within the 8 times 8 layout, it's not possible to assure two connected neighbors for fewer cells scattered over the board. - Given that there are 64 cells in total and each color must occupy at least 4 cells to ensure the two-adjacent rule, the maximum number of different colors thus becomes frac{64}{4} = 16. 4. **Optimizing the Coloring:** - By ensuring each of the 16 2 times 2 blocks is colored individually and assigned a unique color, each cell within those blocks will have at least two sides in common with cells of the same color. Hence, this arrangement optimally allows us to use exactly 16 colors. # Conclusion: The maximum number of colors that can be used to color the cells of an 8 times 8 chessboard such that each cell borders at least two other cells of the same color is boxed{16}."},{"instruction":"f 10 gallons of grape juice are added to 40 gallons of a mixture, which contains a certain percentage of grape juice, the resulting mixture is 36 percent grape juice.

Substituting (-1, -3) for (x_1, y_1) and -3 for m, we get y - (-3) = -3(x - (-1)), which simplifies to y + 3 = -3(x + 1). Finally, we rearrange this equation to obtain the standard form of the line: 3x + y + 6 = 0.

The reciprocal ( frac{1}{(2-x)^3} ) covers all positive and negative values and reaches infinite magnitude near the asymptote at ( x=2 ) but does not exist at ( x=2 ). As ( x ) increases beyond 2, ( 2-x ) becomes negative, so the cube and hence our function will be negative. Similarly, for ( x < 2 ), ( f(x) ) will be positive.

The distance between parallel lines (directrix) and the height of the equilateral triangle can be calculated as: [ text{Height} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a ] 6. By considering the orthogonal projection, we project the line parallel to its plane, and the distance between the lines is equivalent to the distance in the equilateral triangle. 7.

The segment A B of variable length is positioned on the line e such that the product A M cdot M B is constant. The midpoint F of the segment A B moves on a circle passing through M, and A M < B M. What is the locus of the points A and B?","output":"\`\`\`markdown Let's analyze the problem step-by-step with detailed explanations and references: 1. **Given Data and Interpretation:** We are given that a line ( e ) rotates around a point ( M ). A segment ( AB ) lies on this line such that the product ( AM cdot MB ) is constant, denoted as ( c^2 ). The midpoint ( F ) of the segment ( AB ) traces a circle passing through ( M ), and we are given ( AM < BM ). 2. **Assessment for ( AM cdot MB = c^2 ):** Since ( AM cdot MB = c^2 ) is constant, both points ( A ) and ( B ) vary in such a way that their geometric mean remains the same. We consider a condition ( c > 0 ) because ( c = 0 ) implies that ( A ) is always at ( M ) and hence, ( B ) is a mirror image of ( A ) with respect to ( F ). 3. **Relationship Between Points:** With ( AM < BM ), point ( M ) separates points ( A ) and ( F ) from point ( B ). In every position of line ( e ), point ( F ) is one of the intersection points of ( e ) with circle ( k ) that is different from ( M ). 4. **Geometric Construction and Derivation:** Let us construct ( e ) perpendicularly at ( M ) and measure the segment ( MN = c ). Then, by drawing a circle centered at ( F ) with radius ( FN ), we intersect ( e ) again to get points ( A ) and ( B ). According to Thales' theorem, triangle ( ABN ) forms a right triangle with the right angle at ( N ). 5. **Mathematical Calculation:** Let ( FM = f ) and ( AM = x ) where ( x > 0 ). Then, ( MB = MF + FB = MF + AF = AM + 2 MF = x + 2f ). Using the condition ( x(x + 2f) = c^2 ), we derive the quadratic equation: [ x^2 + 2fx - c^2 = 0 ] Solving this, we get: [ x = sqrt{f^2 + c^2} - f ] 6. **Special Cases of ( e ):** The perpendicular position ( e^* ) to ( k ) does not apply here where ( F^* ) coincides with ( M ), and by our elimination, ( A^* ) and ( B^* ) meet at ( A^*M = MB^* = c ). 7. **Further Geometric Analysis:** We observe that for several positions of ( e ), points ( A ) and ( B ) form circles with the center as ( M )'s opposing point in ( k ), denoted as ( F_0 ). The radius follows: [ F_0 A_0^2 = F_0 B_0^2 = F_0 N_0^2 = F_0 M^2 + MN_0^2 = d^2 + c^2 ] where ( d ) is the diameter of circle ( k ). 8. **Calculation Validation:** Given ( F_0A = F_0B ) constant for any allowed positions of ( e ), simplifying further: [ F_0 B^2 = F_0 F^2 + FB^2 = F_0 F^2 + (MB - MF)^2 ] Using: [ MB - MF = FB - MF = AF - MF = AM ] leading to: [ F_0 B^2 = d^2 + MB cdot AM = d^2 + c^2 = F_0 A_0^2 ] 9. **Expression of Points Geometry:** We conclude that ( A ) and ( B ) trace specific segments of a circle determined by ( F_0 ) where: - The smaller arc ( i_a ) and the larger arc ( i_b ) where ( A ) and ( B ) always lie on opposite sections, respectively. 10. **Conclusion:** The geometric locus of points ( A ) and ( B ) define segments of a circle. The constants involved ( c ) and the circle ( k ) under the given constraints point towards a systematic geometric solution where ( A ) and ( B ) lie on arcs of a circle centered around an opposing point to ( M ) on circle ( k ).

Let’s call this initial set of ( k ) black cells as ( A_0 ). For instance, for ( k = 3 ), we would have a scenario like this: [ begin{array}{cccc} circ & circ & circ & cdots circ & bullet & circ & cdots circ & circ & bullet & cdots circ & circ & circ & bullet vdots & vdots & vdots & vdots end{array} ] 2. **Step 2: Shift and Duplicate** Next, shift this pattern diagonally right-up by ( k ), ( 2k ), ( 3k ), ldots, ( (k-1)k ) cells.

The entire construction now forms a ( k^4 ) configuration of black cells where each vertical, horizontal, and diagonal line intersects exactly 0 or ( k ) black cells. 6. **Conclusion** The described configuration uses geometric properties to ensure that any vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line will contain either ( k ) black cells or none.

This results in (2^{n-2}) outcomes as: - (x_{1}) (always in the numerator) - (x_{2}) (always in the denominator) - (x_{3}, x_{4}, ldots, x_{n}) can be chosen by binary choices (in the numerator or denominator). Mathematically, this can be validated as the number of distinct proper parenthesized ways of placing (n-1) division operations on (n) elements is given by: frac{1}{n} binom{2n-2}{n-1} 5. **Conclusion:** There are (2^{n-2}) distinct ways to assign the elements (x_{3}, x_{4}, ldots, x_{n}) to the numerator and denominator in the given sequence.

( b + c + d + e > a ) Let's localize inequality (1) as an example: If ( e ) is the largest, rearranging gives ( a + b + c + d = 2 - e ). Substituting in the inequality: [ 2 - e > e ] [ 2 > 2e ] [ e < 1 ] This pattern is consistent, making each segment strictly < 1 a necessity. Since ( e ) was arbitrary among the segments, all must have this property to satisfy the conditions globally. Analyzing the condition of all segments having a combined length of 2 and requiring each segment to be strictly less than 1, we need a lower bound; For ( a = b = c = d = e = frac{2}{5}), the inequality still holds since ( frac{8}{5} > frac{2}{5} ). Thus, the minimum bound for safe formation of the polygon without violating inequalities might plausibly be set at a little above frac{1}{10}, ensuring each side isn't too small to invalidate the condition by making four sides unable to surpass the fifth significantly.

Consider two cases for ( x_k ): - **Case 1:** If ( x_k = 0 ), then from the definition, either ( x_{k-1} = 0 ) or ( frac{p_k}{x_{k-1}} ) is an integer. In both instances, ( x_{k-1} ) must be rational. - **Case 2:** If ( x_k neq 0 ) and ( x_k ) is a rational number, then: [ x_k = left{ frac{p_k}{x_{k-1}} right} = frac{p_k}{x_{k-1}} - leftlfloor frac{p_k}{x_{k-1}} rightrfloor ] Hence, [ x_{k-1} = frac{p_k}{x_k + leftlfloor frac{p_k}{x_{k-1}} rightrfloor} ] This shows that ( x_{k-1} ) is a rational number because it is expressed in terms of rational numbers ( p_k ), ( x_k ), and ( leftlfloor frac{p_k}{x_{k-1}} rightrfloor ). 7.

Since the denominators sequence is strictly decreasing, it must eventually hit 1. - In other words, there's a point where ( x_k = frac{m}{1} ), which implies that it can only be 0 or a non-zero integer. 12. Hence, the sequence ( x_k ) ultimately reaches ( 0 ). 13. Conversely, if ( x_0 ) is not rational, ( x_k ) for some ( k ) would not be rational either, preventing the sequence from becoming 0. # Conclusion: If the sequence ( x_0, x_1, x_2, ldots ) eventually becomes 0, the initial term ( x_0 ) must be a rational number.

Prove that for any positive integer (n), at least one of (mathrm{a}_{n+1}, mathrm{a}_{n+2}, ldots, mathrm{a}_{2n+1}) is 1. 1. **Lemma**: We will first prove the following lemma: For any (mathrm{d} in {-1, -2, ldots, -mathrm{k}}), the equation (mathrm{x}^{2} - 4mathrm{k}(mathrm{k}+1)mathrm{y}^{2} = mathrm{d}) has no positive integer solutions. 2. **Proof of Lemma**: - Assume contrary that there exists (mathrm{d} in {-1, -2, ldots, -mathrm{k}}), such that the equation (mathrm{x}^{2} - 4mathrm{k}(mathrm{k}+1)mathrm{y}^{2} = mathrm{d}) has a positive integer solution. - Let (mathrm{x}_{0} + mathrm{y}_{0} sqrt{4 mathrm{k}(mathrm{k}+1)}) be the smallest positive integer solution. Clearly, the fundamental solution to Pell's equation (mathrm{x}^{2} - 4mathrm{k}(mathrm{k}+1)mathrm{y}^{2} = 1) is ((2mathrm{k} + 1) + sqrt{4mathrm{k}(mathrm{k}+1)}). - Therefore, for any integer (mathrm{n}): (mathrm{x}_{0} + mathrm{y}_{0} sqrt{4mathrm{k}(mathrm{k}+1)}) cdot ((2mathrm{k}+1) + sqrt{4mathrm{k}(mathrm{k}+1)})^{mathrm{n}} is also an integer solution to the original equation. 3. **Particular Case**: - Let (({2mathrm{k} + 1}) - sqrt{4mathrm{k}(mathrm{k}+1)}) be an inverse. Then: (mathrm{x}_{0} + mathrm{y}_{0} sqrt{4 mathrm{k}(mathrm{k}+1)}) cdot ((2mathrm{k} + 1) + sqrt{4 mathrm{k}(mathrm{k}+1)})^{-1} is also an integer solution.

So: mathrm{x}_{0}^{2} - 4 mathrm{k}(mathrm{k}+1)mathrm{y}_{0}^{2} > 0 > mathrm{d}, a contradiction. - And ((2mathrm{k}+1)mathrm{x}_{0} - 4 mathrm{k}(mathrm{k}+1)mathrm{y}_{0} leq -mathrm{x}_{0}), mathrm{x}_{0} leq 2mathrm{k}mathrm{y}_{0}.

If (mathrm{a}_{mathrm{n}+1}, mathrm{a}_{mathrm{n}+2}, ldots, mathrm{a}_{2mathrm{n}+1}) are all 0, then: 2^{mathrm{n}+1} left{2^{mathrm{n}} sqrt{mathrm{k}(mathrm{k}+1)}right} < 1.

Find the necessary and sufficient condition for n_1,n_2,ldots,n_k , such that there exists a succession of moves through which all pencils are transferred to the same pile.</span>","output":"1. **Define the problem in terms of gcd:** Let ( k_i = frac{n_i}{gcd(n_1, n_2, ldots, n_k)} ). We claim that it is possible to transfer all pencils to a single pile if and only if (sum k_i) is a power of two. 2. **Consider the reverse operation:** Instead of transferring (b) pencils from a pile with (a) pencils to a pile with (b) pencils (where (a geq b)), we consider the reverse operation: ((x, y) mapsto left(frac{x}{2}, y + frac{x}{2}right)). This means we are splitting a pile with (x) pencils into two piles, one with (frac{x}{2}) pencils and the other with (y + frac{x}{2}) pencils. 3. **Analyze the reverse operation:** Note that in this reverse operation, (a = y + frac{x}{2} > frac{x}{2} = b) is always true. This ensures that the reverse operation is valid. The problem now becomes determining what configurations of piles a single pile can map to using this reversal. 4. **Initial configuration:** Let the single pile start with (2^t N) pencils, where (N) is odd. Since pencils can only be shifted away from even piles, any move from that point on can only shift a multiple of (N) pencils. The sum of all pencils remains constant, so the necessity of the condition follows immediately. 5. **Sufficiency by induction:** We now look forward for sufficiency, noting that the problem reduces to when the sum is (2^t). We proceed by induction on (t). - **Base case ((t=1)):** When (t=1), the sum of the (n_i) is (2). Clearly, the result holds because we can transfer all pencils to one pile in one move. - **Inductive step:** Assume the result holds for (t-1). Now consider the case when (sum n_i = 2^t). An even number of the (n_i) must be odd. We can pair these odd numbers arbitrarily and perform the operation ((2p-1, 2q-1) mapsto (4p-2, 2q-2p)). At this point, every (n_i) is divisible by 2, so we reduce the problem to (frac{n_i}{2}) summing to (2^{t-1}), which has a solution by the inductive hypothesis. 6. **Conclusion:** By induction, the result follows that it is possible to transfer all pencils to a single pile if and only if (sum k_i) is a power of two.

It appears that the sum of the first n odd numbers is equal to n^2. So for the sum including 1+3+5+7+9, we have 5 odd numbers which suggests the sum should be 5^2. Thus, 1+3+5+7+9 = 25. (2) Now, we need to find the sum of the odd numbers up to 199. We notice that 1, 3, ... 199 is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. The number of terms in this sequence can be found by using the formula for the n^{th} term of an arithmetic series, a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_n is the last term, a_1 is the first term, and d is the common difference. For the given sequence, a_n = 199, a_1 = 1, and d = 2. Solving 199 = 1 + (n-1)(2) for n gives n = 100. Therefore, the sum of the first 100 odd numbers using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n), is S_{100} = frac{100}{2} (1 + 199) = 50 cdot 200 = 10000 Since the sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2, S_{100} = 100^2. So, 1+3+5+7+…+195+197+199 = 10000. (3) The sum 101+103+105+107+…+195+197+199 can be thought of as the sum of the first 100 odd numbers minus the sum of the first 50 odd numbers (because 101 is the 51^{st} odd number). Using the same logic as in part (2), the sum of the first 50 odd numbers is 50^2. Therefore, the sum we're trying to find is 100^2 - 50^2 = 10000 - 2500 = 7500.

Hence, let ( x geq 0 ) and ( y geq 0 ). 2. **Ordering the Variables:** We also assume (x geq y).

Then the left-hand side of our desired inequality would increase due to the symmetry. 3. **Bounding (x^8) and (y^8):** From the condition (x^{8} + y^{8} leq 1), we know that each of (x) and (y) is bounded by 1, i.e., (x leq 1) and (y leq 1). 4. **New Substitution:** Define ( u = x^6 ) and ( v = y^6 ).

To find side AD, complete the quadrilateral by connecting points A and D.

The vertices of this pyramid are at (0,0,0), (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), and the centroid of the triangle formed by (2,0,0), (0,2,0), and (0,0,2) which is the point (frac{2}{3}, frac{2}{3}, frac{2}{3}). **Step 3: Calculate the volume of the pyramid.** Using the formula for the volume of a pyramid: (text{Volume} = frac{1}{3} times text{Base Area} times text{Height}), we find the area of the triangle with vertices at (2,0,0), (0,2,0), and (0,0,2). This triangle lies in the plane x + y + z = 2, hence the area of this triangle is: [ frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times 2sqrt{2} times 2sqrt{2} times frac{1}{2} = 2 ] (Base and height are the distances from the origin to (2,0,0) and (0,2,0), respectively). The height from the origin to the plane is frac{2}{sqrt{3}} (distance from (0,0,0) to the plane x + y + z = 2). Thus, the volume of the pyramid is: [ frac{1}{3} times 2 times frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{4}{3sqrt{3}} = frac{4sqrt{3}}{9} ] Multiplying this by 8 (because there are 8 such pyramids in the whole solid): [ text{Total Volume} = 8 times frac{4sqrt{3}}{9} = frac{32sqrt{3}}{9} ] Thus, the volume of the solid S is boxed{frac{32sqrt{3}}{9}}."},{"instruction":"Mark bought a shirt, pants, and shoes for 340. What is the price of the pants knowing that the price of a shirt is threequarters of the price of the pants and that the price of a shoe is ten dollars more than the price of the pants?","output":"To solve for the price of the pants, let's denote the price of the pants as X. According to the problem, the price of a shirt is three-quarters of the price of the pants, which can be represented as frac{3}{4}X. Furthermore, the price of the shoes is ten dollars more than the price of the pants, which gives us X + 10. The total amount paid for the shirt, pants, and shoes is 340. We can set up the equation as follows: [X + frac{3}{4}X + (X + 10) = 340] Combining like terms, we get: [X + frac{3}{4}X + X = 340 - 10] [2X + frac{3}{4}X = 330] [2frac{3}{4}X = 330] [frac{11}{4}X = 330] To solve for X, we divide both sides by frac{11}{4}: [X = frac{330}{frac{11}{4}}] [X = 330 times frac{4}{11}] [X = 120] Therefore, the price of the pants is boxed{120}."},{"instruction":"A cone has a base radius of 3cm. If the lateral surface is unfolded and forms a semicircle, then the lateral surface area of the cone is ____ cm^{2}.","output":"To find the lateral surface area of the cone, we start by understanding that when the lateral surface is unfolded, it forms a semicircle. The circumference of the base of the cone gives us the diameter of this semicircle since it wraps around the base exactly once. Given: - Base radius of the cone, r = 3cm. First, we calculate the circumference of the base of the cone, which is given by the formula C = 2pi r. Substituting the given radius: [C = 2pi times 3cm = 6pi cm.] This circumference is equal to the diameter of the semicircle formed by the unfolded lateral surface. Since the diameter of a circle (or semicircle) is twice the radius, we can find the slant height of the cone, which corresponds to the radius of the semicircle, by dividing the diameter by 2: [l = 6pi cm times frac{1}{pi} = 6cm.] Now, to find the lateral surface area of the cone, we use the formula for the area of a semicircle (since the unfolded lateral surface forms a semicircle) and adjust it for the fact that the original formula for a circle's area is pi r^2, but we need to halve it for a semicircle and then apply it to the cone's dimensions: [Lateral Surface Area = frac{1}{2} times pi times l^2.] Substituting the slant height (l = 6cm) into the formula: [Lateral Surface Area = frac{1}{2} times pi times (6cm)^2 = frac{1}{2} times pi times 36cm^2 = 18pi cm^2.] Therefore, the lateral surface area of the cone is boxed{18pi cm^{2}}."},{"instruction":"Mrs. Hilt and Mr. Hilt have a busy fitness schedule.

To proceed, let's use the properties of logarithms. We have to ensure that the bases are valid for logarithm functions, so: 1. **Conditions**: - ( s > 0 ) and ( s neq 1 ) (since the base of a logarithm must be positive and not equal to 1), - ( x > 0 ) (since the argument of a logarithm must be positive), - ( log_{s} x > 0 ) (since we take the logarithm again). Next, we need to express ( log_{frac{1}{s}} log_{s} x ) in a different way. Using the change of base formula for logarithms: 2. **Change of Base**: [ log_{frac{1}{s}} log_{s} x = frac{log_{s} log_{s} x}{log_{s} frac{1}{s}} ] But we know that: [ log_{s} frac{1}{s} = log_{s} 1 - log_{s} s = 0 - 1 = -1 ] So: [ log_{frac{1}{s}} log_{s} x = frac{log_{s} log_{s} x}{-1} = -log_{s} log_{s} x ] With this transformation, the inequality now becomes: 3. **Restating the Inequality**: [ -log_{s} log_{s} x > log_{s} log_{s} x ] This simplifies to: 4. **Simplifying the Inequality**: [ -log_{s} log_{s} x > log_{s} log_{s} x implies -1 cdot log_{s} log_{s} x > log_{s} log_{s} x ] Adding ( log_{s} log_{s} x ) to both sides, we get: [ -log_{s} log_{s} x - log_{s} log_{s} x > 0 implies -2 log_{s} log_{s} x > 0 implies log_{s} log_{s} x < 0 ] Since ( log_{s} log_{s} x ) must be less than zero, let's analyze the possibilities based on ( s )'s value: 5. **Cases Based on ( s )**: - **If ( s > 1 )**: - ( log_{s} x ) is an increasing function. - ( log_{s} log_{s} x < 0 ) means that ( log_{s} x < 1 ) because ( log_{s}(1) = 0 ) and it is positive at ( s ).
