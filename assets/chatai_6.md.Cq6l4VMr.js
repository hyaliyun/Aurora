The study conducted by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania examined the behavior of 143 undergraduate students over a period of time. The study revealed that participants who spent more than 30 minutes a day on social media were more likely to experience symptoms of depression. The study further revealed that participants who spent more time on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat were more likely to feel lonely and show signs of low self-esteem. These negative feelings were also linked to a decrease in social activity and a lack of physical activity. The results of the study suggest that excessive social media use may contribute to negative mental health outcomes. However, it is important to note that the relationship between social media use and depression is complex and other factors such as pre-existing mental health conditions and stress may also contribute. Despite this complexity, it is clear that social media platforms have an impact on our emotional well-being. It is important for individuals to be mindful of their social media use and to take breaks from it when feeling overwhelmed. Seeking support from friends, family, or a mental health professional is also recommended for those experiencing symptoms of depression. In conclusion, the study reinforces the idea that excessive social media use can be harmful and have a negative impact on mental health. It is important for individuals to be aware of their social media habits and to prioritize their mental health by seeking appropriate support when needed."},{"instruction":"Summary: New York City's subway system faces significant challenges in the coming years Years of neglect by city and state officials take a toll on subway's infrastructure Fixing subway delays and infrastructure costs billions in government funds Article: New York City's subway system faces a wide range of challenges in the coming years, from outdated trains and equipment to dilapidated stations to overcrowding.

The researchers cautioned, however, that the study did not prove cause and effect and that more research is needed to understand the relationship between social media use and mental health.","output":"A recently conducted study has revealed that prolonged social media use by young adults may significantly increase the risk of developing depression. According to CBS News, researchers surveyed over 1,000 adults between the ages of 18 to 30 and found that participants who spent a significant amount of time scrolling through social media displayed higher chances of experiencing depressive symptoms than those who used it less. While the researchers have cautioned that the study did not prove cause and effect, they showed concerns about the harmful effects social media may have on young adults' mental health. According to the study, young adults who were regular users of social media platforms demonstrated a 50% higher risk of experiencing depressive symptoms when compared to those who minimally or did not use social media at all. The study's authors have suggested that social media use may contribute to the prevalence of depression and other mental health disorders due to factors such as misinformation and cyberbullying. However, larger studies on the subject must be conducted to establish conclusive evidence. Awareness programs aimed at addressing the possible negative impact of social media use on mental health may also contribute to combating the issue. According to the American Psychological Association, while social media can have benefits, such as providing social connectedness, it may negatively impact mental health if used excessively. Therefore, young adults should be encouraged to use social media in moderation, and adopt healthy and productive habits to maintain a healthy mental well-being."},{"instruction":"The European Union and the U.K. agree on a postBrexit trade deal.

The study, conducted by a team of researchers from various countries, has revealed that the amount of plastic in our planet's oceans is far greater than previously estimated. According to the study, there are over 5 trillion pieces of plastic in the world's oceans, with an estimated 8 million tons added every year. This plastic pollution is having a devastating effect on the planet's marine life, with thousands of animals dying each year due to ingestion of plastic. The study also found that plastic pollution is not only affecting marine life, but also our food chain. Small fish eat microplastics, which are then consumed by larger fish, and eventually by humans. This can lead to harmful health effects such as cancer, infertility, and developmental problems. The study calls for urgent action to be taken to address the plastic pollution crisis, including reducing plastic production, improving waste management systems, and promoting sustainable alternatives to plastic. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have a role to play in tackling plastic pollution. This includes reducing our use of single-use plastics, using cloth bags or reusable containers, and recycling as much as possible. The alarming findings of this study serve as a wake-up call that we need to take immediate action to protect our oceans and the millions of species that call them home. By working together and taking steps to reduce and ultimately eliminate plastic waste, we can create a brighter and more sustainable future for our planet."},{"instruction":"Given the fact that: Using a larger pot when planting a tree allows for more root growth and a larger tree.

How many friends did Matthew share his crackers and cakes with?","output":"Let's denote the number of friends Matthew shared his crackers and cakes with as F. Since each friend ate 5 crackers and cakes, and Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend, we can say that each friend received 5 crackers and 5 cakes, making a total of 10 items per friend. Matthew had 14 crackers and 21 cakes in total. To find out how many friends he shared with, we need to add the total number of crackers and cakes together and then divide by the number of items each friend received. Total items = Total crackers + Total cakes Total items = 14 + 21 Total items = 35 Now, we divide the total number of items by the number of items each friend received: Number of friends (F) = Total items / Items per friend Number of friends (F) = 35 / 10 Since we cannot have a fraction of a friend, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Matthew shared his crackers and cakes with 3 friends, as 35 divided by 10 is 3 with a remainder of 5 items. However, we need to check if the remaining items can still be divided equally among the friends in terms of crackers and cakes. Since there are 5 items left, and each friend needs to receive an equal number of crackers and cakes, we cannot distribute these remaining items to another friend while maintaining the condition of equal numbers of crackers and cakes.

What is the maximum profit?","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Finding the Selling Price for a 800 Daily Profit 1. **Setting up the equation based on given conditions:** Let x be the selling price per item to achieve a daily profit of 800. The profit from selling each item is (x - 2) dollars (selling price minus cost price). The number of items sold decreases by 10 for every 0.1 increase in price above 3. Therefore, the number of items sold can be expressed as 500 - frac{x - 3}{0.1} times 10. The profit equation becomes: (x - 2) left(500 - frac{x - 3}{0.1} times 10right) = 800 2. **Simplifying the equation:** Expanding and simplifying gives us: x^2 - 10x + 24 = 0 3. **Solving the quadratic equation:** Solving for x yields two solutions: x_1 = 4 and x_2 = 6. 4. **Applying the Price Bureau's restriction:** The selling price cannot exceed 240% of the cost price, which is 2 times 240% = 4.8. Therefore, we discard x = 6. Hence, the selling price per item should be boxed{4 text{ dollars}} to achieve a profit of 800 per day.

Therefore, the maximum profit occurs when x = 4.8. 4. **Calculating the maximum profit:** Substituting x = 4.8 into the profit function: w_{text{max}} = -100 times (4.8 - 5)^2 + 900 = 896 Therefore, to maximize the daily profit, the selling price should be boxed{4.8 text{ dollars}} per item, resulting in a maximum daily profit of boxed{896 text{ dollars}}."},{"instruction":"Let {a_n} be a positive geometric sequence, given that a_2=2, and a_3a_4a_5=2^9.

The moves continue until the water can no longer fill new cells.

[ text{Adding additional cells: } 25 (text{after second move}) + 7 (text{third row}) + 4 (text{fourth row}) + 1 (text{fifth row}) = 37 text{ cells} ] 6. **Minimal Fill Argument**: - Reviewing combinatorial placements, Vasya cannot prevent water from occupying less than 37 cells if he strategically places sandbags such as blocking exactly as shown in above steps. 7. **Effective Strategy to Minimize Filled Cells**: - To achieve exactly 37 cells filled: - Vasya places sandbags in each subsequent row effectively as needed at critical cells to block additional flow efficiently. 8. **Illustration Confirmation**: - Refer to the given image illustrating possible blockage and minimal water fill. **Conclusion**: Water will fill at minimum 37 cells, ensuring the minimal spread given any particular strategic placement by Vasya.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 15 to align the coefficients of y: [15(x + y) = 15 times 200] [15x + 15y = 3000] Subtracting this equation from the total cost equation gives us: [25x + 15y - (15x + 15y) = 3500 - 3000] [10x = 500] [x = 50] Substituting x = 50 back into the first equation: [50 + y = 200] [y = 150] Therefore, the school purchased boxed{50} black shirts and boxed{150} white shirts. # Part 2: Calculating the Profit from the Charity Sale The profit made from selling each type of shirt is the difference between the retail price and the wholesale price, multiplied by the number of shirts sold. For black shirts: - Wholesale price: 25 yuan, - Retail price: 50 yuan, - Profit per black shirt: 50 - 25 = 25 yuan. For white shirts: - Wholesale price: 15 yuan, - Retail price: 35 yuan, - Profit per white shirt: 35 - 15 = 20 yuan. Calculating the total profit: - Profit from black shirts: 25 times 50 = 1250 yuan, - Profit from white shirts: 20 times 150 = 3000 yuan, - Total profit: 1250 + 3000 = 4250 yuan. Therefore, the total profit from this charity sale for the school is boxed{4250} yuan."},{"instruction":"For a triangle ABC, let k be its circumcircle with radius r.

Let us assume an irregular n-gon is inscribed around a circle ( S ). 2. Inscribe a regular ( n )-gon around the same circle, and denote the circle circumscribed around this regular ( n )-gon as ( S_1 ). 3. We claim that the area of the part of the irregular ( n )-gon that lies inside ( S_1 ) is greater than the area of the corresponding regular ( n )-gon. 4. Consider the tangent lines to ( S ). These tangent lines intercept ( S_1 ) in equal segments. - The sum of the areas of these intercepted segments (formed between ( S ) and ( S_1 )) is the same whether it concerns the regular or irregular ( n )-gon. 5. However, in the case of a regular ( n )-gon, these segments do not intersect (i.e., they do not have common internal points). - Whereas, for an irregular ( n )-gon, some of these segments must overlap. 6. Consequently, the area covered by these segments in the regular n-gon is less than that for the irregular n-gon: - Because any overlapping decreases the area covered separately by segments, meaning some areas are counted more than once. 7. Therefore, the area inside ( S_1 ) enclosed by the regular n-gon is greater than that enclosed by the irregular n-gon. 8. Hence, the total area of the irregular ( n )-gon is inherently larger than that of the regular ( n )-gon. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{The regular n-gon has the smallest area among all n-gons inscribed around the same circle.}} ] Part (b) **Problem:** Prove that among all n-gons inscribed around a given circle, the one with the smallest perimeter is the regular n-gon. **Step-by-step proof:** 1.

If the diagonals XY and MN intersect at a single point, say P, then stop A can be connected to stop B directly or with a single transfer at point P. Case 2: No Direct Intersection 5. If the diagonals XY and MN do not intersect directly, consider the quadrilateral formed by these diagonals, indicated as XYMN. 6. By the problem's setup, considering that no three diagonals meet at a single point and each intersection is unique, there must exist diagonals within the quadrilateral XYMN that do intersect. Let these be XN and YM, intersecting at point O. 7. Without loss of generality, assume a tram route exists along diagonal YM passing through point O. Confirming the Path with Transfers 8. Given this configuration, a possible travel route from A to B would be: - Take the tram from A to Y - Transfer at point Y - Take the tram from Y to M - Finally, transfer at point M - Reach stop B from M 9.

The smallest multiple of 9 greater than 100 can be found by dividing 100 by 9 and rounding up to the nearest whole number, then multiplying by 9: 100 ÷ 9 ≈ 11.11, rounding up to 12. 12 × 9 = 108. So, the smallest multiple of 9 greater than 100 is 108. The largest multiple of 9 less than 500 can be found by dividing 500 by 9 and rounding down to the nearest whole number, then multiplying by 9: 500 ÷ 9 ≈ 55.55, rounding down to 55. 55 × 9 = 495. So, the largest multiple of 9 less than 500 is 495. Now we need to find all the multiples of 9 between 108 and 495. We can do this by subtracting the smallest multiple from the largest and then dividing by 9 to find the number of terms, and then adding 1 because we are including both the first and the last terms in the sequence. (495 - 108) ÷ 9 = 387 ÷ 9 = 43. So there are 43 multiples of 9 between 108 and 495, inclusive. Since the number of terms is odd, the median will be the middle term in the ordered list. To find the middle term, we take the number of terms (43), add 1, and then divide by 2: (43 + 1) ÷ 2 = 44 ÷ 2 = 22. The median will be the 22nd term in the sequence. To find the 22nd term, we start with the first term (108) and add 9 (the common difference) 21 times (since the first term is already the 1st multiple): 108 + (21 × 9) = 108 + 189 = 297.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes Now, we subtract the time spent on short-haired dogs from the total time to find out how much time was spent on full-haired dogs: 240 minutes - 60 minutes = 180 minutes Since it takes twice as long to dry a full-haired dog as it does to dry a short-haired dog, the time for a full-haired dog is: 10 minutes/dog * 2 = 20 minutes/dog Now, we divide the time spent on full-haired dogs by the time it takes to dry one full-haired dog to find out how many full-haired dogs were dried: 180 minutes / 20 minutes/dog = 9 full-haired dogs So, the groomer had to dry boxed{9} full-haired dogs."},{"instruction":"Given a sequence {a_n} that satisfies a_{n+1}=2a_{n} (ninmathbb{N}^*), and a_{1}+a_{3}=2, then a_{5}+a_{7}= () A: 8 B: 16 C: 32 D: 64","output":"Since the sequence {a_n} satisfies a_{n+1}=2a_{n} (ninmathbb{N}^*), this sequence is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2.

After the merger, the total number of employees in the new company will be A + B. We are given the percentages of managers, support staff, and human resources in the new company, but we need to find the percentage of the workforce from Company A. To do this, we can use the information given about the managers, as this is the only role that is present in both companies and also mentioned in the new company's workforce distribution. In the new company, 18% of the workforce are managers. This means that the total number of managers from both companies is 0.18(A + B). From Company A, 10% are managers, which is 0.10A. From Company B, 25% are managers, which is 0.25B. The total number of managers from both companies is the sum of managers from Company A and Company B: 0.10A + 0.25B = 0.18(A + B) Now we can solve for A in terms of B: 0.10A + 0.25B = 0.18A + 0.18B 0.25B - 0.18B = 0.18A - 0.10A 0.07B = 0.08A A/B = 0.07/0.08 A/B = 7/8 This means that for every 8 employees from Company B, there are 7 employees from Company A. To find the percentage of the workforce from Company A in the new company, we can express A as a percentage of the total workforce (A + B): Percentage from Company A = (A / (A + B)) * 100 We know that A/B = 7/8, so A = 7B/8. Substituting this into the equation, we get: Percentage from Company A = ((7B/8) / ((7B/8) + B)) * 100 Percentage from Company A = ((7B/8) / (7B/8 + 8B/8)) * 100 Percentage from Company A = ((7B/8) / (15B/8)) * 100 Percentage from Company A = (7/15) * 100 Percentage from Company A = 700/15 Percentage from Company A = 46.67% Therefore, boxed{46.67%} of the workforce in the new merged company originated from Company A."},{"instruction":"Numbers ( C_n, n geqslant 1 ) (Catalan numbers) have many interesting combinatorial interpretations.

For ( n=3 ), the sum ( a+b+c ) can be computed by adding two numbers at a time, in the following ways: ( a+b+c=(a+(b+c))=((a+b)+c) ). The number of different ways is ( N_3 = 2 ).

Suppose we are given an expression, we move from left to right: - Replace each opening parenthesis by a step to the right. - Replace each plus by a step upwards. - Given that the number of opening parenthesis in the expression equals the number of steps to the right, and each is paired with a summation sign, we form a path starting from ((0, 0)) to ((n-1, n-1)). This path must ensure that at any point in time, steps to the right are not fewer than steps upwards. 2. **Form the Path:** Move stepwise from point ((0,0)) to ((n-1, n-1)): - Replace each right step with an opening parenthesis. - Each step upwards is replaced by a plus sign. The derived path does not move above the line ( y = x ). 3. **Reverse Mapping:** - Start from the point ((0,0)) and replace each step to the right with an opening parenthesis, and each upward step with a plus sign. - Write down the variables before each addition sign and at the end of the derived expression. - Ensure the expression’s validity by placing the closing parenthesis correctly. 4. **Conclusion:** Thus, the constructed bijection confirms the number of ways is indeed ( C_n ).

The total number of diagonals would then be: [ (n-3 text{ from } ntext{-gon}) = 1 + (m-3 text{ from } mtext{-gon}) + ((n-m-1) text{ from } n-m+2text{-gon}) ] 3. **Triangle Decomposition:** The total number of triangles is ( n-2 ). Label the ( n ) sides from some fixed side and number them say ( a, b, c, ldots ).
