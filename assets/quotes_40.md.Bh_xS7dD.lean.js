Venezuelan prosecutors dropped the most serious charges against opposition politician Leopoldo Lopez, whom the country's government blames for inciting clashes that have left at least five people dead. Lopez, one of the leading opposition figures in Venezuela, was formally charged with arson and conspiracy, but murder and terrorism charges were dropped, said his attorney, Juan Carlos Gutierrez. If convicted, Lopez could face up to 10 years in prison. Lopez's legal team welcomed the reduced charges, though it criticized the way the judicial process was being carried out. Wednesday night's hearing, to charge Lopez and determine whether he would be released or remain behind bars, took place in an unusual spot: a bus parked outside the prison where he is being held. \\"It seems very unorthodox,\\" Gutierrez told CNN en Español. The initial court appearance was to take place in a courtroom, but because of security concerns, officials wanted to move it to the prison. Gutierrez argued that inside a prison was not a proper venue for a hearing, so the strange solution was reached: the bus-turned-courtroom parked just outside the facility. The prison, outside the capital, Caracas, is a military facility, and Lopez's defense has raised questions about why a civilian is being held there. The response was that it was a place where the government could guarantee his safety, Gutierrez said. Lopez turned himself in to authorities this week in a dramatic scene before tens of thousands of supporters he had called to the streets. Anti-government protests in recent weeks are the largest demonstrations that President Nicolas Maduro has faced in his 11 months in power. The unrest. During the demonstrations, supporters of the country's socialist government and anti-government protesters have flooded social media with reports of violence, making drastically different claims about who's behind it. Since February 13, more than 2,000 stories from Venezuela have been uploaded to iReport, CNN's user-generated platform. Many of the videos and photos depict violent scenes between demonstrators and government forces. Alejandro Camacho Beomont told iReport that students Wednesday blocked streets and burned debris in San Cristobal, from where he sent photos -- and he said he didn't blame them. \\"Even though I am always looking for peace to make a better place to live, I think people have the right to express themselves in the ways they can, and it is not easy to express yourself in this country now,\\" he said. \\"I support the protesters. There have been more than 15 years that the majority of the Venezuelan citizens are going through tough times. There are so many problems we have to face every day, and there seems to be not a sincere attitude from the high government officials to rectify (them).\\" In a nationally televised broadcast Wednesday night, Maduro described bullet wounds sustained by government forces during protests and showed videos that he said depicted opposition protesters throwing stones and setting buses ablaze. \\"You think this is a novel? This is the reality that you with your hatred have created,\\" he said. \\"If you don't like Venezuela, leave.\\" Reports of violence drew condemnation from Henrique Capriles, a leading opposition politician who lost a bid for the presidency last year. He called for the government to open a dialogue with demonstrators, rather than cracking down on dissent. \\"In this hour of turbulence, to the students, to those who are in the streets, again we call for you not to step into the trap of violence,\\" he said. Human rights concerns. Human rights groups warned about the danger of turning the protests into a persecution of political opponents. The charges against Lopez, who has organized protests demanding better security, an end to shortages and protected freedom of speech, \\"smack of a politically motivated attempt to silence dissent in the country,\\" Amnesty International said in a prepared statement. Human Rights Watch warned that Venezuela must avoid \\"scapegoating\\" political opponents. Justice Minister Miguel Rodriguez Torres said Thursday that out of about 200 people who were detained during clashes in the past week, only 13 remain in jail for offenses that include illegal gun possession and vandalism. Rodriguez Torres ridiculed reports that the Venezuelan state is illegally detaining students in an effort to put an end to the protests. Obama decries 'false accusations' Major social and economic problems in Venezuela have fueled the protests. But as the demonstrations gained steam, officials have pointed fingers at other factors, accusing the United States of plotting to destabilize the government. Venezuela expelled three U.S. diplomats this week, accusing them of conspiring to bring down the government. At a rally Tuesday, Maduro shouted, \\"Yankee, go home\\" from the stage, drawing cheers from the crowd. U.S. President Barack Obama fired back at a news conference in Mexico on Wednesday. \\"Venezuela, rather than trying to distract from its own failings by making up false accusations against diplomats from the United States, the government ought to focus on addressing the legitimate grievances of the Venezuelan people,\\" he told reporters. In a television broadcast Wednesday, Maduro accused Colombian paramilitary forces and the United States of fueling the violence, and he vowed to stand firm against any attempts to overthrow his government. \\"And what is the Venezuelan opposition going to do?\\" he said. \\"Believe that with the support of (U.S. Secretary of State) John Kerry or Obama, you are going to be able to take political power by violent means?\\" This isn't the first time that bitter protests and counterprotests by supporters and opponents of the government have threatened political stability in Venezuela over the past decade. Many of Maduro's claims -- of U.S. intervention, of assassination plots -- were also lobbed by the late President Hugo Chavez. Chavez was briefly ousted in a coup in 2002, but otherwise outlasted the protests and repeatedly won reelection. He ruled for 14 years, until his death last year after a long battle with cancer.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: How long does a mud mask or facial mask probably have to be applied? Answer: Answer:","output":"There is no specific duration mentioned in the context for how long a mud mask or facial mask needs to be applied for sun-damaged skin. However, generally speaking, mud or facial masks usually need to be applied for approximately 15-20 minutes, depending on the mask's instructions and the individual's skin type. It is crucial to follow the product's guidelines and remove the mask when recommended to avoid over-drying or irritating the skin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Deadpool is expected to take an overwhelming 150 million over the full four-day holiday weekend.

Context: Svinhufvud's Senate introduced Finland's Declaration of Independence on 4 December 1917 and Parliament adopted it on 6 December. The social democrats voted against the Senate's proposal, while presenting an alternative declaration of sovereignty. The establishment of an independent state was not a guaranteed conclusion for the small Finnish nation. Recognition by Russia and other great powers was essential; Svinhufvud accepted that he had to negotiate with Lenin for the acknowledgement. The socialists, having been reluctant to enter talks with the Russian leadership in July 1917, sent two delegations to Petrograd to request that Lenin approve Finnish sovereignty. In December 1917, Lenin was under intense pressure from the Germans to conclude peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk and the Bolsheviks' rule was in crisis, with an inexperienced administration and the demoralised army facing powerful political and military opponents. Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could fight for central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud's delegation won Lenin's concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917. By the beginning of the Civil War, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland had recognised Finnish independence. The United Kingdom and United States did not approve it; they waited and monitored the relations between Finland and Germany , hoping to override Lenin's regime and to get Russia back into the war against the German Empire. In turn, the Germans hastened Finland's separation from Russia so as to move the country to within their sphere of influence.

Établie en 1948 et active jusqu'en 2011, l'UEO était une organisation de coopération en matière de défense et de sécurité entre les nations européennes. Au fil des années, l'UEO a contribué à la mise en place des structures nécessaires pour garantir la sécurité et la stabilité de la région. L'organisation a soutenu des projets tels que la mise en place d'une armée européenne, la création d'une force de réaction rapide et la mise en place de mesures de coopération en matière de défense. Ces projets ont été développés en étroite collaboration avec d'autres institutions et organisations européennes, comme l'Union européenne (UE), l'Organisation du traité de l'Atlantique Nord (OTAN) et l'Organisation pour la sécurité et la coopération en Europe (OSCE). En outre, l'UEO a travaillé à la création d'un espace de dialogue entre les États membres afin de promouvoir la compréhension et la coopération en matière de défense et de sécurité.

Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk.  Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

But Newcastle caretaker boss John Carver says he won't be staying. Ameobi is weighing up a move to Major League Soccer in America. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard announced move to LA Galaxy this week.","output":"Title: Shola Ameobi Not to be Re-Signed by Newcastle United: Considering Move to Major League Soccer Newcastle United confirmed that they will not re-sign former Magpies striker Shola Ameobi despite his recent training at the club's facilities. The 39-year-old has been receiving treatment for an ankle injury he sustained during his time at Turkish club Gaziantep, from which he departed last week, but will not be remaining with the Magpies. Ankle Injury and Treatment: Ameobi suffered the injury during his tenure at his most recent club, Gaziantep. The Nigerian forward turned down several opportunities to renew his contract to focus on finding new challenges in his career and eventually landed back at St. James' Park training base in Newcastle, where he was rehabilitating. Newcastle United caretaker boss John Carver, however, made it clear that Ameobi would not be rejoining the club. Looking Towards Major League Soccer: Instead, the experienced attacker is reportedly considering a move to Major League Soccer in America, amidst increasing interest in the league. If Ameobi follows through, he would join a growing list of high-profile players who have recently moved to the U.S. competition, seeking new challenges and opportunities in the latter years of their careers.  Steven Gerrard Precedent: Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard stands as one such example, having made a high-profile move to LA Galaxy in 2015. The former England international played two seasons with the Galaxy, acting as an influential figure both on and off the pitch before retiring from professional football. Ameobi could similarly use this opportunity to bring his wealth of experience and footballing expertise to the Major League Soccer scene. In summary, although Shola Ameobi has been receiving treatment at Newcastle United's training ground after leaving Gaziantep, he will not be re-signing with the Magpies. Instead, the former striker is said to be mulling over a move to Major League Soccer, amongst a growing trend of football veterans seeking new challenges across the pond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The painting shows the moment from Summer in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into \\"the lucid coolness of the flood\\" to \\"bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream\\". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical...

Write an article based on this summary: Use an eye dropper or small net to catch your larvae. Place unhatched egg boats in your fish tank. Capture larvae “wrigglers” and place them in your fish tank. Harvest your larvae weekly. Dispose of dead larvae.","output":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Raising Fish Larvae in Aquaria Introduction Raising fish larvae, also known as 'wrigglers', within home aquaria can be a challenging but ultimately rewarding experience. This article will provide a comprehensive guide, detailing everything you need to know about catching, transferring, harvesting, and maintaining the health of fish larvae in your tank. Catching the Fish Larvae: A Delicate Task The first step in raising fish larvae is, of course, catching them. Regardless of the breed of the fish, larvae are unfailingly delicate creatures. One can use an eye dropper or a small fish net for this purpose. Both options offer restorative control while being gentle enough to ensure the larvae's safety. The eye dropper technique involves creating a suction effect to carefully 'pick up' the larvae, without any direct contact. On the other hand, using a small net requires more skill, but can facilitate the collection of larger quantities of larvae at a time. Remember, the key is to handle them with extreme care to avoid any harm. Preparing the Safe Haven: Placement of Unhatched Egg Boats Introduction of the unhatched egg boats into the fish tank is an essential step to create a conducive incubatory environment for the unhatched eggs. These egg boats are artificial spawning sites designed to resemble a fish's natural habitat. They provide a protective shield for the unhatched eggs, preventing other inhabitants of the tank from preying on them. Monitor their progress daily to ensure they are safe and developing correctly. Welcome Your New Inhabitants: Transferring the Wrigglers  After successful collection, it is time to introduce the larvae 'wrigglers' to the fish tank. Ensure that the tank's conditions are optimized for their survival and growth, including appropriate temperature, pH, and light exposure.  Frequent Monitoring: Weekly Harvesting of Larvae Maintaining the health, growth, and safety of your newly added residents is crucial in their upbringing. Regular harvesting through gentle suction or netting allows you to monitor and assess their growth progressive accurately. A weekly schedule is recommended as it is frequent enough to detect any abnormalities promptly, yet not so invasive as to cause the larvae undue stress. Dealing with Mortality: Disposal of Dead Larvae In the lifecycle of fish larvae, facing mortality is not uncommon – in fact, it's natural. These natural losses can, however, have detrimental effects on the health of other fish and larvae in the tank if not properly managed. Dead larvae tend to deteriorate quickly, leading to unsanitary conditions that can endanger all the tank's inhabitants. Regular removal of dead larvae, therefore, helps maintain both the health of the tank and the wellbeing of its other inhabitants. Conclusion Raising fish larvae might seem like an overwhelming task at first, but with patience, care, and the right techniques, it can be a fascinating journey. The careful process of collecting, introducing, observing, and caring for these delicate creatures offers not just an opportunity to enrich your aquatic understanding but also an extraordinary joy of adding and nurturing life in your home aquaria environment.  Be mindful as the margin of error is slim. But with this guide in your hands, each step will bring you one inch closer to a vibrant and thriving aquatic family!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: William James Dixon (July 1, 1915 - January 29, 1992) was an American blues musician, vocalist, songwriter, arranger and record producer. He was proficient in playing both the upright bass and the guitar and was a capable singer, but he is perhaps best known as one of the most prolific songwriters of his time. Next to Muddy Waters, Dixon is recognized as the most influential person in shaping the post-World War II sound of the Chicago blues. Dixon's songs have been recorded by countless musicians in many genres as well as by various ensembles in which he participated. Context: Dixon signed with Chess Records as a recording artist, but he began performing less, being more involved with administrative tasks for the label. By 1951, he was a full-time employee at Chess, where he acted as producer, talent scout, session musician and staff songwriter. He was also a producer for the Chess subsidiary Checker Records. His relationship with Chess was sometimes strained, but he stayed with the label from 1948 to the early 1960s. During this time Dixon's output and influence were prodigious. From late 1956 to early 1959, he worked in a similar capacity for Cobra Records, for which he produced early singles for Otis Rush, Magic Sam, and Buddy Guy. He later recorded for Bluesville Records. From the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, Dixon ran his own record label, Yambo Records, and two subsidiary labels, Supreme and Spoonful. He released his 1971 album, Peace?, on Yambo and also singles by McKinley Mitchell, Lucky Peterson and others.  Dixon is considered one of the key figures in the creation of Chicago blues. He worked with Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Otis Rush, Bo Diddley, Joe Louis Walker, Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, Koko Taylor, Little Milton, Eddie Boyd, Jimmy Witherspoon, Lowell Fulson, Willie Mabon, Memphis Slim, Washboard Sam, Jimmy Rogers, Sam Lay and others.  In December 1964, the Rolling Stones reached number one on the UK Singles Chart with their cover of Dixon's \\"Little Red Rooster\\". In the same year, the group also covered \\"I Just Want To Make Love To You\\" on their debut album, The Rolling Stones. Question: In what way did he work with them? Answer:","output":"William James Dixon worked with various artists in multiple capacities. As a producer, talent scout, session musician, and staff songwriter for Chess Records and Checker Records, he helped shape and develop the careers of many Chicago blues musicians, including Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Otis Rush, Bo Diddley, Joe Louis Walker, Little Walter, and Sonny Boy Williamson. Dixon wrote numerous songs that were recorded by these artists, and he also played the upright bass and guitar during recording sessions, adding his musical skills to their tracks. Additionally, he collaborated with these artists during live performances, further cementing their partnership in creating the unique sound of the Chicago blues."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

David Bowie's last three songs: decoding the final transmission “I’ve got a handful of songs to sing / To sting your soul, to fuck you over,” sings David Bowie on Killing a Little Time, one of three new songs on the album of his stage musical Lazarus. Now there’s a lyric to conjure with. It’s so playfully, poignantly appropriate for one of Bowie’s very last recordings that it’s hard to resist the idea that he is addressing us directly; that it’s a morbid showbusiness flourish from a dying man. But is that all there is to a Bowie song? Bowie was never one for straightforward autobiography. His lyrics, even from a song as beloved as Life on Mars?, contain confounding twists and pockets of mystery. You can have a lot of fun guessing what they mean but you can never fully explain them. Before he died in January, Blackstar seemed to be yet another of his slippery, enigmatic creations, so it felt a little disappointing to see its array of possible meanings reduced, upon his passing, to a deathbed address. Confirmation bias led listeners to literalise any line that was remotely death-related and downplay the rest. The theory that this was a calculated farewell was alluring and not without foundation but it was suspiciously neat, given what we know about his art. The Lazarus material really is the last word. Here are the final three songs recorded by a titanic artist whose death triggered a volcano of grief, so how could we not comb them for clues? But they are also components of a long-dreamt-of musical about Thomas Jerome Newton, The Man Who Fell to Earth. Of course, Bowie seemed to mindmeld with Walter Tevis’s creation at one psychologically fraught point in the mid-70s – the covers for Station to Station and Low both used stills from Nicolas Roeg’s movie; cocaine has a way of making one identify with an emotionally numb alien far from home – but still, there was, and is, a difference between the singer and the character. These songs were written for actors to sing, so interpret with caution. They are by no means offcuts. Posthumous material often resembles a scrawny cigarette, scraped together using strands of tobacco from the butts in the ashtray. But these songs are as fully realised as anything on Blackstar. Indeed, they were recorded at the same time, with the same band and producer, and give the same impression that Bowie was on one last hot streak. Each one has its own flavour. When I Met You is the kind of briskly anthemic, self-quoting rock that Bowie delivered on his 2013 comeback album The Next Day, climbing a ladder of chords to a stirring chorus, until a swarm of overlapping backing vocals knocks it sideways, giving it a stranger, more chaotic quality. Killing a Little Time has the same neurotic momentum as Sue (Or in a Season of Crime) and a touch of Outside’s 1990s industrial clamour, pitching Bowie’s sinisterly theatrical vocal into shrieking, churning jazz-rock. Mark Guiliana’s astonishing, tentacular drumming alone confirms that Bowie’s last band, led by saxophonist Donny McCaslin, was one of his best, capable of anything. Bowie sounds like a man coming apart — “I’m falling, man / I’m choking, man / I’m fading, man” — but it feels like Newton talking. Bowie is just the cracked actor. The best of the three, No Plan, is also the one most likely to inspire literal readings. It’s an exquisitely lush, star-speckled torch song, which refracts the late-in-life stocktaking of Piaf or Sinatra through the stasis and fatalism of Talking Heads’ Heaven. “All the things that are my life / All my moves, my beliefs, my designs / Me alone, nothing to regret / This is no place but here I am / This is not quite yet,” Bowie croons. Taken alone, it would be a hell of a swansong (“Am I nowhere now?”) but play it beside the feverish discontent of Killing a Little Time and it loses its soothing finality. Again, these are numbers from a musical. They might feel movingly true at times but they’re stories, from a master storyteller. For a fan, these three songs reignite that January sadness, but they also underline what Blackstar implied, which is that Bowie wasn’t winding down but racing as fast as his health allowed through a final burst of creativity that was cut short too soon. And they provide a more ambiguous finale to a consistently surprising career. If you retrospectively found closure in Blackstar, then you’ll discover a more open ending here: loose threads to unravel that suspicious neatness. Their artistic vitality will, as promised, sting your soul. It will fuck you over.

Putting the gift in a box will enhance its appearance and also create an element of surprise. It will show that Jesse has put thought and effort into his gift, emphasizing Skylar's importance to him.  Once Jesse has found the perfect box, he will need to make sure the gift, in its new packaging, embodies his message – love, care, and the appreciation he has for Skylar.

Additionally, Jesse might want to choose a meaningful or heartwarming card to accompany the gift. In the card, he can write a personal message expressing his feelings and describing why this particular gift was chosen especially for Skylar. Upon completing these tasks, Jesse can now move on to option [i]: make Skylar happy with the gift. At this point, Jesse will want to choose the perfect moment to present the gift to Skylar. This moment should be personal, intimate, and free from distractions, ensuring that both Jesse and Skylar can fully absorb the sentiment behind the exchange. Alternatively, Jesse might opt to surprise Skylar with the gift. He could do this by leaving the beautifully wrapped gift and card in a strategic location, where Skylar is certain to find it, such as on Skylar's bed or desk.

Nick needed a splint on their arm but not Michael because  Pick your answer from:  (A). Nick had a healthy arm..  (B). Michael had a healthy arm..","output":"B. Michael had a healthy arm. Nick needed a splint on their arm but not Michael because Michael had a healthy arm. As they were in the woods with limited resources, Nick knew that they had to improvise. Step 1: Identify materials to create a splint Nick scanned the surroundings for two sturdy sticks that could be secured to the injured arm. These sticks would provide enough support for the injured area, ensuring that the arm stays properly aligned as they made their way back to civilization. Step 2: Gather additional materials for securing the splint Next, Nick searched for materials to use to secure the sticks in place on the arm. This could include strips of cloth from their clothing, flexible vines, or even shoelaces. The key was to find materials strong enough to hold the splint in place without causing discomfort or cutting off circulation. Step 3: Position the injured arm Before applying the splint, Nick needed to ensure that the injured arm was in a straight position, with the hand slightly elevated to prevent swelling. Gently, Nick guided the arm into this position while being mindful of the pain and discomfort. Step 4: Apply the splint Once the arm was properly positioned, Nick placed the two sturdy sticks on either side of the arm and began tying the materials securely around the sticks and the injured limb. Maintaining even pressure and spacing the ties every few inches along the arm, Nick ensured that the splint was firmly stabilized. Step 5: Reassess and adjust if necessary Upon completion, Nick assessed the stability of the splint, verifying that it was securing the injured arm effectively and offering enough support. If any adjustments were needed, Nick made them accordingly, ensuring that the splint provided both comfort and immobilization. Step 6: Seek medical attention Now that the arm was immobilized using the splint, their immediate priority was to seek professional medical assistance. Nick and Michael identified the direction they needed to travel to reach the nearest town and began their journey, being cautious of further injury to the splinted arm. By acting efficiently and effectively, Nick was able to create a makeshift splint that protected their injured arm while they sought medical attention. Meanwhile, Michael was there to offer emotional and physical support, as his healthy arm allowed him to take on more tasks during their trek."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the thing or person that may be immune to the venom of the Lycosa Carnivora? ?  Consulting detective Sherlock Holmes fakes his own death in Scotland in order to investigate a number of bizarre apparent suicides that he is convinced are part of an elaborate plot by \\"a female Moriarty\\". Returning to his assistant Watson in secret, Holmes notes that all the victims were wealthy gamblers, so disguised as \\"Rajni Singh\\", a distinguished Indian officer, he stalks London's gaming clubs. It is not long before he encounters the villain of the piece, Adrea  Spedding. Holmes discovers that she seeks out men short of money, persuades them to pawn their life insurance policies with her accomplices, then kills them. Holmes sets himself up as her next victim, discovering that she uses the deadly spider, Lycosa Carnivora, whose venom causes such excruciating pain that the victims kill themselves. Holmes also finds the footprint of a child nearby. Searching for evidence Holmes and Watson visit eminent arachnologist Matthew Ordway, who may have supplied the deadly creatures. Holmes soon realizes that the man he is speaking to is an impostor, but the villain makes his escape. Searching the premises, Holmes finds the corpse of the real Ordway, as well as his journals, which allude to something or someone from Central Africa immune to the spider venom. This baffles Holmes until he finds the model skeleton of a child. However, Dr. Watson points out that the relation of the skull and the circumference of the chest prove it is not a child, and Holmes deduces that the Central African thing described in the journal is a pygmy. Holmes and Watson continue their investigations at a nearby fairground, where Holmes allows himself to fall into the clutches of Spedding and her gang. Bound and gagged, Holmes is tied behind a moving target in a shooting gallery, at which Lestrade and Watson take pot shots with a  .22 rifle. However Holmes manages to escape, and Lestrade and the police arrest Spedding, her gang, and the pygmy.

You are given two options and you need to select the one that best connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. Indicate your answer by 'Option 1' if the first option is correct, otherwise 'Option 2'. The incorrect option will change the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences is no longer consistent with the story.

Sentence 3: I lifted half of what my friend did, and I almost dropped the weight   Sentence 4:  When we moved to the leg exercises, I quit from exhaustion   Sentence 5:  I went into the locker room and packed up my bag for home   Option 1: We started our workout on the bench press.   Option 2: We started our workout on the treadmill.","output":"This task wants you to fill in the missing second sentence in a five sentence story. Both options given to you will fit in the structure of the story, but only one will maintain consistency within the story's narrative. It's important to remember that the incorrect option will disrupt the sequence of events, making one or more of the following sentences seem out of place or not make sense.  Taking a look at sentences 3 and 4, we can see they refer to specific gym exercises - lifting weights and leg exercises. This should be a hint to which option fits best. Option 1: \\"We started our workout on the bench press.\\" This option refers to a gym activity and serves as a natural way to transition to sentence 3, which speaks about lifting weight. Option 2: \\"We started our workout on the treadmill.\\" While it is a gym activity, this option shifts the focus of the story to cardio exercises, which disconnects from sentence 3 about lifting weights. Thus, 'Option 1' is the correct choice here. It connects seamlessly with the third sentence, allowing the story to flow naturally without changing any subsequent elements in the narrative. The selection of 'Option 2' would interrupt the storyline as it does not align with the reference to weight lifting in sentence 3, causing a disruption in the consistency of the story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The term hand luggage or cabin baggage (also commonly referred to as carry-on in North America) refers to the type of luggage that passengers are allowed to carry along in the passenger compartment of a vehicle instead of moving to the cargo compartment. Passengers are allowed to carry a limited number of smaller bags with them in the vehicle and contain valuables and items needed during the journey. There is normally storage space provided for hand luggage, either under seating, or in overhead lockers. Trains usually have luggage racks above the seats and may also (especially in the case of trains travelling longer distances) have luggage space between the backs of seats facing opposite directions, or in extra luggage racks, for example, at the ends of the carriage near the doors.

Both terms refer to the type of luggage that passengers are allowed to carry with them in the passenger compartment of a vehicle, such as a plane or train, instead of placing it in the cargo compartment.

Given the below context:  In 1932, after six year's teaching at the Royal College, Moore took up a post as the Head of the Department of Sculpture at the Chelsea School of Art. Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of The Seven and Five Society would develop steadily more abstract work, partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti. Moore flirted with Surrealism, joining Paul Nash's modern art movement \\"Unit One\\", in 1933. In 1934, Moore visited Spain; he visited the cave of Altamira (which he described as the \\"Royal Academy of Cave Painting\\"), Madrid, Toledo and Pamplona.Moore and Nash were on the organising committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings. In 1938, Moore met Kenneth Clark for the first time. From this time, Clark became an unlikely but influential champion of Moore's work, and through his position as member of the Arts Council of Great Britain he secured exhibitions and commissions for the artist.

The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at Donauwörth on the 17th to find the Grande Armée in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by 75 miles (121 km) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia. On 13 May, Vienna fell for the second time in four years, although the war continued since most of the Austrian army had survived the initial engagements in Southern Germany.\\".

Which language is this?","output":"The given text is in Turkish. Turkish is a member of the Oghuz group of languages, a subgroup of the Turkic language family. This language family is one of the world’s major language families, and its languages are spoken by some 170 to 200 million people spread across a wide area from Northeastern Siberia in the east to the Balkan Peninsula in the west. Turkey, where Turkish is primarily spoken, has strong historical, cultural, and political ties to the Turkic peoples of Central Asia. The modern Turkish language derives from the Ottoman Turkish language which was heavily influenced by Arabic and Persian. However, the Turkish Language Reform in the early 20th century purged the language of a great many Arabic and Persian loanwords, replacing them with newly coined Turkish words. The Latin alphabet is used for writing Turkish since 1928, replacing the Arabic script. The provided text can be translated roughly into English as: \\"Some analysts believe that dialogue mechanisms will overcome the existing regional bilateral disputes and facilitate the EU membership of the candidates.\\" This phrase likely refers to discussions about potential new members of the European Union, such as talks about Turkey's longstanding bid for EU membership.  One of the notable features of the Turkish language is its use of vowel harmony, a type of phonological process that involves the changing of vowel sounds that are dependent upon the preceding vowel or consonant. Turkish also follows a subject-object-verb word order, rather than the subject-verb-object order that is common in English. For example, \\"I see you\\" would be \\"Ben seni görüyorum\\" in Turkish, which translates directly to \\"I you see\\".  Additionally, Turkish is highly agglutinative, meaning words are often made up of multiple parts — root words and one or more affixes. For example, the word \\"çıkarılamayabileceğinizi\\" means \\"that you might not be able to be taken out,\\" showcasing the complexity of the language.  While Turkish is the official and main language of Turkey, it is also spoken by Turkish communities in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Northern Cyprus, and other regions of the Balkans as well as by large immigrant communities in Western Europe and in North America."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Labour was challenged to hand back donations from the Unite union yesterday after its leader called for civil disobedience during the Olympics. General secretary ‘Red Len’ McCluskey threatened illegal strikes and direct action to oppose changes to public sector pensions. Labour leader Ed Miliband joined the Trades Union Congress in denouncing Mr McCluskey’s outburst – but only after he had tweeted a mild rebuke earlier in the day. Clash: Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, was put on the defencive by David Cameron, right, over his party's links to Unite. Mr Miliband also faced calls to break the link with the union which remains Labour’s biggest donor. In the Commons, David Cameron said:. ‘Let us remember Unite is the single biggest donor to the party. opposite, providing around a third of their money, and had more role. than anybody else in putting the Right Honourable Gentleman (Mr. Miliband) in his place.’ Mr Cameron also attacked Mr Miliband for initially failing to condemn Mr McCluskey’s views in person. On Tuesday night when news of Mr. McCluskey’s views first surfaced, the Labour leader left it to his. spokesman to respond. Then yesterday morning he issued a tweet and sent. his deputy Harriet Harman to answer questions on radio and television. Disruption: 'Red Len' McCluskey threatened a year of industrial strife and said Unite would be prepared to break the law 'to defend our basic rights' But Mr Cameron said: ‘It’s not good. enough for them just to put out a tweet, they need to condemn this. utterly and start turning back the money.’ Downing Street earlier denounced the threat of strikes to disrupt the Olympics as ‘completely unacceptable and unpatriotic’. Rebuke: Nick Clegg said the public would be 'gobsmacked' and 'appalled' by Mr McCluskey's comments. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg urged Mr Miliband to ‘rein in’ the union boss. ‘I just think people will be. gobsmacked, appalled, that someone thinks that at a time when we are. finally hosting one of the greatest events in the world, he is calling. for civil disobedience,’ Mr Clegg said. ‘I know he is the sort of paymaster of the Labour party but I hope Ed Miliband will rein him in.’ Stung into action, the Labour leader eventually broke cover to speak out as he met French Socialist leader Francoise Hollande. Mr Miliband said: ‘It’s completely. wrong to make any threat to the Olympic Games – I do condemn it. We as. the Labour government fought for the Olympic Games to be brought to. Britain as part of a cross-party effort – it is a moment of national. celebration. ‘The focus of the world will be on. Britain and it is totally wrong to make a threat to the Games.’ Since. the general election Unite has given £5million to Labour, making it by. far the party’s biggest donor. 'Chaos': Mr McCluskey said action during the Olympics would bring his 'grievances to the attention of as many people as possible' Countdown: The Olympic rings mounted on a barge pass under Tower Bridge as London counts down to the games. Mr McCluskey said no precise plans had. been drawn up for action during the games, but added that they. ‘absolutely’ could include strikes. Pugh's take. ‘The attacks that are being launched. on public sector workers at the moment are so deep and ideological that. the idea the world should arrive in London and have these wonderful. Olympic Games as though everything is nice and rosy in the garden is. unthinkable. Our very way of life is being attacked,’ he said. Labour MPs were also furious last night with Mr McCluskey. ‘This is just posturing but it doesn’t do us any good,’ said one. ‘This sort of thing is unpopular with. the public and damages by association. Ed needs to take a stand and show. that he’s not Unite’s man.’ TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: ‘The TUC and Britain’s unions have been strong supporters of the London Olympics. Unions have engaged constructively. with the Olympic authorities throughout the whole project to ensure the. good working conditions that are helping deliver the Games on time and. on budget.’ VIDEO: Shadow Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell gives her opinion on Len McCluskey's comments.

Article: The mystery woman sitting on a Powerball ticket worth 560 million has petitioned a New Hampshire court to let her claim the jackpot before a judgment is reached on whether her name must be made public – in part, her lawyers argue, so she can start lining up private security.      A hearing on her fight to collect on her winnings anonymously is scheduled for today in Hillsborough Superior Court in Nashua, N.H.      Lawyers for \\"Jane Doe\\" filed a motion yesterday asking the court to let her claim the third largest Powerball jackpot in history through a trust, \\"pending a final resolution of this matter.\\"      She is agreeing, as part of the claim process, to have a trustee provide her photo identification and Social Security number to the New Hampshire Lottery Commission on the condition that all her personal information be kept confidential.      A lump-sum cash payout is worth 352 million, the lawyers note in their court filing.      The woman struck gold on Jan. 6 with the Easy Pick combination of 12-29-30-33-61 and Powerball number 26.      The ticket was purchased at Reeds Ferry Market in Merrimack, N.H.      \\"Allowing Ms. Doe to collect payment of the Powerball prize will provide Ms. Doe with the time and resources to adequately prepare for the possibility that the Court will hold that the Commission must disclose her identity in response to a Right to Know request,\\" the attorneys tell the court.      \\"With her prize winnings, Ms. Doe will be able to obtain the necessary security to ensure her and her family's safety and take other protective actions in order to mitigate acts of harassment and annoyance.\\"      The woman signed the back of the Powerball ticket with her name, home address and phone number after turning to the New Hampshire Lottery Commission's website for advice on how to claim her prize — only belatedly realizing she could have set up a trust to protect her identity.      The commission has seen a copy of ticket and confirmed \\"it is likely the winning ticket,\\" its lawyers acknowledge in their motion to dismiss Jane Doe's argument for remaining anonymous.      The ticket will have to be submitted as signed with the winner's signature and personal information, the commission states.      \\"Even if the winner elects to assign the ticket to another legal entity, such as a trust, the ticket itself will need to be submitted in its original form,\\" the commission told the court. \\"Whiting out, reconstruction, tampering or other alteration of the ticket violates Powerball Administrative Rules and could lead to a disqualification of the ticket.\\"      The winning ticket, when presented to the commission, will be considered a public document, the commission's lawyers note. Under New Hampshire's Right-to-Know law, most public documents must be released upon appropriate request, and the commission would be legally obligated to release the winning ticket with, at a minimum, the winner's name and hometown, it states. ||||| The commission oversees hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues and prizes a year.      “When somebody wins a public lottery of 560 million, there is a public interest in knowing who the winner was, and that it is a fair and equitable process,” John J. Conforti, an assistant attorney general representing the lottery commission, told the court.      The state gave little credence to the argument that identifying Ms. Doe would jeopardize her safety, saying that any risk could be managed by engaging a security detail. Ms. Doe’s lawyers said they were already lining up bodyguards.      Most states view the names of winners of significant prizes as a matter of public record, though a few permit winners to keep their identities private. Some states, including New Hampshire, allow trusts and not just individuals to claim winnings.      For almost two hours Tuesday, Judge Charles Temple of the Hillsborough County Superior Court heard arguments in the case, which has made headlines around the world for the eye-popping size of the prize and for an “if only” twist in Ms. Doe’s plight.      When Ms. Doe realized she had the winning ticket, she followed the instructions on the ticket and on the lottery commission’s website to “sign the ticket.”      If only she had talked to a lawyer first, she might have avoided the entire issue. She could have set up a trust that would sign the ticket, claim the prize and be the public face of the winner, rather than Ms. Doe personally. But lottery officials say the chance to do that ended when she signed her name.      Ms. Doe’s lawyers — Steven M. Gordon and Billy Shaheen, high-powered attorneys in the state — said the ticket and state’s website were misleading because they did not explain that by signing a ticket, winners give up their anonymity. Nowhere, they said, does the website advise the winner “that there is an option for a trust to claim a prize.” |||||Summary:","output":"A New Hampshire woman, known as \\"Jane Doe,\\" is fighting to claim her 560 million Powerball jackpot prize without disclosing her identity, citing personal security concerns.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve this math problem Solve -14*y + 259 - 175 = 0 for y.","output":"Alright, let's solve this step by step: 1. We have the equation -14*y + 259 - 175 = 0 2. First, we will combine the numbers 259 and -175.     So, 259 - 175 = 84    Now our equation is -14*y + 84 = 0 3. Next, we want to get y by itself. So let's move the 84 to the other side of the equation.    To do this, we will subtract 84 from both sides:    -14*y + 84 - 84 = 0 - 84    Now we have: -14*y = -84 4. Finally, we want to find out what y is. Since y is being multiplied by -14, we need to divide both sides by -14 to find y:    y = -84 / -14 5. Divide -84 by -14 and we get y = 6 So the answer is y = 6."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

His work has contributed significantly to solving complex criminal cases in Colombo, leading to a reputation of professionalism and integrity within his field. Education: Although specific details about W.D.L. Fernando's education are not available in the provided bio, it is likely that he completed an undergraduate medical degree (such as a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery, MBBS) from a reputable medical school. Afterward, he would have pursued a postgraduate specialization in pathology and then further specialized in forensic pathology. This would have required a rigorous training program and, potentially, additional certifications and affiliations with relevant medical and forensic associations. Birth Date: W.D.L.

I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement.

In the post WWII era, several eastern European countries came into the orbit of the Soviet Union.","output":"In both sentences, the term \\"orbit\\" is used to convey a similar concept, but the context slightly differs. Here is a closer examination of each sentence to understand the nuances involved. 1. \\"In the political orbit of a world power.\\" In this sentence, the term \\"orbit\\" is used metaphorically to suggest that a country or entity is under the influence and control of a world power. It implies that this entity is subjected to the political direction and decisions made by the more powerful world power, in a relationship akin to a satellite and the celestial body it orbits. 2. \\"In the post WWII era, several eastern European countries came into the orbit of the Soviet Union.\\" In this context, \\"orbit\\" still denotes influence and control but is being used in a historical context to describe the situation that unfolded following World War II. In this case, the term describes the fact that many Eastern European countries fell under the political and economic control of the Soviet Union, which acted as the dominant regional power.  In both sentences, \\"orbit\\" essentially conveys the dependency of a smaller entity (e.g., a country) on a larger and more powerful entity (e.g., a world power or the Soviet Union). While the contexts are different – one being a general description of political influence, and the other being specific to the post-WWII era – the term \\"orbit\\" serves a similar purpose in conveying the metaphorical relationship between the influential power and the dependent entity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Educational standards were once high, but have declined significantly since the early 2000s. Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001, performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had dropped. Although average literacy stands at 98.4% with no significant difference between sexes, functional illiteracy is significant. The PISA study of 2015 found 41.5% of pupils in the 9th grade to be functionally illiterate in reading, maths and science. The Ministry of Education and Science partially funds public schools, colleges and universities, sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process. Education in primary and secondary public schools is free and compulsory. The process spans through 12 grades, where grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level.

Step 2: Evaluate the choices relative to each other Now we need to compare the choices and figure out which one offers the best view. - Hill and Building: Both of these options provide an elevated viewpoint, which can offer a good view.

Article: On December 24, Yeltsin informed the Secretary-General of the United Nations that by agreement of the member states of the CIS Russian Federation would assume the membership of the Soviet Union in all UN organs (including permanent membership in the UN Security Council). Thus, Russia is considered to be an original member of the UN (since October 24, 1945) along with Ukraine (Ukrainian SSR) and Belarus (Byelorussian SSR). On December 25—just hours after Gorbachev resigned as president of the Soviet Union—the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian Federation (Russia), reflecting that it was now a sovereign state with Yeltsin assuming the Presidency. The change was originally published on January 6, 1992 (Rossiyskaya Gazeta). According to law, during 1992, it was allowed to use the old name of the RSFSR for official business (forms, seals and stamps). The Russian Federation's Constitution (Fundamental Law) of 1978, though with the 1991–1992 Amendements, remained in effect until the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis.

Now we know that getting along with other people is something that we can work at. It is possible to act in such a way that other people will like us better. One way is being unselfish, not wanting everything from our friends. Another way is to look for good points, not bad points in other people. It is surprising how successful this treasure hunt can be. You do not have to be spineless   in order to be popular. In fact, you will be liked or loved if you are not afraid to stand up for your rights  . But do it politely and pleasantly. Being friendly and polite to your group, to other people and to strangers and especially to those who do not look important or do not interest you is one way to develop a good character. You cannot expect to be perfect, and you must learn not to be unhappy when you make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and no one is to be blamed if he does not refuse to learn from them. Many young people become discouraged   when they know in themselves qualities that they do not like--selfishness, laziness, and other unpleasant qualities. Just remember that we all have some of these faults   and have to fight against them. At the same time, it is important to remember that while you are probably no worse than others, the best way to be happy is to think yourself above other people. When something is wrong, it is good sense to try to make it right. Perhaps you do not like a teacher or a classmate. Try to see why, and look at yourself, too, to be sure that you are not doing anything to make that person dislike you.

But what is electric current? Electric current is actually the flow of electrons. You may recall, an electron is the outer-most particle in an atom. They have a negative charge. Electricity is the continuous flow of these particles. Electrons are able to move through wires. Their speed can even be measured. The SI unit for electric current (or speed) is the ampere (A). Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. Direct current (DC) flows in only one direction. Direct current is what is used in devices like flashlights. Alternating current (AC) flows in two directions. This is the type of current that flows into your home through wires.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Where are the wires that carry electric current to your home?\\" is \\"Under the poles\\"?","output":"Based on the given paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Where are the wires that carry electric current to your home?\\" is \\"On top of the poles\\" instead of \\"Under the poles.\\" The paragraph states, \\"You have noticed the tall poles along the roadside... wires that carry electric current.

We have the equation: 0 = -5*s - 7*s + 771 - 711 First, we can combine the numbers which are not attached to 's' (those are the ones at the end, 771 and -711): 771 - 711 = 60 Now our equation looks like: 0 = -5*s - 7*s + 60 Next, let's add the parts with 's' together (it's like saying \\"I have -5 apples and -7 apples\\"): -5*s - 7*s = -12*s Now our equation looks like: 0 = -12*s + 60 To solve for 's', we want to move the 12*s to the other side of the equation. We will do that by adding 12*s to both sides: 0 + 12*s = 60 This simplifies to: 12*s = 60 Now, we just need to find out how many times 12 can fit into 60. If we divide both sides by 12, we can find the answer: s = 60 / 12 And when you do the division, you get: s = 5 So the answer is: s = 5"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who was commissioned to compose a score for the 1969 film, Battle of Britain? ?  In 1956 Walton sold his London house and took up full-time residence on Ischia. He built a hilltop house at Forio and called it La Mortella. Susana Walton created a magnificent garden there. Walton's other works of the 1950s include the music for a fourth Shakespeare film, Olivier's Richard III, and the Cello Concerto (1956), written for Gregor Piatigorsky, who gave the premiere in January 1957 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the conductor Charles Munch. Some critics felt that the concerto was old-fashioned; Peter Heyworth wrote that there was little in the work that would have startled an audience in the year the Titanic met its iceberg (1912). It has nevertheless entered the regular repertoire, performed by Paul Tortelier, Yo-Yo Ma, Lynn Harrell and Pierre Fournier among others. In 1966 Walton successfully underwent surgery for lung cancer. Until then he had been an inveterate pipe-smoker, but after the operation he never smoked again. While he was convalescing, he worked on a one-act comic opera, The Bear, which was premiered at Britten's Aldeburgh Festival, in June 1966, and enthusiastically received. Walton had become so used to being written off by music critics that he felt \\"there must be something wrong when the worms turned on some praise.\\" Walton received the Order of Merit in 1967, the fourth composer to be so honoured, after Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Britten.Walton's orchestral works of the 1960s include his Second Symphony (1960), Variations on a Theme by Hindemith (1963), Capriccio burlesco (1968), and Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten (1969). His song cycles from this period were composed for Peter Pears (Anon. in Love, 1960) and Schwarzkopf (A Song for the Lord Mayor's Table, 1962). He was commissioned to compose a score for the 1969 film Battle of Britain, but the film company rejected most of his score, replacing it with music by Ron Goodwin.

Positive Movie Review: Title: Interstellar (2014) Director: Christopher Nolan Starring: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan, is an ambitious sci-fi epic that manages to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat while exploring themes of love, sacrifice, and the human spirit. Set against the backdrop of a future Earth struggling with drought, famine, and the imminent extinction of humanity, the film follows former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) as he leads a group of scientists on a mission to find a habitable planet in a distant galaxy. One of the highlights of Interstellar is its stunning visuals. The film’s outer space settings are breathtaking, with meticulously designed shots of planets, black holes, and wormholes that are both beautiful and scientifically accurate. Equally impressive are the sets on Earth which depict a gritty, dust-choked world on the brink of collapse. Nolan's storytelling is a significant aspect of the film’s success, as it poses thought-provoking questions about our place in the universe and the nature of time. Furthermore, its non-linear storytelling structure adds a layer of complexity to the narrative, leaving the audience pondering the intricacies of the story long after the credits roll. The performances in Interstellar are equally commendable. Matthew McConaughey delivers a powerful and nuanced performance as Cooper, a father who must face the agonizing choice between saving his family and the entire human race. Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain offer strong supporting performances, adding depth and emotion to their respective roles. The entire cast works well together, creating a believable dynamic between the characters that further grounds the story in reality. Hans Zimmer's haunting and emotional score perfectly complements the film's visuals and emotional core. His use of traditional orchestral elements combined with innovative electronic sounds gives Interstellar a unique and mesmerizing sonic identity that further enhances the overall experience. In conclusion, Interstellar is a visually stunning, emotionally rich, and thought-provoking sci-fi epic that leaves a lasting impact on the viewer. Bolstered by exceptional performances and a captivating story, it's a testament to Christopher Nolan's prowess as both a director and storyteller. Interstellar is a must-watch for fans of science fiction and great cinema in general."},{"instruction":"How long ago was it…? It was a long time is all I know.

After we got situated in our hotel, we immediately headed off for the Mozart Plaza/Park. My family and I also visited other monuments that day: By the end of the day, our legs were worn out. We had rode so many trolleys and walked so much that I’m pretty sure that any longer and we would’ve collapsed on the spot. The bed never felt so good.

Lama Norbu and his fellow monks believe they have found a candidate of Dorje's reincarnation within a boy named Jesse Conrad (Alex Wiesendanger) in Seattle. While Jesse is fascinated with the monks and their way of life, his parents, Dean (Chris Isaak) and Lisa (Bridget Fonda), are wary, and that wariness turns into near-hostility when Norbu announces that he would like to take Jesse back with him to Bhutan to be tested. Jesse's father changes his mind however, after one of his close friends and colleagues commits suicide, seeming to realize that there could be more to life than work and money. He then decides to go to Bhutan with his son. In Nepal, two children who are also candidates are encountered, Raju (Rajuh Lal) and Gita (Greishma Makar Singh).In the story, the Lama Norbu relates Buddha's life story from a book entitled \\"Little Buddha,\\" which is also enacted as a story within the movie. In the story, a Hindu prince called Siddhartha sets on a journey to achieve his goal. Mara, a jealous demon, senses that Siddhartha (Keanu Reeves) is about to attain enlightenment and sends his daughters to distract him. Failing to do so, he attempts to shatter Siddharthas resolve and thus begins an onslaught of threats, intimidation and temptation. Mara summons a terrifying horde of monsters of every conceivable description but even something as horrific as this still leaves Siddhartha unmoved, unperturbed. Instead he transforms the weapons which these hosts throw at him into lotus petals which exude a lovely fragrance as they gently floated down to earth. Mara decides that Siddhartha will not deny himself and turns into his image in a reflection on a pool of water. Instead Siddhartha reaches and pulls the image out of the water.

Given the question: Process:  - A bird picks a spot high spot, often in a tree - The bird collects bits of sticks and grass - The sticks and grasses are placed between support branches - Leaves, mud and spider webs are added to the sticks - The mud, leaves and webs glue the sticks together - The solid nest supports the eggs -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more leaves are added to the nest happens, how will it affect more leaves will stick together.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of adding more leaves to the nest has an effect (both direct and indirect) on the process of nest-building.  Step-by-step justification: 1. Adding more leaves to the nest directly affects the composition of the nest. In this case, the nest will have a higher proportion of leaves compared to other materials like sticks, grass, mud, and spider webs. 2. As more leaves are added, they may stick together due to their natural surface properties and the presence of mud, which acts as an adhesive. This can make the nest denser and potentially stronger, providing better support for the eggs. 3. An indirect effect of adding more leaves is that it may affect the insulation properties of the nest. Leaves can provide extra insulation, helping to keep the eggs warm and protected from temperature fluctuations.  4. More leaves in the nest may also result in a longer time spent constructing the nest, as the bird will need to collect and arrange more materials. This can indirectly affect the bird's energy expenditure and the overall time available for other activities, such as foraging and mating. 5. Another indirect effect of adding more leaves is that it may alter the visual camouflage of the nest. Depending on the tree or location where the nest is built, more leaves could either make the nest less visible to predators or make it stand out more, potentially affecting the safety of the eggs and hatchlings. Based on these factors, it can be concluded that the supposed perturbation of adding more leaves to the nest does have direct and indirect effects on the nest-building process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That claim turned out not to be true, leading Rowling to delete her original tweets and apologize, Time and the Telegraph report. Rowling's original tweets (archived here) were based on an edited video of a July 24 press conference in which the young boy appeared to reach out to shake hands and Trump appeared to ignore him. But the full video—as many critics, including Piers Morgan, PolitiFact, and the boy's own mother, pointed out to Rowling—clearly shows Trump leaning down to talk to the boy and paying him quite a bit of attention. \\"Re: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proferred hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage, multiple sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction,\\" Rowling said in a series of tweets Monday. \\"I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly. These tweets will remain, but I will delete the previous ones on the subject.\\" Rowling did not address her apology to Trump himself, whom she's called worse than Voldemort. Expand this summary.","output":"In July 2017, British author JK Rowling found herself amidst a controversy surrounding an edited video clip that allegedly showed President Trump ignoring a young boy in a wheelchair during a press conference on July 24. Rowling, who has been vocal about her opposition to Trump in the past, took to Twitter to call out the President's supposed refusal to shake the boy's hand. The series of tweets from Rowling, which have since been archived, were based on this edited video that appeared to show the child reaching out for a handshake with Trump, while the President seemingly ignored him. However, the reality of the situation was different, as the unedited version of the video, as well as testimonies from multiple sources including Piers Morgan, PolitiFact, and the boy's mother, revealed that President Trump actually leaned down to talk to the boy and paid him quite a bit of attention. Upon realizing her mistake and after facing backlash for her tweets, Rowling issued an apology. She explained in a new series of tweets, \\"Re: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proferred hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage, multiple sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction.\\" Acknowledging her assumptions, Rowling added, \\"I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly.\\" In her apology, Rowling stated that she would leave her apology tweets up but would delete the previous ones related to the incorrect claims. It should be noted that Rowling's apology did not directly address President Trump, whom she has strongly criticized in the past, even going as far as comparing him to the fictional villain, Voldemort, from her Harry Potter series. This incident and the subsequent uproar that ensued raised questions about the importance of verifying information before sharing it, especially when it concerns public figures like President Trump. Individuals with large followings, such as JK Rowling, can inadvertently spread misinformation which can lead to divisiveness and misunderstandings. The Rowling-Trump controversy ultimately highlights the essential need for fact-checking, especially in today's fast-paced world of social media and digital content sharing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tennessee furnished more soldiers for the Confederate Army than any other state, and more soldiers for the Union Army than any other Southern state. Beginning during Reconstruction, it had competitive party politics, but a Democratic takeover in the late 1880s resulted in passage of disfranchisement laws that excluded most blacks and many poor whites from voting. This sharply reduced competition in politics in the state until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century.

Is this product review positive? Title: Wanted to LOVE this toy Review: I bought two of these for my 3 year old and 6 year old girls. They look like the cutest things ever, and as a child, I loved helping my mom crack real eggs to cook, so I thought my kids would love these. They are nearly impossible to pry open, even for me. I'm not exaggerating, I'm a very strong person, but can barely get them opened once in a while. Because they are so hard to open, my kids used their mouths, trying to pry them open...the metal bent, the paint scratched off...I ended up throwing the shell part away b/c I was worried about them getting hurt with them. I love the idea, but some tweaking is definitely needed to make this a better product. I feel it was a total waste of my money. :( Answer: The answer is:","output":"No, the product review is not positive.  The reviewer starts by expressing their initial excitement and anticipation for the product, mentioning how they were attracted to the cute appearance of the toy and how they thought their children would enjoy playing with them. However, their enthusiasm quickly turns into disappointment as they describe their negative experiences with the product.  The main issue the reviewer faces is the difficulty in opening the toy. They emphasize that even they, as a strong adult, struggle to pry the toy open, let alone their young children. This frustration leads the reviewer to explain how their children resorted to using their mouths to open the toy, which unfortunately led to further issues, such as potential harm from the metal bending and paint scratching off. The reviewer acknowledges that the concept behind the toy could be appealing and fun, but the poor execution and lack of usability make the product difficult to enjoy. They express their dissatisfaction with the purchase, ultimately saying that it was a waste of their money. As a result, the overall tone of the review is negative, indicating that the reviewer did not have a positive experience with the product and cannot recommend it to others. Some adjustments to the design and functionality are suggested as necessary improvements to make the product more enjoyable and user-friendly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Curved Air are a pioneering English progressive rock group formed in 1970 by musicians from mixed artistic backgrounds, including classical, folk, and electronic sound. The resulting sound of the band was a mixture of progressive rock, folk rock, and fusion with classical elements. Along with High Tide and East of Eden, Curved Air were one of the first rock bands after It's a Beautiful Day and the United States of America to feature a violin. Curved Air released eight studio albums, the first three of which broke the UK Top 20, and had a hit single with \\"Back Street Luv\\" (1971) which reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. However, Darryl Way and Sonja Kristina remained interested in working together, and so Way brought in two more \\"Car Thieves\\", guitarist Mick Jacques and drummer Stewart Copeland. Though more members of this new lineup came from Stark Naked and the Car Thieves than Curved Air (Kristina being the only member not from the former band), they decided to adopt the Curved Air name for the same reasons that the Kristina/Wedgwood-led band had. With Darryl Way at the helm, this new band often employed the same classical and folk influences as the original band (and even played some of the original band's songs at their shows), but their core sound was rooted in pop, rhythm and blues, and hard rock. Miles Copeland III, still serving as Curved Air's manager, put the group on his own label, BTM.  The band kicked off with a European tour, which started poorly. Way, a notorious perfectionist, grew impatient with the struggling of his bandmates, especially novice drummer Copeland. Then, for reasons no one could pinpoint, the musicians suddenly \\"clicked\\" with each other and the band caught fire, quickly becoming a popular and acclaimed live act.  Their studio efforts were another story, however. Phil Kohn left and the band, unable to replace him in time for the sessions for Midnight Wire, relied on guest musicians to play both bass (John G Perry) and keyboards (Peter Wood). Norma Tager, a friend of Kristina's, penned the lyrics to the \\"Midnight Wire\\" songs. Kohn was later replaced by Tony Reeves, formerly of Colosseum and Greenslade, but the recording sessions for both Midnight Wire and 1976's Airborne were expensive and highly stressful for everyone involved. Both albums - as well as \\"Desiree\\", a single drawn from Airborne - failed to break the charts.  Citing dissatisfaction with BTM Records' inability to support Curved Air financially, Way departed. Though Alex Richman from the Butts Band stepped in on keyboards, the loss of the band's de facto leader was a blow. This line-up's last-ditch attempt at a hit single, a cover version of \\"Baby Please Don't Go\\", was another flop. After months of gradually losing steam, Curved Air broke up so quietly that, by Sonja Kristina's recollections, most of the music press wrote off the band's absence as a \\"sabbatical\\". Copeland formed The Police, Reeves returned to work as a producer and played in semi-pro band Big Chief along with Jacques, and Kristina and Way both pursued solo careers. Kristina and Copeland maintained the close personal relationship they'd formed while bandmates and were married in 1982. Entity:","output":"Curved Air"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Taking into account that C4c is deeply rooted in the Asian portion of the mtDNA phylogeny and is indubitably of Asian origin, the finding that C4c and X2a are characterized by parallel genetic histories definitively dismisses the controversial hypothesis of an Atlantic glacial entry route into North America.\\" Q: Because C4c and X2a are characterized by parallel genetic histories means what controversial hypothesis may be dismissed?","output":"Imagine there are two big families called C4c and X2a who lived a very, very long time ago. Both of these families have similarities in their ages and where they used to live. Scientists believe these two families came from different parts of the world but ended up in the Americas. Some people thought there was a special path across the ocean called the \\"Atlantic glacial entry route\\" that helped people get to America. But, because the families C4c and X2a have such similar stories and C4c was definitely from Asia, scientists now think that this ocean path idea is not true. So, the controversial hypothesis, or idea, that can be dismissed is the \\"Atlantic glacial entry route.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Build a movie plot around this: Why were there auditions to replace Georgia? She was pregnant. The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: A Song for Georgia Genre: Drama, Comedy, Music Step 1: Introduce Georgia and her passion for music The movie opens with Georgia (early 30s), a talented singer and prominent member of a successful band called \\"Whistling Harmony.\\" She is shown thoroughly enjoying being on the stage, singing her heart out, and entertaining the crowd. The band members and Georgia have developed a sibling-like bond, and the audience loves their performances.  Step 2: Present Georgia's life-changing news One day, after a concert, Georgia discovers that she is pregnant. While she and her partner are thrilled about the news, Georgia is hesitant to share it with the band members. She worries that this might affect the band's future performances and tours, as she won't be able to continue giving her best in the coming months. Step 3: Band members learn about Georgia's pregnancy A few weeks pass, and Georgia's absence from band practice becomes more frequent due to pregnancy-related health issues. Eventually, the band members notice the changes in Georgia and realize that she is pregnant. While they express their happiness for her, they also understand the potential impact on the band's performance schedule. Step 4: Decision to organize auditions After a group discussion, the band members reluctantly decide that they need to find a temporary replacement for Georgia to ensure the continuity of their performances. They announce auditions for a new singer, assuring Georgia that her spot in the band is secure, and they only need a temporary stand-in. Step 5: Introduce the main supporting character - Annie At the auditions, a young and talented singer named Annie gives an impressive performance, capturing the attention of the band members. They offer her the opportunity to replace Georgia temporarily, and she eagerly accepts the offer. As she joins the band, she develops a friendship with Georgia, who offers her support and guidance on working with the band.  Step 6: Annie's strive to success Initially, fans of the band express their disappointment with Georgia's absence, but Annie's talent and determination eventually win their hearts. The band continues to perform well, and Georgia, although dealing with mixed emotions, remains supportive of Annie. Step 7: The turning point As Georgia's due date approaches, complications arise with her pregnancy, requiring her to be on bedrest for a prolonged period. Georgia misses the band and starts to feel even more isolated, experiencing a sense of loss and fear of being replaced permanently. Step 8: Annie's loyalty and reassurance Annie visits Georgia at home, comforting her and reassuring her that her place in the band is irreplaceable. She suggests that they write a song together, which they title \\"A Song for Georgia,\\" a tribute to Georgia's passion for music and her invaluable contribution to the band. Step 9: Climax - The emotional performance Finally, on the night of Georgia's return to the stage, the band performs \\"A Song for Georgia,\\" now a hit single, with Georgia and Annie singing it together. The audience gives a standing ovation, and Georgia finally rediscovers her confidence, joy, and passion for music. Step 10: Ending The movie ends with Georgia returning to the band and juggling her new responsibilities as a mother. Annie, grateful for the opportunity, pursues her solo career as a singer-songwriter, thankful for the lessons she learned along the way. The answer to the question is: There were auditions to replace Georgia because her pregnancy resulted in health complications and an inability to continue performing, thus requiring a temporary replacement for the band to continue its schedule without setbacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are over 48,900 poems penned by some 2,200 Tang authors that have survived until modern times. Skill in the composition of poetry became a required study for those wishing to pass imperial examinations, while poetry was also heavily competitive; poetry contests amongst guests at banquets and courtiers were common. Poetry styles that were popular in the Tang included gushi and jintishi, with the renowned poet Li Bai (701–762) famous for the former style, and poets like Wang Wei (701–761) and Cui Hao (704–754) famous for their use of the latter. Jintishi poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line stanzas or seven characters per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the antithesis is often lost in translation to other languages). Tang poems remained popular and great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song dynasty; in that period, Yan Yu (嚴羽; active 1194–1245) was the first to confer the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713–766) era with \\"canonical status within the classical poetic tradition.\\" Yan Yu reserved the position of highest esteem among all Tang poets for Du Fu (712–770), who was not viewed as such in his own era, and was branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.The Classical Prose Movement was spurred in large part by the writings of Tang authors Liu Zongyuan (773–819) and Han Yu (768–824). This new prose style broke away from the poetry tradition of the piantiwen (騙體文, \\"parallel prose\\") style begun in the Han dynasty. Although writers of the Classical Prose Movement imitated piantiwen, they criticized it for its often vague content and lack of colloquial language, focusing more on clarity and precision to make their writing more direct. This guwen (archaic prose) style can be traced back to Han Yu, and would become largely associated with orthodox Neo-Confucianism.Short story fiction and tales were also popular during the Tang, one of the... contains an answer for the question: What authors used a writing style that broke away from the style started during the Han dynasty?, what is it ?

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"In order to answer this question, let's first break down the steps and analyze if a less strong negative charge could potentially affect any stage in the butterfly life cycle process. 1. The butterfly starts as an egg: At this stage, there is no indication that a less strong negative charge would have a direct impact on the egg. 2. The egg hatches to form a larva, also called a caterpillar: Similarly, at this stage, it is not clear how a less strong negative charge would directly affect the hatching of an egg into a caterpillar. 3. The caterpillar molts (loses its skin) many times as it grows: Molting is primarily a biological process, and it is not evident that a less strong negative charge would influence this process. 4. The caterpillar then forms itself into a pupa, or chrysalis: Once again, this is a biological process that is not clearly affected by a less strong negative charge. 5. The caterpillar in the chrysalis begins to change, a process called metamorphosis: During this stage, it is not apparent that a less strong negative charge would have a direct influence on metamorphosis. 6. The caterpillar completes its metamorphosis and has turned into a butterfly: As metamorphosis is a complex biological process, it is not evident that a less strong negative charge would directly affect this transformation. 7. The adult butterfly emerges out of the chrysalis and flies away: At this stage, it remains unclear how a less strong negative charge would affect the adult butterfly as it emerges and flies away. Based on the analysis of each step in the process, it appears that a less strong negative charge does not have a direct effect on any stage of the butterfly life cycle process. However, the perturbation hypothesis may have an indirect effect on the process. A less strong negative charge might potentially affect the environment or the butterfly's food resources, predators, or other interdependent species, which could consequently impact the butterfly population. These indirect effects would need to be further studied to determine if they have any influence on the number of butterflies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: William Charles Lunalilo was born on January 31, 1835 in a two-story house made of coral brick, an area known as Pohukaina, now part the grounds of the \`Iolani Palace in Honolulu. His mother was High Chiefess Miriam Auhea Kekauluohi (later styled as Ka\`ahumanu III) and his father was High Chief Charles Kana\`ina. He was grandnephew of Kamehameha I by blood and the monarch's stepson by marriage to his mother. His grandmother was Kalakua Kaheiheimalie, sister of Kamehameha's favorite wife, Queen Ka\`ahumanu. Context: When Lunalilo assumed the duties of the king, a huge change in the government's policy began to form. His predecessor, Kamehameha V, had spent his reign increasing the powers of his office and trying to restore the absolute monarchy of his grandfather, Kamehameha I. Lunalilo, however, spent his reign trying to make the Hawaiian government more democratic. He started by writing to the legislature, recommending that the constitution be amended. He wanted to undo some changes that his predecessor had made when he enacted the 1864 Constitution.  For example, the Kingdom legislature prior to 1864 met in two houses: The House of Nobles and the House of Representatives. The members of the House of Nobles were appointed by the King and the Representatives were elected by popular vote. Lunalilo served in the House of Nobles from 1863 through 1872. Under King Kamehameha V, the two houses of legislature were combined into one. Lunalilo wished to restore the bicameral legislature. He also wanted to add a provision to the constitution that required the king to include a written explanation to accompany any veto by the king. He wanted cabinet ministers to be heard in the House of Representatives.  The King also wanted to improve Hawaii's economic situation. The Kingdom was in an economic depression, with the whaling industry rapidly declining. Commerce groups asked the king to look at sugar to improve the economy and recommended that a treaty be drawn with the United States to allow Hawaiian sugar to enter the nation tax-free. To make such a treaty, many thought that the Kingdom would have to offer the Pearl Harbor area to the United States in exchange. There was much controversy over this, with both the public and in the legislature. When Lunalilo saw this opposition, he dropped the proposal.  During Lunalilo's reign, a mutiny took place in the small Hawaiian army. Some members of the army revolted against the drillmaster and the adjutant general. The king interviewed the troops involved in the mutiny and he persuaded them to lay down their arms. Following this, the king disbanded the army. From that point on, the Kingdom had no armed forces until King Kalakaua restored them. Question: What else is significant about him being king? Answer:","output":"Lunalilo was a special king because he wanted to make things fair for everyone in Hawaii. He tried to change the way the government worked to make it more democratic, which means giving people a chance to share their opinions and have a say in how things are run. He also cared about Hawaii's economy and tried to find new ways to make money for the kingdom, like focusing on sugar instead of whaling. Even though he faced challenges, like disagreements over Pearl Harbor and a rebellion in the military, he was a patient and kind leader who listened to others. This makes him an important and memorable king in Hawaiian history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the solution? Solve 0 = -11*r - 15 + 59 for r.","output":"To solve the given equation, 0 = -11*r - 15 + 59, for the variable r, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation. First, combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation. The equation becomes: 0 = -11*r + 44 Step 2: Isolate the variable term. In order to isolate the variable term (in this case, -11*r), add 11*r to both sides of the equation to eliminate it from the right side. This will give you: 11*r = 44 Step 3: Solve for the variable. Now, to find the value of r, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of r, which is -11 in this equation. This will give you: r = 44 / 11 Step 4: Simplify the result. Divide 44 by 11 to find the value of r: r = 4 So the solution to the equation 0 = -11*r - 15 + 59 is r = 4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery in the forest behind the Creeds' new home. On his first day at work, Louis meets Victor Pascow, a jogger who is brought in with severe injuries from a car accident.

Answer a question about this article: In 1963, the teenage Brian May and his father custom-built his signature guitar Red Special, which was purposely designed to feedback. Sonic experimentation figured heavily in Queen's songs. A distinctive characteristic of Queen's music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of May, Mercury, and Taylor best heard on the studio albums A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races. Some of the ground work for the development of this sound can be attributed to their former producer Roy Thomas Baker, and their engineer Mike Stone. Besides vocal harmonies, Queen were also known for multi-tracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdubs. For instance, according to Brian May, there are over 180 vocal overdubs in \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". The band's vocal structures have been compared with the Beach Boys, but May stated they were not \\"much of an influence\\". What engineer helped with Queen's feedback heavy sound?","output":"The engineer who helped with Queen's feedback heavy sound was Mike Stone.  This is determined by drawing the connection from the text that specifies Mike Stone worked alongside Roy Thomas Baker, the band's former producer, in laying the groundwork for the development of Queen's distinct sound. Mike Stone is not directly credited with the feedback heavy sound, but his role as their engineer implies his significant involvement in the technical aspects of their music production, which would include creating and managing such sonic characteristics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For the past 6-7 months, I noticed their truck don't make rounds to various area of Vegas like they used to, especially since they opened a restaurant in northwest and with a new one coming in southwest.

Their juicy delicious sliders are now replaced by their stale buns and dried patty. Their customer service kinda lost the friendliness that I used to see from them.

On the outside, it appears that Roman has the perfect life: a loving wife, a successful career, and good friends. His best friend, a witty lawyer named Scott, often teases him about his seemingly perfect life. One evening, Roman returns home early from a canceled business meeting to find his wife's phone left on the kitchen counter. Noticing an incoming text message, he picks it up, only to find a message that reads, \\"I miss you. Can't wait to see you again soon.\\" The message is from a number he doesn't recognize. Act 2: Roman becomes increasingly suspicious about Veronica's behavior. Over the next few days, Roman keeps an eye on his wife and notices numerous phone calls and text messages from her \\"new friend.\\" He also discovers receipts from romantic dinners and hotel stays, which leads him to the undeniable truth that Veronica is having an affair. Consumed with a mix of anger and betrayal, Roman confides in Scott, who advises him to approach Veronica directly.

It featured the singles \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" and \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\", both of which reached number one in the US. After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles, Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" be released as a single, and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one. The album topped the Billboard 200 for five weeks, and sold over four million copies in the US. It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album. Heretofore, their albums featured a distinctive \\"No Synthesisers!\\" sleeve note.

In September 1980, Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden. In 1980, Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for Flash Gordon. At the 1981 American Music Awards in January, \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single, and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band, Duo, or Group.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Coral Polge is a person who has provided comfort to thousands. She has a remarkable talent which may prove the survival of the human spirit after death, for Coral is a medium who draws the portraits of spirits who contact her.        Coral, whose parents were spiritualists, was brought up in Harrow, North London, where she attended a local spiritualist church. She studied art at the local college, where she specialized in textile design. Even though, at the time, she wasn't very good at drawing portraits, she met a medium who told her she would be a psychic  artist.        She doesn't actually see the dead nor are her hands controlled by the spirits; instead she 'feels' them coming through. Early in her career she drew the portraits of 'spirit guides' from whom she had received help. These portraits of guides, who included Red Indians, nuns and monks, were remarkable, yet could have been attributed to the working of a strong imagination. She also drew portraits by holding on to letters that had been written by people who had since died.        Coral says, 'I know exactly what to draw without thinking about it. It's involuntary, like breathing or walking.' Not only are her portraits a good likeness but she sketches her subjects in clothes they would have worn in life.        Coral has displayed her talent at public meetings around the world. At one gathering there was a woman whose grandfather had just died. Her name was Phyllis Timms. Coral made a sketch of a man who had a long moustache and Phyllis recognized the man as her grandfather. However, she was reluctant to acknowledge the portrait without extra proof. Coral then said that the colour green was a link with the man whom she had drawn. Mrs Timms, whose maiden name had been Green, understood the significance of the comment and claimed the portrait.        There are some people for whom this is evidence of survival from beyond the grave. Others, who have their reservations, may put it down to an extraordinary kind of extrasensory perception . Whatever... Options: A she could see the spirits. B she learned it from college. C she had a strong imagination. D she was gifted to feel the spirits. Answer: D she was gifted to feel the spirits. Question:","output":"Question: According to the article, how does Coral Polge interact with spirits during her psychic artistry? A. She could see the spirits. B. She learned it from college. C. She had a strong imagination. D. She was gifted to feel the spirits. Justification: The question follows the information given in the article. Answer option 'A' is incorrect because Coral mentioned she doesn't 'see' the dead. Option 'B' is not accurate because, although Coral studied art in college, her psychic connection with spirits was not mentioned as part of her course. Option 'C' could be misleading as the article says her portraits could be attributed to a strong imagination, but this isn't how she contacts the spirits. Finally, option 'D' is the correct answer because the article says she 'feels' the spirits coming through, this communicates her unique talent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It would have to be this… Donald Trump once cashed a 0.13 check… In 1990, writer from a “Spy Magazine” had a great idea for a prank: “What would happen if you sent checks for small amounts to celebrities and saw who cashed them, putting to test the theory that every man (and woman) has a price? In their words: \\"We could however, send them checks for minuscule sums of money—sums so small they couldn’t fund as much as a minute of the recipients’ existence—and see who would bother to bank these teensy amounts of money.\\" Spy thought \\"some subterfuge\\" would be necessary—it'd be suspicious to get a check from the magazine that lampooned so many of the intended recipients. This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for 0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump.

The yeti was captured in the Himalayas and brought to the town as an old man′s sideshow, but had escaped, and is reportedly the last of its kind. Each night, Debra, one of its members, lures young men to the cult with the intention of offering it up to the yeti as a means of keeping it sexually sated. The movie opens up with such an example, with Debra and Raymond, the cult′s leader, looking on while laughing sadistically. Five college students—fraternity brothers Adam and Dick, their girlfriends Sally and Emily, and a fifth member named Joe—are coming to Quatssack on a camping trip, unaware of the town′s secrets. On their first night, Joe is killed while going to the bathroom in the woods, and since he was the one who had the car keys, the remaining four cannot leave town. The old man, who now owns a hideous-looking creature called \\"Tentacle Boy\\" and displays it as a sideshow, informs them of the yeti that he used to own now living somewhere in the woods. Emily goes into a nearby church to pray for Joe′s safety, and while she is in there, she is discovered by a priest as a \\"Chosen One\\" that was prophesied to take down the Children of the Yeti. She accepts her destiny, and the priest gives her supplies for her mission. Meanwhile, Adam, Dick, and Sally, who are waiting for Emily outside, are ambushed by a redneck demanding the whereabouts of the Chosen One. Emily emerges from the church and shoots the redneck with a crossbow, and despite his seemingly near-fatal wound, demands that the redneck take them to the cult′s location. Only Adam and Emily follow the redneck; Sally is sent back to their campsite, while Dick had left earlier, having met Debra. contains an answer for the question: Who is discovered by a priest?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The person who is discovered by a priest in the movie narrative provided in the article is Emily. From the richly detailed plot, it is clear that the group of college students are faced with navigating through the eerie, hidden truths of the town of Quatssack. This unexpected journey takes a turn when their companion, Joe, is tragically killed, leaving the surviving quartet stranded in the town due to his possession of the car keys. As they grapple with their predicament, Emily, one of the girls in the group, seeks comfort and solace in a church. This scene sets up a crucial plot twist. During her time praying for Joe’s safety in the church, she is discovered by a priest. This encounter, however, is far from a coincidental meet-and-greet. The priest identifies Emily as the prophesied \\"Chosen One\\". According to the prophecy, the Chosen One is destined to confront and take down the Children of the Yeti, the evil cult that terrorizes the town and worships a yeti. Recognizing her pivotal role, the priest equips Emily with the supplies necessary for her destined mission. This revelation not only signals a role reversal for Emily, shifting from a simple college student to a cult-confronting heroine, but it also paves the way for what forms the crux of the succeeding events in the movie plot. Emily's discovery by the priest, therefore, structures an important turning point in the narrative, as she transforms from a casual visitor of Quatssack to a figure of prophetic importance in the town's survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition to Dr. Smith's kidnapping, the city is plagued by a series of unsolved murders that seem to be linked to a mysterious figure simply known as \\"Claude.\\" Whilst investigating the case, Marc Anthony finds Dr. Smith's last research notes, which describe a groundbreaking technology with the potential to revolutionize the way humans perceive reality. Together with his new partner, Detective Elise Walker (played by Emily Blunt), Marc works tirelessly to unravel the web of secrets that surround the object of their investigation, Claude. As time runs out, and with the city growing increasingly restless due to the ongoing crimes, Marc stumbles upon a possible lead. He attends a secret underground gathering organized by a mysterious group that seeks to profit from the chaos suffocating the city. As the detectives blend into the crowd, they're both shocked to discover Claude (played by Edward Norton) blindfolded, seemingly at ease in the dimly lit room. Claude, not aware of Marc's presence, reveals that he is a victim himself. He was once a world-class magician able to manipulate reality to his advantage, but after a failed experiment using Dr. Smith's cutting-edge technology, his powers spiraled out of control. Now, blindfolded to protect himself and others from his unpredictable abilities, Claude has been coerced into serving a powerful criminal mastermind known only as \\"The Puppeteer\\" (played by Gary Oldman). The Puppeteer is determined to use both Claude's abilities and Dr. Smith's research to cause unprecedented mayhem in the city, in order to discredit the law enforcement and establish a new, powerful criminal empire. As Marc and Elise work to dismantle the organization, they ultimately convince Claude to collaborate with them. With the combined efforts of law enforcement and Claude's troubled magic, they take down The Puppeteer and reclaim their city from the powerful entity that threatened to leapfrog it to a point of no return. At the end of the film, Marc and Elise successfully release Claude from his blindfold and help him find a way to harness his powers for good, but not before they learn a thing or two about the mysteries of the reality they took for granted.

Bacteria: These processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". How can anaerobes adjust to the surrounding environment?","output":"Anaerobes can adjust to the surrounding environment by switching between different metabolic pathways and utilizing various terminal electron acceptors depending on the conditions they encounter. In the case of facultative anaerobes, these organisms can transition between aerobic respiration and anaerobic processes, such as fermentation, based on the availability of oxygen. When oxygen is present, facultative anaerobes utilize aerobic respiration, a process that involves the use of oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain to generate energy in the form of ATP. This is the most efficient way to derive energy from organic molecules. However, when oxygen is lacking or absent in the environment, facultative anaerobes switch to anaerobic processes like fermentation. During fermentation, organic molecules, such as pyruvate, serve as terminal electron acceptors, and energy is produced in a less efficient manner than aerobic respiration. The by-products of fermentation, which can include ethanol or lactic acid, depending on the organism, are secreted as waste. In summary, anaerobes, particularly facultative anaerobes, can adjust to their surrounding environment by altering their metabolic pathways and utilizing diverse terminal electron acceptors based on the availability of oxygen and other environmental factors.

Republicans oppose this, remember?”      “Instead, we support competition on a level playing field, remember? Because we know special interest crony capitalism is on big fail.”      Just ahead of Trump’s formal announcement of the deal at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Carrier would receive 7 million in tax breaks over 10 years in order to keep the 1,100 jobs in Indiana.      \\"However well meaning, burdensome federal government imposition is never the solution.

Foundational to our exceptional nation’s sacred private property rights, a business must have freedom to locate where it wishes. In a free market, if a business makes a mistake (including a marketing mistake that perhaps Carrier executives made), threatening to move elsewhere claiming efficiency’s sake, then the market’s invisible hand punishes. Thankfully, that same hand rewards, based on good business decisions.      But this time-tested truth assumes we’re operating on a level playing field.      When government steps in arbitrarily with individual subsidies, favoring one business over others, it sets inconsistent, unfair, illogical precedent. Meanwhile, the invisible hand that best orchestrates a free people’s free enterprise system gets amputated. Then, special interests creep in and manipulate markets. Republicans oppose this, remember? Instead, we support competition on a level playing field, remember? Because we know special interest crony capitalism is one big fail.      Politicians picking and choosing recipients of corporate welfare is railed against by fiscal conservatives, for it’s a hallmark of corruption. And socialism. The Obama Administration dealt in it in spades. Recall Solyndra, Stimulus boondoggles, and all their other taxpayer-subsidized anchors on our economy. A 20 trillion debt-ridden country can’t afford this sinfully stupid practice, so vigilantly guard against its continuance, or we’re doomed.      Reaganites learned it is POLICY change that changes economic trajectory. Reagan’s successes were built on establishing a fiscal framework that invigorated our entire economy, revitalized growth and investment while decreasing spending, tax rates, over-reaching regulations, unemployment, and favoritism via individual subsidies. We need Reaganites in the new Administration.      However well meaning, burdensome federal government imposition is never the solution. Never. Not in our homes, not in our schools, not in churches, not in businesses.      Gotta’ have faith the Trump team knows all this. And I’ll be the first to acknowledge concerns over a deal cut by leveraging taxpayer interests to make a manufacturer stay put are unfounded – once terms are made public.      But know that fundamentally, political intrusion using a stick or carrot to bribe or force one individual business to do what politicians insist, versus establishing policy incentivizing our ENTIRE ethical economic engine to roar back to life, isn’t the answer. Cajole only chosen ones on Main St or Wall St and watch lines stretch from Washington to Alaska full of businesses threatening to bail unless taxpayers pony up. The lines strangle competition and really, really, dispiritingly screw with workers’ lives. It’s beyond unacceptable, so let’s anticipate equal incentivizes and positive reform all across the field – to make the economy great again.      -Sarah Palin ||||| Summary:","output":"Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin has criticised President-elect Donald Trump’s deal with air conditioning firm Carrier as an example of “crony capitalism” and a “hallmark of corruption and socialism” in an op-ed in Young Conservatives.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to when presenting a case before the supreme court. approximately how long does each side have??","output":"In the United States, when presenting a case before the Supreme Court, each side is typically granted a limited amount of time to present their arguments. The conventional duration is 30 minutes for each party. This time allocation ensures that the justices have enough time to thoughtfully consider the issue under review and allows both sides to concisely address their main points. It is important to note that in addition to the allocated 30 minutes, the justices may ask questions and engage in discussion with the attorneys that can extend the length of the oral arguments. This constant exchange between the parties enables the justices to better understand the issues at play and foster a robust and constructive conversation. However, the Supreme Court may occasionally allot a different amount of time for specific cases if the Court believes that the complexity of the case warrants more or less time. Before the oral arguments take place, both petitioner (party who is seeking Supreme Court's review) and respondent (party who opposes review) must submit briefs that provide a detailed explanation of their position in the case. These briefs give the justices an opportunity to review the arguments in depth before the oral arguments session. Sometimes, even third-party groups or individuals, often referred to as \\"friends of the court\\" or amici curiae, submit briefs offering additional information or perspective on the issues at hand. After the conclusion of oral arguments, the Supreme Court deliberates in private and issues its ruling, which may take days, weeks, or even months depending on the complexity and considerations involved in the case. This final decision, along with the opinions of the justices, is published and has a far-reaching impact on the nation's legal landscape. Therefore, to sum up, when presenting a case before the Supreme Court, each side is usually granted 30 minutes for oral arguments. However, the time can be adjusted based on the complexity of the case and at the discretion of the Court. The justices may actively participate by asking questions and engaging in discussions, extending the overall length of the oral arguments session. Moreover, the submitted briefs and the final decision process help shape the outcome of the case and further contribute to its possible implications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: The American Dream has become making movies. Hypothesis: Making movies is now the American Dream, said the governor. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. In this case, let us first define both the terms - premise and hypothesis - and then elaborate on whether the statement above reflects an entailed relationship between them. A premise refers to a proposition or statement from which another statement or conclusion is inferred or follows as a logical consequence, often as part of an argument or reasoning process. A hypothesis, on the other hand, is a proposed explanation or assumption made on the basis of limited evidence, serving as a starting point for further investigation. In this context, a hypothesis can be seen as a conclusion that is drawn from the given premise. In the given statements, Premise: The American Dream has become making movies. Hypothesis: Making movies is now the American Dream, said the governor. We can see that the hypothesis is a rephrased version of the premise, with the added information of its attribution to the governor. The hypothesis clearly follows from the premise as a logical consequence. The premise suggests that the concept of the American Dream has evolved to the point where making movies represents that aspiration. The hypothesis, which states that \\"making movies is now the American Dream\\" mirrors this notion by asserting the same idea. Furthermore, the mention of the governor adds credibility to the statement, as it implies that this belief is recognized or endorsed by a figure of authority. In summary, the premise does entail the hypothesis, as the hypothesis presents a logical and coherent conclusion based on the information provided in the premise. In this case, the hypothesis reinforces the idea of the evolving American Dream and attributes it to a source that grants the statement a certain degree of credibility. Therefore, we can conclude that the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The given equation is -11 = p - 6. Step 2: Observe the given equation. In the equation -11 = p - 6, we are supposed to find the value of p. The objective is to isolate the variable and make p the subject of the formula. Step 3: Isolate the variable. The given equation is -11 = p - 6. Let's isolate p by adding 6 to both sides of the equation. By doing this, we cancel out the -6 on the right side of the equation, and in turn, we get the following equation: -11 + 6 = p - 6 + 6 Now, simplify the equation: -5 = p Step 4: Write the solution. So, the solution to the equation -11 = p - 6 is p = -5. This means that when the value of p is -5, the equation holds true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Born on April 30, 1912, Kroggel made his mark in the world of fencing, a sport that requires a combination of speed, strategy, and agility. Fencing has a long history, with its origins dating back to ancient civilizations. The modern sport of fencing consists of three disciplines: foil, épée, and sabre. Each discipline has its own set of rules, equipment, and techniques. Erwin Kroggel specialized in the épée event, which is characterized by its heavier sword and the ability to score points via hits on the opponent's entire body. The individual épée event at the 1952 Summer Olympics, held in Helsinki, Finland, was one of several Olympic fencing events designed to test the skill, strength, and determination of competitors. The event featured a men's individual épée competition, where fencers from around the world gathered to showcase their talents and vie for Olympic glory. In the lead-up to the 1952 Summer Olympics, Erwin Kroggel would have undoubtedly trained tirelessly to refine his technique, improve his fitness, and study his opponents. Fencing bout strategies require a blend of both physical and mental discipline, often involving careful observation of opponents and the ability to adapt tactics on the fly. Despite Kroggel's efforts and accomplishments in the sport of fencing, details surrounding his specific performance at the 1952 Summer Olympics are limited. Nevertheless, his participation in such a prestigious and competitive event serves as a testament to his abilities, dedication, and determination as an athlete. In summary, the text about Erwin Kroggel refers to the category of \\"athlete,\\" highlighting his achievements and contribution to the sport of fencing, particularly in the épée discipline. His participation in the 1952 Summer Olympics further establishes his status as an athlete of notable skill and determination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The first step in the process of oxygen entering the body is the lungs expanding. This occurs as a result of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contracting, which increases the volume of the thoracic cavity and decreases the pressure inside it. This pressure difference causes air from outside the body to be drawn into the lungs through the mouth or nose, down the trachea, and into the bronchi and bronchioles, ultimately reaching the alveoli.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue the following story. Mary scoffed at Jane's new hat, but was jealous of Jane's new watch, because Mary yearned for the","output":"time when she, too, had a stunning accessory that she could boast about. It had been far too long since she'd treated herself to something exquisite, as a string of unfortunate events left her strapped for cash and desperate for some sort of change in her life. As the gossip filled the air, Mary knew this was the perfect opportunity to rekindle the subtle rivalry they had maintained throughout the years. The envy that seethed inside her as she watched Jane flaunt her new hat and watch urged her to seek out a piece that would surely outshine Jane's entire collection of accessories. Later that evening, Mary prepared a detailed plan to track down a showstopping piece she'd heard whispers about: the famed and elusive Red Phoenix Diamond. Rumors swirled that this exceptional gemstone was cursed, but Mary decided to put aside her superstitions for the opportunity to make a statement and outdo Jane. Little did she know, the Red Phoenix Diamond was more than just a myth. The following day, Mary embarked on her quest. She began her search in one of the many antique shops littering her city, thinking that such a mysterious and valuable item would likely be hidden in plain sight. After scouring numerous boutiques and corner stores, Mary eventually found herself standing outside the door of the least known and most impenetrable of establishments: The Black Cat Antique Shop. With a deep breath, she pushed open the door and the thick scent of musty books and dust enveloped her. Undeterred, Mary carefully combed through every nook and cranny, but the Red Phoenix Diamond seemed to elude her grasp. Just as she was about to admit defeat and leave, she spotted a man in a corner, shrouded in shadows. He stood too still to be just another patron, and his eyes seemed to follow her like a hawk stalking its prey. Driven by curiosity and desperation, Mary approached the shadowy figure and mustered the courage to speak. \\"I'm looking for something extraordinary, a treasure like no other,\\" she said, hesitating only briefly, \\"the Red Phoenix Diamond. Do you know where I can find it?\\" The stranger remained silent for a moment, but then leaned closer to reveal his worn but wise-looking face. \\"You're playing a dangerous game, young lady,\\" he whispered in a gravelly tone. \\"The Red Phoenix Diamond is not something anyone should tamper with. It is known to have sealed within it a curse that brings grave misfortune to any who possess it.\\" Despite the man's warnings, Mary was determined to have the gemstone to outshine Jane. She challenged the stranger to reveal the diamond's location. Hesitantly, he agreed to help her, but not before making her swear a solemn oath to respect the powers of the famed diamond. The stranger directed Mary to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city, where the Red Phoenix Diamond was believed to be hidden. Steeling herself, she ventured within the crumbling building, scouring it for any sign of the gemstone. After a long night of searching, she finally stumbled across a small hidden chamber at the heart of the warehouse, and there, resting on a velvet cushion, sat the magnificent Red Phoenix Diamond. It was even more radiant than the stories foretold; the vibrant red hue of the diamond seemed to glow with an inner fire. Ignoring the dark presence that prevailed in the chamber, Mary lifted the gemstone and reluctantly acknowledged the weight of her oath. Aware of the curse, she decided to consult with someone knowledgeable about such matters to safely wear the gemstone. Over the following weeks, Mary consulted with psychics, shamans, and jewelers alike, learning about the gemstone's curse and ways to protect herself from its malignant powers. She had the diamond set into a dazzling necklace, imbued with magic-infused materials, which she hoped would shield her from the darker side of its history. At last, the day came for her to unveil her astonishing find. Mary knew the addition of the Red Phoenix Diamond necklace would shock the gossip mill, and leave Jane flabbergasted. Dressed to the nines with the striking gemstone resting around her neck, she stepped into the room, commanding the attention of everyone present. As expected, Jane's eyes widened in disbelief and jealousy coursed through her veins. Mary reveled in the moment, letting the envy of the room wash over her. However, as the night wore on, whispers began not just about Mary's incredible find, but also about those before her who had fallen victim to the curse. Unnerved by the conversation, Mary desperately clung to the hope that her magic-infused necklace would keep the curse at bay. Yet, despite her efforts, Mary couldn't ignore the nagging suspicion that the curse had already set its roots deep within her life. She began to question her choices, the motivations that led her to seek something so dangerous simply to overshadow her rival. As she confronted her untamed ambition and envy, she found herself in a struggle to break free from the darkness the Red Phoenix Diamond had brought upon her life. Only time would tell if Mary could navigate the treacherous path ahead, between the envy that drove her and the curse that haunted her. As the events of her life continued to unravel, the ruthless rivalry between Mary and Jane began to fade in significance. She realized that perhaps the true battle was never against Jane, but ultimately against herself and the darkness she had invited into her life. Mary knew that in order to put an end to the curse and the envy that consumed her, she would need to embark on a harrowing journey of self-discovery and redemption. She would need to uncover the truth behind the Red Phoenix Diamond's curse and confront the inner demons that haunted her. As her story continued, Mary would be forced to examine her motivations, face the consequences of her actions, and ultimately discover the strength within her to triumph over the darkness that had invaded her life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Why does he get so little sleep ?","output":"The individual in question appears to be getting little sleep due to a combination of factors related to early fatherhood, work commitments, and existing insomnia issues. Let's explore each contributing factor in more detail. 1. Early fatherhood: Having a newborn baby can be an overwhelming experience, as the baby requires constant care and attention. The individual's baby, Sloane, likely wakes up multiple times during the night, and being an insomniac, the father is available to comfort and play with her when she is up. Newborns typically have unpredictable sleeping patterns, as their circadian rhythm – the body's internal clock that controls sleep-wake cycles – takes time to develop. This inconsistency in the baby's sleep cycle disrupts the father's ability to get a full night's sleep. 2. Insomnia: As the individual mentions being an insomniac, it indicates that they have a pre-existing problem with sleep. Insomnia is a sleep disorder that makes it difficult for people to fall asleep, stay asleep, or both. Insomniacs often struggle with getting sufficient sleep even when they have the opportunity for proper rest. In this case, the father's insomnia compounds the sleep disruptions caused by caring for a newborn baby, making it even more challenging for him to get adequate sleep. 3. Work commitments: The father has a daily routine that involves going to work after taking care of Sloane in the morning, and then returning in the evening to spend more time with her and his wife. The exhaustion from work combined with the responsibility of child care leaves little room for rest. Furthermore, having to wake up around 6 am after going to bed close to 3 am results in only about 3 hours of sleep, which is significantly less than the recommended 7-9 hours for adults. 4. Balancing personal relationships: Besides taking care of the baby, the father also spends time with his wife and values their relationship. He attends to her needs and ensures that she also gets her rest, which is essential during the postpartum period. Balancing the needs of the newborn baby, the spouse, and personal mental health may significantly impact the amount of sleep the father gets. In summary, the individual gets very little sleep mainly due to the sleep interruptions caused by early fatherhood, exacerbated by his pre-existing insomnia, work commitments, and the necessity to balance personal relationships. This combination of factors creates a challenging environment in which it is difficult for him to achieve sufficient restorative sleep."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A couple booking a two-week holiday to Greece were left £600 out of pocket after they paid extra for a holiday bungalow, only to be put in a hotel room on arrival. Ken  Marlow, 68, and his wife Dorothy, 58, wanted to stay at the Belvedere Hotel on the Greek island of Skiathos, but were disappointed to be told by Thomas Cook that the rooms were fully booked. Instead, the holiday company offered the couple, from Moorside, Sunderland, a stay in a bungalow on the property for £578.86 more. Ken and Dorothy Marlow have received a full refund after they were overcharged by more than half of the overall booking for a bungalow they never even got to stay in. However, when the couple arrived at the resort, they were told the bungalows were fully booked and they would instead be placed in a double room. The Marlows complained when they got home and despite admitting the brochure was 'confusing', Thomas Cook initially refused to refund the full amount. Mr Marlow was contacted by Thomas Cook's customer relations department which admitted the brochure description was 'really confusing.' The pensioner was offered just £260 in vouchers or £209 in cash in a full and final settlement but neither amount covered what he had been overcharged. However, after local newspapers took up the battle, the couple have now been given an apology, refund, and compensation from Thomas Cook. The couple have accepted £700 after the company blamed a 'technical fault' for charging too much. The Marlows have been given a full refund, plus compensation after the booking blunder. Mr Marlow said: 'I went to the Thomas Cook shop to book a holiday with a twin/double room at the Belvedere Hotel & Bungalows at Achladies, Skiathos, Greece. 'The sales assistant told me no twin/double rooms were available on our chosen dates. 'There was, however, a family bungalow for three or four persons but I would have to pay extra for under occupancy. 'Having studied the brochure we decided the Belvedere was where we wanted to stay, so I agreed, and looked forward to having a bit more room to spread out.' On arrival, however, it was a completely different story. Mr Marlow, said: 'We were told that no bungalows were available and that we would have to stay in a double room. 'This, of course, was what we had wanted all along but a holiday that should have cost £1,118 cost me, somehow, £1,696.86, meaning I was overcharged by £578.86. 'It seems Thomas Cook and the Belvedere were not using the same data and, therefore, there was wrong information in the brochure.' The company admitted in email correspondence that the brochure was 'confusing' but refused to compensate to the amount Mr Marlow had been overcharged. The Marlows, from Sunderland, arrived at the Belvedere Hotel & Bungalows at Achladies, Skiathos, Greece to be told their booking for a bungalow was not possible. A spokesman for the company said: 'At Thomas Cook we pride ourselves on offering the best value holidays in the market. We would like to express our apologies to Mr Marlow for the inconvenience of additional charges incurred while on holiday. 'These were due to a pricing discrepancy caused by a technical fault at the time of booking. 'Thomas Cook would like to reassure customers that such pricing errors are rare and a full investigation has been carried out to ensure that there are no further issues of this nature. 'We can confirm that Mr Marlow has now accepted a full refund for the extra costs and has stated that he is looking forward to booking his next holiday with Thomas Cook.' Thomas Cook said that that the difference between what Mr Marlow was charged and what he should have been charged had been fully refunded - despite the earlier refusal - and they had also offered a gesture of goodwill by way of apology. Mr Marlow said he was delighted with the result. 'They have refunded what I wanted all along and rounded the amount up to £700,' he added.

Title: Benny's Video Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (November 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film opens with a home video of the slaughter with a captive bolt pistol of a pig on a European farm. The video rewinds to play the slaughter in slow motion, which emphasizes the hand-held barrel against the pig's fore-skull and the cartridge explosion. A party centered on a game called Pilot and Passengers is broken up by Georg and Anna, when they return home while the party is in progress. The host of the party, Eva, is their daughter who lives in another part of town and who has, it turns out in questioning of Benny after the incident, taken advantage of the planned absence of Georg and Anna to host the impromptu party in their home. While watching a newscast, Georg and Anna discuss the money Eva won in the pyramid scheme she was promoting at the party. In a locker room at school, Benny encourages his friends to take positions in his own Pilot and Passengers game. While his parents are away for the weekend, Benny invites a girl (Ingrid Stassner) he has seen outside the local video store to his home. He shows her the video of the pig slaughter, and they talk about the film. She: \\"Did you make this film? How was it, with the pig? I mean, have you ever seen a dead person--a real one, I mean?\\" Benny: \\"No. I once saw a TV program about the tricks they use in action films. It's all ketchup and plastic,\\" and then he unveils and loads the slaughtering gun. He holds it against his chest, and dares the girl to discharge it. When she refuses, he calls her a coward (Feigling!). He holds it against her chest, and when he hesitates, she calls him a Feigling also. He fires the gun, and she falls. Her falling reveals a video monitor, on which we see her crawling away from Benny and completely out of frame, Benny running to reload the gun and returning to shoot her a second time, the girl crawling back...

What is the last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.","output":"The last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario is Thomson.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her.

The narrating nurse might also believe in the importance of standing up against mistreatment of patients, as evidenced by their confrontation with the impatient nurse. They could also be curious about the long-term consequences of Connie S.'s miraculous recovery and how her life unfolded after leaving the ward.

Hypothesis: Franz Joseph Haydn developed chamber music. Select from the following.  --Yes.  --It's impossible to say.  --No.","output":"Yes, based on the given context, we can draw the hypothesis that Franz Joseph Haydn played a crucial role in the development of chamber music. Specifically, he was instrumental in shaping the piano trio, one form of chamber music. Additionally, his significant contributions to musical form, which have earned him the titles \\"Father of the Symphony\\" and \\"Father of the String Quartet,\\" further support the argument that Haydn was influential in the realm of chamber music. Chamber music is a form of classical music composed for a small group of instruments. It can be showcased in more intimate settings compared to large orchestra performances. During the Classical period, chamber music further evolved, with composers such as Haydn significantly impacting its growth. Haydn was a prolific composer, known for creating over 100 symphonies. These symphonies, as well as his work with string quartets, showcased an evolving style that set the stage for others to build upon. As the \\"Father of the Symphony\\" and \\"Father of the String Quartet,\\" Haydn demonstrated innovative thinking and mastery in composition. His ability to experiment with forms and ideas exemplify how his work was pivotal in shaping chamber music as we know it today. In conclusion, we can confidently state the hypothesis that Franz Joseph Haydn was a crucial figure in the development of chamber music. His work in the Classical period significantly influenced the evolution of this musical genre, with lasting effects on the growth of piano trios, symphonies, and string quartets. Thus, Haydn's contributions to chamber music are both evident and undeniable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber.

The situation is further controversial due to the fact that the company responsible for carrying out this campaign is run by the Prime Minister's son. In the lead-up to an election, political parties and candidates often use various methods and strategies to communicate their messages, policies, and promises to potential voters. One such method is email campaigns, which involve sending emails to a large number of people to gain their attention and support. However, when such campaigns send unsolicited messages or are perceived as spam, they can attract controversy and backlash. In this instance, Prime Minister John Howard has admitted to financially supporting an email campaign that has been criticized as spam. The fact that Howard's son's company is behind this campaign adds an extra layer of conflict, raising ethical questions around nepotism, favoritism, and ensuring a level playing field when it comes to political communication. The text suggests that the Prime Minister faced significant criticism for his decision to bankroll this campaign, putting his credibility and judgment as a leader under scrutiny. It is likely that opponents would argue that such practices are unfair and inappropriate in an electoral context, where transparency and equitable communication methods are crucial to the democratic process. In summary, this text is about Australian Prime Minister John Howard admitting to funding a controversial pre-election email campaign, which has been labeled as spam, and the company responsible for this campaign is run by his son.

There are two rival gangs in Vasco, called the Bichhoos (Scorpions in Hindi), who are Hindus, and the Eagles, who are Christians. Bichoo gang's leader is Prakash (Sharad Kapoor), while the Eagles are led by Max (Shah Rukh Khan). They are all enemies, they fight, run, chase, and beat. But they are usually stopped from fights by Father Jacob, or the Town Inspector (Sharat Saxena). One day Prakash's brother Rahul (Chandrachur Singh) comes to visit after 2 years, who is a master-chef working in Mumbai. Rahul loves Goa the more he sees of it, and as he tours around Vasco, he meets Shirley (Aishwarya Rai), the twin sister of Max and he falls in love with her straightaway. Knowing about Eagles and Bicchhoo rivalry, Rahul keeps his mouth closed. He opens a pastry shop 'Treat House' and settles in Vasco. Meanwhile, he becomes part of the Eagles-Bichchoo rivalry, and gets closer to Shirley. The whole situation is unprecedented in this city, which gets all the more intriguing when Rahul comes across a secret about Max and Shirley's past; a secret that will change their lives forever, and that, which leads to a death. He comes to know that Max and Shirley were actually the illegitimate children of Alberto Vasco, the founder of the town. Rahul wants to reveal this to Shirley in a letter but due to circumstances it falls in the hands of Prakash. Prakash plans to murder Max, to get his father's lands worth Rs. 20 lakh. This leads to fight sequence between both, where Max accidentally shoots Prakash while defending himself. Max is arrested and his trial puts a rift between Shirley and Rahul.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Who failed to offer an alternative emancipatory project? Context: In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\" The answer is:","output":"Antihumanists failed to offer an alternative emancipatory project."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Pepsi Charity Contest Trips Over Its Own Submission Rules Pepsi is planning to give more than 20 million to charities through a contest called Pepsi Refresh, the most ambitious so far among a number of similar contests that have used social networks on the Internet to raise money and recognition for nonprofit groups and social causes. But, like some of its predecessors, Pepsi Refresh has stumbled over its own rules. The tiny charity currently atop the rankings in one category of the contest accidentally got a little help from Pepsi itself. Materials submitted by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a charity started by Mariska Hargitay, one of the stars of “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” to help victims of sexual assault, were updated by the staff at Pepsi after the submission deadline, which is against the contest rules. That upset some of the contestants who wondered whether Pepsi was doing favors for a celebrity. “I can’t edit my own submission, so how did she do it?” said one contestant, who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to jeopardize his chances of winning. Just an honest mistake, says Pepsi. “We didn’t follow our guidelines to the letter,” said Jill Beraud, chief marketing officer for the American beverages unit at Pepsi. “The bottom line is that we’ve learned from this and we’re moving on.” The company said it would give away three 250,000 prizes, instead of two as originally planned. The company worked with experts in social media in hopes of avoiding problems other companies have encountered. Ms. Beraud said that so far it had exceeded expectations in terms of the number of people who have voted, the number of submissions and the response from bottlers and employees. A thousand organizations compete for 5,000, 25,000, 50,000 and 250,000 grants in each month at least through the end of the year, using materials and information they must submit before each monthly contest begins. Those materials cannot be edited once the particular contest starts. But a video clip that is embedded in Joyful Heart’s pitch was clearly made after the submission deadline. Featuring Ms. Hargitay and Justine Ezarik, the blogosphere and Twitter phenom, the video incorporates a photo of the Pepsi Refresh Web site, which went up only after the submission deadline had passed. The Joyful Heart submission originally included a link to a video on YouTube, and the Pepsi staff decided it would be simpler for Pepsi Refresh voters to view the video directly on the Pepsi Refresh site. Ms. Beraud said she was certain the video had not given an advantage to Joyful Heart, which had 6 percent more votes than its closest competitor the day before and the day after the video was embedded. (Pepsi does not release vote totals, only rankings.)","output":"Pepsi is having a charity contest called Pepsi Refresh, where they will give more than 20 million to charities.

Benedict Rogers, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a religious freedom oriented organization, urges President Trump to emulate former President Ronald Reagan who once publicly called on the leader of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall that separated democratic West Germany and the Communist East. “Mr. Trump’s message should be, Mr. Kim if you seek peace, come to the gates of the prison camps, open the prison camps, tear down the walls of the prison camps,” said Rogers at a North Korea human rights conference in Seoul on Thursday. It is unclear if human rights will be part of the agenda at the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit, if it happens. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol have been meeting this week in New York to overcome the main obstacle to the summit; the gap between the U.S. demand for rapid and complete denuclearization and North Korea’s more phased in approach that would provide early sanctions relief. Brad Adams, the Asia director at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday, “Whatever the outcome of nuclear talks, human rights-related sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea changes the way it treats its people.” The United Nations has passed 13 resolutions addressing human rights abuses in North Korea, most recently in March of this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. Question: What is probably true about Trump? Answer: A:","output":"He is expected to confront Kim Jong Un about ongoing human rights abuses in North Korea during their meeting in Singapore in June."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Addison wasn't paying much attention.  They got into a car accident.  Given the context: What will Addison want to do next? Pick from:  1). show their driver license.  2). text.  3). avoid the police. Answer:","output":"Addison, realizing the seriousness of the car accident, will most likely want to show their driver's license. This is because doing so is a responsible and legally required action after being involved in a car accident. By providing their driver's license, they are ensuring that they are being transparent and cooperative with the other party involved and any responding law enforcement officers. In contrast, the other options present less appropriate or responsible choices. Texting, for example, could be seen as neglecting the severity of the situation and a lack of empathy for anyone else involved. Additionally, texting immediately after an accident might even be illegal in some jurisdictions, as authorities may interpret it as a sign of distracted driving. As for avoiding the police, this is highly inadvisable and could cause further legal trouble for Addison. Evading law enforcement after an accident can lead to hit-and-run accusations, fines, and possibly even criminal charges. Furthermore, escaping the scene sends a negative message about Addison's willingness to take responsibility for their actions and indicates a lack of concern for the well-being of others. By choosing to show their driver's license, Addison demonstrates that they understand the gravity of the situation and are willing to cooperate with the other party involved in the accident, as well as any potential legal repercussions. This choice exhibits accountability and mature decision-making, attributes that will bode well for Addison as they navigate the aftermath of the car accident."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I read this background article the other day: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  I am facing a new situation today: Pam is an astronaut who has been given a mission to find a new planet for humans to live on. She is exploring the outer rims of the galaxy when she discovers two new planets that may be suitable. The atmospheric makeup of these planets is very similar to Pam's current home. After running a quick diagnostic, the only difference that Pam sees is that planet B has more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet A.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which planet has more less inside its atmosphere?","output":"From the background article, we know that higher amounts of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, trap heat inside a planet's atmosphere due to their complex molecular structure. This leads to a warming effect, which is the main cause of global warming and climate change on Earth. In the new situation, Pam discovers two planets with similar atmospheric makeup to her current home, but planet B has more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet A. Based on the knowledge acquired, we can conclude that planet B has more heat trapped inside its atmosphere due to the higher concentration of carbon dioxide, which acts as a greenhouse gas. Consequently, planet A has less heat trapped inside its atmosphere compared to planet B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Question: I read this background article the other day: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism.  I am facing a new situation today: Two cousins were fascinated about food chains in nature. Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which cousin learned less about wolves?

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  A significant stylistic shift in the Kinks' music became evident in late 1965, with the appearance of singles like \\"A Well Respected Man\\" and \\"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\\", as well as the band's third album, The Kink Kontroversy, on which session musician Nicky Hopkins made his first appearance with the group on keyboards. These recordings exemplified the development of Davies' songwriting style, from hard-driving rock numbers toward songs rich in social commentary, observation and idiosyncratic character study, all with a uniquely English flavour.The satirical single \\"Sunny Afternoon\\" was the biggest UK hit of summer 1966, topping the charts and displacing the Beatles' \\"Paperback Writer\\". Before the release of The Kink Kontroversy, Ray Davies suffered a nervous and physical breakdown, caused by the pressures of touring, writing and ongoing legal squabbles. During his months of recuperation, he wrote several new songs and pondered the band's direction. Quaife was involved in an automobile accident, and after his recovery decided to step back from the band for much of 1966. Bassist John Dalton filled in until Quaife returned to the group at the end of the year.\\"Sunny Afternoon\\" was a dry run for the band's next album Face to Face, which displayed Davies' growing ability to craft gentle yet cutting narrative songs about everyday life and people. Hopkins returned for the sessions to play various keyboard instruments, including piano and harpsichord. He played on the band's next two studio albums as well, and was involved on a number of their live BBC recordings before joining the Jeff Beck Group in 1968. Face to Face was released in October 1966 in the UK, where it was well received and peaked at number eight. It was released in the US in December and was tipped as a potential \\"chart winner\\" by Billboard magazine. Despite this, it managed only a meagre chart peak of 135—a sign of the band's flagging popularity in the American market.The Kinks' next single was a social commentary piece entitled \\"Dead End...

I'm nearing clinical depression right now\\" 1. The phrase \\"I can't do it\\" demonstrates a sense of hopelessness and inability to perform or accomplish a specific task or handle a situation. This kind of statement usually indicates frustration, overwhelming emotions, or a lack of self-confidence, all of which are considered negative emotions. 2. The excessive use of exclamation marks after the phrase \\"I can't do it!!!!!!!\\" implies a strong emphasis on the emotion being conveyed. This kind of punctuation is used to highlight the urgency or severity of the situation, further emphasizing the negative sentiment in this tweet. 3. The statement \\"I'm nearing clinical depression right now\\" indicates that the individual is struggling with their mental health and experiencing significant difficulties. Clinical depression is a severe mental health disorder characterized by pervasive feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in activities. Mentioning clinical depression in this context suggests that the person is going through an extremely challenging time, which is undoubtedly a negative sentiment. Taking these factors into account, the sentiment of the tweet can be categorized as (i). negative. The combination of hopelessness, urgency, and struggles with mental health conveys a strong sense of negativity and emotional turmoil."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What is a medical prohibition for Witnesses?\\" is in \\"Though Jehovah's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions of whole blood, they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion. The Watch Tower Society provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components, in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept. Jehovah's Witnesses have established Hospital Liaison Committees as a cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah's Witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","output":"A medical prohibition for Witnesses refers to the restrictions and limitations Jehovah's Witnesses place on certain medical treatments based on their religious beliefs and principles. One of the most well-known prohibitions is their refusal to accept blood transfusions of whole blood, as they believe it is against God's commandments to consume or accept blood in any form. However, they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion. The Watch Tower Society, the governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses, provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents, which are legal documents specifying the medical treatments and procedures a person allows or prohibits in case they are unable to make their own decisions due to illness or incapacitation. These documents help Witnesses to clearly state their preferences when it comes to receiving major blood components and enable them to specify which allowable blood fractions and treatments they will personally accept. In order to facilitate communication and increase understanding between Jehovah's Witnesses and healthcare providers, Hospital Liaison Committees have been established. These committees act as a bridge between individual Jehovah's Witnesses, medical professionals, and hospitals, ensuring that the patient's beliefs, needs, and concerns are understood and respected. They also provide valuable resources and information to medical professionals about alternative treatments and procedures that can be used in place of blood transfusions when treating Jehovah's Witness patients. In summary, the medical prohibition for Jehovah's Witnesses mainly revolves around their refusal to accept blood transfusions of whole blood and certain blood components. They have established specific guidelines, legal documents, and committees to help uphold these beliefs while maintaining open communication and cooperation with healthcare providers to ensure quality treatment and care."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: The economy of Isola Superiore is based entirely on agriculture. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"If the first sentence is true, which describes Isola dei Pescatori (a.k.a. Isola Superiore) as a delightfully peaceful fishing village with narrow streets, it is not necessarily contradictory to the second sentence, which claims that the economy of Isola Superiore is based entirely on agriculture.  However, we should examine both sentences in more detail in order to better explore the relationship between them and whether they are compatible. In the first sentence, the main focus is on the island's atmosphere and physical setting. It is described as being a peaceful fishing village, which suggests that fishing is a significant activity on the island. However, the sentence does not provide information on how important fishing is to the economy of the island, or if it's just a cultural or historical aspect of Isola Superiore. On the other hand, the second sentence focuses on the economy of Isola Superiore, stating that it is based entirely on agriculture. The use of the term \\"entirely\\" implies that agriculture is the sole basis for economic activity on the island.  It's important to note that fishing and agriculture can coexist as parallel economic activities on the same island. Agriculture could include a variety of practices, such as cultivating crops and raising livestock, while fishing could involve both freshwater and saltwater fishing. In this case, both sentences may be true together, if we consider that fishing is a part of the broader agricultural activities or serves as a supplementary economic activity that contributes to the island's identity as a fishing village. However, if we take the literal interpretation of \\"entirely\\" in the second sentence to mean that agriculture is the one and only economic activity on the island, then this could be seen as contradictory to the description of the island as a fishing village in the first sentence. In this case, we would need further information to determine the exact relationship between fishing and agriculture on Isola Superiore in order to decide if these two sentences are both true. In conclusion, if we take the descriptions in the first sentence and the second sentence at face value, there is a potential contradiction between them when considering the role of fishing in the island's economy. However, without additional context or information about the specific economic activities on Isola Superiore, it is not possible to definitively say whether the second sentence is true or false based solely on the information in the first sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the first real name of the person that agrees to invest 1000 in Ossining's business?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Dr. John Harvey Kellogg opened a sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan, where he practiced his unusual methods for maintaining health, including colonic irrigation, electrical stimulus and sexual abstinence, vegetarianism and physical exercise. The sanitarium attracts well-to-do patients including William and Eleanor Lightbody, who are suffering from poor health following the death of their child. On their way to Battle Creek they meet Charles Ossining, hoping to make a fortune by exploiting the fad for health food cereals. Ossining finds a partner in Goodloe Bender. Having enlisted the services of George Kellogg, the doctor's estranged adopted son, they attempt to produce \\"Kellogg's Perfo Flakes.\\"  In the sanitarium, Will Lightbody is separated from his wife, and is soon harboring lustful thoughts toward Nurse Graves and patient Ida Muntz. His wife Eleanor, meanwhile, befriends Virginia Cranehill, who has a modern attitude toward sexual pleasure, influenced by the works of Dr. Lionel Badger. Will eventually succumbs to Ida Muntz's charms. Later he learns that Ida has died during treatment. Following the death of a patient in the sinusoidal bath, and the discovery of yet another death, Will suffers a breakdown, flees the sanitarium, gets drunk and eats meat. At a restaurant, he meets Ossining, and agrees to invest 1,000 in his health food business. Will returns drunk to the sanitarium, where he is reprimanded by Dr. Kellogg and is abandoned by a distraught Eleanor.   Ossining's business is a disaster, with no edible product. He and the partners resort to stealing Kellogg's cornflakes and repackaging them in their own boxes. Ossining meets his aunt, his sole investor, on visiting day at Kellogg's sanitarium, and is there exposed as a fraud and arrested.

No, these questions do not have the same meaning. While both questions are related to human emotions, relationships, and social norms, they address different aspects of these topics. The first question - \\"Why do people think love is magical? I think it's more about physical beauty.\\" - deals with perceptions of love and the role of physical attractiveness in relationships. It asks why people believe love to be a magical or extraordinary emotion when, to the person asking the question, it might seem that physical beauty plays a larger part in forming romantic connections. This question encourages discussion about the nature of love, the factors that contribute to romantic attraction, and the potential overemphasis on physical appearance in society. The second question - \\"Why is it that in India people don't talk about sex as much as they think about it?\\" - deals with cultural norms and attitudes regarding sex in India. It highlights a perceived discrepancy between the frequency with which people in India think about sex and their willingness to discuss it openly. This question invites exploration of the historical, cultural, and societal factors that contribute to this sexual reticence, as well as comparisons to norms and attitudes in other cultures.

He served as the head football coach at Western Reserve University, Vanderbilt University and Wittenberg University in a career lasting more than 30 years, compiling a win-loss-tie record of 168-45-8. Edwards also coached the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL) from 1941 to 1942, tallying a 4-9-1 record, and served as an assistant coach for the NFL's Cleveland Browns in the late 1940s. Raised near Massillon, Ohio, Edwards was the son of an immigrant from Wales who worked in the area's coal mines. Having built a strong record at Western Reserve, Edwards was in the running for head coaching roles at a number of larger universities and professional teams. He met with officials at Marquette University and was considered a candidate for coaching duties at Colorado University and for the National Football League's Detroit Lions. After visiting with Lions owner Fred Mandel, Edwards ultimately was hired in February 1941 to succeed George Clark. Both Edwards and Dugan Miller signed two-year contracts. Edwards was given a 10,000 annual salary (166,380 in 2017 dollars), more than double the 4,420 he was paid at Western Reserve.  Edwards's stint as the Lions coach was unsuccessful. He guided the team to a 4-6-1 record in 1941, and Mandel fired him after three straight losses to begin the 1942 season as the team's roster was depleted by players' service in World War II. Detroit went on to lose all the rest of its games after John Karcis was named his replacement.  Edwards enlisted in the U.S. Navy later in 1942 as America's involvement in the war intensified. While in the military, he served at St. Mary's Pre-Flight, a training program in California, and coached the Air Devils football team there. He also served at a base in Pensacola, Florida. Edwards was discharged in 1946, and spent a year in the sporting goods business in Cleveland, Ohio before reuniting with Brown, who had become the first coach of the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Edwards took a position as a tackle coach and remained with the team for two seasons. He coached tackles including Ernie Blandin, Lou Rymkus and future Pro Football Hall of Fame member Lou Groza. The Browns won the AAFC championship in both of Edwards's years as an assistant; the team won all of its games in 1948, turning in professional football's first perfect season.

The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it.

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. walk opposite left thrice after turn around right","output":"Task: The task is to convert the given command in limited natural language into the correct sequence of actions for an agent. Command: walk opposite left thrice after turn around right Breakdown of the command: 1. \\"walk opposite left thrice\\" means the agent needs to walk backward to the left direction three times. The action sequence is: I_TURN_LEFT, I_WALK (three times) 2. \\"turn around right\\" means the agent needs to turn around in the right direction. The action sequence is: I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT 3. \\"after\\" means we need to execute the second part of the command first and then the first part. Putting it all together: 1. Execute \\"turn around right\\": I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT 2.

Information:  - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - The Church of England (C of E) is the Anglican Christian state church of England. Headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (currently Justin Welby) and primarily governed from London with the monarch as the supreme governor, the Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion. The church dates its formal establishment as a national church to the 6th-century Gregorian mission in Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury, with considerable features introduced and established during and following the English Reformation in the 16th century.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England, the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury. The current archbishop is Justin Welby. His enthronement took place at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013. Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury, the \\"Apostle to the English\\", sent from Rome in the year 597. Welby succeeded Rowan Williams.  - Justin Portal Welby (born 6 January 1956) is the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury and the most senior bishop in the Church of England. Welby was the vicar of Southam, Warwickshire, and most recently was the Bishop of Durham, serving for just over a year. As Archbishop of Canterbury he is the Primate of All England and the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion.  - The Gnostic Gospels are a collection of about 54 ancient texts based upon the teachings of several spiritual leaders, which were written from the 2nd to the 4th century AD. The sayings of the Gospel of Thomas, compiled circa 140, may include some traditions even older than some of the gospels of the New Testament, possibly as early as the second half of the first century. These gospels are not part of the standard Biblical canon of any mainstream Christian denomination, and as such are part of what is called the New Testament apocrypha. Recent novels, films, and video games that refer to the gospels have increased public interest.  - The Gregorian mission or Augustinian mission was sent by Pope Gregory the Great in 596 to convert Britain's Anglo-Saxons. Headed by Augustine of Canterbury, by the death of the last missionary in 635 the mission had established Christianity in southern Britain. Along with the Irish and Frankish missions it converted other parts of Britain as well and influenced the Hiberno-Scottish missions to Continental Europe.  - The New Testament (Koine Greek:   , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music.  - Ini Kopuria ( died 1945 ) , a police officer from Maravovo , Guadalcanal , Solomon Islands formed the Melanesian Brotherhood in 1925 . He and the Bishop of Melanesia , the Right Reverend John Manwaring Steward , realised Ini 's dream by forming a band of brothers ( known in the Mota language as ' Ira Reta Tasiu ' ) to take the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the non-Christian areas of Melanesia . He is commemorated in the calendars of saints of the Church of the Province of Melanesia , of the Church of England , and of the Episcopal Church ( USA ) .  - The Northern Solomons were the more northerly group of islands in the Solomon Islands archipelago over which Germany declared a protectorate in 1885. Initially the German Solomon Islands Protectorate included Choiseul, Santa Isabel, the Shortlands and Ontong Java Islands, but in 1900 these islands were transferred to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. The largest of the Solomon Islands, Bougainville, continued under German administration until World War I when it fell to Australia, and after the war, it formally passed to Australian jurisdiction under a League of Nations mandate.  Today, the original North Solomon Islands are split between the Autonomous Region of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea and the successor state of the British Solomon Islands which was officially renamed from \\"the British Solomon Islands Protectorate\\" to \\"Solomon Islands\\" in 1975 prior to becoming an independent, sovereign state in 1976.  - The English Reformation was a series of events in 16th century England by which the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. These events were, in part, associated with the wider process of the European Protestant Reformation, a religious and political movement that affected the practice of Christianity across all of Europe during this period. Many factors contributed to the process: the decline of feudalism and the rise of nationalism, the rise of the common law, the invention of the printing press and increased circulation of the Bible, and the transmission of new knowledge and ideas among scholars, the upper and middle classes and readers in general. However, the various phases of the English Reformation, which also covered Wales and Ireland, were largely driven by changes in government policy, to which public opinion gradually accommodated itself.  - Melanesia is a subregion of Oceania (and occasionally Australasia) extending from the western end of the Pacific Ocean to the Arafura Sea, and eastward to Fiji.  - The Melanesian Brotherhood is an Anglican religious community of men in simple vows based primarily in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Papua New Guinea.  - A subregion is a part of a larger region or continent and is usually based on location. Cardinal directions, such as south or southern, are commonly used to define a subregion.  - A gospel is an account describing the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. The most widely known examples are the four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John which are included in the New Testament, but the term can also used to refer to apocryphal, non-canonical, JewishChristian and gnostic gospels.  - Augustine of Canterbury (first third of the 6th century  probably 26 May 604) was a Benedictine monk who became the first Archbishop of Canterbury in the year 597. He is considered the \\"Apostle to the English\\" and a founder of the English Church.  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - Guadalcanal (indigenous name: \\"Isatabu\\") is the principal island in Guadalcanal Province of the nation of Solomon Islands in the south-western Pacific, northeast of Australia. Its European discovery was under the Spanish expedition of Álvaro de Mendaña in 1568. The name comes from Guadalcanal, a village in the province of Seville, in Andalusia, Spain, birthplace of Pedro de Ortega Valencia, a member of Mendaña's expedition.

The number is not known with any confidence; new sign languages emerge frequently through creolization and de novo (and occasionally through language planning). In some countries, such as Sri Lanka and Tanzania, each school for the deaf may have a separate language, known only to its students and sometimes denied by the school; on the other hand, countries may share sign languages, though sometimes under different names (Croatian and Serbian, Indian and Pakistani). Deaf sign languages also arise outside educational institutions, especially in village communities with high levels of congenital deafness, but there are significant sign languages developed for the hearing as well, such as the speech-taboo languages used in aboriginal Australia.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Syria, during this time, is for a death rate of about a third. The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypts population. Half of Pariss population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110,000–120,000 inhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. In London approximately 62,000 people died between the years between 1346 and 1353.   While contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What areas were the introduction of the raccoon a success? from the following article ?  As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, the raccoon is now distributed in several European and Asian countries. Sightings have occurred in all the countries bordering Germany, which hosts the largest population outside of North America. Another stable population exists in northern France, where several pet raccoons were released by members of the U.S. Air Force near the Laon-Couvron Air Base in 1966. Furthermore, raccoons have been known to be in the area around Madrid since the early 1970s. In 2013, the city authorized \\"the capture and death of any specimen\\". It is also present in Italy, with one reproductive population in Lombardy.About 1,240 animals were released in nine regions of the former Soviet Union between 1936 and 1958 for the purpose of establishing a population to be hunted for their fur. Two of these introductions were successful—one in the south of Belarus between 1954 and 1958, and another in Azerbaijan between 1941 and 1957. With a seasonal harvest of between 1,000 and 1,500 animals, in 1974 the estimated size of the population distributed in the Caucasus region was around 20,000 animals and the density was four animals per square kilometer (10 animals per square mile).

Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The Bacon Explosion is a culinary dish that hails from the United States, specifically from the Kansas City metropolitan area. This area is known for its unique and vibrant food scene, which encompasses various techniques and flavors from different cultures. The Kansas City metropolitan area comprises the border region between Kansas and Missouri, and encompasses several cities and towns connected through their robust culinary traditions. As such, the Bacon Explosion can be considered a product of the confluence of cultural and regional backgrounds that embrace this unique geographical location. The primary ingredients of the Bacon Explosion are bacon and sausage, both of which are popular meats in American cuisine. Bacon, a type of salt-cured pork, is adored by millions for its savory taste, crispy texture, and aromatic appeal. Sausage, on the other hand, is a meat product usually composed of ground meat, often pork, combined with various seasonings and spices. Depending on the region and recipe, sausages can be smoked, cooked, or cured in a variety of ways to impart unique and distinct flavors. In the context of the Bacon Explosion, these two key ingredients showcase the ultimate celebration of rich and savory flavors found in American cuisine. The making of a Bacon Explosion involves intricately weaving strips of bacon into a lattice pattern, which then forms the outer layer of this delicious dish. The bacon weave is viewed as both an artistic expression and a functional technique, which allows the dish to hold its shape during the cooking process. Layered within this weave is a layer of flavorful sausage meat, the second main ingredient. This sausage layer serves as a complementary flavor profile to the crispy bacon exterior, with its tender and juicy texture providing a harmonious balance to this carnivorous delight. The Bacon Explosion is often seasoned with a blend of spices and flavors, which may include barbecue rubs, chopped onions, minced garlic, and even jalapeno peppers. Some variations of the dish also involve incorporating cheese, herbs, or other ingredients to further enhance the overall taste experience. As a whole, this dish embodies the spirit of American innovation, creativity, and love for bold and satisfying flavors. The Bacon Explosion, with its roots in the Kansas City metropolitan area and the United States, represents a testament to the diverse and experimental nature of American cuisine. Showcased in its pairing of bacon and sausage, the dish encompasses the rich and robust flavors that continue to entice food lovers of all backgrounds. This dish is a prime example of how classic ingredients can be combined in innovative ways, forging a culinary experience that transcends regional boundaries and reflects the essence of American cuisine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The missing something might well be Sally (Catherine O'Hara), an animated rag doll who yearns for Jack, but he doesn't notice. (Sally was created by Halloweentown's evil scientist (William Hickey), who keeps her locked up except when she knocks him out by slipping deadly nightshade in his soup.)After pondering his ennui in a cemetery (disturbing Sally, who's replenishing her supply of deadly nightshade), Jack takes his ghostly dog Zero for a walk in the woods. They come upon a strange circle of trees, each with a door representing a holiday. Jack opens the Christmas door and they're sucked in, landing in Christmastown. Jack is curious about everything he sees there, but finds it all delightful and wants to be part of it.Back in Halloweentown Jack calls a town meeting, where he describes what he saw in Christmastown.

Question: If children are raised Ashkenazi, what group is the woman from? Context: In this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is Sephardic, since most non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or not they are ethnically Sephardic. By tradition, a Sephardic or Mizrahi woman who marries into an Orthodox or Haredi Ashkenazi Jewish family raises her children to be Ashkenazi Jews; conversely an Ashkenazi woman who marries a Sephardi or Mizrahi man is expected to take on Sephardic practice and the children inherit a Sephardic identity, though in practice many families compromise. A convert generally follows the practice of the beth din that converted him or her. With the integration of Jews from around the world in Israel, North America, and other places, the religious definition of an Ashkenazi Jew is blurring, especially outside Orthodox Judaism.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many different players caught TD passes?","output":"Title: Discovering the Number of Different Players Catching Touchdown Passes Hey little buddies! Today, we're going to talk about football and learn how many different players can catch touchdown passes. Touchdowns are an exciting part of the game, and it's so much fun to see players run, jump, and catch the ball. Before we dive in, let's learn some cool words that are used in football. A touchdown pass is when the quarterback throws the ball to a player who catches it in the end zone. This scores 6 points for the team. The quarterback is the team leader who decides which play to run and throws the ball to other players. The end zone is the special part at each end of the field where players try to take the ball to score points. Now, back to our main question: How many different players can catch touchdown passes? Well, it depends on the game you're watching and the team that's playing. In a football team, there are several positions of players who can catch these passes: 1. Wide Receivers: These are the fastest players who run far and wide to catch the ball thrown by the quarterback. They can score many touchdowns because they are quick and have great hands for catching. 2. Tight Ends: These players are a mix of speedy runners like wide receivers and strong blockers like offensive linemen. They line up next to the offensive linemen and can either help block or run out to catch the ball for a touchdown. 3. Running Backs: These players usually carry the ball and run with it, but they can also catch passes from the quarterback. They can surprise the other team by catching the ball and running into the end zone for a touchdown. 4. Full Backs: These players are similar to running backs, but they focus more on blocking. Sometimes, they can also catch passes and score touchdowns if the other team is not expecting it. In a single game of football, all of these players might have a chance to catch touchdown passes! But the number of different players who actually catch a touchdown pass will vary depending on the team's strategy, the skill of the individual players, and how the game unfolds. So, little buddies, the answer to your question is: There is no exact number for how many different players can catch touchdown passes in one game. It varies from game to game and depends on the team playing. But the fun part is that many players can have a chance to catch the ball and score for their teams! I hope you enjoyed learning about football and touchdown passes.

News of the deadly Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and injured 178 others Monday has understandably dominated CNN's coverage this week. You can follow the live updates here, as events unfold. Two men believed to be suspects in the case have been identified. One died of injuries suffered during a confrontation with police Friday, and the other was arrested after a standoff with police, causing jubilation in Boston. But while all eyes were on the Boston suburb of Watertown, there was plenty going on elsewhere. Here are five stories you may have missed:. 1. A deadly wave of bombings blasted Iraq Tuesday, ahead of elections there Saturday. The attacks took place in at least six provinces: Baghdad, Anbar, Babel, Kirkuk, Salaheddin Diyala, and Nasriya, police officials across the country told CNN. Shiite neighborhoods, police checkpoints and political offices were among the targets. At least 42 people were killed, with more than 257 others wounded. 2. The founder of the French company that made controversial breast implants, went on trial over the scandal. Proceedings against Jean Claude Mas, who founded Poly Implant Prothese, or PIP, and four others connected to the company continued Thursday, a day after the trial opened in Marseille. Mas was arrested in January 2012 in connection with an investigation after the 2010 cancer death of a French woman with PIP implants. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing, insisting that his products were perfectly safe. 3. A powerful earthquake struck Pakistan's border with Iran, Tuesday, killing 34 people and injuring 80 others in Pakistan, sources say. Officials earlier said that dozens more were injured in both countries. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was preliminarily measured at 7.8 magnitude. The Iranian Seismological Center said the earthquake had a magnitude of 7.5. Army doctors and Frontier Corps paramilitary forces took part in rescue efforts in Mashakel, according to a Pakistani official involved in relief efforts. 4. A Pakistani court confined the country's former president Pervez Musharraf to his home Friday. The move came a day after he made a swift exit from an Islamabad court after a judge revoked his bail. The development is the latest legal setback to Musharraf since the former military ruler returned to Pakistan last month, five years after he resigned as president and left the country, to fight a series of court cases against him. He had been seeking to run in upcoming elections. 5. New Zealand's parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage Wednesday. The country became the first in the Asia Pacific region to pass the legislation, ahead of Australia, whose gay community feels the country is falling behind in terms of gay rights. The New Zealand Parliament passed the bill by a convincing margin of 77 votes to 44, amending the Marriage Act to permit gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual and intersex couples to marry. Overjoyed supporters of the legislation in the public gallery burst into song in celebration. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1. A series of bombings in Iraq occurred ahead of the elections, killing 42 people and injuring over 257 others in at least six provinces. 2. Jean Claude Mas, the founder of the French company PIP, went on trial over a scandal involving controversial breast implants. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing. 3. A powerful earthquake struck Pakistan's border with Iran, killing 34 people and injuring 80 others in Pakistan. Rescue efforts are underway. 4. Pakistan's former president, Pervez Musharraf, was confined to his home after a judge revoked his bail, hindering his plans to run in upcoming elections. 5.

Premise: A small child with turquoise shorts is standing near a large tree. Hypothesis: A small child stands by a tree. Based on the information provided in the premise, we can break down the details as follows: 1. There is a small child. 2. The small child is wearing turquoise shorts. 3. The small child is standing near a large tree. Now, let's break down the hypothesis: 1. There is a small child. 2. The small child stands by a tree. Comparing the details mentioned in both premise and hypothesis, we can notice some similarities and differences. The similarities are: both involve the presence of a small child, and both mention the child standing by or near a tree. The difference is in the details about the small child's attire (turquoise shorts) and the specific detail about the tree being large, which are mentioned in the premise but not in the hypothesis. The hypothesis omits these specific details and focuses on the broad idea of a small child standing by a tree. We can conclude that if the premise is true (the small child with turquoise shorts standing near a large tree), the broad idea mentioned in the hypothesis (a small child stands by a tree) is also true. The hypothesis is a simplified version of the premise, focusing on the essential elements and ignoring the specific details (turquoise shorts and large tree). Therefore, if the premise is true, the hypothesis can be considered true as it captures the fundamental concept of the situation. However, it is important to note that the hypothesis is not as detailed or specific as the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer is:","output":"No, the statement \\"Nixon's visit to the People's Republic of China in 1972 opened diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he initiated détente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year.\\" is not a reasonable answer to the question of when President Nixon resigned. It does, however, provide important information about President Nixon's foreign policy achievements during his time in office. To answer the question, President Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, due to the Watergate scandal that enveloped his presidency. Watergate was a political scandal involving President Nixon's administration, which was caught in illegal activities such as wiretapping and breaking into the Democratic National Committee's headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. The scandal that followed led to a series of investigations, and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against President Nixon for obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress. Fearing almost certain impeachment by the full House of Representatives and probable conviction by the Senate, Nixon decided to resign from his position as the 37th president of the United States. He is the only U.S. president in history to have resigned from office. His vice president, Gerald Ford, was sworn in as the 38th president and later pardoned Nixon for any crimes he may have committed during his presidency. In conclusion, President Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, due to the Watergate scandal. The provided statement about Nixon's foreign policy accomplishments is not directly related to the question but illustrates some of the prominent achievements of his presidency before the Watergate scandal overshadowed his legacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The negative keyword is weaker in sentiment compared to the positive ones. 4. Consider the context of the negative keyword: The \\"not a masterpiece\\" does not seem to be entirely negative, as the sentence continues with \\"but because it convinced me.\\" This suggests that although the film may not have been a perfect work of art, it still evoked positive emotions due to the growth of Portuguese cinema.

Question: A wasp uses poison in a stinger to Choose your answer from: (I). produce eggs.. (II). defend itself.. (III). build a nest.. (IV). attract a mate.. Answer:","output":"To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the primary function of a wasp's stinger and the role it plays in the wasp's survival. (I). Produce eggs - While wasps use their stingers to lay eggs in some cases, the poison within the stinger isn't directly involved in producing eggs. (II). Defend itself - This is the primary purpose of a wasp's stinger, as it injects venom into its target to deter predators and protect the wasp or its nest. (III). Build a nest - Wasps don't use their stingers to build their nests; instead, they use materials like wood pulp and mud. (IV). Attract a mate - A wasp's stinger doesn't play a role in attracting a mate, as wasps usually rely on chemical signals called pheromones to communicate with one another. Considering the primary function of a wasp's stinger, the correct answer is: Answer: (II). defend itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In 2003, the village of Carabane's official population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most of the population is Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée at the time of the first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.The indigenous population was originally animist, but while the fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% of the population of Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity.

Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-Platinum in several other countries. Their following studio album Meteora continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work. Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres on their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). Following the success of Hybrid Theory and Reanimation, Linkin Park spent a significant amount of time touring around the United States. The band members began to work on new material amidst its saturated schedule, spending a sliver of their free time in their tour bus' studio. The band officially announced the production of a new studio album in December 2002, revealing its new work was inspired by the rocky region of Meteora in Greece, where numerous monasteries have been built on top of the rocks. Meteora features a mixture of the band's nu metal and rap metal style with newer innovative effects, including the induction of a shakuhachi (a Japanese flute made of bamboo) and other instruments. Linkin Park's second album debuted on March 25, 2003 and instantly earned worldwide recognition, going to No. 1 in the US and UK, and No. 2 in Australia.  Meteora sold more than 800,000 copies during its first week, and it ranked as the best selling album on the Billboard charts at the time. The album's singles, including \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", \\"Breaking the Habit\\", \\"Faint\\", and \\"Numb\\", received significant radio attention. By October 2003, Meteora sold nearly three million copies. The album's success allowed Linkin Park to form another Projekt Revolution, which featured other bands and artists including Mudvayne, Blindside, and Xzibit. Additionally, Metallica invited Linkin Park to play at the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003, which included well-known acts such as Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne and Deftones. The band released an album and DVD, titled Live in Texas, which featured some audio and video tracks from the band's performances in Texas during the tour. In early 2004, Linkin Park started a world tour titled the Meteora World Tour. Supporting bands on the tour included Hoobastank, P.O.D., Story of the Year and Pia.  Meteora earned the band multiple awards and honors. The band won the MTV awards for Best Rock Video for \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" and the Viewer's Choice Award for \\"Breaking the Habit\\". Linkin Park also received significant recognition during the 2004 Radio Music Awards, winning the Artist of the Year and Song of the Year (\\"Numb\\") awards. Although Meteora was not nearly as successful as Hybrid Theory, it was the third best selling album in the United States during 2003. The band spent the first few months of 2004 touring around the world, first with the third Projekt Revolution tour, and later several European concerts. At the same time, the band's relationship with Warner Bros. Records was deteriorating rapidly on account of several trust and financial issues.

Article: Vancouver is located in the southwest corner of Canada in the province of British Columbia. Vancouver is the largest city in the province and the third largest in Canada. It covers an area of 113 sq km. It is surrounded by water on three sides and overlooked by the Coast Range. Its climate is one of the mildest in Canada. Temperatures average 3degC in January and 18degC in July. Vancouver's most rainfall occurs in winter.               Archaeological evidence shows that coastal Indians had settled the Vancouver area by 500 BC. British naval   captain George Vancouver explored the area in 1792. Vancouver was founded as a sawmill settlement called Granville in the 1870s. The city was united in 1886 and renamed after Captain Vancouver.               As the main western terminus of Canada's transcontinental highway and rail routes, Vancouver is the primary city of western Canada, as well as one of the nation's largest industrial centers.               The Port of Vancouver is Canada's largest and most various port, trading more than 43 billion in goods with more than 90 trading economies annually. Port activities generate 69,200 jobs in total with 4 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) and 8.9 billion in economic output.                Vancouver is a major tourist place.

The state primarily relies on sales tax, property tax, and taxes on specific industries like banking and tourism. 5. Texas: The state of Texas does not impose an individual income tax. Its primary sources of revenue are sales tax, property tax, and various business taxes such as franchise tax. 6. Washington: Washington does not have an individual income tax, and instead, it relies on sales tax, property tax, and a business and occupation tax. It is also among the states with no corporate income tax. 7. Wyoming: Like Alaska, Wyoming does not have an individual income tax or a state sales tax. Its primary sources of revenue are property taxes, mineral taxes (especially on oil, gas, and coal production), and severance taxes on natural resource extraction. These seven states have chosen not to levy an individual income tax on their residents as part of their respective fiscal and economic policies. While each adopts a unique approach to generate revenue, they all share the common attribute of not collecting income tax at the state level."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Roberta Adams skipped the thick how-to guide on child-custody forms and sat down at a computer at the Lamoreaux Justice Center in Orange on Wednesday. The Garden Grove woman answered a series of questions to create and print a form to file with the court. \\"It's easy,\\" said Adams, 25. \\"I thought I'd have all kinds of questions and have to take the forms home.\\" A University of California, Irvine, study released Wednesday found an interactive computer system effectively helps people fill out paperwork for restraining orders, eviction defense, small-claims cases and requests for filing-fee waivers. Not only does the system make life easier for people who can't afford a lawyer, but it also might improve efficiency in the courts because the forms, which are printed out when completed, are easy to read and are being filled out correctly, the study found. Since the program started in 2000, more than 6,000 people have used the free system, located in public buildings throughout Orange County. The system was developed by the Legal Aid Society of Orange County with about 800,000 in grants. The program avoids legal jargon, offers a courthouse video tour and sticks to a fifth-grade vocabulary. Users can choose English, Spanish or Vietnamese. Kiosks are in courthouses in Fullerton and Orange, the district attorney's family-support office, the Legal Aid Society in Santa Ana, Irvine City Hall and the San Juan Capistrano Library. The program is also available online. Bob Cohen, executive director of Legal Aid, said the study should clear the way for expansion throughout California. Locally, a program for divorce petitions will be added this summer. Cohen said the system proves the benefit of technology tailored to those who aren't computer-savvy. He said much of the technology now available requires Internet skills and access.

Tonight it was to select the sweetest whisper of love ever said between husband and wife. The final competition was held among 10 married couples. Seven of them were young ones, two middle-aged and one old. The last turn came to the old couple. The old lady took the microphone and said the sweetest whisper of love she had ever heard was: \\" Are you standing or sitting?\\" The host fixed his eyes on her, quite puzzled by her words. Regardless of all the talking around, she went on with her story. Her husband had been a doctor before he retired. One day when he was on duty at the hospital, he felt a sharp pain at the heart. By his professional knowledge he knew immediately he suffered a fit of heart attack. His colleagues carried him at once to the operation room and prepared  him for a bypass operation, which was highly risky. The patient's family members had to be informed before it began. The patient himself was allowed to put in a word. Lying silently on the operation table with a trembling hand, he dialed after a moment's thinking of the number of his wife's phone. Finally a familiar voice came from the other end... \\"So many years had passed but memory of this incident remained fresh in my mind.

Czech is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic by approximately 10.7 million people, and it is also spoken by Czech communities around the world. The Czech language is closely related to Slovak and has some similarities with Polish and Sorbian languages. The phrase \\"Špehuješ?\\" can be translated to \\"Are you spying?\\" in English. It is a question asking if someone is secretly watching or investigating someone or something. This term is often used in various contexts, ranging from casual conversations to serious situations involving surveillance and privacy. Czech, like other Slavic languages, has a rich and complex grammar system, with seven cases for nouns and adjectives, including nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental. Additionally, Czech verbs are conjugated for tense, mood, voice, person, and number, making the language quite complex for learners. The Czech alphabet is based on the Latin script and includes some unique letters with diacritical marks, such as \\"č,\\" \\"š,\\" and \\"ž,\\" which represent distinct consonant sounds. These characters, along with the specific pronunciation rules, give the Czech language its unique sound and phonetic qualities. The Czech language has a long literary and linguistic tradition, with some of its earliest written records dating back to the 11th century. Over the years, the Czech language has developed and evolved, absorbing loanwords from Latin, German, and other languages, while also creating new compounds and expressions to reflect modern societal and technological advancements. Today, Czech is known for its rich vocabulary, complexity, and distinctive pronunciation, making it an important part of the Slavic cultural and linguistic heritage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Eleven artists used the small, ordinary objects to create sculptures, portraits and wearable art. Some of the works are political, some are personal and others are just fun. Wright said each artist reimagines and repurposes the buttons to make art. \\"What I tried to do with this show,\\" he said , \\"was to look at artists who were promoting that level of craft.\\" He said he wanted the button art to be comparable to a painting \\"because of the amount of detail and precision in the work\\".

Summarize this article: As they chipped away at a wall inside a tunnel of the Clinton Correctional Facility last spring, David Sweat and Richard Matt had the Hollywood movie \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" on their minds.      The film tells the story of convicted murderer Andy Dufresne, who spends nearly two decades using a rock hammer to dig a tunnel out of his cell. The parallels were not lost on Sweat and Matt, who were trying to make their own escape.      State police are looking for 48-year-old Richard Matt, left, and 34-year-old David Sweat after troopers say they escaped from Clinton Correctional Facility. New York State Police      \\"We were laughing and joking about how Andy did it in 20 years. I think we might be able to do it in 10,\\" Sweat later told investigators.      Weeks later, Sweat and Matt were on the lam in one of the nation's most brazen breakouts. They spent three weeks running in upstate New York before Matt was killed and Sweat was wounded and captured.

To compile the report, investigators obtained sworn testimony from Sweat, who spent 85 nights cutting an escape path in the system of catwalks and tunnels behind cell walls, using tools smuggled in by prison seamstress Joyce Mitchell. Matt, he said, joined him in the tunnels for two nights of work before they finally made a break for it on June 5.      Stealing into the tunnels after 11 p.m. guard checks, they left dummies in their beds — and notes for prison staff.      \\"You left me no choice but to grow old & die in here. I had to do something,” Matt scrawled on a notepad, according to the report. On a painting he made of fictional mob boss Tony Soprano, he wrote, “Time to Go Kid!” with the date “6-5-15.” Sweat put up messages in the tunnel, meant for their pursuers. One was an image of an extraterrestrial with the note, “Are You Trying Me Punk?”      Notes left behind by David Sweat and Richard Matt when they escaped the Clinton Correctional Facility on June 5, 2015.

This chore helps ensure that the kitchen remains organized, which in turn makes meal preparation more efficient and pleasant. Furthermore, promptly cleaning dirty dishes helps to prevent the growth of bacteria and mold, as well as the spread of potential foodborne illnesses. To effectively wash dishes, follow these steps: 1. Preparation: Begin by removing any leftover food from the dishes. Scrape the food scraps into a compost bin or trash can. Stack the dishes by size and type, such as plates, bowls, and glasses, to make cleaning more manageable. If there are any particularly difficult food remnants, soak the dishes in warm, soapy water for several minutes before washing. 2. Fill the sink with water: Fill the sink with warm to hot water, and mix in some mild dish soap to create suds. Alternatively, you can use a plastic basin or tub if you don't have a sink available. 3. Wash: Using a dishcloth or sponge, scrub each dish thoroughly, making sure to remove any food debris and grease. Be gentle on delicate surfaces to prevent scratching. For stubborn grime or burned-on food, soaking the dish in warm soapy water may be helpful, or you can use a non-abrasive scrubbing pad or brush. 4. Rinse: Rinse each dish under warm water to remove soap residue. Make sure there are no suds left on the dishes, as they can leave a soapy taste on the dishes. 5. Dry: You can either air-dry the dishes by placing them on a drying rack or dry them with a clean, dry dish towel. Make sure to store the dishes properly afterward to maintain cleanliness and organization. By selecting the most suitable option, washing dishes, and following these steps, you can effectively address a kitchen with dishes astray and promote a clean, organized, and hygienic environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions, along with justifications for each step. 1. Gather ingredients: - 1 cup of uncooked long-grain white rice - 2 cups of water - 1 tablespoon of olive oil - 1 small onion, finely chopped - 1 green bell pepper, finely chopped - 2 cloves of garlic, minced - 1 (15-ounce) can of black-eyed peas, drained and rinsed - 1 teaspoon of salt - 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper - 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (optional) - 2 cups of cooked, shredded ham or bacon (Justification: Gathering all ingredients before you start prepares you for the cooking process while ensuring you have everything you need.) 2. Cook the rice: - Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan and add the uncooked rice. Lower the heat to simmer, cover, and cook for about 18-20 minutes or until the rice is tender and has absorbed the water. Then set aside. (Justification: This step ensures that the rice is cooked separately, which helps to prevent it from becoming mushy when combined with the other ingredients.) 3. Prepare the vegetables: - While the rice is cooking, finely chop the onion and green bell pepper, as well as mince the garlic. (Justification: Prepping the vegetables in advance streamlines the process and ensures they are evenly distributed in the dish.) 4. Sauté the vegetables: - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, green bell pepper, and garlic, and sauté for 5-7 minutes, or until the onions become translucent and the bell peppers are softened. (Justification: Sautéing the vegetables in olive oil brings out their flavors and helps to ensure even cooking.) 5. Add the black-eyed peas, cooked rice, and seasonings: - To the skillet with the sautéed vegetables, add the cooked rice, black-eyed peas, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using). Stir well to combine and cook for 3-4 minutes on medium-low heat, allowing the flavors to meld.

I didn't need to read the findings of a recent Australian research study to know that most women who live with their mates have more body fat than those who don't. For 10 years, researchers studied nearly 6,500 women, age 18 to 23, and found, according to one of the study's authors, Dr. Wendy J. Brown, that \\"Women with no partner and no baby averaged 11 pounds over 10 years. With a partner and no baby they gained about 15 pounds, and if they had a partner and a baby they gained 20 pounds.\\" (The findings appear in the February issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.) Researchers can speculate on the reasons for this, but it's not news to me. Of the thousands of women I've met who are desperately seeking to reshape their bodies, almost all are living with -- or just moved away from -- a partner. While I have heard many voices, their story is the same: They lust, then love. With lust comes starvation; with love, over-consumption and under-exercise. Their love transforms from the physical to the emotional, and this usually happens after they decide to live together. But once they lift their heads above the fog of love, they look down to find that their butts are sagging, bellies are bulging and thighs have taken on interesting new shapes! Come to think of it, many of the men who knock on my door looking for their abdominal muscles also deteriorated soon after moving in with their mates. Think about your man. Does he have the same waistline measurement as when you first signed the lease or mortgage papers? Probably not. In fact, it probably got even worse for both of you after your first child, didn't it? (The new Australian research references an earlier study that showed an increase in obesity in men once they'd had children.) Like the smokers I know, the overwhelming majority of whom hate to smoke, many women develop unhealthy patterns (like snacking on junk food at home) that lead to unhealthy bodies, which lead to a seriously unhealthy lack of self-esteem. We become \\"less desirable,\\" a phrase I hear far too often. Once we arrive at this place, the frantic search begins. Many of us will do anything to recover what was once our youthful body. Sadly, many waste time and money on fad diets, pills and potions. They end up doing the yo-yo thing, torturing their bodies through obsessive experimentation with an endless list of exercise programs, almost all of which fail them, because the will to really change behavior is not yet there. So, what can we do? First, we must think about the quality and standards of our everyday behavior more than the end result. If we can just focus on gradual improvement of our diet and our exercise programs, we will likely regain our healthier, slimmer form. But more important, we will also build our self-respect. So, taking intelligent steps (i.e., coming up with a rational workout plan or shopping for fresher and healthier foods and eating them, not impulse snacks), carrying the steps out consistently -- more frequently and for a longer duration -- will have a huge net benefit on our bottoms and our bottom line: love. Next, we should include our mates in our process. In my experience, for example, couples who work out together have greater success in achieving their health and weight loss goals. They also seem to get along much better and stay together longer. Transform your personal physical development time into \\"date time,\\" doing something as simple as taking regular after-dinner walks together. Finally, cut back, but don't cut out the fun stuff. When we are consistent with our diet and exercise programs, there is no need for maniacal starvation. We don't need to sit at the dinner table with a radish on our plate, while our children and mates enjoy full meals. A healthy diet should not be some kind of intruder in our relationships, it should be a natural part of our lives. Besides, fun foods are what make our love lives more interesting and memorable. So eat! But only if you do the work on the other side of those calories. Having a healthy, fit and feminine physique and a deeply loving emotional relationship are not mutually exclusive. You can have both; and it can be done in a fun and positive way. For those of you about to move in, heed this advice: Start your program now, before your belly and your mate's interest start to sag! I promise: if you don't quit, you'll have a body that won't quit! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tracy Anderson. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses the findings of an Australian research study that showed women with partners and children tend to gain more weight than those without.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Dan likes to experiment with different food items. Today, he wants to make curds out of milk and see how it differs from plain milk. For his experiment he collected three bottles of milk, bottle A, bottle B, and bottle C. Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk.  But I can use this background: Curds are a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins.  What is an answer for this question: Would bottle B milk need or not need added lactic acid bacteria to produce curd?","output":"To answer the question of whether or not bottle B milk would need added lactic acid bacteria to produce curd, we first need to understand the different types of milk involved in this experiment and the process of making curd. As mentioned, bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, while bottle C milk is just raw milk. Pasteurization is a heat treatment applied to milk, which kills most of the bacteria, including lactic acid bacteria that are naturally present in raw milk. Raw milk, on the other hand, contains a diverse microbial population which includes lactic acid bacteria that can cause milk to sour and curdle over time. In Dan's experiment, he is making curd out of bottle B (pasteurized) and bottle C (raw) milk. Since bottle A milk is not being used for making curd, it is not relevant to the question.  Now, focusing on bottle B milk, which is pasteurized, the process of pasteurization kills most of the bacteria including the natural lactic acid bacteria. When making curds, it is the presence of lactic acid bacteria that helps in the coagulation of milk proteins (casein) into solid masses, or curds. Since the pasteurization of bottle B milk significantly reduces the number of naturally present lactic acid bacteria, it would be necessary to add lactic acid bacteria to start the coagulation process and produce curd. There are a few different ways to reintroduce lactic acid bacteria into bottle B milk: 1. Inoculating with a store-bought or homemade starter culture containing lactic acid bacteria, like yogurt or bacterial cultures specifically designed for cheesemaking. 2. Adding a small amount of raw milk containing active lactic acid bacteria to the pasteurized milk. 3. Leaving the pasteurized milk to sit at room temperature and allowing the limited amount of remaining lactic acid bacteria to multiply, naturally souring, and curdling the milk (although this method is less reliable and might lead to inconsistent curd formation). In conclusion, bottle B milk, being pasteurized, would need added lactic acid bacteria to initiate the process of curd formation effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a new situation: Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight.  But I can use this background: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

Destiny's Child was an American girl group whose final and best-known line-up comprised Beyonce Knowles, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams. Formed in 1997 in Houston, Texas, Destiny's Child members began their musical career as Girl's Tyme, formed in 1990, comprising Knowles, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett among others. After years of limited success, the quartet were signed in 1997 to Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment as Destiny's Child. Destiny's Child was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of their best-selling second album, The Writing's on the Wall (1999), which contained the number-one singles \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" and \\"Say My Name\\". In 1990, Beyonce Knowles met rapper LaTavia Roberson while auditioning for a girl group. Based in Houston, Texas, they were joined to a group that performed rapping and dancing. Kelly Rowland, who relocated to Knowles' house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including Tamar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor. With Knowles and Rowland, Girl's Tyme attracted nationwide attention: west-coast R&B producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them. He brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with focus on Knowles' vocals because Frager thought she had personality and the ability to sing. With efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major record deal, Frager's strategy was to debut the group in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time. However, they lost the competition because, according to Knowles, their choice of song was wrong; they were actually rapping instead of singing.  Because of the group's defeat, Knowles' father, Mathew, voluntarily dedicated his time to manage them. Mathew Knowles decided to cut the original lineup to four, with the removal of Davis and the Taylor sisters and the inclusion of LeToya Luckett in 1993. Aside from spending time at their church in Houston, Girl's Tyme practiced in their backyards and at Headliners Salon, owned by Knowles' mother, Tina. The group would test routines in the salon, when it was on Montrose Boulevard in Houston, and sometimes would collect tips from the customers. Their try out would be critiqued by the people inside. During their school days, Girl's Tyme performed at local gigs. When summer came, Mathew Knowles established a \\"boot camp\\" to train them in dance and vocal lessons. After rigorous training, they began performing as opening acts for established R&B groups of that time such as SWV, Dru Hill and Immature. Tina Knowles designed the group's attire for their performances.  Over the course of the early years in their career, Girl's Tyme changed their name to Something Fresh, Cliche, the Dolls, and to Destiny. The group signed with Elektra Records with the name Destiny, but were dropped several months later before they could release an album. The pursuit of a record deal affected the Knowles family: in 1995, Mathew Knowles resigned from his job as a medical-equipment salesman, a move that reduced Knowles' family's income by half, and her parents briefly separated due to the pressure. In 1996, they changed their name to Destiny's Child, which was taken from a passage in the Book of Isaiah. Mathew Knowles helped in negotiating a record deal with Columbia Records, which signed the group that same year. Prior to signing with Columbia, the group had recorded several tracks in Oakland, California produced by D'wayne Wiggins of Tony! Toni!

Options: (a). stress the accuracy of Venice's fame for peace (b). reduce the damage to Venice's enviironment (c). depend less on the crusie industry (d). limit the number of toursits Read the following article and answer the question. Article: When travelers think of an Adriatic cruise, scenes of Venice, Italy--its canals, bridges, piazzas, and stunning architecture--come to mind. It's one of the most popular cruise destinations in Europe. And for many, the sail-away from Venice, through its Giudecca Canal, is an awe-inspiring experience. Venice may be known as La Serenissima, or \\"the most peaceful,\\" which, however, isn't entirely accurate these days. Venetians have been increasingly concerned about the impact of tourism and the potential for an environmental disaster off its shoreline due to the number of cruise ships that enter and exit its lagoon . That's why earlier last month, Venice announced a new policy to forbid the transit  of cruise ships to the city via the Giudecca Canal. It's not that the city wants to shun the cruise industry altogether: It simply wants to force traffic further away from the landmarks along the shoreline. City officials say that most ships will now transit the Contorta Sant'Angelo Canal. Additionally, the city is _ the size of ships that can visit Venice, as well as the total number of ships that call on it on a daily basis. As of January 2014, Venice plans to reduce the visitations of larger ships (those that are 40,000 tons or heavier) by 20 percent. This effectively caps the number of ships that can enter per day to five. In November, ships heavier than 96,000 tons will not be allowed to enter Guidecca Canal at all. How the city plans to carry out the new five-ships-per-day rule remains to be seen and have yet to be announced. Which ships will be allowed passage? Will it be first-come, first-served? However they proceed, cruise line executives want their passengers to know that Venice will remain a regular port of call--even if the transit to and from the city must evolve. Question: The new policy was issued in order to  _  .

This article: Released in September 1980, Never for Ever saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first experience as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker \\"Violin\\" to the wistful waltz of hit single \\"Army Dreamers\\". Never for Ever was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top. The top-selling single from the album was \\"Babooshka\\", which reached number five in the UK singles chart. In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again\\", which reached number 29 in the UK charts. September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced by herself. With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become \\"less accessible\\". In a 1993 interview with Q (magazine), Bush stated: \\"That was my 'She's gone mad' album.\\" However, the album became her first to enter the US Billboard 200 chart, albeit only reaching number 157. The album entered the UK album chart at number-three, but is to date her lowest-selling album, garnering only a silver disc.\\"Sat in Your Lap\\" was the first single from the album to be released.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Soren, a young barn owl, lives in the Tyto Forest with his family: his father, Noctus; his mother, Marella; his older brother, Kludd; his younger sister, Eglantine; and Mrs. P, the family's nest maid, a kindly blind snake. Soren enjoys listening to the 'Legends of Ga'Hoole,' which are mythical tales of warrior owls called the Guardians who fight against the Pure Ones. Kludd berates his brother's dreams, having grown tired of listening to the stories. When their father teaches them the first steps to flying, Kludd becomes jealous of Soren's natural branching ability. Later, when practicing branching while their parents are hunting, Kludd pushes Soren off a branch which forces them both to fall to the ground. They are attacked by a Tasmanian devil but are saved, and then kidnapped, by two owls, Jatt and Jutt. Along the way, more owlets are revealed to have been kidnapped. Soren meets Gylfie, a young elf owl who is also kidnapped. At St. Aegolius, the owlets are greeted by Nyra, who says that they will be divided into either soldiers or 'pickers'. When Soren and Gylfie protest, they are sorted as pickers while Kludd, who betrays Soren, is sent to be a soldier. Soren and Gylfie avoid being 'moon-blinked' (a catatonic state induced by sleeping under a full moon), while the others do not know and become moon-blinked. They are forced to 'pick' through owl's pellets, scouring for bits of metal 'flecks', which are being used to build a superweapon. They are spotted by Grimble, a boreal owl, who reveals that he works under the Pure Ones only to keep his family safe and that he isn't really a Pure One at all. He teaches them to fly, but Nyra finds out whilst coming to invite Soren to become a soldier. Kludd decides to stay behind and become a Pure One, despite Soren's pleas for him to come with him. Grimble... My question: What is Soren?

A symptom is subjective, observed by the patient, and cannot be measured directly, whereas a sign is objectively observable by others. For example, paresthesia is a symptom (only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling), whereas erythema is a sign (anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual). Symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses, helping to narrow down what may be wrong. In other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic.  - The members of Triatominae , a subfamily of Reduviidae, are also known as conenose bugs, kissing bugs, assassin bugs, or vampire bugs. Other local names for them used in the Latin Americas include barbeiros, vinchucas, pitos and chinches. Most of the 130 or more species of this subfamily are haematophagous, i.e. feeds on vertebrate blood; a very few species feed on other invertebrates (Sandoval \\"et al.\\" 2000, 2004). They are mainly found and widespread in the Americas, with a few species present in Asia, Africa, and Australia. These bugs usually share shelter with nesting vertebrates, from which they suck blood. In areas where Chagas disease occurs (from the southern United States to northern Argentina), all triatomine species are potential vectors of the Chagas disease parasite \\"Trypanosoma cruzi\\", but only those species (such as \\"Triatoma infestans\\" and \\"Rhodnius prolixus\\") that are well adapted to living with humans are considered important vectors.  - Carlos Justiniano Ribeiro Chagas , or Carlos Chagas ( Portuguese : ( kaluutninu ibeju a ) , ( kalua ) ; 1879 -- 1934 ) , was a Brazilian sanitary physician , scientist and bacteriologist who worked as a clinician and researcher . He discovered Chagas disease , also called American trypanosomiasis in 1909 , while working at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in Rio de Janeiro . Chagas ' work holds a unique place in the history of medicine . Working in primitive conditions , Chagas described in detail a previously unknown infectious disease : its pathogen , vector ( Triatominae ) , host , clinical manifestations and epidemiology . Chagas was also the first to discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus Pneumocystis , later infamous for being linked to PCP ( Pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS patients ) .  - A lymph node or lymph gland, is an ovoid or kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system, and of the adaptive immune system, that is widely present throughout the body. They are linked by the lymphatic vessels as a part of the circulatory system. Lymph nodes are major sites of B and T lymphocytes, and other white blood cells. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles and cancer cells. Lymph nodes do not have a detoxification function, which is primarily dealt with by the liver and kidneys.  - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.  - A medic is an umbrella term for a person involved in medicine. The following fall under this term: a physician, paramedic, medical student, and sometimes a medically-trained individual participating in the role of a medic such as an emergency medical responder.   - Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce. Infectious disease, also known as transmissible disease or communicable disease, is illness resulting from an infection. Infections are caused by infectious agents including viruses, viroids, prions, bacteria, nematodes such as parasitic roundworms and pinworms, arthropods such as ticks, mites, fleas, and lice, fungi such as ringworm, and other macroparasites such as tapeworms and other helminths.  - A physician, medical practitioner, medical doctor or simply doctor is a professional who practises medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining, or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients and methods of treatmentknown as specialitiesor they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communitiesknown as general practice. Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines (such as anatomy and physiology) underlying diseases and their treatmentthe \\"science\\" of medicineand also a decent competence in its applied practicethe art or \\"craft\\" of medicine.  - Heart failure (HF), often referred to as congestive heart failure (CHF), occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the body's needs. Signs and symptoms commonly include shortness of breath, excessive tiredness, and leg swelling. The shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise, while lying down, and may wake the person at night. A limited ability to exercise is also a common feature. Chest pain, including angina, does not typically occur due to heart failure. Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease including a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause. These cause heart failure by changing either the structure or the functioning of the heart. There are two main types of heart failure: \\"heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction\\" and \\"heart failure with normal ejection fraction\\" depending on whether the ability of the left ventricle to contract is affected, or the heart's ability to relax. The severity of disease is usually graded by the degree of problems with exercise. Heart failure is not the same as myocardial infarction (in which part of the heart muscle dies) or cardiac arrest (in which blood flow stops altogether). Other diseases that may have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver problems, anemia, and thyroid disease. The condition is diagnosed based on the history of the symptoms and a physical examination with confirmation by echocardiography. Blood tests, electrocardiography, and chest radiography may be useful to determine the underlying cause. Treatment depends on the severity and cause of the disease. In people with chronic stable mild heart failure, treatment commonly consists of lifestyle modifications such as stopping smoking, physical exercise, and dietary changes, as well as medications. In those with heart failure due to left ventricular...  - Trypanosoma cruzi is a species of parasitic euglenoids. Amongst the protozoa, the trypanosomes characteristically bore tissue in another organism and feed on blood (primarily) and also lymph. This behaviour causes disease or the likelihood of disease that varies with the organism: for example, trypanosomiasis in humans (Chagas disease in South America ), dourine and surra in horses, and a brucellosis-like disease in cattle. Parasites need a host body and the haematophagous insect triatomine (descriptions \\"assassin bug\\", \\"cone-nose bug\\", and \\"kissing bug\\") is the major vector in accord with a mechanism of infection. The triatomine likes the nests of vertebrate animals for shelter, where it bites and sucks blood for food. Individual triatomines infected with protozoa from other contact with animals transmit trypanosomes when the triatomine deposits its faeces on the host's skin surface and then bites. Penetration of the infected faeces is further facilitated by the scratching of the bite area by the human or animal host.  - Oswaldo Gonçalves Cruz, better known as Oswaldo Cruz (August 5, 1872 in São Luís do Paraitinga, São Paulo province, Brazil  February 11, 1917 in Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro state), was a Brazilian physician, bacteriologist, epidemiologist and public health officer and the founder of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute.  - Pathology (from the Greek roots of \\"pathos\\", meaning \\"experience\\" or \\"suffering\\", and \\"-logia\\", \\"study of\\") is a significant component of the causal study of disease and a major field in modern medicine and diagnosis.  - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.  - The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease. To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the bloodbrain barrier, bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluidbrain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain.  - Public health refers to \\"the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting human health through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals.\\" It is concerned with threats to health based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people, or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). The dimensions of health can encompass \\"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity,\\" as defined by the United Nations' World Health Organization. Public health incorporates the interdisciplinary approaches of epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. Environmental health, community health, behavioral health, health economics, public policy, insurance medicine, mental health and occupational safety and health are other important subfields.  - A parasitic disease, also known as parasitosis, is an infectious disease caused or transmitted by a parasite. Many parasites do not cause diseases. Parasitic diseases can affect practically all living organisms, including plants and mammals. The study of parasitic diseases is called parasitology.  - Immunodeficiency (or immune deficiency) is a state in which the immune system's ability to fight infectious disease and cancer is compromised or entirely absent. Most cases of immunodeficiency are acquired (\\"secondary\\") due to extrinsic factors that affect the patient's immune system. Examples of these extrinsic factors include HIV infection, extremes of age, and environmental factors, such as nutrition. In the clinical setting, the immunosuppression by some drugs, such as steroids, can be either an adverse effect or the intended purpose of the treatment. Examples of such use is in organ transplant surgery as an anti-rejection measure and in patients suffering from an overactive immune system, as in autoimmune diseases. Some people are born with intrinsic defects in their immune system, or primary immunodeficiency. A person who has an immunodeficiency of any kind is said to be immunocompromised. An immunocompromised person may be particularly vulnerable to opportunistic infections, in addition to normal infections that could affect everyone. Immunodeficiency also decreases cancer immunosurveillance, in which the immune system scans the body's cells and kills neoplastic ones.  - Health is the level of functional and metabolic efficiency of a living organism. In humans it is the ability of individuals or communities to adapt and self-manage when facing physical, mental or social changes. The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in its 1948 constitution as \\"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\\" This definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value, the ambiguity in developing cohesive health strategies, and because of the problem created by use of the word \\"complete\\". Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction.  - Autoimmunity is the system of immune responses of an organism against its own healthy cells and tissues. Any disease that results from such an aberrant immune response is termed an autoimmune disease. Prominent examples include celiac disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Addison's disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, polymyositis (PM), and dermatomyositis (DM). Autoimmune diseases are very often treated with steroids.  - Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protozoan \\"Trypanosoma cruzi\\". It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs. The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 812 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 6070% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure. An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people. \\"T. cruzi\\" is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the blood-sucking \\"kissing bugs\\" of the subfamily Triatominae. These insects are known by a number of local names, including: \\"vinchuca\\" in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, \\"barbeiro\\" (the barber) in Brazil, \\"pito\\" in Colombia, \\"chinche\\" in Central America, and \\"chipo\\" in Venezuela. The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, eating food contaminated with the parasites, and by vertical transmission (from a mother to her fetus). Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope. Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for \\"T. cruzi\\" in the blood. Prevention mostly involves eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine has not been developed as of 2013. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of endstage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox...

He has everything: wealth, friends, and an unshakeable charm that attracts people from all walks of life.

Article: If your arms are wet or sweaty when you apply your deodorant or antiperspirant, it’s not going to work as well and stains are more likely to form. Wipe off any moisture underneath your arms before applying deodorant or antiperspirant, and let the application dry completely. It’s common to think that applying more deodorant or antiperspirant will help you smell or sweat less, but this isn’t necessarily the case. It’s much better to apply an even layer that is thin and controlled. Don’t apply too much, as this can cause stains. Research has shown that it's possible for your body to become immune to your antiperspirant after several months. So if you're frustrated by your deodorant or antiperspirant because it doesn't seem to be working anymore, try switching it up and trying out a different one. You can always go back to your favorite after a few months. If you find yourself constantly sweating and are looking for a better solution, think about trying a prescription deodorant or antiperspirant. These still have lots of aluminum, but they’re less likely to ruin your day-time clothes because you apply the prescription at night. The prescription will most likely cause a bit of damage to your sleepwear, so throw on an old t-shirt or nightgown before going to bed. Many deodorants have aluminum in them, which helps you sweat less. However, the aluminum causes the sweat that you do produce to leave more prominent stains on your clothing. By switching to a natural deodorant or antiperspirant, you’ll avoid all of the harmful chemicals that are in regular deodorants and help prevent stains as well. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article discusses the proper application and use of deodorants and antiperspirants to minimize staining on clothes and maintain their effectiveness. It suggests wiping off moisture before application, applying a thin and even layer, considering a periodic change of product to avoid immunity, and trying prescription alternatives for excessive sweating. Additionally, the article highlights that using natural deodorants can help avoid harmful chemicals and prevent stains due to the absence of aluminum."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism? is inside the article: At this point Lissitzky subscribed fully to suprematism and, under the guidance of Malevich, helped further develop the movement. In 1919–1920 Lissitzky was a head of Architectural department at the People's Art School where with his students, primarily Lazar Khidekel, he was working on transition from plane to volumetric suprematism. Lissitzky designed On the New System of Art by Malevich, who responded in December 1919: \\"Lazar Markovich, I salute you on the publication of this little book\\". Perhaps the most famous work by Lissitzky from the same period was the 1919 propaganda poster \\"Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge\\". Russia was going through a civil war at the time, which was mainly fought between the \\"Reds\\" (communists, socialists and revolutionaries) and the \\"Whites\\" (monarchists, conservatives, liberals and other socialists who opposed the Bolshevik Revolution). The image of the red wedge shattering the white form, simple as it was, communicated a powerful message that left no doubt in the viewer's mind of its intention. The piece is often seen as alluding to the similar shapes used on military maps and, along with its political symbolism, was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism into a style his own. He stated: \\"The artist constructs a new symbol with his brush. This symbol is not a recognizable form of anything that is already finished, already made, or already existent in the world – it is a symbol of a new world, which is being built upon and which exists by the way of the people.\\"In January 17, 1920, Malevich and Lissitzky co-founded the short-lived Molposnovis (Young followers of a new art), a proto-suprematist association of students, professors, and other artists. After a brief and stormy dispute between \\"old\\" and \\"young\\" generations, and two rounds of renaming, the group reemerged as UNOVIS (Exponents of the new art) in February.

Translate to English","output":"\\"Investment policy must also take into account the priorities of the European Union's foreign policy.\\" In the context of investment policy, it is essential to consider the priorities of the European Union's (EU) foreign policy. The EU is a political and economic union that consists of 27 member countries, and its external actions are governed by a set of shared goals and principles established in various treaties and documents, including the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Global Strategy for the European Union's Foreign and Security Policy. These priorities primarily aim to foster peace, security, and prosperity for the EU and its neighbors while promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law worldwide. Some of the EU's foreign policy priorities include: 1. Peace and Security: The EU works to ensure stability in its neighborhood, particularly in the Western Balkans and the Eastern neighborhood. It addresses crises and conflicts through diplomacy, sanctions, and, if necessary, military or civilian operations. The EU also supports global disarmament and non-proliferation initiatives. 2. Trade and Economic Diplomacy: The EU is a major trading partner, and its foreign policy seeks to create a level playing field for its businesses and industries on the international stage. EU trade policy aims to promote fair trade, sustainable development, and investment to create jobs and economic growth. 3. Development Cooperation: The EU provides development aid to countries in need to support initiatives that focus on sustainable development, poverty reduction, and long-term peace and stability. This includes funding programs in areas such as education, healthcare, agriculture, and infrastructure. 4. Climate Change and Environmental Protection: As the world faces the growing challenges of climate change, the EU actively participates in international negotiations and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support clean energy transition. 5. Human Rights and Democracy: Upholding human rights, the rule of law, and democratic principles is a cornerstone of the EU's external actions, and it supports these values through various policy and funding instruments, including its partnerships with international organizations like the United Nations. In shaping an investment policy, the interests of the European Union's foreign policy must be taken into account to ensure that investments contribute to these goals and do not undermine them. This means that investors and policymakers should consider the potential social, economic, and political impact of their investments on the stability of the regions, as well as how investments might align with the EU's broader objectives such as promoting human rights, sustainable development, and climate change mitigation or adaptation. In summary, it is vital to analyze and understand the priorities of the European Union's foreign policy framework when developing an investment policy. Considering these priorities can contribute to securing long-term stability and growth for all parties involved and strengthen the bonds between nations and regions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Under his progressive government the old regime was tenuously reconciled to his liberal policies. During this period of upheaval in the provinces he declared that all the estates of the Church, its congregations, and its religious orders were national property—though in Valencia, most of this property was subsequently acquired by the local bourgeoisie. City life in Valencia carried on in a revolutionary climate, with frequent clashes between liberals and republicans, and the constant threat of reprisals by the Carlist troops of General Cabrera.

News article: Mitt Romney's aides announced amid the Newt Gingrich campaign breakdown that he'll be skipping the Ames Straw Poll, a crucial test of organizational strength in Iowa and an event he spent a hefty 1 million on in 2007, only to lose the caucuses.      Mitt Romney's aides have done a delicate dance managing expectations about how strongly he'll play in Iowa, and the argument against competing at Ames for him is his already-high name recognition and current poll standing in the state. To lose at Ames would raise doubts about his grassroots support and create a real perception problem.      He's also still planning on taking part in a Fox News debate scheduled shortly before the straw poll, and has said he'll compete in the caucuses. He also has staff muscle in Iowa, and he's skipping a Florida straw poll as well.      The dwindling number of potential anti-Romneys in the field clearly makes it an easier option for him.      But it's also designed to dampen the significance of the event, which will be a springboard to a candidate from the right who could take on Romney. It was less than two weeks ago, while in Arkeny, that Romney said he was \\"committed\\" to the process, but he hedged about whether he'd take part in Ames.      In spinning his decision, Romney will be confronted by his own 2007 statements in which he held up Rudy Giuliani and John McCain's absence from the straw poll as a sign that they were not as sufficiently committed to the Iowa as him.      \\"If you're going to participate in the Iowa process, then you better get in the straw poll,\\" he said four years ago.      Romney opponents will ask why that process apparently doesn't include Ames for him any longer.      Tim Pawlenty's team seized on the announcement.      \\"The Ames straw poll is a great gathering of conservatives, and Governor Pawlenty's solid record will be well received there,\\" was the cheery statement from Iowa Steering Committee Chairman Matt Whitaker. \\"I look forward to joining thousands of Iowans in casting my vote for Governor Pawlenty in Ames this summer and in the caucuses this winter.\\"      Republican Party of Iowa chairman Matt Strawn was clearly displeased, but made a relatively mild statement saying, \\"I’ll leave it to the pundits and voters to assess the wisdom of skipping an event of tremendous importance to tens of thousands of Iowa Republicans and caucus-goers.\\"      Strawn, who has been fighting to try to keep the caucuses relevant in picking the eventual nominee, predicted Ames will still be a success.      Team Romney put out a string of statements to defend the decision, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.      \\"Our campaign has made the decision to not participate in any straw polls, whether it’s in Florida, Iowa, Michigan or someplace else,\\" said campaign manager Matt Rhoades, insisting this was a decision about directing resources, something Romney's campaign isn't lacking.      The campaign also put out statements praising his decision from former party chairs-turned-supporters, including former Iowa GOP chairman Brian Kennedy, saying, \\"The campaign is making a smart decision to not to compete in the upcoming series of straw polls. Mitt’s focus is on winning the nomination, not the straw polls. Mitt will be back in Iowa this summer and will participate in the Ames debate.”      However, if a frontrunner bypassed Ames when Kennedy was chairman, his statement at the time would probably have been more like Strawn's. ||||| « Previous | Main | Next »      Mitt Romney Bows Out of Iowa Straw Poll to Focus Resources Elsewhere      ABC News' Emily Friedman reports:      Presidential candidate Mitt Romney will not attend the Iowa Straw Poll this August, an event long known to be one of the first indicators of how a campaign might fair in the crucial Hawkeye State.      And Romney's aides said tonight that the former governor will not only bow out of the Iowa Straw Poll but will not take part in any straw polls during his campaign, a nod to their vows to run a \\"wiser\\" and \\"leaner\\" campaign this time around.      Campaign manager Matt Rhoades said tonight in an email statement, \\"Our campaign has made the decision to not participate in any straw polls, whether it’s in Florida, Iowa, Michigan or someplace else.\\"      \\"In the last presidential campaign we were both strengthened as an organization and learned some important lessons by participating in them,\\" wrote Rhoades. \\"This time we will focus our energies and resources on winning primaries and caucuses. We look forward to bringing Mitt Romney’s strong pro-jobs message to every part of the country.\\"      In his 2008 White House bid, Romney won the Iowa Straw Poll but was largely criticized for millions of dollars spent to attract voters to the event. Despite the money he spent on the event, Romney later came in second-place in the 2008 Iowa caucuses to Arkansas Republican Mike Huckabee in 2008. So far this campaign Romney has made several remarks indicating that his campaign will use their resources more sparingly.      Romney will still participate in the Fox News debate scheduled to be held in Ames on August 11, just days before the straw poll.      Statements by former GOP chairmen in Michigan, Iowa and Florida released by the Romney campaign tonight lauded the presidential hopeful's decision to focus his resources on other campaign efforts and not straw polls.      \\"The campaign is making a smart decision to not compete in the upcoming series of straw polls,\\" said Brian Kennedy, former Iowa GOP Chair. \\"Mitt's focus is on winning the nomination, not the straw polls.\\"      Former Florida GOP Chairman John Trasher added, \\"The campaign's decision to not participate in any straw polls makes strategic sense. Florida is an expensive state to campaign in. As a candidate that has already proven his organization strength and support in Florida, it's smart for him to focus his time and resources on winning the actual primary.\\"      Iowa GOP Chairman Matt Strawn seemed less pleased about Romney's decision in his own release in which he wrote, \\"I’ll leave it to the pundits and voters to assess the wisdom of skipping an event of tremendous importance to tens of thousands of Iowa Republicans and caucusgoers.”      “More than ever, Iowa Republicans are energized and motivated to utilize the Ames Straw Poll as a catalyst toward building a 99-county organization to deny President Obama a second term,\\" said Strawn.      Romney's announcement that he will not attend the straw poll in Iowa later this summer comes on the heels of a multi-stop trip to the state late last month, during which he spoke at length about how much he values Iowa voters.      “You’ll have plenty of opportunity to see me,” Romney said in May. “I care about Iowa.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Mitt Romney's aides have announced that he will be skipping the Ames Straw Poll, an event he spent 1 million on in 2007.

Romney still plans to take part in a Fox News debate prior to the straw poll and compete in the caucuses. His opponents criticize this decision by recalling Romney's past statements about the importance of participating in the Iowa process and the straw poll.

Agent Orange was a herbicide the US Government used during the Vietnam War to kill foliage making it easier for US Troops to see through the dense jungle canopy.      The adverse effects of Agent Orange on our veterans was unknown to them during their service.      Now over 400,000 Vietnam vets are suffering from their exposure.      Expeditions Orange’s goals during the campaign:      To raise national awareness for the issue of Agent Orange exposure and the resulting illnesses.      To meet and interview veterans, family members, doctors and experts in regards to Agent Orange and their personal stories.      To create a Video Documentary of the ride and interviews which will serve as a tool to help expand outreach, while also serving as a resource tool that Vietnam veterans and their families can use to find assistance.      To raise money through the Exhibition Orange 501(c)(3) charitable organization which will be utilized to directly help affected Vietnam veterans receive a proper “Thank You” using the “Make A Wish” model.      To honor the stories of the many who have suffered and continue to suffer from the horrors of Agent Orange.

(Associated Press)      In this Wednesday, April 19, 2017 photo, Iraq war veteran Colt Romberger pauses behind an American flag hanging from his trailer in Santa Clarita, Calif. Romberger is training his horse for a ride from California to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington in hopes to raise money for veterans causes and... (Associated Press)      SANTA CLARITA, California (AP) — The two things Colt Romberger and his father had most in common, the ones that made them best friends as well as father and son, were a deep affection for horses and an equally deep pride in having served their country in times of war.      So when Cliff Romberger, a Vietnam War veteran and onetime wrangler of horses on Hollywood film sets, died in 2015 of a brain disease doctors attributed to his exposure to the chemical defoliant Agent Orange, his son knew there was but one way to honor him: He would saddle up his horse and ride it from the Pacific Ocean to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington.      On Monday the compact, muscular 32-year-old Iraq war veteran will begin that journey through big-city streets, across desert sand and over mountain ranges and prairies, aboard a handsome gray-and-black 4-year-old quarter horse named Gus.      Along the way he hopes to accomplish several things: raise money for veterans causes through a nonprofit foundation he's established, tell the public about the devastating, deadly effect the use of Agent Orange is having on thousands of aging bodies of Vietnam veterans and, with stops at town halls across the country, let those veterans know they have not been forgotten.      \\"I've spoken to so many Vietnam vets, and they've emailed me. Sometimes it breaks my heart hearing their stories,\\" he says in a voice momentarily choked with emotion.      There was the guy in Norfolk, Virginia, who heard of the ride and sent him 200. When Romberger called to thank him he learned the man was dying of a form of leukemia he believed had been caused by Agent Orange but that had not yet been classified as such because there hadn't been enough cases for the Department of Veterans Affairs to study. He was hoping the government could make that connection in time to add his wife to his survivor's benefits.      \\"And then he passed away, and he never got the approval,\\" Romberger says quietly as he sits on the patio of a friend's ranch in a semi-rural section of the picturesque suburb of Santa Clarita, 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Los Angeles. Gus is in a pen nearby, playfully grabbing at a large log he's turned into a toy. They've just finished a lengthy endurance ride through surrounding canyons.      Colt Romberger has been preparing for this ride for nearly two years, and like all good cowboys, the reserve Pasadena police officer, Air Force reserve intelligence analyst and part-time actor will bring along a sidekick. It's his late father's best friend.      \\"He said, 'Kenny, I'm going to do this. You want to go?' I said, 'You bet,' so I told his mom I'll make sure he's taken care of, and so here we are,\\" said Kenny Reichel, who is putting his business restoring antique cars on hold for the six months the ride is expected to take.      Reichel will drive a truck carrying supplies and pulling a horse trailer while scouting for places man and horse might bed down for the night.      It will pretty much be Gus who sets the pace, Romberger said, adding when the horse gets tired they'll stop. He estimates they can average 25 miles (40 kilometers) a day.      \\"The potential of getting injured on this thing is high,\\" he acknowledges. \\"When you're riding on city streets, a horse can spook and get hit by a truck.\\"      To prepare, he's been riding Gus through some of the busy streets of Los Angeles and Pasadena.      Recently he dropped by the Pasadena Police Department, which has granted him a leave of duty for the ride.      \\"I wish I had taken a picture,\\" Police Chief Phillip Sanchez says with a chuckle. \\"Picture the classic Gary Cooper 'High Noon,' right? He's got this brown Stetson hat on, he's wearing a pair of 501 button-down Levi jeans, a pair of brown boots that have probably seen more cow dung than I want to imagine, and spurs of all things.\\"      The department \\"couldn't be more proud of him,\\" Sanchez adds, and will be following his ride on social media.      Veterans Affairs has recognized more than a dozen diseases it presumes to be connected with exposure to Agent Orange, the defoliant sprayed on the Vietnam countryside to eliminate ground cover hiding enemy troops. After learning how toxic it was, the U.S. banned its use in 1971.      Romberger's father, stationed with the Air Force in Vietnam in 1970 and '71, knew he was exposed but had no idea of the debilitating effects it would cause.      After that exposure, Romberger says, it's likely nothing would have prevented his father from contracting the brain-wasting disease that killed him. But, he adds, his father could have been diagnosed years earlier, providing time to better plan his future and make his final years more comfortable.      That's what Romberger wants to accomplish for others.      \\"I'm hoping this ride raises the national awareness, becomes the squeaky wheel to get things rolling for these guys,\\" he says. \\"And I hope it becomes like an educational tool that says, 'Hey, there is help out there, there are people who care.'\\"      ___      On the web: https://expeditionorange.org/ ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Expedition Orange is a 3,000-mile, coast-to-coast horseback ride aiming to raise awareness for Vietnam War veterans suffering from exposure to the toxic chemical Agent Orange.

If oh Jagged Edge Jagged Edge was a suspenseful one or uh Fatal Attraction, can we conclude that \\"Jagged Edge and Fatal Attraction explored similar themes of betrayal and revenge.\\"?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that Jagged Edge and Fatal Attraction explored similar themes of betrayal and revenge, even though both films approached these themes from different angles and employed distinct storytelling techniques. A comparative analysis of both movies reveals the common ground they share while highlighting their unique features. Jagged Edge, directed by Richard Marquand and released in 1985, is an American courtroom thriller and suspenseful whodunit. It follows the story of a wealthy San Francisco heiress, Paige Forrester, who is brutally murdered, and her husband, accused of the crime, turning to a talented female attorney to prove his innocence. The film delves into themes of betrayal by presenting the protagonist's close relationship with her defense attorney and the possibility that he may be exploiting their bond for his hidden motives. The mounting suspense of whether the husband is indeed guilty or innocent is a central component of the story. The theme of revenge surfaces as the husband's motivations are scrutinized: Was this murder an act of retaliation, or is the husband being framed? Furthermore, the defense attorney's personal life is not exempt from these themes. She has her own rocky relationship, and a history of being betrayed by a previous client. This personal struggle makes her skeptical of the husband, despite her fierce determination to defend him in court. Fatal Attraction, directed by Adrian Lyne and released in 1987, is a psychological thriller about a married New York attorney named Dan Gallagher, who has a brief affair with a book editor, Alex Forrest. He attempts to break things off with Alex, but she becomes obsessed with him and starts stalking him and his family. This film presents betrayal in the context of adultery committed by the protagonist, Dan, and his decision to turn away from his affair. As a result, Alex feels intensely betrayed, sparking a series of violent outbursts and psychological manipulation in her quest to exact revenge on Dan and his family. Dan must now navigate the increasingly dangerous situations set up by Alex and protect his loved ones from harm. Comparing the two films, it's evident that betrayal is a significant theme in both Jagged Edge and Fatal Attraction. Jagged Edge examines betrayal within the confines of a legal arena, showcasing moral dilemmas, trust issues, and the often-guarded relationships between an attorney and their client. On the other hand, Fatal Attraction delves into the dangers of infidelity and its potentially disastrous consequences, revealing the dark side of passion and the lengths that some individuals will go to vindicate their perceived betrayal. Additionally, the theme of revenge is pivotal to both stories. In Jagged Edge, revenge plays a role as a motive for murder or as a means to frame an innocent person. Fatal Attraction, on the contrary, revolves around revenge as a destructive force, demonstrating how an individual scorned can unleash havoc on the life of the one who betrayed them. In conclusion, though Jagged Edge and Fatal Attraction approach the themes of betrayal and revenge in different ways, they do indeed explore these themes throughout their respective narratives. The two films portray the dire consequences of misplaced trust and emotional vulnerability, as well as the risks of being involved with manipulative and vengeful individuals."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: There is a zoo named Zhongshan in our city.

Poffo was born in Columbus, Ohio, the elder son of Judy and Angelo Poffo. His father was Italian American and his mother was Jewish; Poffo was raised Roman Catholic. Angelo was a well-known wrestler in the 1950s and 1960s, who was featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not! for his ability to do sit-ups for hours on end. In June 1985, Savage signed with Vince McMahon. Billed as \\"the top free agent in pro wrestling\\", Savage's first appearances on Tuesday Night Titans featured several established managers (including Bobby Heenan, Jimmy Hart, and \\"Classy\\" Freddie Blassie) offering their services to Savage. He eventually declined their offers and chose Miss Elizabeth as his new manager. His gimmick was a crazed, ego-maniacal bully who mistreated Miss Elizabeth and threatened anyone who even looked at her. He made his pay-per-view (PPV) debut at The Wrestling Classic on November 7, 1985, participating in a 16-man tournament. He defeated Ivan Putski, Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat, and the Dynamite Kid before losing by a countout in the finals to Junkyard Dog.  In late 1985, Savage started a feud with then Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Tito Santana over that title. Santana beat him on October 19, 1985 at San Juan, Puerto Rico. The November 2, 1985 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, he unsuccessfully challenged Santana for the title (Savage won the match by countout, but not the title because the title did not change hands by countout). In a rematch on the February 24, 1986 (taped February 8) episode of Prime Time Wrestling, he won the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship at the Boston Garden by using an illegal steel object stashed in his tights to knock out Santana. Early in his WWF career, Savage also won three countout victories (the first at the Spectrum in Philadelphia and the other two at Madison Square Garden) over his future tag team partner WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan (although the belt did not change hands due to the countout) as well as engaging in feuds with Bruno Sammartino and George \\"The Animal\\" Steele. During this time, Savage also formed a tag-team with semi-retired wrestler come color commentator Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura, who would remain a vocal supporter of Savage until Ventura left the WWF in mid-1990, except during Savage's period as a face.  Savage's feud with Steele began on the January 4, 1986 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, when Steele developed a crush on Miss Elizabeth. At WrestleMania 2, Savage defeated Steele in a match to retain his Intercontinental Heavyweight Title. He resumed his feud with Steele in early 1987, culminating in two Intercontinental Heavyweight title matches, both won by Savage.  Savage wrestled Ricky Steamboat at WrestleMania III in the Pontiac Silverdome. After 19 two-counts, Steamboat pinned Savage (with help from George Steele, who pushed Savage from the top rope seconds before he was pinned) to end his near 14-month reign as Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion. The match was extremely choreographed, as opposed to the \\"on the fly\\" nature of most wrestling matches at the time. Savage was a stickler for detail, and he and Steamboat laid out and rehearsed every spot in the match prior to WrestleMania, at his home in Florida. The match was named 1987's Match of the Year by both Pro Wrestling Illustrated and the Wrestling Observer. Steamboat and Savage were seen cheering with and hugging other wrestlers after the match. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what happened in 1985?","output":"In 1985, Poffo, also known as Randy Savage, signed with Vince McMahon and joined the professional wrestling world.

Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was...

The hospital and Jahi's family reached a deal in court today in which Jahi's mom, Nailah Winkfield, will assume responsibility for the girl at the moment of transfer, reports the Oakland Tribune. Much remains in flux, though. It's not clear when Jahi will be moved, or where she will be taken. Also confusing: The judge refused to order the hospital to insert breathing and feeding tubes, or allow an outside doctor to do so, which had been described as necessary before any such transfer. The deal allows Jahi to be moved while on a ventilator, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. \\"Right now, arrangements are being made, and what we needed to know was that when all the balls were in line, that we could move quickly,\\" said the family attorney. \\"So this is a victory in terms of getting us one step closer.\\" The hospital reiterated in court that it considers Jahi to be deceased. \\"It's horrible that this child has died,\\" said the hospital's attorney, who choked up while addressing the media. \\"It's also horrible that it's so difficult for her family to accept that death, and I wish and I constantly think that, wouldn't it be great if they could come to terms with this terrible tragic event and I wouldn't have to stand in front of you time after time.\\" Expand this summary.","output":"In an ongoing legal saga surrounding the status of a young girl declared brain-dead by Children's Hospital Oakland, Jahi McMath's mother, Nailah Winkfield, secured the right to move her daughter to another facility. This landmark decision came more than three weeks after the hospital announced Jahi's brain-death. The Oakland Tribune reported that the agreement reached in court positions Winkfield as primarily responsible for Jahi immediately upon transfer. Despite this significant development, several aspects of the situation remain uncertain, including the specific time and destination of Jahi's transfer. The court denied the family's request to command the hospital to install breathing and feeding tubes, which were formerly deemed obligatory for any relocation. Similarly, the judge rejected the suggestion to allow an external physician to execute this task. In lieu of these measures, the agreement enables Jahi's transfer while she remains on a ventilator, an arrangement that the San Francisco Chronicle documented. The family's representation stated that they are currently arranging the logistics of the move. \\"Right now, arrangements are being made, and what we needed to know was that when all the balls were in line, that we could move quickly,\\" the family attorney emphasized, celebrating this development as a symbol of progress. \\"So this is a victory in terms of getting us one step closer.\\" In court, the Oakland hospital reiterated its stance, affirming that it considers Jahi to have passed away.

After yesterday’s story about Joe’s stripped VW, many wondered if Volkswagen was going to actually pay for the dismantled (but still running!) husk of a car, or if the company would just turn him away.      Advertisement      Advertisement      It turns out, the answer is “neither,” as Joe just told me over the phone that a mere hour before his appointment at the VW dealership, a representative for the company— who most likely saw yesterday’s story on Jalopnik—called and told him his buyback appointment had been postponed. (We have reached out to Volkswagen directly about this matter and will update if we hear anything.)      Joe says the rep told him that the reason for the delay is that VW believes stripping the car “wasn’t in the spirit of the buyback.”      But as for the actual letter of the buyback, as Joe points out, the FTC Consent Order specifies only that to be eligible cars have to be “operable,” a term the document defines clearly as “can be driven under its own 2.0- liter TDI engine power.”      Sponsored      Joe says his car drives just fine.      Photo: Joe Mayer      Joe says the VW rep—whom he believes was heavily coached on what to tell him—did not give a time frame for his new appointment, but simply emailed him an attorney’s number to whom he should direct questions. He thinks the automaker is “just trying to bide some time,” and he expects them to get back to him once they have spoken with their lawyers, a move he fears is meant to find some way or another to get out of having to pay him.      Joe remains firm that stripping the car wasn’t a breach of the terms in the class action suit, saying he plans to get his own legal advice in the coming days. As for when or if VW will schedule Joe’s new buyback appointment, we’ll just have to wait and see.            For his part, Joe said he followed the claims process to the tee, uploading all of his documents as soon as the claims portal went online in an effort to be first on the buyback list.      Advertisement      The car enthusiast and Jalopnik reader fears that Volkswagen might drag this out, like it has with so many other upset VW owners. “I’ve waited long enough already,” he told me tonight.      Update: Here’s the statement Volkswagen sent us, which doesn’t seem to directly address whether car-stripping is within the letter of the buyout terms or not:      Advertisement      Volkswagen’s priority is to make the 2.0L TDI settlement process as seamless and convenient as possible for our affected customers and we are working hard to ensure that this is the case. The program is governed by specific eligibility guidelines and other conditions which were agreed by all the parties and approved by the Court. Subject to regulatory approval of modifications that will allow vehicles to meet agreed emissions standards, the settlement allows Volkswagen to modify some of the vehicles we buy back so they can be returned to commerce rather than scrapped. The great majority of Volkswagen owners take very good care of their vehicles and are returning them for buyback intact.      We’ll update as we hear more. ||||| Joe Mayer, a Cincinnati car salesman, says he’s turning in his 2010 Volkswagen Golf TDI as part of VW’s court-ordered buyback, but not before stripping the car down to the bone, removing the doors, seats, hood, bumpers, hatch and a big portion of the interior. Just look at this naked carcass he’s selling back to VW!      We’ve heard about some VW diesel owners removing fascias and little interior pieces before turning in their vehicles for VW’s buyback, but Mayer is—and these are his own words—“[taking] the whole partout thing a bit to the extreme.”      I called him up to see how serious he really is about trying to turn this stripped-down hatch in to the dealership, and he told me this isn’t a joke, and that he’s read the court documents and knows that the settlement terms only specify that the car has to be “operable,” i.e. that it can be driven under its own power.      Advertisement      Mayer bought his little diesel manual hatchback in the fall of 2015, just a few weeks before Volkswagen’s diesel scandal made headlines in September. In fact, he says he hadn’t even plated the car by the time the scandal broke, so when the time came to go to the DMV, he chose the “DSLGATE” license plate you see above.      After the settlement terms came out, and Mayer read that the condition of the car doesn’t affect the payout, he decided to remove a bunch of parts from his Golf, figuring “Why not make a bit of extra money?”      So he drove to a buddy’s house this past Sunday, drank some beer, ate some pizza, and ripped a bunch of parts off his Golf without a care in the world if something broke.      Advertisement      Mayer went all out stripping this thing, saying “Anything that could come off pretty much came off,” except for the dashboard, because that would be a pain in the butt, and the rearview mirror, because he still has to drive the thing, and nobody’s going to buy a used rearview mirror.      Advertisement      He said it was a “surprising amount of fun” removing airbags, doors, fenders, the engine cover, the shifter cover, bumpers, a bumper support, the radio, seats, interior trim pieces (he even removed the bezels for the AC vents!), the center console, the hatch, and a bunch more.      He says he’ll “also be replacing the driver’s seat with a milk crate,” and that the headlights and taillights are “hanging on by one or two bolts,” as he plans to drive within a block of the dealership, quickly take off the lights, and putt his little hatchback skeleton into the service center.      Advertisement      I asked him if he was concerned about VW not taking the car, and he told me he talked with three VW settlement representatives over the phone, asking them if removing the doors, hatch, hood, seats and interior bits would affect the buyback amount, and they told him something to the effect of “I’m not telling you you’re allowed to, but the only thing required is that its drivable and operable.”      Many people will think of Mayer’s actions as a bit petty, while others will think it’s fine, since Volkswagen may be recycling these cars anyway, and since VW was the one who betrayed its customers.      Advertisement      I’m not sure what to think; on one hand, I can imagine how fun it would be to strip a car without a care in the world, but on the other hand, if VW does find a fix for these cars, and wants to sell them, stripping cars could hurt the company and, more importantly, send a car into a junkyard unnecessarily—a car that has the potential to look really good:      Mayer, a self-proclaimed car-lover and Jalopnik reader, says he hopes to buy a manual Toyota FJ Cruiser after turning in his Golf tomorrow. That is, if the dealership accepts it. We’ll find out soon enough.

Tasmania is one of the six states and two territories that comprise the Commonwealth of Australia. It is separated from the Australian mainland by the Bass Strait, a body of water that stretches about 240 kilometers (150 miles) between Victoria and Tasmania. Hobart is the most populous city in Tasmania, with a population of approximately 240,000 people as of 2020. The city is situated along the southeastern coast of the island, at the mouth of the Derwent River, and is bordered by Mount Wellington to the west. Thanks to its coastal location, Hobart has a mild, temperate maritime climate that features cool winters and mild summers. Hobart was established in 1804 by British settlers as a penal colony, making it Australia's second oldest capital city after Sydney. Its history is still evident in the various well-preserved Georgian and Victorian buildings that are scattered throughout the city, many of which have been converted into museums, galleries, and other cultural institutions.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  legend of Madman Marz  for the following movie plot:  A group of senior counselors and campers, consisted of T.P., Betsy, Ellie, Dave, Stacy, Bill, and the middle-aged head counselor Max, are gathered around a campfire and tell the legend of Madman Marz; a murderer who murdered his wife and children with an axe, and was hung on a noose for conviction before he mysteriously broke free and escaped into the woods. Told by Max, he explains that anyone that says his name will awaken him and have him get that person. Richie, a cocky teenager, awakens Marz by shouting his name and throws a rock into his old home. Annoyed, Max then ends the campfire session and sends everyone to their cabins while he goes into town to stock up on supplies. Richie stays behind when he sees Madman Marz hidding in a tree and sneakily follows him back to his house. While everyone is inside their cabins, Chef Dippy is then killed by Marz outside. After the kids have gone to sleep, the rest of the counselors go to the rec room to relax; T.P. and Betsy kiss in a hot tub, unbeknownst that Marz is watching them from outside. Meanwhile, Dave finds out that Richie didn't follow them back, and informs the counselors about this. T.P. searches out into the woods for Richie, and is hung by Marz with a noose up on a tree; he is killed when Marz pulls down his legs and the noose snaps his neck. Marz later returns to the camp and grabs the axe out of the log. While Richie tries looking for a way back to camp, Dave ventures out into the woods due to Betsy worrying about T.P.'s disapperance, and is decapitated by Marz. Stacy tells Betsy to watch the kids in the meantime, and gets Ellie and Bill back to the camp due to the disappearances. Stacey drives out into the woods and, panicking from discovering Dave's headless body, tries to escape in her car in which stalls. She opens the car's hood, and Marz stands on top of the car just before he jumps down onto the hood, decapitating Stacy. Later, Ellie finds Madman Marz and screams, prompting Marz to flee and bringing Stacy's body with him. Bill soon arrives...

Casey is an adolescent boy whose life is constantly influenced by his intense fear of clowns. His two older brothers, Geoffrey and Randy, are mostly disobliging. One night, the three boys are left alone when their mother visits relatives, so they decide to visit a local circus for a night of amusement, despite Casey's uncontrollable coulrophobia. Meanwhile, the local state insane asylum has sent a majority of the hospital's inmates to the carnival for therapy, but three psychotic mental patients break away from the group and kill three clowns, taking their makeup and costumes. While at the circus, Casey innocently visits a fortune teller despite Randy's better judgment.

By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The predecessor to vinyl in the record industry was shellac."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Robbie Gould started the scoring for the Bears with a 34-yard field goal, but field goals of 23 and 31 yards by David Akers put the Lions up 6-3. Early in the second quarter, Matt Fort&#233; exploded for a 53-yard touchdown run to put Chicago back up, 10-6. The lead was narrowed to 10-9 when Akers connected on a 41-yard field goal. The Lions then reeled off three straight touchdowns in the span of three and a half minutes. Set up by a 57-yard punt return from Micheal Spurlock, Matthew Stafford scored first when he recovered his own fumble in the end zone following a 1-yard quarterback sneak. On Chicago's next possession, Jay Cutler's second interception of the day was returned by Glover Quin 42 yards, to the Bears 2. One play later, Stafford hit Calvin Johnson in the corner of the end zone for a 2-yard TD. On the Lions next possession, Reggie Bush scored on a 37-yard TD run, hurdling Bears safety Major Wright on his way to the end zone. Robbie Gould closed the half with a 28-yard field goal that made the score 30-13. Gould would connect again on a 25-yarder in the third quarter to get the Bears within two touchdowns. On Chicago's next possession, Ndamukong Suh forced a Jay Cutler fumble, then Nick Fairley scooped up the ball and took it the remaining 4 yards for the score to give Detroit a 37-16 lead. David Akers extended it to 40-16 on a 43-yard field goal in the fourth quarter. The Bears attempted a furious rally in the final minutes.  Cutler hit Alshon Jeffery on a 14-yard TD pass with four minutes left, then connected with Jeffery again for a 2-point conversion to make the score 40-24.

Article: If you have a chance to go to Taiwan, there's one place you should not miss-- the Taipei Palace Museum. The museum has around 650,000 pieces of ancient Chinese treasures. These treasures were originally in the Palace Museum in Beijing. But how did they get to Taiwan? In 1931, the Japanese invaded the northeast part of China. To protect the national treasures from the Japanese, the government of the Republic of China decided to move some important pieces to Nanjing. However, they did not stay long in Nanjing. In 1949, the people's Liberation Army won in the Liberation War. The Guomindang government went from Nanjing to Taiwan. Along with them they took the art pieces. The Taipei Palace Museum was set up in 1965 to hold the national treasures. Taiwan people are very proud of the Taipei Palace Museum. Some of the collections are world famous. One of the most visited art pieces in the museum is the \\"Jade Cabbage\\". It is made from a single piece of jade . If you take a close look, you can see two grasshoppers on the leaves, a large one and a small one, which were the symbol of many children in a family.

Are the following two questions the same? Is there any difference between non-binary and ternary compounds? What is the difference between binary and ternary compounds?","output":"The two questions are not the same, but they are related as they deal with the classification of chemical compounds based on the number of constituent elements. Let me explain the differences by addressing each question and providing some context regarding the types of compounds. 1. Is there any difference between non-binary and ternary compounds?  To answer this question, we first need to define both non-binary and ternary compounds and determine if they are comparable categories. Non-binary compounds refer to chemical compounds that do not consist of only two elements. In other words, non-binary describes any compound that is not binary, including ternary, quaternary, and higher-order compounds. Non-binary compounds can be divided into: - Ternary compounds: consisting of three elements. - Quaternary compounds: consisting of four elements. - Quinary compounds: consisting of five elements. - Senary compounds: consisting of six elements. - And so on... Ternary compounds, as the name suggests, are a specific type of non-binary compound that consists of three constituent elements. The category of non-binary compounds encompasses ternary compounds and all other higher-order compounds. Therefore, the difference between non-binary and ternary compounds is in their scope and inclusiveness. Non-binary compounds is a broader category encompassing all compounds with more than two elements, whereas ternary compounds specifically describe compounds with three elements. 2. What is the difference between binary and ternary compounds? Binary and ternary compounds are distinct categories of chemical compounds based on the number of constituent elements. The key differences between binary and ternary compounds are: - Binary compounds consist of exactly two different elements. Examples of binary compounds include water (H2O, consisting of hydrogen and oxygen), sodium chloride (NaCl, consisting of sodium and chlorine), and carbon dioxide (CO2, consisting of carbon and oxygen). - Ternary compounds, on the other hand, consist of three different elements. Examples of ternary compounds include sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, consisting of sodium, carbon, and oxygen), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3, consisting of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen), and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2, consisting of calcium, oxygen, and hydrogen). In summary, the two questions are related but not the same. The first question addresses the differences between the broader category of non-binary compounds and the specific category of ternary compounds. The second question focuses on the differences between binary and ternary compounds, which are two distinct categories within the overall classification of chemical compounds based on the number of constituent elements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hugh Hare (1606–1667) had inherited a large amount of money from his great-uncle Sir Nicholas Hare, Master of the Rolls. On the death of his father, his mother had remarried Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in Court and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as Baron Coleraine shortly thereafter.As he was closely associated with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War.

I spent the summer working with my vet to find things to help Toto,but nothing works.Since we can't stand the smell of cat urine in the house,two weeks ago I took drastic measures.I _ Toto outside.(She gets to come in while I work,but I put her out for 80%of the day and night.) Because Toto now lives outside,she eats and drinks outside.I' ve set up a heating pad on the porch.and given her own food and water area nearby.She seems perfectly content with this arrangement except when she's out of food,or she wants to be petted. Strangely enough,she's been out of food a lot lately.\\"I think another cat is eating Toto's food.\\"I told Kris when I first noticed how quickly she was going through her bowl. \\"Actually,\\"I said a couple of days later,\\"maybe it's a dog.Whoever is eating Toto's food keeps knocking the bowl over.\\" But a few days after that,I realized that the food thief probably wasn't even a dog.Whatever the critter was,it was messy.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms.  Now, I have a new situation: Students learned about protozoa in school this week. Dan and Jim were interested and read more on the subject. Dan read more about predatory  and parasitic protozoa, while Jim read more about herbivore and decomposer protozoa.  Answer this question please: Which student read less about protozoa that consume dead organic matter? Answer:","output":"Dan read less about protozoa that consume dead organic matter.

Background: Richard Charles \\"Dick\\" Lewontin (born March 29, 1929) is an American evolutionary biologist, mathematician, geneticist, and social commentator. A leader in developing the mathematical basis of population genetics and evolutionary theory, he pioneered the application of techniques from molecular biology, such as gel electrophoresis, to questions of genetic variation and evolution. In a pair of seminal 1966 papers co-authored with J.L. Hubby in the journal Genetics, Lewontin helped set the stage for the modern field of molecular evolution. In 1979 he and Stephen Jay Gould introduced the term \\"spandrel\\" into evolutionary theory. Context: Along with others, such as Gould, Lewontin has been a persistent critic of some themes in neo-Darwinism. Specifically, he has criticised proponents of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology such as Edward O. Wilson and Richard Dawkins, who attempt to explain animal behaviour and social structures in terms of evolutionary advantage or strategy. He and others criticize this approach when applied to humans, as he sees it as genetic determinism. In his writing, Lewontin suggests a more nuanced view of evolution is needed, which requires a more careful understanding of the context of the whole organism as well as the environment.  Such concerns about what he views as the oversimplification of genetics has led Lewontin to be a frequent participant in debates, and an active life as a public intellectual. He has lectured widely to promote his views on evolutionary biology and science. In books such as Not in Our Genes (co-authored with Steven Rose and Leon J. Kamin) and numerous articles, Lewontin has questioned much of the claimed heritability of human behavioral traits, such as intelligence as measured by IQ tests.  Some academics have criticized him for rejecting sociobiology for non-scientific reasons. Edward Wilson (1995) suggested that Lewontin's political beliefs affected his scientific view. Robert Trivers described Lewontin as \\"...a man with great talents who often wasted them on foolishness, on preening and showing off, on shallow political thinking and on useless philosophical rumination while limiting his genetic work by assumptions congenial to his politics.\\" Lewontin has at times identified himself as Marxist, and admitted that his ideological views have affected his scientific work (Levins and Lewontin 1985). Others such as Kitcher (1985) have countered that Lewontin's criticisms of sociobiology are genuine scientific concerns about the discipline. He wrote that attacking Lewontin's motives amounts to an ad hominem argument. Question: Who has he worked with in the past? Answer:","output":"Richard Lewontin has worked with several notable scientists and researchers in the past. Some of these collaborators include: 1. J.L. Hubby: Lewontin co-authored a pair of seminal 1966 papers with Hubby in the journal Genetics, which helped set the stage for the modern field of molecular evolution. 2. Stephen Jay Gould: In 1979, Lewontin and Gould introduced the term \\"spandrel\\" into evolutionary theory. 3. Steven Rose and Leon J. Kamin: Lewontin co-authored the book \\"Not in Our Genes\\" with Rose and Kamin, which questioned the heritability of human behavioral traits such as intelligence as measured by IQ tests. 4.

They eat rice with meat, fish and vegetables. Some people do not eat some kinds of meat. Muslims  ,for example, do  not eat pork. Japanese eat lots of fish. They are near the  sea.

This is similar to some other Western countries such as Britain and the USA, where bread and potatoes are commonly consumed as main sources of carbohydrates and daily sustenance. Australia, being a diverse and multicultural country, embraces a rich variety of cuisines and food habits from around the world. However, the basis of the traditional Australian diet is rooted in British and Irish cuisine as a result of the historical colonization of Australia. Hence, the prominence of bread and potatoes in their everyday meals. Wheat, used for making bread, is one of Australia's principal crops and an important agricultural export. It's also worth noting that Australia's climate and landscape support wheat farming, making bread a widely available and affordable food option for people all across the nation. Over the years, Australia has seen a significant change in eating habits, as new cultures and food preferences have been introduced and incorporated into the nation's culinary practices. Australians today enjoy a much more diverse range of food, but the key staple of bread remains widely consumed and popular. Despite this, Australia's beautiful coastlines, and its enormous fishing industry, makes it a great place to enjoy high-quality seafood, including fish, crustaceans and shellfish. Vegetables, fruits, and grains also form a significant portion of the Australian diet and are highly valued for their health benefits and role in maintaining a balanced diet.

Alan Victor White (born 26 May 1972 in Lewisham, South London) is an English rock drummer, best known as being the drummer of the English rock band Oasis from 1995 to 2004. Before Oasis, he was the drummer of Starclub from 1991 to 1994. He is the longest serving drummer in Oasis's history, performing on four studio albums, two compilation albums and one live album during his tenure. He joined the band in May 1995 after the band's original drummer Tony McCarroll was removed from the band. In early 2004, White surprisingly left Oasis during the early recording sessions for the band's sixth album. According to Oasis' spokesperson, there were some new tracks and demos with White's performances, which were made at the end of 2003 and early 2004 as the very first demos for their upcoming album, before his departure. In an interview, Noel Gallagher alluded to White's personal problems: \\"He's a ******* great guy, and he's one of the best drummers I've ever met in my life, but his personal life is ******* chaos. In the end he ****** ***, and we haven't seen him since.\\" In an interview on Radio 1 with Chris Moyles (15 August 2008), Noel Gallagher stated that White was \\"kicked out\\" of the band.  There is also evidence to suggest that White was upset that his drums were going down so low in the mix on top of the prevalence of drum loops (\\"Go Let It Out\\", \\"Gas Panic!\\", \\"The Hindu Times\\", \\"Better Man\\", \\"Force of Nature\\"). On one Q&A with Freddie Gee, he had said: \\"Well, I don't like that my drums get turned down with each successive mix we do of an album, but one mustn't grumble in this band.\\"  White was replaced with Zak Starkey, The Who drummer and the son of The Beatles' Ringo Starr. Ringo particularly was cited as one of White's biggest drumming influences. Due to his departure, the band scrapped the first midway sessions and later suffered some prolonged and difficult recording for Don't Believe the Truth (2005).","output":"This text is about Alan Victor White, an English rock drummer.

A massive increase in antibiotic prescriptions is being fuelled by out-of-hours GPs – with potentially fatal consequences, experts claim. The number handed out by doctors covering nights and weekends has increased by up to a third since 2010. Health experts say locums filling these shifts – as well as dentists and walk-in centres – do not know patients and are more inclined to hand out antibiotics as a quick fix. Number of antibiotics prescribed by doctors on nights and weekends has increased by up to a third since 2010. Overall, the number of antibiotics prescribed by GPs, hospitals, dentists and out of hours clinics has risen by 6 per cent in four years. This is despite repeated attempts by the NHS to bring the figure down over fears that over-prescribing is creating strains of drug-resistant bacteria, making many illnesses effectively untreatable – including potentially deadly ones. Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies has warned that the threat is 'as big as terrorism' and could lead to minor scratches becoming fatal. It has been caused by over-prescribing antibiotics – meant for bacterial illnesses, even for coughs and colds, which are caused by viruses and are unaffected by the drugs. Scientists have warned that E. coli, a frequent cause of infection, is becoming resistant to antibiotics. Bacteria have gradually become more resistant and a growing number cannot be eradicated by common treatments. In the first study of its kind, Public Health England looked at prescriptions for antibiotics in hospitals, GP surgeries, out-of-hours clinics and dentists. Since 2010, the numbers have risen by 6 per cent, from 25.9 doses per day for every 1,000 people to 27.4 doses. This is 28 per cent higher than the European average of 21.3 doses per 1,000 people. Previously, GPs have been blamed for handing out drugs too freely under pressure from demanding patients who expect to be given some sort of medication. But this report shows the number given by family doctors fell last year by 3.5 per cent to 21.5 doses per day. Those from out-of-hours doctors, walk-in centres and dentists has risen by 32 per cent since 2010. Dr Susan Hopkins, the epidemiologist behind the report, said: 'GPs know patients and they're able to give a back-up prescription so they don't immediately go and fill it – they only take it if they get worse over the next few days. 'It's a really good measure of reducing prescribing. Urgent-care centres don't know that patient.' Her study is the first to look at the issue across the NHS. It also found that the number of prescriptions handed out in hospitals had increased by 12 per cent. Professor John Watson, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said: 'Anti-microbial resistance is one of the biggest threats to health security facing the world today.'

First, any habit which slows down your silent reading to the speed at which you speak or read aloud, is inefficient. If you point to each word as you read, or move your head, or form the words with your lips, you read poorly. Less obvious habits also hold back reading efficiency  . One is \\"saying\\" each word silently by moving your tongue or throat; another is \\"hearing\\" each word as you read. These are habits which should have been outgrown long ago. The beginning reader is learning how letters can make words, how written words are pronounced, and how sentences are put together. Your reading purpose is quite different, which is to understand meaning. It has been supposed that up to 75% of the words in English sentences are not really necessary for expressing the meaning. The secret of silent reading is to find out those key words and phrases which carry the thought, and to pay less attention to words which exist only for grammatical completeness. An efficient reader can grasp the meaning from a page at least twice as fast as he can read the page aloud. He takes in a whole phrase or thought unit at a time.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Drake ended his studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation, and in autumn 1969 moved to London. His father remembered \\"writing him long letters, pointing out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge ... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least you have something to fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net was the one thing he did not want.\\" Drake spent his first few months in London drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's Kensington flat but usually sleeping on friends’ sofas and floors. Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden. On 5 August 1969, Drake recorded five songs for the BBC's John Peel show (\\"Cello Song\\", \\"Three Hours\\", \\"River Man\\", \\"Time of No Reply\\" and an early version of \\"Bryter Layter\\"), three of which were broadcast on the following night.

It was actually quite painful to watch. I don't know what the audience expected, I mean, they must have known they weren't going to get sea-shanties and sing-alongs at a Nick Drake gig! The experience reinforced Drake's decision to retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play around this time were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Most digital metronomes will use BPM or beats per minute as a way to measure the speed of the piece. Some mobile metronomes available for phones will even allow you to tap the beat on your screen to get the corresponding tempo.  On most quartz metronomes, the BPM is listed around the edge of the dial. Within the BPM selections, there are corresponding Italian words that are traditionally used to describe tempo, such as Allegro and Presto.  On wind-up models, you simply slide the weight up the metal bar to the desired tempo or the marking indicated on the music to be rehearsed. Many digital metronomes will allow you to set the time signature, but most wind-up metronomes do not. Time signatures consist of 2 numbers written how you would write a mathematical fraction. The top number indicates the number of beats in a measure. The bottom number indicates the value of the beat.  For example, a piece in 4/4 time would have 4 quarter notes in a measure, while a piece in 2/4 time would have 2 quarter notes in a measure. Some pieces of music may have several time signatures. To practice them with a metronome you will have to take it in parts and reset the metronome to match the changing time signatures. Setting the volume for the metronome is especially important for any digital devices. You want to find a volume that won't be drowned out by the music but isn't overwhelming either. Many swinging or wind-up metronomes will not have a volume control, but musicians can follow the swinging of the metronome to keep accurate time even if they are unable to hear the metronome over the music. Some electronic metronomes will also have an LED light that goes on and off in time with the beat.

Step 1: Understanding the premise - The premise states that a little redheaded boy is playing a game called Whack Em!. This indicates that the boy is engaged in an activity, specifically a game. Step 2: Understanding the hypothesis - The hypothesis states that a boy is reading. This also indicates another activity, reading, assumedly a different boy is doing. Step 3: Comparing the premise and hypothesis - The boy described in the premise is explicitly playing a game, whereas, in the hypothesis, a boy is described to be reading.

I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening.

Make this proper case","output":"Sure, I can change this sentence to its proper case. Here is the process step-by-step: 1. \\"3:12\\": This seems to be a verse number. In standard English, verse numbers are often written exactly the same way, so I'll leave it as it is. 2. \\"unlike cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother.\\": This is the first sentence and should begin with a capital letter to be grammatically correct. Additionally, the name of the person, \\"cain\\", should also be capitalized. So, it becomes \\"Unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother.\\" 3. \\"why did he kill him?\\": This is a question, so it should start with a capital letter. It becomes \\"Why did he kill him?\\" 4. \\"because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.\\" : This sentence starts with \\"because\\", yet it can stand on its own as a complete sentence. So, it should start with a capital letter. The use of the word \\"righteous\\" as an adjective also fits here to complete the meaning.

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","output":"During the third quarter, there had been essentially no growth in investment expenditures. However, the situation changed drastically as the growth rate of this component jumped to an impressive 19 percent. This surprising shift can be attributed to several factors that contributed to the surge in investment expenditures. A detailed analysis can help explain the reasons for this sudden growth and its implications for the economy as a whole. 1. Economic Recovery: One possible reason for the jump in investment expenditures could be a general improvement in the economic conditions. As the economic outlook brightens and confidence rises, businesses may see this as an opportune time to invest in new projects and expand their operations. This rise in investment expenditures may indicate an economy on the path to recovery. 2. Government Policies: Pro-investment government policies or initiatives could have also played a role in boosting investment expenditures. For example, if the government introduces tax incentives or guarantees loans for businesses, it's more likely that they'll invest in potential growth opportunities. Reduced regulations and bureaucratic barriers can also make the investment process more attractive and accessible to businesses. 3. Low-Interest Rates: If interest rates are low, businesses are more likely to borrow funds for new investments. Low borrowing costs can increase the likelihood of investments with potentially higher returns. As borrowing becomes more affordable, companies are encouraged to invest in capital formation and business expansion. 4. Technological Advancements: Rapid advancements in technology can also drive investment growth. Companies may see the value in investing in research and development, infrastructure, and technology adoption to stay competitive and agile in the market. As businesses invest in new technological capabilities, growth in investment expenditures can surge. 5. Market Demand: Increased market demand may have prompted businesses to expand their capacities and production capabilities. If consumer and business demand increases, companies are more likely to invest in new projects and expansions to meet these needs and capitalize on the opportunities. 6. Global Market Conditions: The global economic landscape can also impact investment expenditures. If international market conditions are favorable and prospects for exports are positive, businesses may elect to invest in expanding their reach and presence in foreign markets. 7. Previous Underinvestment: It is also worth considering that the sudden growth in investment expenditures could be a result of previous underinvestment. A period of economic uncertainty or recession may have caused businesses to delay or reduce their investments. As conditions improve, businesses may be playing catch-up by making long-overdue investments to improve their positions and capitalize on new opportunities. In conclusion, the 19 percent growth in investment expenditures after a period of no growth can be attributed to a variety of factors, including an improving economy, government policies, low-interest rates, technological advancements, increased market demand, favorable global market conditions, and a possible reaction to previous underinvestment. Understanding these factors can help forecast future growth rates, recognize potential risks, and inform policy decisions to support a healthy and thriving economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War.

Vance subtly maneuvers Cleaver, Mannix, Lindquist and the two Spotswoodes into playing poker to pass the time so he can observe their personality traits. Only one shows the daring, imagination and discipline required for the crime; that man bluffs Vance, betting everything with just a pair of deuces. The suspects are then released. Sheel, who witnessed the murder while hiding in the closet, sends the killer several blackmail letters. He too is strangled. A pen found at the scene has Jimmy's name on it, so Heath arrests him for the murder. Jimmy then confesses to both murders, but Vance knows better.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"The answer to these two questions is not the same because they address different aspects of a Taurus individual's relationships and personality traits existing within them. Let's address each question separately to provide a thorough understanding of the topics. Question 1: What are the signs that a Taurus man really likes you? Taurus men are known for their loyal, stable, and determined nature. They are sensual, reliable, and devoted, making them excellent partners once they have established trust and genuine feelings for someone. Here are some signs that a Taurus man really likes you: 1. Consistency and reliability: If a Taurus man is frequently in touch with you, consistently making plans, and maintaining contact, it is an indicator of his genuine interest. 2. Takes time to get to know you: A Taurus man will invest time in getting to know you deeply - understanding your preferences, hobbies, and your emotional world. 3. Reveals his vulnerable side: Taurus men are known for their strength and reserve. If a Taurus man starts to open up and share his feelings, emotions, or insecurities, it's a sign he really likes you and trusts you. 4. Protectiveness and possessiveness: A Taurus man in love can become protective of the person he cares about, sometimes taking it a bit too far and becoming possessive. If he is concerned for your well-being and displays a protective nature, he is likely quite interested in you. 5. Generosity: A Taurus man in love will be very generous, both emotionally and materially. He will shower you with thoughtful gifts and give you his undivided attention. 6. Physical affection: Taurus men are known for their sensuality and appreciation of physical touch. If a Taurus man becomes more physically affectionate and seeks opportunities to touch or hug you, it can be a strong signal that he is attracted to you. 7. Includes you in his future plans: When a Taurus man includes you in his long-term goals and future plans, it indicates that he is serious about the relationship. Question 2: I'm a Taurus, but why do I feel like an Aries? Astrology depends on various factors, and your sun sign - the zodiac sign you know based on your birth date - is just one aspect of your astrological chart. There are several reasons why you might feel more like an Aries rather than a Taurus. Some considerations include: 1. Your Ascendant or Rising sign: Your Rising sign is the sign on the eastern horizon at the time of your birth. It impacts your appearance, outward personality, and how others perceive you. If your Rising sign is Aries, it can be a significant reason why you relate more to Aries traits than Taurus traits. 2. Moon sign: Your Moon sign represents your emotional nature and inner world. If your Moon sign is in Aries, you may find yourself connecting more to Aries' characteristics. 3. Close proximity of the Sun sign: If you were born on the cusp, close to the dates when the Sun moves from Aries to Taurus (around April 19-20), you may possess traits from both signs, and that could be why you feel a connection to Aries characteristics. 4. Dominant planets and aspects: Various astrological aspects, such as the placement of planets and their influences in your birth chart, can alter how your sun sign manifests in your life. 5. Personal experiences and environmental factors: Astrology alone does not determine one's personality traits. Your upbringing, experiences, and environment also play a significant role in shaping your characteristics and preferences. To understand your astrological profile more accurately, consult an astrologer who can analyze your birth chart or perform an in-depth study of your unique astrological chart. This comprehensive understanding will provide insights into your sun, moon, and rising signs, as well as other critical factors influencing your identity beyond your Taurus sun sign."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Throughout mid-2000, after aligning himself with Edge & Christian, \\"Team ECK\\" (Edge, Christian, and Kurt) feuded with Too Cool and Rikishi, with Angle defeating Rikishi in the finals of the King of the Ring tournament. He went on to feud with Triple H after a love triangle between them and Triple H's wife, Stephanie McMahon, developed.

Before the match started, however, he bumped into a returning Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was looking for the perpetrator who ran him over at the previous year's Survivor Series. Angle offered him his friendship and one of his gold medals, but Austin was not pleased by telling him that he would keep it in a nice safe place, to which Austin referred to \\"right up his ass\\" before attacking Angle and throwing his medal to the floor.

Permiteţi-mi să subliniez că multimarca există - şi va continua să existe - acolo unde realitatea pieţei o solicită. Translate to English English:","output":"Allow me to emphasize that multi-branding exists - and will continue to exist - where the market reality demands it. In today's world, multi-brand strategy plays a vital role in businesses to sustain and grow their market presence. This approach is adopted by companies to target a diverse range of customer segments, meet their varying needs, and ultimately, provide better value to the customers. There is no doubt that competition has become fierce and the global market is constantly evolving. To cater to these changes, multi-branding has become essential. It offers various advantages such as product diversification, increased market share, strong brand recognition, and greater opportunities for expansion. By offering a variety of brands, companies can appeal to a wider range of customers, each with their own unique preferences. For instance, while one person may prefer an affordable and simple product, another might opt for a more luxurious and feature-rich variant. Having multiple brands enables organizations to present options that cater to all types of consumers. Moreover, multi-branding can help in spreading the risks that might come with market fluctuations and unforeseen changes. The negative impact on one brand can be minimized if the company has other successful brands in its portfolio. This diversification can provide a safety net that ensures the brand's overall stability and growth. Increased market share is another key advantage of a multi-brand strategy. Having multiple brands gives companies the leverage to penetrate different market segments and expand their reach. Not only does this result in higher sales, it also makes it more difficult for competitors to gain a significant market share. In terms of brand recognition, multi-branding offers the opportunity to build a strong reputation across various customer segments. By catering to a wide range of preferences, companies create goodwill among their customer base and enhance the likelihood of customers forming a positive association with their brands. This can lead to long-lasting customer relationships that fuel business growth. Lastly, multi-branding offers opportunities for expansion, both nationally and internationally.

I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Write a title: LONDON -- Eight men charged with conspiracy to murder in a trans-Atlantic terror plot made their first court appearance yesterday in a case that has added to the fierce debate over Britain's terrorism laws and heightened fears in the country's Islamic community of an anti-Muslim backlash.","output":"Title: \\"Trans-Atlantic Terror Plot: The Court Case that Shaped the UK's War on Terror and the Impact on Its Islamic Community\\" The trial of the eight men accused of conspiracy to murder in a trans-Atlantic terror plot has been nothing short of a sensation in the United Kingdom and beyond. As one of the most significant terror cases to emerge since the infamous September 11 attacks, it has captivated the world's attention and brought a wave of unrest, apprehension, and civil liberty concerns in its wake. The court proceedings, which began with the highly publicized first court appearance of the suspects, have unleashed a torrent of debate on Britain's terrorism laws and have magnified anxieties within the nation's Islamic community of a potential anti-Muslim backlash. The case can be best understood in three distinctive, yet interconnected aspects: the legal battles that have taken place in the courts, the impact of the case on the UK's counter-terrorism laws, and the social consequences that have arisen across the British Muslim community. First and foremost, the legal battle between prosecutors and defense attorneys has been nothing short of dramatic. The case against the eight men has largely hinged on the unveiling of their alleged trans-Atlantic terror plot, which entailed plans to bomb several airplanes bound for the United States and Canada using liquid explosives concealed in carry-on luggage. It has been reported that thousands of lives could have been put at risk had the plan been successfully executed. As a result, defenders of the accused have fought vehemently to challenge the reliability of the evidence presented against their clients. The prosecution, on the other hand, has endeavored to prove the veracity of the claims and reiterate the severity of the charges. As the legal proceedings have played out in the public eye, so too has the heated debate around the UK's counter-terrorism laws that the trans-Atlantic terror plot has inflamed. Critics argue that existing legislation contains civil liberty violations and disproportionately targets Muslims, while proponents of tougher laws argue that they are indispensable for ensuring public safety. In the political arena, the case has led to calls for legislation that would allow the British government to hold terrorism suspects without charge for up to 90 days, a notion that has ignited concerns regarding human rights and further polarized the already-divided public opinion. Last but not least, the case has had major ramifications for the country's Islamic community. With reports of the suspects' connections to extremist Islamic factions and the highly-charged atmosphere surrounding the trial, fears of an anti-Muslim backlash in the UK have been intensified. The situation is reflective of a broader context, one in which international events such as the September 11 attacks and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East have incited skepticism and apprehension toward Muslims residing in Western nations. British Muslims have thus found themselves in a precarious situation, facing the prospect of heightened discrimination, suspicion, and potential alienation from broader society. In summary, the trans-Atlantic terror plot and the resulting court case involving the eight men charged with conspiracy to murder have overshadowed national conversations in the United Kingdom. It has brought forth crucial questions about the boundaries of counter-terrorism laws, the delicate balance of civil liberties, and the potentially detrimental effects on the nation's Islamic community. This complex and important case will remain a critical symbol of the fight against terrorism in the UK as it continues to reverberate through political, legal, and social spheres for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We propose a novel framework to generate clean video frames from a single motion-blurred image.  While a broad range of literature focuses on recovering a single image from a blurred image, in this work, we tackle a more challenging task i.e.  video restoration from a blurred image. We formulate video restoration from a single blurred image as an inverse problem by setting clean image sequence and their respective motion as latent factors, and the blurred image as an observation. Our framework is based on an encoder-decoder structure with spatial transformer network modules to restore a video sequence and its underlying motion in an end-to-end manner. We design a loss function and regularizers with complementary properties to stabilize the training and analyze variant models of the proposed network. The effectiveness and transferability of our network are highlighted through a large set of experiments on two different types of datasets: camera rotation blurs generated from panorama scenes and dynamic motion blurs in high speed videos.

They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that. Jody had borrowed someone's correction fluid -- in fact it was Mr Dickinson, the teacher's correction fluid -- but it was borrowed from someone who'd borrowed it from him. At the end of the lesson Jody was packing her stuff up and didn't know what to do with the bottle of white-out, so she tossed it out the window of the classroom. Dara had seen her do it, and thought it was just so cool. Jody had done it not in the hope of getting attention, because no one was paying attention, they were all packing up their own crap as fast as possible; she'd just done it.

To make that very specific, if we agree with you, does that mean that we would, in principle, have to hold the 1976 extension unconstitutional? I mean, in 1976, Congress extended the term from 28 years renewable once, to life of the author plus 50 years. Now they're extending it life of the author plus 70. If the latter is unconstitutional on your theory, how could the former not be? And if the former is, the chaos that would ensue would be horrendous. Hypothesis: The 1976 extension could be unconstitutional and off putting.","output":"The hypothesis proposed from the given context, \\"The 1976 extension could be unconstitutional and off-putting,\\" certainly fits within the realms of the discussion. In fact, the insinuations in the text suggest that there could be potential constitutional issues with the 1976 extension. However, it is also important to dig deeper into the matter to fully understand the implications and grounds for such a hypothesis. The context raises a hypothetical concern in the way copyright laws were amended by the U.S. Congress over time, in particular, the specific changes made in 1976 and thereafter. The 1976 Copyright Act extended copyright duration from 28 years, which was renewable once, to the life of the author plus 50 years. The latter modification extended it further to the life of the author plus 70 years. The speaker questions if these repeated extensions, specifically the move from a term of 'life of the author' plus 50 years to 'life of the author' plus 70 years, could be deemed unconstitutional. The speaker also poses an implicit question: If the more recent change (adding an extra 20 years to the term) is judged to be unconstitutional, could the 1976 modification—which shifted from a set term of years to a term based on the author's life—also be considered unconstitutional? One must note that the speaker seems to take no affirmative stand about the unconstitutionality of either extension. Instead, they pose it as a query or hypothetical situation in an attempt to explore the implications if such unconstitutionality were declared. The speaker goes on to express concern about the 'chaos' that might ensue if the 1976 extension were declared unconstitutional. This is where the \\"off-putting\\" part of the hypothesis comes into play. The speaker seems to suggest that such a dramatic reversal could cause significant disruption and confusion. It's important to mention that the unconstitutionality of these extensions would likely be related to concerns around limiting free speech or curtailing the public domain, which are fundamental to the constitutional framework supporting intellectual freedom. So, to conclude, the extracted hypothesis is indeed plausible, considering that the speaker brings up the potential unconstitutionality of 1976 extension and alludes to the potentially off-putting fallout from such a judgment. Yet, it should also be noted that no firm conclusion or judgment is made in this context. The concerns are presented as hypothetical and speculative, highlighting a possible but not definite interpretation of the repeated extensions to copyright duration."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given this review: \\"Everything's\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them.

Backpropagation is fundamental in training neural networks by adjusting weights and biases based on the error of the output. Let’s break down the process into more digestible steps and equations, using our own wording and examples for clarity. # 1. Initialization and Feedforward Pass Before diving into backpropagation, you start with an initialization step where you set up your neural network architecture, initializing all weights (θ) and biases (b) usually with small random values. The neural network takes an input vector (x) and produces an output (prediction) via its layers. The feedforward pass is where the neural network makes its predictions. This involves passing the input data through the network, layer by layer until the final output is produced. This is achieved by applying a weighted sum of inputs plus a bias at each layer, followed by an activation function to introduce non-linearity. Mathematically, for layer (l) (ignoring the bias for simplicity), this looks like: [h^{(l)} = g(theta^{(l-1)T}h^{(l-1)})] Where (h^{(l)}) is the output of layer (l), (theta^{(l-1)}) are the weights from layer (l-1) to layer (l), and (g()) is the activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid). # 2. Calculate the Output Error Once the feedforward process provides an output, you compare this output ((h^{(L)}), where (L) is the last layer) against the true labels (y) using a loss function (objective function) to calculate the error. This step is crucial for backpropagation since the goal is to minimize this error during training. # 3. Backpropagation - Backward Pass Backpropagation is essentially the backward pass through the network, where you compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter (weights and biases), telling us how to update our parameters to minimize the loss. Starting from the output layer, for the last layer (L), you calculate the error term (delta^{(L)}) which measures how much the output of the network contributed to the final error. This is given by: [delta^{(L)} = 2(h^{(L)} - y) cdot g’(theta^{(L-1)T}h^{(L-1)} + b^{(L-1)})] Here, (cdot) denotes element-wise multiplication, and (g’()) is the derivative of the activation function, indicating how the activation function’s output changes with its input. # 4. Propagate the Error Backwards For each preceding layer, (l = L-1, L-2, ldots, 2), you calculate the error term (delta^{(l)}) using the error term of the layer above ((l+1)) and the derivative of the activation function at layer (l): [delta^{(l)} = (theta^{(l)T} delta^{(l+1)}) cdot g’(theta^{(l-1)T}h^{(l-1)} + b^{(l-1)})] This step effectively propagates the error backward through the network, providing insight into how much each layer’s output needs to change to reduce the overall error. # 5. Gradient Computation With the error terms (delta^{(l)}) computed, you can now calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights (theta) and biases (b) at each layer: [Deltatheta^{(l)} = delta^{(l+1)}(h^{(l)})^T] [Delta b^{(l)} = delta^{(l+1)}] This tells us how much we need to adjust our weights and biases to minimize the loss. # 6. Update Weights and Biases Finally, using the gradients calculated, you update the weights and biases across the network, typically using an optimization algorithm like Gradient Descent. This step is iterated with multiple forward and backward passes with batched inputs until the network’s performance (as measured by the loss function) is satisfactory. In essence, backpropagation leverages the chain rule from calculus to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias in the network, allowing for efficient optimization of these parameters to minimize the loss.\\" Show the equation to Update Weights and Biases.","output":"The process of updating weights and biases in a neural network during the backpropagation step is crucial for learning. The equations for updating the weights and biases typically involve subtracting a portion of the gradient of the loss function with respect to those parameters, scaled by a learning rate ((eta)). Here's how it's done mathematically: # Update Equation for Weights Given the gradient of the loss with respect to the weights, (Deltatheta^{(l)}), calculated during backpropagation for layer (l), the update equation for the weights is: [theta^{(l)}_{text{new}} = theta^{(l)} - eta cdot Deltatheta^{(l)}] This equation means that we update each weight by subtracting a fraction (determined by the learning rate (eta)) of the calculated gradient. This fraction is essentially how big of a step we take in the direction that minimally reduces the loss, with each iteration of training. # Update Equation for Biases Similarly, given the gradient of the loss with respect to the biases, (Delta b^{(l)}), the update equation for the biases is: [b^{(l)}_{text{new}} = b^{(l)} - eta cdot Delta b^{(l)}] Again, we update each bias by subtracting a fraction (determined by the learning rate (eta)) of the calculated gradient. # Importance of Learning Rate ((eta)) - The learning rate (eta) is a hyperparameter that controls how much we are adjusting the weights of our network with respect to the loss gradient. A too small learning rate makes the learning process slow, as the steps towards the minimum of the loss function are tiny. Conversely, a too large learning rate can cause the learning process to oscillate or even diverge, as the steps taken might overshoot the minimum. # Illustrative Example Suppose you have a gradient calculated for a particular weight (Deltatheta = 0.05) and your learning rate (eta = 0.01). The update rule for the weight would be: [ theta_{text{new}} = theta - 0.01 cdot 0.05 = theta - 0.0005 ] So, if the current value of (theta = 0.5), then after the update, (theta_{text{new}} = 0.5 - 0.0005 = 0.4995). Executing this update process iteratively across all weights and biases in the network by using the whole dataset (or batches of it) is how neural networks \\"learn\\" from the input data. The goal is to iteratively decrease the error (loss) the network makes on its predictions, thereby increasing its accuracy and generalization capability to unseen data over time."},{"instruction":"Use arrow to represent update","output":"Certainly! When using arrows (→) to represent the update process in equations, it visually signifies the transition from the old value of a parameter to its new value after the update. Following the update rules for both weights and biases in the context of neural network training, here's how they can be rewritten with arrows: # Update Equation for Weights For the weights ((theta^{(l)})) at layer (l), the update equation, incorporating the learning rate ((eta)), and the gradient of the weight ((Deltatheta^{(l)})): [ theta^{(l)} rightarrow theta^{(l)} - eta cdot Deltatheta^{(l)} ] This notation visually represents that the old weights ((theta^{(l)})) are being updated to new values by subtracting the product of the learning rate ((eta)) and the gradient of the loss with respect to those weights. # Update Equation for Biases Similarly, for the biases ((b^{(l)})) at layer (l), the update equation can be represented as: [ b^{(l)} rightarrow b^{(l)} - eta cdot Delta b^{(l)} ] Again, this visually signifies that the old biases ((b^{(l)})) are updated to new values by subtracting the product of the learning rate ((eta)) and the gradient of the loss with respect to the biases. # Example with Numeric Values Imagine a scenario where you have a learning rate ((eta = 0.01)), a gradient for a weight ((Deltatheta = 0.05)), and a gradient for a bias ((Delta b = 0.02)). The update process using arrows would look like this: For weights: - Before: (theta = 0.5) - Update: (theta rightarrow 0.5 - 0.01 cdot 0.05) - After applying update: (theta rightarrow 0.5 - 0.0005 = 0.4995) For biases: - Before: (b = 0.3) - Update: (b rightarrow 0.3 - 0.01 cdot 0.02) - After applying update: (b rightarrow 0.3 - 0.0002 = 0.2998) These updated values for weights and biases would then be used in the next iteration of training (or the next forward and backward pass through the network), gradually improving the model's performance on the training data by minimizing the loss function."},{"instruction":"Briefly tell some advantage of back-propagation.","output":"Back-propagation is a cornerstone algorithm for training artificial neural networks and comes with several notable advantages: 1. **Efficiency in Gradient Computation**: Back-propagation allows the efficient calculation of gradients of the loss function with respect to all weights in the network by systematically applying the chain rule from calculus. This efficiency is crucial for training deep neural networks where the number of parameters can be in the millions. 2. **Facilitates Deep Learning**: It enables the training of deep neural networks by effectively propagating error signals from the output layer back to earlier layers. Without back-propagation, the training of deep networks would be impractical, as earlier layers would struggle to adjust their weights appropriately to minimize loss. 3. **Scalability**: Back-propagation scales relatively well with increasing network size and complexity, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple tasks to those requiring deep and complex neural network architectures. 4. **Adaptability with Various Architectures**: It is versatile and can be applied to different types of neural network architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and others. This versatility is a huge advantage because it means the fundamental learning method doesn’t need to change drastically as new neural network architectures are developed. 5. **Integration with Optimization Techniques**: Back-propagation is compatible with a variety of optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD, Adam, RMSprop) that influence how the network weights are updated based on the computed gradients. This compatibility allows for flexibility in finding the most effective way to minimize the loss function. 6. **Generalization to New Data**: By adjusting the weights to minimize the loss on a training dataset, neural networks trained using back-propagation can generalize well to new, unseen data. This ability is crucial for practical applications where the model needs to make predictions on data it has not explicitly been trained on. 7. **Automatic Feature Learning**: Back-propagation enables the network to automatically learn features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. This is particularly advantageous in complex data domains like image and speech recognition, where designing hand-crafted features would be extremely challenging. In summary, back-propagation is an essential algorithm that allows for the practical training of neural networks across a wide range of complexity and applications, leading to the current successes observed in the field of deep learning."},{"instruction":"In few sentences","output":"Back-propagation is a pivotal algorithm for training neural networks, known for its ability to efficiently compute gradients for weight updates, thereby facilitating the training of deep and complex architectures.

The inputs x provide the initial information that then propagates up to the hidden units at each layer and finally produces yˆ. This is called forward propagation. During training, forward propagation can continue onward until it produces a scalar cost J(θ). The back-propagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986a), often simply called backprop, allows the information from the cost to then flow backwards through the network, in order to compute the gradient. Computing an analytical expression for the gradient is straightforward, but numerically evaluating such an expression can be computationally expensive. The back-propagation algorithm does so using a simple and inexpensive procedure. The term back-propagation is often misunderstood as meaning the whole learning algorithm for multi-layer neural networks. Actually, back-propagation refers only to the method for computing the gradient, while another algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent, is used to perform learning using this gradient. Furthermore, back-propagation is often misunderstood as being specific to multilayer neural networks, but in principle it can compute derivatives of any function (for some functions, the correct response is to report that the derivative of the function is undefined). Specifically, we will describe how to compute the gradient ∇xf(x, y) for an arbitrary function f , wherex is a set of variables whose derivatives are desired, and y is an additional set of variables that are inputs to the function but whose derivatives are not required. In learning algorithms, the gradient we most often require is the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters, ∇θ J(θ). Many machine learning tasks involve computing other derivatives, either as part of the learning process, or to analyze the learned model. The backpropagation algorithm can be applied to these tasks as well, and is not restricted to computing the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters. The idea of computing derivatives by propagating information through a network is very general, and can be used to compute values such as the Jacobian of a function f with multiple outputs. We restrict our description here to the most commonly used case where f has a single output. 204 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS 6.5.1 Computational Graphs So far we have discussed neural networks with a relatively informal graph language. To describe the back-propagation algorithm more precisely, it is helpful to have a more precise computational graph language. Many ways of formalizing computation as graphs are possible. Here, we use each node in the graph to indicate a variable. The variable may be a scalar, vector, matrix, tensor, or even a variable of another type. To formalize our graphs, we also need to introduce the idea of an operation. An operation is a simple function of one or more variables. Our graph language is accompanied by a set of allowable operations. Functions more complicated than the operations in this set may be described by composing many operations together. Without loss of generality, we define an operation to return only a single output variable. This does not lose generality because the output variable can have multiple entries, such as a vector. Software implementations of back-propagation usually support operations with multiple outputs, but we avoid this case in our description because it introduces many extra details that are not important to conceptual understanding. If a variable y is computed by applying an operation to a variable x, then we draw a directed edge from x to y. We sometimes annotate the output node with the name of the operation applied, and other times omit this label when the operation is clear from context. Examples of computational graphs are shown in figure 6.8. 6.5.2 Chain Rule of Calculus The chain rule of calculus (not to be confused with the chain rule of probability) is used to compute the derivatives of functions formed by composing other functions whose derivatives are known. Back-propagation is an algorithm that computes the chain rule, with a specific order of operations that is highly efficient. Let x be a real number, and let f and g both be functions mapping from a real number to a real number. Suppose that y = g(x) and z = f (g(x)) = f (y). Then the chain rule states that dz dx = dz dy dy dx . (6.44) We can generalize this beyond the scalar case. Suppose that x ∈ Rm, y ∈ Rn, 205 CHAPTER 6.

(d)Examples a–c applied at most one operation to each variable, but it is possible to apply more than one operation. Here we show a computation graph that applies more than one operation to the weights w of a linear regression model. The weights are used to make both the prediction yˆ and the weight decay penalty λ  i w2 i . 206 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS g maps from Rm to Rn, and f maps from Rn to R. If y = g(x) and z = f(y), then ∂z ∂xi =  j ∂z ∂yj ∂yj ∂xi . (6.45) In vector notation, this may be equivalently written as ∇xz =  ∂y ∂x  ∇y z, (6.46) where ∂y ∂x is the n × m Jacobian matrix of g. From this we see that the gradient of a variable x can be obtained by multiplying a Jacobian matrix ∂y ∂x by a gradient ∇yz. The back-propagation algorithm consists of performing such a Jacobian-gradient product for each operation in the graph. Usually we do not apply the back-propagation algorithm merely to vectors, but rather to tensors of arbitrary dimensionality. Conceptually, this is exactly the same as back-propagation with vectors. The only difference is how the numbers are arranged in a grid to form a tensor. We could imagine flattening each tensor into a vector before we run back-propagation, computing a vector-valued gradient, and then reshaping the gradient back into a tensor. In this rearranged view, back-propagation is still just multiplying Jacobians by gradients. To denote the gradient of a value z with respect to a tensor X, we write ∇Xz, just as if X were a vector. The indices into X now have multiple coordinates—for example, a 3-D tensor is indexed by three coordinates. We can abstract this away by using a single variable i to represent the complete tuple of indices. For all possible index tuples i, (∇Xz)i gives ∂z ∂Xi . This is exactly the same as how for all possible integer indices i into a vector, (∇x z)i gives ∂z ∂xi . Using this notation, we can write the chain rule as it applies to tensors. If Y = g(X) and z = f(Y), then ∇X z = j (∇XYj ) ∂z ∂Yj . (6.47) 6.5.3 Recursively Applying the Chain Rule to Obtain Backprop Using the chain rule, it is straightforward to write down an algebraic expression for the gradient of a scalar with respect to any node in the computational graph that produced that scalar. However, actually evaluating that expression in a computer introduces some extra considerations. Specifically, many subexpressions may be repeated several times within the overall expression for the gradient. Any procedure that computes the gradient 207 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS will need to choose whether to store these subexpressions or to recompute them several times. An example of how these repeated subexpressions arise is given in figure 6.9. In some cases, computing the same subexpression twice would simply be wasteful. For complicated graphs, there can be exponentially many of these wasted computations, making a naive implementation of the chain rule infeasible. In other cases, computing the same subexpression twice could be a valid way to reduce memory consumption at the cost of higher runtime. We first begin by a version of the back-propagation algorithm that specifies the actual gradient computation directly (algorithm 6.2 along with algorithm 6.1 for the associated forward computation), in the order it will actually be done and according to the recursive application of chain rule. One could either directly perform these computations or view the description of the algorithm as a symbolic specification of the computational graph for computing the back-propagation. However, this formulation does not make explicit the manipulation and the construction of the symbolic graph that performs the gradient computation. Such a formulation is presented below in section 6.5.6, with algorithm 6.5, where we also generalize to nodes that contain arbitrary tensors. First consider a computational graph describing how to compute a single scalar u(n) (say the loss on a training example). This scalar is the quantity whose gradient we want to obtain, with respect to the ni input nodes u(1) to u(ni). In other words we wish to compute ∂u(n) ∂u(i) for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , ni}. In the application of back-propagation to computing gradients for gradient descent over parameters, u(n) will be the cost associated with an example or a minibatch, while u(1) to u(ni) correspond to the parameters of the model. We will assume that the nodes of the graph have been ordered in such a way that we can compute their output one after the other, starting at u(ni+1) and going up to u(n) . As defined in algorithm 6.1, each node u(i) is associated with an operation f(i) and is computed by evaluating the function u(i) = f(A(i) ) (6.48) where A(i) is the set of all nodes that are parents of u(i) . That algorithm specifies the forward propagation computation, which we could put in a graph G. In order to perform back-propagation, we can construct a computational graph that depends onG and adds to it an extra set of nodes. These form a subgraph B with one node per node of G. Computation in B proceeds in exactly the reverse of the order of computation in G, and each node of B computes the derivative ∂u(n) ∂u(i) associated with the forward graph node u(i) . This is done 208 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS Algorithm 6.1 A procedure that performs the computations mapping ni inputs u(1) to u(ni) to an output u(n) . This defines a computational graph where each node computes numerical value u(i) by applying a function f (i) to the set of arguments A(i) that comprises the values of previous nodes u(j) , j < i, with j ∈ Pa(u(i) ). The input to the computational graph is the vector x, and is set into the first ni nodes u(1) to u(ni ) . The output of the computational graph is read off the last (output) node u(n) . for i = 1, . . . , ni do u(i) ← xi end for for i = ni + 1, . . . , n do A(i) ← {u(j) | j ∈ Pa(u(i) )} u(i) ← f (i) (A(i) ) end for return u(n) using the chain rule with respect to scalar output u(n) : ∂u(n) ∂u(j) =  i:j∈Pa(u(i) ) ∂u(n) ∂u(i) ∂u(i) ∂u(j) (6.49) as specified by algorithm 6.2. The subgraph B contains exactly one edge for each edge from node u(j) to node u(i) of G. The edge from u(j) to u(i) is associated with the computation of ∂u(i) ∂u(j) . In addition, a dot product is performed for each node, between the gradient already computed with respect to nodes u(i) that are children of u(j) and the vector containing the partial derivatives ∂u(i) ∂u(j) for the same children nodes u(i) . To summarize, the amount of computation required for performing the back-propagation scales linearly with the number of edges in G, where the computation for each edge corresponds to computing a partial derivative (of one node with respect to one of its parents) as well as performing one multiplication and one addition. Below, we generalize this analysis to tensor-valued nodes, which is just a way to group multiple scalar values in the same node and enable more efficient implementations. The back-propagation algorithm is designed to reduce the number of common subexpressions without regard to memory. Specifically, it performs on the order of one Jacobian product per node in the graph. This can be seen from the fact that backprop (algorithm 6.2) visits each edge from node u(j) to node u(i) of the graph exactly once in order to obtain the associated partial derivative ∂u(i) ∂u(j) . 209 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS Algorithm 6.2 Simplified version of the back-propagation algorithm for computing the derivatives of u(n) with respect to the variables in the graph. This example is intended to further understanding by showing a simplified case where all variables are scalars, and we wish to compute the derivatives with respect to u(1), . . . , u(ni ) . This simplified version computes the derivatives of all nodes in the graph. The computational cost of this algorithm is proportional to the number of edges in the graph, assuming that the partial derivative associated with each edge requires a constant time. This is of the same order as the number of computations for the forward propagation. Each ∂u(i) ∂u(j) is a function of the parents u(j) of u(i) , thus linking the nodes of the forward graph to those added for the back-propagation graph. Run forward propagation (algorithm 6.1 for this example) to obtain the activations of the network Initialize grad_table, a data structure that will store the derivatives that have been computed. The entry grad_table[u(i) ] will store the computed value of ∂u(n) ∂u(i) . grad_table[u(n) ] ← 1 for j = n − 1 down to 1 do The next line computes ∂u(n) ∂u(j) =  i:j∈Pa(u(i) ) ∂u(n) ∂u(i) ∂u (i) ∂u(j) using stored values: grad_table[u(j) ] ←  i:j∈Pa(u(i)) grad_table[u(i) ] ∂u(i) ∂u(j) end for return {grad_table[u(i) ] | i = 1, . . . , ni} Back-propagation thus avoids the exponential explosion in repeated subexpressions. However, other algorithms may be able to avoid more subexpressions by performing simplifications on the computational graph, or may be able to conserve memory by recomputing rather than storing some subexpressions. We will revisit these ideas after describing the back-propagation algorithm itself. 6.5.4 Back-Propagation Computation in Fully-Connected MLP To clarify the above definition of the back-propagation computation, let us consider the specific graph associated with a fully-connected multi-layer MLP. Algorithm 6.3 first shows the forward propagation, which maps parameters to the supervised loss L(yˆ, y) associated with a single (input,target) training example (x, y), with ˆy the output of the neural network when x is provided in input. Algorithm 6.4 then shows the corresponding computation to be done for 210 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS z x y w f f f Figure 6.9: A computational graph that results in repeated subexpressions when computing the gradient. Let w ∈ R be the input to the graph. We use the same function f : R → R as the operation that we apply at every step of a chain: x = f(w), y = f(x), z = f( y). To compute ∂z ∂w , we apply equation 6.44 and obtain: ∂z ∂w (6.50) = ∂z ∂y ∂y ∂x ∂x ∂w (6.51) =f (y)f (x)f (w) (6.52) =f (f(f(w)))f  (f(w))f (w) (6.53) Equation 6.52 suggests an implementation in which we compute the value off (w) only once and store it in the variable x. This is the approach taken by the back-propagation algorithm. An alternative approach is suggested by equation 6.53, where the subexpression f(w) appears more than once. In the alternative approach, f(w) is recomputed each time it is needed. When the memory required to store the value of these expressions is low, the back-propagation approach of equation 6.52 is clearly preferable because of its reduced runtime. However, equation 6.53 is also a valid implementation of the chain rule, and is useful when memory is limited. 211 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS applying the back-propagation algorithm to this graph. Algorithms 6.3 and 6.4 are demonstrations that are chosen to be simple and straightforward to understand. However, they are specialized to one specific problem. Modern software implementations are based on the generalized form of backpropagation described in section 6.5.6 below, which can accommodate any computational graph by explicitly manipulating a data structure for representing symbolic computation. Algorithm 6.3 Forward propagation through a typical deep neural network and the computation of the cost function. The loss L(yˆ, y) depends on the output yˆ and on the target y (see section 6.2.1.1 for examples of loss functions). To obtain the total cost J, the loss may be added to a regularizer Ω(θ), where θ contains all the parameters (weights and biases). Algorithm 6.4 shows how to compute gradients of J with respect to parameters W and b. For simplicity, this demonstration uses only a single input example x. Practical applications should use a minibatch. See section 6.5.7 for a more realistic demonstration. Require: Network depth, l Require: W(i) ,i ∈ {1, . . . , l}, the weight matrices of the model Require: b(i) ,i ∈ {1, . . . , l}, the bias parameters of the model Require: x, the input to process Require: y, the target output h(0) = x for k = 1, . . . , l do a(k) = b(k) + W(k)h(k−1) h(k) = f(a(k) ) end for yˆ = h(l) J = L(yˆ, y) + λΩ(θ) 6.5.5 Symbol-to-Symbol Derivatives Algebraic expressions and computational graphs both operate on symbols, or variables that do not have specific values. These algebraic and graph-based representations are called symbolic representations. When we actually use or train a neural network, we must assign specific values to these symbols. We replace a symbolic input to the network x with a specific numeric value, such as [1.2, 3.765, −1.8]. 212 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS Algorithm 6.4 Backward computation for the deep neural network of algorithm 6.3, which uses in addition to the input x a target y. This computation yields the gradients on the activations a(k) for each layer k, starting from the output layer and going backwards to the first hidden layer. From these gradients, which can be interpreted as an indication of how each layer’s output should change to reduce error, one can obtain the gradient on the parameters of each layer. The gradients on weights and biases can be immediately used as part of a stochastic gradient update (performing the update right after the gradients have been computed) or used with other gradient-based optimization methods. After the forward computation, compute the gradient on the output layer: g ← ∇yˆJ = ∇yˆL(yˆ, y) for k = l, l − 1, . . . , 1 do Convert the gradient on the layer’s output into a gradient into the prenonlinearity activation (element-wise multiplication if f is element-wise): g ← ∇a(k)J = g  f (a(k) ) Compute gradients on weights and biases (including the regularization term, where needed): ∇b(k)J = g + λ∇b(k)Ω(θ) ∇W (k)J = g h(k−1) + λ∇W (k)Ω(θ) Propagate the gradients w.r.t. the next lower-level hidden layer’s activations: g ← ∇h(k−1) J = W(k) g end for 213 CHAPTER 6.

In this approach, the back-propagation algorithm does not need to ever access any actual specific numeric values. Instead, it adds nodes to a computational graph describing how to compute these derivatives. A generic graph evaluation engine can later compute the derivatives for any specific numeric values. (Left)In this example, we begin with a graph representing z = f (f(f (w))). (Right)We run the back-propagation algorithm, instructing it to construct the graph for the expression corresponding to dz dw . In this example, we do not explain how the back-propagation algorithm works. The purpose is only to illustrate what the desired result is: a computational graph with a symbolic description of the derivative. Some approaches to back-propagation take a computational graph and a set of numerical values for the inputs to the graph, then return a set of numerical values describing the gradient at those input values. We call this approach “symbolto-number” differentiation. This is the approach used by libraries such as Torch (Collobert et al., 2011b) and Caffe (Jia, 2013). Another approach is to take a computational graph and add additional nodes to the graph that provide a symbolic description of the desired derivatives. This is the approach taken by Theano (Bergstra et al., 2010; Bastien et al., 2012) and TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015). An example of how this approach works is illustrated in figure 6.10. The primary advantage of this approach is that the derivatives are described in the same language as the original expression. Because the derivatives are just another computational graph, it is possible to run back-propagation again, differentiating the derivatives in order to obtain higher derivatives. Computation of higher-order derivatives is described in section 6.5.10. We will use the latter approach and describe the back-propagation algorithm in 214 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS terms of constructing a computational graph for the derivatives. Any subset of the graph may then be evaluated using specific numerical values at a later time. This allows us to avoid specifying exactly when each operation should be computed. Instead, a generic graph evaluation engine can evaluate every node as soon as its parents’ values are available. The description of the symbol-to-symbol based approach subsumes the symbolto-number approach. The symbol-to-number approach can be understood as performing exactly the same computations as are done in the graph built by the symbol-to-symbol approach. The key difference is that the symbol-to-number approach does not expose the graph. 6.5.6 General Back-Propagation The back-propagation algorithm is very simple. To compute the gradient of some scalar z with respect to one of its ancestors x in the graph, we begin by observing that the gradient with respect to z is given by dz dz = 1. We can then compute the gradient with respect to each parent of z in the graph by multiplying the current gradient by the Jacobian of the operation that produced z. We continue multiplying by Jacobians traveling backwards through the graph in this way until we reach x. For any node that may be reached by going backwards from z through two or more paths, we simply sum the gradients arriving from different paths at that node. More formally, each node in the graph G corresponds to a variable. To achieve maximum generality, we describe this variable as being a tensor V. Tensor can in general have any number of dimensions. They subsume scalars, vectors, and matrices. We assume that each variable V is associated with the following subroutines: • get_operation(V): This returns the operation that computes V, represented by the edges coming into V in the computational graph. For example, there may be a Python or C++ class representing the matrix multiplication operation, and the get_operation function. Suppose we have a variable that is created by matrix multiplication, C = AB. Then get_operation(V) returns a pointer to an instance of the corresponding C++ class. • get_consumers(V, G): This returns the list of variables that are children of V in the computational graph G. • get_inputs(V, G): This returns the list of variables that are parents of V in the computational graph G. 215 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS Each operation op is also associated with a bprop operation. This bprop operation can compute a Jacobian-vector product as described by equation 6.47. This is how the back-propagation algorithm is able to achieve great generality. Each operation is responsible for knowing how to back-propagate through the edges in the graph that it participates in. For example, we might use a matrix multiplication operation to create a variable C = AB. Suppose that the gradient of a scalar z with respect to C is given by G. The matrix multiplication operation is responsible for defining two back-propagation rules, one for each of its input arguments. If we call the bprop method to request the gradient with respect to A given that the gradient on the output is G, then the bprop method of the matrix multiplication operation must state that the gradient with respect to A is given by GB. Likewise, if we call the bprop method to request the gradient with respect to B, then the matrix operation is responsible for implementing the bprop method and specifying that the desired gradient is given by AG. The back-propagation algorithm itself does not need to know any differentiation rules. It only needs to call each operation’s bprop rules with the right arguments. Formally, op.bprop(inputs, X, G) must return  i (∇ Xop.f(inputs)i) Gi, (6.54) which is just an implementation of the chain rule as expressed in equation 6.47. Here, inputs is a list of inputs that are supplied to the operation, op.f is the mathematical function that the operation implements,X is the input whose gradient we wish to compute, and G is the gradient on the output of the operation. The op.bprop method should always pretend that all of its inputs are distinct from each other, even if they are not. For example, if the mul operator is passed two copies of x to compute x2, the op.bprop method should still return x as the derivative with respect to both inputs. The back-propagation algorithm will later add both of these arguments together to obtain 2x, which is the correct total derivative on x. Software implementations of back-propagation usually provide both the operations and their bprop methods, so that users of deep learning software libraries are able to back-propagate through graphs built using common operations like matrix multiplication, exponents, logarithms, and so on. Software engineers who build a new implementation of back-propagation or advanced users who need to add their own operation to an existing library must usually derive the op.bprop method for any new operations manually. The back-propagation algorithm is formally described in algorithm 6.5. 216 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS Algorithm 6.5 The outermost skeleton of the back-propagation algorithm. This portion does simple setup and cleanup work. Most of the important work happens in the build_grad subroutine of algorithm 6.6 . Require: T, the target set of variables whose gradients must be computed. Require: G, the computational graph Require: z, the variable to be differentiated Let G be G pruned to contain only nodes that are ancestors of z and descendents of nodes in T. Initialize grad_table, a data structure associating tensors to their gradients grad_table[z] ← 1 for V in T do build_grad(V, G, G , grad_table) end for Return grad_table restricted to T In section 6.5.2, we explained that back-propagation was developed in order to avoid computing the same subexpression in the chain rule multiple times. The naive algorithm could have exponential runtime due to these repeated subexpressions. Now that we have specified the back-propagation algorithm, we can understand its computational cost. If we assume that each operation evaluation has roughly the same cost, then we may analyze the computational cost in terms of the number of operations executed. Keep in mind here that we refer to an operation as the fundamental unit of our computational graph, which might actually consist of very many arithmetic operations (for example, we might have a graph that treats matrix multiplication as a single operation). Computing a gradient in a graph with n nodes will never execute more than O(n2) operations or store the output of more than O(n2) operations. Here we are counting operations in the computational graph, not individual operations executed by the underlying hardware, so it is important to remember that the runtime of each operation may be highly variable. For example, multiplying two matrices that each contain millions of entries might correspond to a single operation in the graph. We can see that computing the gradient requires as most O(n2) operations because the forward propagation stage will at worst execute all n nodes in the original graph (depending on which values we want to compute, we may not need to execute the entire graph). The back-propagation algorithm adds one Jacobian-vector product, which should be expressed with O(1) nodes, per edge in the original graph. Because the computational graph is a directed acyclic graph it has at most O(n2 ) edges. For the kinds of graphs that are commonly used in practice, the situation is even better. Most neural network cost functions are 217 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS Algorithm 6.6 The inner loop subroutine build_grad(V, G, G , grad_table) of the back-propagation algorithm, called by the back-propagation algorithm defined in algorithm 6.5. Require: V, the variable whose gradient should be added to G and grad_table. Require: G, the graph to modify. Require: G , the restriction of G to nodes that participate in the gradient. Require: grad_table, a data structure mapping nodes to their gradients if V is in grad_table then Return grad_table[V] end if i ← 1 for C in get_consumers(V, G ) do op ← get_operation© D ← build_grad(C, G,G , grad_table) G(i) ← op.bprop(get_inputs(C, G ), V, D) i ← i + 1 end for G ← i G(i) grad_table[V] = G Insert G and the operations creating it into G Return G roughly chain-structured, causing back-propagation to have O(n) cost. This is far better than the naive approach, which might need to execute exponentially many nodes. This potentially exponential cost can be seen by expanding and rewriting the recursive chain rule (equation 6.49) non-recursively: ∂u(n) ∂u(j) =  path (u(π1),u(π2) ,…,u(πt) ), from π1=j to πt=n  t k=2 ∂u(πk) ∂u(πk−1 ) . (6.55) Since the number of paths from node j to node n can grow exponentially in the length of these paths, the number of terms in the above sum, which is the number of such paths, can grow exponentially with the depth of the forward propagation graph. This large cost would be incurred because the same computation for ∂u(i) ∂u(j) would be redone many times. To avoid such recomputation, we can think of back-propagation as a table-filling algorithm that takes advantage of storing intermediate results ∂u(n) ∂u(i) . Each node in the graph has a corresponding slot in a table to store the gradient for that node. By filling in these table entries in order, 218 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS back-propagation avoids repeating many common subexpressions. This table-filling strategy is sometimes called dynamic programming. 6.5.7 Example: Back-Propagation for MLP Training As an example, we walk through the back-propagation algorithm as it is used to train a multilayer perceptron. Here we develop a very simple multilayer perception with a single hidden layer. To train this model, we will use minibatch stochastic gradient descent. The back-propagation algorithm is used to compute the gradient of the cost on a single minibatch. Specifically, we use a minibatch of examples from the training set formatted as a design matrix X and a vector of associated class labels y. The network computes a layer of hidden features H = max{0, XW(1)}. To simplify the presentation we do not use biases in this model. We assume that our graph language includes a relu operation that can compute max{0, Z} elementwise. The predictions of the unnormalized log probabilities over classes are then given by HW (2). We assume that our graph language includes a cross_entropy operation that computes the cross-entropy between the targets y and the probability distribution defined by these unnormalized log probabilities. The resulting crossentropy defines the cost JMLE. Minimizing this cross-entropy performs maximum likelihood estimation of the classifier. However, to make this example more realistic, we also include a regularization term. The total cost J = JMLE + λ   i,j  W (1) i,j 2 +  i,j  W(2) i,j 2   (6.56) consists of the cross-entropy and a weight decay term with coefficient λ. The computational graph is illustrated in figure 6.11. The computational graph for the gradient of this example is large enough that it would be tedious to draw or to read. This demonstrates one of the benefits of the back-propagation algorithm, which is that it can automatically generate gradients that would be straightforward but tedious for a software engineer to derive manually. We can roughly trace out the behavior of the back-propagation algorithm by looking at the forward propagation graph in figure 6.11. To train, we wish to compute both ∇W (1)J and ∇W (2)J. There are two different paths leading backward from J to the weights: one through the cross-entropy cost, and one through the weight decay cost. The weight decay cost is relatively simple; it will always contribute 2λW(i) to the gradient on W(i) . 219 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS X W (1) U (1) matmul H relu U (3) sqr u(4) sum W (2) u(7) λ U (2) matmul y JMLE cross_entropy U (5) sqr u(6) sum u(8) J + × + Figure 6.11: The computational graph used to compute the cost used to train our example of a single-layer MLP using the cross-entropy loss and weight decay. The other path through the cross-entropy cost is slightly more complicated. Let G be the gradient on the unnormalized log probabilities U(2) provided by the cross_entropy operation. The back-propagation algorithm now needs to explore two different branches. On the shorter branch, it adds H G to the gradient on W(2) , using the back-propagation rule for the second argument to the matrix multiplication operation. The other branch corresponds to the longer chain descending further along the network. First, the back-propagation algorithm computes ∇HJ = GW(2) using the back-propagation rule for the first argument to the matrix multiplication operation. Next, the relu operation uses its backpropagation rule to zero out components of the gradient corresponding to entries of U(1) that were less than 0. Let the result be called G . The last step of the back-propagation algorithm is to use the back-propagation rule for the second argument of the matmul operation to add XG to the gradient on W(1). After these gradients have been computed, it is the responsibility of the gradient descent algorithm, or another optimization algorithm, to use these gradients to update the parameters. For the MLP, the computational cost is dominated by the cost of matrix multiplication. During the forward propagation stage, we multiply by each weight 220 CHAPTER 6. DEEP FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS matrix, resulting in O(w) multiply-adds, where w is the number of weights. During the backward propagation stage, we multiply by the transpose of each weight matrix, which has the same computational cost. The main memory cost of the algorithm is that we need to store the input to the nonlinearity of the hidden layer. This value is stored from the time it is computed until the backward pass has returned to the same point. The memory cost is thus O(mnh), where m is the number of examples in the minibatch and nh is the number of hidden units. ” Summarize the above basic principle of back-propagation for neural network training with more equations, try to use your own words, do not directly copy the sentence from the above paper.","output":"Back-propagation is a fundamental algorithm used for training neural networks, primarily used for optimizing the weights of the network by minimizing the cost or loss function. Here's a concise summary, focusing more on the mathematical formulation using my own wording: In a feedforward neural network, information progresses from the input layer (x) through one or more hidden layers, culminating in an output ( hat{y} ), through a process known as forward propagation. During training, forward propagation is used to calculate a loss, (J(theta)), which quantifies the difference between the network's prediction ( hat{y} ) and the true output (y). Back-propagation, introduced by Rumelhart et al. in 1986, is then employed to calculate the gradients of this loss function with respect to the network's weights ( theta ). Despite common misinterpretation, back-propagation solely pertains to the computation of gradients, whereas the adjustment of weights involves another algorithm, typically stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The back-propagation employs the chain rule from calculus to efficiently compute these gradients. For functions of a real variable, the chain rule is expressed as: [ frac{dz}{dx} = frac{dz}{dy} cdot frac{dy}{dx} ] This concept extends to multivariable functions, where derivatives are represented as Jacobian matrices. If we have a function mapping from (mathbb{R}^m) to (mathbb{R}^n), followed by a scalar-valued function, the gradient of the scalar with respect to the input vector can be computed using the product of Jacobians. Central to back-propagation is the computational graph, which represents the operations carried out by the neural network. Each node in this graph corresponds to a variable (which could be a scalar, vector, matrix, etc.), and edges represent operations on these variables. By traversing this graph in reverse, starting from the output back to the inputs, back-propagation applies the chain rule to compute gradients efficiently, avoiding redundant calculations. Consider a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer, for example. Forward propagation for this MLP might look like (H = max(0, XW^{(1)})), which denotes the activation of the hidden layer after applying a ReLU nonlinearity to the weighted input (XW^{(1)}). The final output might be computed as (U^{(2)} = HW^{(2)}), with (W^{(1)}) and (W^{(2)}) representing the weights of the first and second layers, respectively. To minimize a loss function (J), which could include a cross-entropy term for classification and a regularization term for weight decay, back-propagation computes gradients ( nabla_{W^{(1)}} J ) and ( nabla_{W^{(2)}} J ) to update weights in the direction that minimizes (J). The process of back-propagation efficiently computes these gradients by systematically applying the chain rule through the computational graph, using local gradients of operations (represented by Jacobian matrices) and accumulating contributions from different paths due to the connectivity of the network. It requires storing intermediate values from the forward pass to use in the backward pass, and the computational cost is primarily driven by the cost of these forward operations, such as matrix multiplications, along with the additional steps to compute the Jacobian-vector products during back-propagation. In sum, back-propagation is a powerful and efficient algorithm that leverages the structure of the neural network and the chain rule to compute gradients, which are then used by another algorithm, like SGD, to adjust the weights and minimize the loss function during training."},{"instruction":"Briefly tell some advantage of back-propagation","output":"Back-propagation offers several key advantages that have made it a central algorithm in the training of neural networks: 1. **Efficiency**: It computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by efficiently using the chain rule, avoiding redundant calculations through its systematic backward pass.

Regardless of the network's depth or the number of parameters, back-propagation can compute gradients in a time that is linearly proportional to the number of edges in the computational graph, making it practical for large neural networks. 3. **Applicability**: Back-propagation is versatile and can be used to optimize any network architecture, including feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), as long as the network functions are differentiable. 4. **Automation of Gradient Computation**: It automates the differentiation process, eliminating the need for manual computation of gradients.

勇於擔當・試以「承擔」為題，作文一篇。","output":"在我們的生活中，「承擔」是一個每個人都將面臨的課題。它不僅是一種責任感的體現，也是成長的標記。從歷史的長河中，不難發現那些留名青史的偉人，都是敢於承擔的人。范仲淹的「先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂」，極力強調了負責任態度的重要性；諸葛亮在國家困難時期，毅然擔起重任，展現出的是一种至高無上的忠誠和責任感；而莊子的「無所可用，安可困苦哉」則從另一個角度告訴我們，有時承擔並不意味著負重前行，而是要明白放下也是一種智慧。這些歷史人物的態度和選擇，給予我們深刻的啟迪。 在當代社會，「承擔」的意義同樣重大。不論是在職場上的責任、家庭中的角色承擔，抑或是對社會、對國家的責任感，都是支持社會運行的重要因素。但真正的挑戰在於，當面臨困難和壓力時，我們是否還能夠堅持承擔。 承擔意味著勇氣和決心。它要求我們在遇到挑戰時不逃避，不推談，而是勇敢面對，積極解決。這可能意味著要付出更多的努力，也可能意味著要經歷失敗和挫敗。然而，正是這種不懼艱難、勇於承擔的態度，塑造了我們的個性，讓我們在逆境中成長，最終達到自我超越。 「承擔」也是對他人的一種尊重。當我們承諾給某人時，無論是一項工作、一次幫助，還是一份感情，我們的承擔就意味著我們對這份關係的重視和尊重。這之中蘊含的信任和責任感，是人際交往中不可或缺的。 總之，「承擔」既是對自身的一種挑戰，也是對他人的一份承諾。生活中，我們每個人都會面對各種大小不同的「承擔」，而我們對待這些承擔的態度，將直接影響到我們的人生路程和價值實現。正如范仲淹、諸葛亮、莊子所展現的那樣，承擔不僅是一種責任，更是一種智慧和勇氣的展現。未來的路上，讓我們以更加成熟和勇敢的態度，去面對每一次的「承擔」，不斷成長，不斷超越。"},{"instruction":"字數在1200字左右，另外分別加入古今的事例例子，豐富其內涵","output":"在人類的曆史長河中，「承擔」一直是塑造偉人與普通人不同的一個重要特質。它不僅代表著個人的責任感和奉獻精神，也反映了一個人的價值觀和道德境界。從古至今，那些敢於承擔、勇於面對挑戰的人總能在人類的曆史上留下深刻的印記。 古代的范仲淹，在《岳陽樓記》中提出了“先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂”的高尚情懷，這不僅是他個人對社會責任的深刻理解，也是古代士大夫階級對於承擔的一種集體表達。在他看來，身為一名士大夫，應當將國家與民族的興衰視為己任，將個人的榮辱與國家的利益緊密連接起來，這種精神至今仍然激勵著無數人為公共利益奮不顧身。 諸葛亮在艱難的三國時代，面對著國家危機，仍然堅持“忠心耿耿，死而後已”的原則，他的一生可謂是一部承擔與奉獻的史詩。在劉備臨終時，諸葛亮受託輔助幼主，其“鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已”的精神足以影響一代又一代的中國人，告誡人們無論處於何種困境中都應當盡自己最大的努力，為了集體的利益和目標不懈奮鬥。 當然，承擔的精神不僅僅展現在古代，現代社會同樣有著許多感人至深的例子。比如在抗擊新冠肺炎疫情的戰鬥中，無數醫護人員挺身而出，他們冒著生命危險留在第一線，用自己的專業知識和無私奉獻來保護人民的生命安全，這種精神是對“承擔”最好的詮釋。 再比如，現代企業界有許多創業者在面對重重困難時不畏艱難，勇於承擔，最終實現從無到有的蛻變。馬斯克在推動SpaceX探索太空的過程中即面臨了無數挑戰，多次發射失敗讓公司一度處於破產邊緣，但他始終沒有放棄，最終成功將SpaceX推向了新的高度，這種堅持與承擔精神極大地推動了人類進入太空的腳步。 在日常生活中，我們每個人都會遇到各種困難和挑戰，而如何面對這些挑戰，很大程度上取決於我們是否有勇氣和決心去承擔責任。從小事做起，比如學生時代認真學習、工作中積極進取、對家人的責任和關懷，這些都是承擔的表現。隻有當我們學會承擔，面對困難不逃避、不推卸責任，積極尋找解決問題的方法，我們才能在逆境中成長，實現自我超越。 綜上所述，無論是古代的范仲淹、諸葛亮，還是現代的醫護人員、企業家，他們的故事都告訴我們，承擔是一種無價的精神財富，它能夠激勵人們在面對困難與挑戰時勇於前行，不斷探索和追求，最終達到個人和社會的和諧共贏。因此，我們每個人都應該學會承擔，用自己的行動為社會的進步和發展作出貢獻。"},{"instruction":"有人說：「我們對待任何人都要懷着尊重的心。」也有人說：「對討厭的人、不認識的人表現出尊重，其實是一種虛偽。」試以「談尊重」為題寫作文章一篇，談談你的看法。","output":"談尊重 在當今社會中，尊重是一個被廣泛討論且重視的話題。尊重的意義不僅僅是對他人的一種基本態度，更是一種社會文明進步的體現。有人認為，對待任何人都要懷着尊重的心，這反映了一種平等、公正的價值觀；然而，也有人認為，對自己討厭的人或不認識的人表現出尊重，其實是一種虛偽行為。這兩種看法之間的分歧，引發了對尊重本質的深入思考。 首先，我們需要明確尊重的真正含義。尊重不僅僅是表面的禮貌或是策略上的處理方式，而是一種認識到每個人都具有內在價值和尊嚴，因而應當被適當對待的態度。這種尊重建立在平等的基礎之上，認為無論一個人的背景、地位、品味如何，他或她都應被公正地看待。從這個角度來看，對所有人表達尊重並非虛偽，而是一種理想的社會行為準則。 然而，現實情況往往比理想復雜。人與人之間的互動充滿了情感和主觀判斷，面對那些我們不認識或者甚至討厭的人，依然表現出尊重確實需要付出額外的努力。這種努力並非毫無價值，而是通往理解和寬容的一個重要步驟。即使面對那些我們並不喜歡的人，保持基本的尊重，可以避免不必要的衝突和誤解，維護社會的和諧。 值得注意的是，尊重並非意味着無條件的妥協或忍讓。在尊重他人的同時，也應該學會尊重自己，設立合理的界限。當他人的行為侵犯到我們的權利或價值觀時，有權利以恰當的方式表達不同意見和感受，這種表達同樣基於尊重的原則。真正的尊重是雙向的，它要求我們既尊重他人，也關照自己的感受和權益。 因此，對待任何人都懷着尊重的心，不是虛偽，而是一種成熟社會所應有的態度。這種尊重既包括對他人的基本禮貌和尊嚴的認可，也包括對自己界限的堅持和保護。在日常生活中實踐這種尊重，可以增進人與人之間的理解和和諧，促進社會的整體進步。 總之，尊重是一種價值觀，也是一種實踐。它要求我們在與人交往中不斷學習和反思，既要懂得如何尊重他人，也要明白如何適當地維護自己的尊嚴和權益。只有在相互尊重的基礎上，我們才能建立起更加和諧、包容的人際關系和社會環境。"},{"instruction":"結合一些例子讓道理更易明，冷靜下來思考後再寫1200字左右的作文（談尊重）","output":"談尊重 在當今多元化的社會中，尊重已成為維繫人際關係和社會和諧的基石。然而，關於尊重的討論常常伴隨著爭議和不同的見解，尤其是當面對不認識的人或不喜歡的人時，尊重是否仍應成為我們行為的準則？通過探討尊重的真正含義及其在各種情境下的實踐方式，我們或許能更深刻地理解尊重的價值。 尊重的本質，在於認識到每個人都有其內在價值和獨立人格，而這種認識應當超越個人情感和主觀偏好。就像尼爾森·曼德拉所說：“尊重他人並不意味著你必須喜歡他們，尊重是關於你如何對待他們。”這句話道出了尊重的核心精神：即使面對不認識或不喜歡的人，我們也應保持基本的禮貌和正義，這不是虛偽，而是文明社會的標誌。 以一個常見的例子來說明：在日常生活中，我們或許會在公共交通工具上遇到各種各樣的人。面對那些大聲通話或者佔用多個座位的乘客，我們內心可能會感到不快或失望，但這不意味著我們應該用侮辱或攻擊的方式來對待他們。儘管他們的行為可能令人反感，通過平和而有理性的方式提醒或對話，更能反映出我們尊重他人的修養。同時，這種做法也更有可能促成對方行為的改變，達到理想的社會和諧狀態。 進一步來說，尊重是建立在理解和同情的基礎之上的。在多元文化的背景下，我們會接觸到來自不同文化背景的人。這些文化差異有時可能會導致誤解甚至衝突。一個經典的例子是，不同國家對於時間觀念的差異。在某些文化中，約定時間被嚴格遵守，而在另一些文化中，時間觀念更為寬鬆。當我們遇到不同文化背景的人時，保持開放的態度，努力理解和尊重他們的文化習慣，才能建立起相互尊重的關係。這不僅有助於個人之間的和諧相處，也促進了文化的交流和融合。 然而，尊重並不意味著對不公正和不道德行為的容忍。在面對侵犯人權、歧視和不公正待遇時，尊重的概念更應該體現為對正義的捍衛。馬丁·路德·金在為平等權利奮鬥的過程中，展現了通過非暴力方式仍堅持信念和尊嚴的做法。他的行動告訴我們，尊重是對所有人的基本權利的認同，並且當這些權利受到威脅時，透過合適的渠道爭取正義，同樣是尊重的體現。 綜上所述，尊重是一種無價的社會貨幣，它建立在相互理解和公平的基礎之上，超越了個人的偏好與情感。透過尊重他人，我們展現出尊重自己，同時為建立一個更加開放、包容和平等的社會奠定基礎。面對不同的人和情況時，我們應時刻保持這種尊重的態度，不僅因為這是對他人的基本禮貌，更是對自己人格的尊重。"},{"instruction":"以上是多少字","output":"上面的回答包含了大约625字。"},{"instruction":"但我需要1200字 請你盡可能合乎字數要求","output":"談尊重 在當今這個多元化的世界裡，尊重不僅是一種美德，也是促進人與人之間和諧關係的基礎。尊重反映了一個人的品德與修養，是社會文明進步的重要標誌。然而，當我們面對不認識的人或者討厭的人時，是否仍應堅持尊重他們？對此，不同的人有不同的看法，但在我眼中，尊重應當成為我們對待每一個人的態度，無論是誰。 首先，尊重每個人的重要性不僅僅在於維護對方的尊嚴和感情，更在於體現了公平和正義的社會價值。在日常生活中，我們經常能看到尊重的力量。比如，當我們在公共場合遇到語言不通的外國人時，即使雙方無法完全理解對方的言語，但透過禮貌的態度和非言語的溝通，比如微笑和點頭，也能讓對方感受到尊重和友好。這種尊重跨越了語言和文化的障礙，促進了人與人之間的理解和和諧。 然而，對一些我們不喜歡或者不熟悉的人表達尊重，對於一些人來說似乎是一種挑戰。他們認為，這種做法是虛偽的，因為它並不反映真實的情感。這種觀點忽略了一個關鍵點：尊重並不意味著必須喜歡對方，而是一種基本的社會行為準則。在職場中，我們經常需要與不同性格和背景的同事合作，彼此之間可能存在觀點不合或甚至個人矛盾。然而，透過保持專業態度和相互尊重，團隊可以超越個人差異，有效合作，達成共同目標。這不僅是尊重他人的表現，也是對自己職業素養的體現。 進一步地，尊重還能夠成為促進個體成長和社會進步的動力。在教育中，尊重學生的意見和思考方式，鼓勵他們表達不同觀點，這種尊重能激勵學生的學習熱情和創新思維，促進他們的個人發展。同樣，在社會議題上，當我們尊重不同群體的聲音和需求，透過對話而非對立來解決問題，社會才能更加和諧，面對挑戰時也更有韌性。 當然，尊重不意味著無條件退讓或妥協。真正的尊重是建立在理解和認同每個人的基本權利以及尊嚴的基礎上，它要求我們在堅持自己權益的同時，也考慮到他人的感受和需要。在有分歧時，透過尊重的溝通找到解決問題的方法，這既是對自己也是對他人的一種尊重。 總之，尊重不僅是一種行為準則，更是一種生活態度和價值觀。它要求我們超越個人的喜好和偏見，以一種開放和理解的心態去對待每一個人。透過實踐尊重，我們不僅能夠為他人創造一個更加和諧的環境，也能夠為自己帶來成長和進步的機會。在這個過程中，我們學會了如何以一種更加成熟和負責任的方式來面對世界，並且體會到尊重的真正價值所在。"},{"instruction":"日本人如何體現尊重他人而讓旅遊業興盛","output":"日本是一個以禮貌和尊重聞名於世的國度，這些品質不僅體現在日常生活中，也是其旅遊業興盛的重要因素之一。透過對旅客的尊重，日本旅遊業的各個層面不斷提升服務質量，贏得了全球旅客的心，並促進了其旅遊業的發展。以下是幾個方面，展示了日本如何通過尊重他人來促進旅遊業的興盛：

Originating from Russia, this animated series quickly captured the hearts of viewers around the world, thanks in part to its clever storytelling, adorable characters, and positive messages. In the United States, the show received a new life and identity as GoGoRiki, marking a significant moment in the world of international animation. # The Birth of GoGoRiki GoGoRiki was the first English dub of the Russian animated children's series Smeshariki. Created by the animation studio Petersburg in the early 2000s, Smeshariki, also known as Kikoriki in some regions, features a unique cast of round, vibrant characters, each with distinct personalities and backgrounds. The show is renowned for its educational yet entertaining content, covering various themes from friendship and community to science and technology, without resorting to violence, making it a favorite among both children and parents. # Premiering on 4Kids TV GoGoRiki found its American home on the 4Kids TV network, a household name for delivering high-quality children's entertainment and animated series. The show premiered on August 23, 2008, offering viewers in the United States a unique blend of humor, life lessons, and engaging storylines that diverged from the typical offerings of children's TV programming at the time. 4Kids TV was known for its ability to pick and successfully Americanize international animations, and GoGoRiki was no exception. # The Transformation The transition from Smeshariki to GoGoRiki involved more than just a language change; it also underwent cultural adaptation to better resonate with its new audience. However, the essence of what made the original show so charming and meaningful was preserved. Through its carefully crafted dubbing and localization efforts, GoGoRiki maintained the spirit, educational value, and fun of its predecessor while making it accessible to a whole new demographic of young viewers. # Legacy and Impact While GoGoRiki's run on American television wasn't as long as its creators might have hoped, its impact was unmistakable. It introduced American audiences to a unique style of animation and storytelling not often seen in Western children's TV shows. Moreover, it paved the way for further cross-cultural exchanges in animation, showing that stories with heart and humor can transcend geographical boundaries. # Conclusion GoGoRiki stands as a testament to the power of animation to connect disparate cultures through shared values and laughter. By reflecting on its launch and reception, we're reminded of the importance of seeking out and embracing diverse forms of storytelling. The first English dub of Smeshariki may have been rebranded as GoGoRiki for its American audience, but its core message — promoting understanding, friendship, and curiosity about the world — remains universal. As years pass, the legacy of GoGoRiki continues to inspire new generations of viewers and creators alike, proving that good stories truly know no borders."},{"instruction":"Write the CW4Kids lineup on August 23, saying that T&JT has been replaced with GGR and there are only 3 Kids WB shows remaining on the lineup","output":"**CW4Kids Lineup - A New Change Comes on August 23** As the landscape of children’s programming continues to evolve, CW4Kids is once again at the forefront of bringing fresh and exciting content to its young viewers.

Here is a step-by-step guide to get you started with a simple line chart. For this example, I'll assume you are familiar with basic HTML and JavaScript. # Step 1: Include Chart.js Library First, you need to include Chart.js in your HTML file. You can download the library and host it yourself or include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). Using a CDN is the simplest way to get started: \`\`\`html <script src=\\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js\\"><\/script> \`\`\` Include this script tag in the \`<head>\` or at the end of the \`<body>\` section of your HTML file. # Step 2: Create a Canvas Element Next, define a canvas element in your HTML where the chart should appear. Give it an ID so you can easily target it with JavaScript. \`\`\`html <canvas id=\\"myChart\\" width=\\"400\\" height=\\"400\\"></canvas> \`\`\` # Step 3: Write JavaScript to Create the Chart Now, you'll need to write some JavaScript to create the chart. This will involve defining the type of chart you want (line, bar, pie, etc.), specifying data and labels, and setting any options to customize the appearance of your chart. Here's a simple example to create a line chart: \`\`\`html <script> var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d'); var myChart = new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', // Defines chart type data: { labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June'], datasets: [{ label: 'Demo Data', data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3], backgroundColor: [ 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)', ], borderColor: [ 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)', ], borderWidth: 1 }] }, options: { scales: { y: { beginAtZero: true } } } }); <\/script> \`\`\` Let's break down the key parts: - **ctx**: This is the context of the canvas where your chart will be drawn. We get it by targeting our canvas ID and calling \`.getContext('2d')\`. - **type**: Here, we specify the type of chart we want. In this case, it's 'line'. - **data**: This section contains the actual data for your chart. \`labels\` correspond to the x-axis labels, and \`datasets\` is an array where each element represents a dataset. Each dataset can have its own settings like label (legend label), data (the actual data points), backgroundColor, borderColor, etc. - **options**: This is where you can specify global options for your chart. In the example, we make sure that the y-axis starts at zero. And that's it! You've now created a basic line chart using Chart.js. To explore more chart types and customization options, refer to the [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)."},{"instruction":"selam","output":"Merhaba!

However, your query seems more aligned with geological terms. In geology, hardness is often measured using the Mohs scale, which ranks minerals based on their ability to scratch one another. The scale ranges from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond). In terms of physical hardness, rocks don't have a single Mohs rating like minerals do because rocks are made up of multiple minerals. However, we can discuss some of the hardest rock-forming minerals and by extension, the rocks that contain these minerals. Keep in mind that most rocks are mixtures of minerals, and their overall hardness can vary widely depending on the proportions and kinds of minerals they contain. Here are some of the hardest minerals, which contribute to the hardness of the rocks in which they are found: 1. **Diamond** - The hardest known mineral, rated 10 on the Mohs scale. Although not a rock itself, diamond is found in some types of rock, like kimberlite and lamproite. 2. **Corundum** - Includes sapphires and rubies, rated 9 on the Mohs scale. Rocks containing corundum are extremely hard, such as some types of metamorphic rock. 3. **Topaz** - Has a hardness of 8 on the Mohs scale. It is less commonly found in large amounts in rock but does contribute to the overall hardness of rocks in which it is a significant component. 4. **Quartz** - With a hardness of 7, it is one of the most common and varied minerals, forming rocks like quartzite and contributing to the hardness of granitic rocks. 5. **Feldspar** - Ranges from 6 to 6.5 on the Mohs scale and is one of the most abundant minerals in the crust, present in many igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. 6. **Garnet** - This group of minerals can range from 6.5 to 7.5 in hardness and is found in a variety of metamorphic rocks. 7. **Jadeite** - A form of jade, jadeite can reach up to 7 in hardness. It is a major component of the metamorphic rock called jadeitite. 8. **Zircon** - With a hardness of around 7.5, zircon is found in sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. 9. **Chrysoberyl** - With a Mohs hardness of 8.5, this mineral is not as commonly found in rocks but when present, significantly increases their hardness. 10. **Beryl** - Including varieties like emerald and aquamarine, beryl has a hardness of 7.5 to 8. Rocks containing beryl, like certain pegmatites, can be quite hard. Rocks containing these minerals, especially in significant amounts, can be considered among the hardest rocks. For example, rocks rich in quartz, like quartzite, can be very hard. Similarly, rocks with significant corundum content are exceptionally hard, as corundum is second only to diamond in hardness."},{"instruction":"What about compare jade to Quartzite?","output":"Comparing jade to quartzite requires considering several factors, including hardness, composition, and typical uses, as both have unique characteristics and applications. # Composition **Jade** refers to two different minerals: nephrite and jadeite. Nephrite ranges from a mid to dark green or grey-green, and jadeite shows more color variations including green, white, pink, red, black, and more. Their composition is distinct from quartzite: - **Nephrite** consists of interlocking fibrous crystals of the calcium, magnesium, and iron-rich amphibole mineral group, specifically actinolite. - **Jadeite** is made up mostly of sodium- and aluminium-rich pyroxene. **Quartzite** is a metamorphic rock formed from the metamorphism of pure quartz sandstone. It is composed almost entirely of quartz. # Hardness and Durability - **Jade**: Nephrite has a Mohs hardness of about 6 to 6.5, while jadeite is slightly harder, ranging from about 6.5 to 7. These values reflect good toughness and resistance to scratching, largely because of the interlocking crystals in nephrite and the dense composition of jadeite. Jade is renowned for its toughness due to its microcrystalline structure which makes it exceptionally resilient to breaking. - **Quartzite**: Quartzite has a hardness of around 7 on the Mohs scale, making it resistant to scratches and wear. It's actually more durable in terms of scratch resistance than jade because it's composed almost entirely of quartz, one of the hardest minerals. # Uses - **Jade** has been prized for millennia for ornamental objects, jewelry, and fine carvings. Its toughness, workability, and beauty make it suitable for detailed artwork and wearable items. - **Quartzite** is predominantly used in the construction industry due to its hardness and durability. It's used as crushed stone for road construction, as railway ballast, and it's also popular as a decorative stone in architectural applications. Due to its high quartz content, it's also sought after as a dimension stone for countertops, flooring, and other interior and outdoor design projects because of its aesthetic appeal and resistance to wear and acid. # Conclusion While both jade and quartzite are valued for their hardness and aesthetic qualities, their uses diverge significantly due to differences in composition and structural properties. Jade's historical and cultural significance, combined with its toughness, lends itself well to artistic and jewelry purposes. Quartzite, being hard and durable, is more commonly used in construction and as a material for functional yet beautiful surfaces in homes and buildings."},{"instruction":"Deeply analyze this level list's titles for all the references you can find \`\`\`AT HELL'S GATE LEVEL LIST # SUN # {I} “a burning memory” (Space Station) # MERCURY # {I} “A New Genesis” {II} “Sword fight on the heights” {III} “The Mentor” (boss battle) {IV} “The Mercury Nexus” (Space Station) # VENUS # {I} “Acid's reign” {II} “Zeppelin Wars” {III} “Lovely Bastards” (boss battle) {IV} “Venusian Haven” (Space Station) # EARTH # {I} “Paradise Lost” {II} “Revelation's echoes” {III} “Their Former Eden” (boss battle) {IV} “Among The Stars” (Space Station) # MARS # {I} “God of War” {II} “War of the Worlds” {III} “Ozymandias” (boss battle) {IV} “Martian Bastion” (Space Station) # EUROPA # {I} “潜水艦戦争” {II} “Frozen Neon” {III} “Big Red Spot” (boss battle) {IV} “By Jove!” (Space Station) # TITAN # {I} “The Capitol” {II} “Methane Sea” {III} “Crossroads” (boss battle) {IV} “Titanic” (Space Station) # UMBRIEL # {I} “Shadow’s Crescent” {II} “Dusk’s Embrace” {III} “Nocturne’s Veil” (boss battle) {IV} “Umbriel Enclave” (Space Station) # TRITON # {I} “Neptune’s Forge” {II} “Frozen Cathedral” {III} “Triton’s Sorrow” (boss battle) {IV} “Solar Drift” (Space Station) # PLUTO # {I} “Twin Moons” {II} “Styx’s Flow” {III} “Calm before the Storm” (no enemies) {IV} “AT HELL’S GATE” (final boss)\`\`\`","output":"This level list titled \\"AT HELL'S GATE\\" is rich in references across a multitude of genres including literature, mythology, history, and pop culture.

(give word name of classification system) classification system of gaseous planets Saturnian: Permanent clouds are frozen, never raining ? (give demonymic names): Raining clouds ?: Hot clouds never raining","output":"Given the playful and creative nature of the previously provided chromochemical classification system, and adhering to the same imaginative spirit, let's name the classification system for gaseous planets based on their cloud behavior and temperature characteristics. Given that these categories seem to revolve around meteorological and thermal properties of the planet's clouds, we could call this the **\\"Climatonomic Classification System\\"** of gaseous planets. Within this Climatonomic classification system, let’s expand on the provided categories and give demonymic names to fit the descriptions: - **Saturnian**: Permanent clouds are frozen, never raining. This is directly named after Saturn, recognizing its high-altitude clouds that appear frozen and don't precipitate as rain to the surface. - **Nepholian**: (Derived from \\"nephology,\\" the study of clouds) This demonymic name could represent the class of gaseous planets with raining clouds. It encapsulates any planet where the atmospheric conditions allow for the cloud cycle to include precipitation. - **Pyrostratian**: (Combining \\"pyro,\\" meaning fire or heat, with \\"stratus,\\" a type of cloud layer) This would aptly describe hot clouds that never rain. The name suggests an atmospheric layer that is both intensely hot and permanently cloud-covered, with no precipitation. To summarize in the **Climatonomic Classification System**: - **Saturnian**: Permanent clouds are frozen, never raining. - **Nepholian**: Planets with cloud cycles that include active precipitation. - **Pyrostratian**: Planets with hot clouds that never precipitate as rain."},{"instruction":"Describe ejected gas giant is chromochemically Corundian and climatonomically Saturnian, it named Apaoria.","output":"Based on the imaginative chromochemical and climatonomic classification systems you've provided, let's delve into describing an ejected gas giant named Apaoria, which is characterized as chromochemically Corundian and climatonomically Saturnian. # Chromochemical Classification: Corundian Apaoria's atmosphere is dominated by corundum (aluminum oxide), along with significant amounts of calcium oxide and perovskite. This suggests an atmosphere with extraordinarily high temperatures and pressures, where these refractory compounds can exist in cloud form. The chromochemical signature of Apaoria would likely include shades of red, peach, and perhaps some lighter pinkish hues, hinting at the scattering of light through these high-altitude corundum clouds. The presence of corundum, a material found in precious gems like sapphires and rubies on Earth, implies that Apaoria might shimmer brilliantly in the light of its star, displaying a fiery and vivid display of colors in its upper atmosphere. # Climatonomic Classification: Saturnian Being classified as Saturnian in its climatonomic category, Apaoria has permanent clouds that are essentially frozen and fail to precipitate as rain. This indicates that despite the high temperatures near the cloud-forming regions necessary to sustain compounds like corundum in aerosol form, there's a significant temperature gradient toward the upper atmosphere. The outer cloud layers are frozen, perhaps composed of very high melting point crystals or substances that do not easily transition back into a gaseous phase to precipitate. This could also suggest that any potential heat source warming Apaoria does not efficiently reach these upper cloud layers, or that radiative cooling into space massively overpowers any internal heat the planet might have. # The World of Apaoria Imagine Apaoria, an ejected gas giant thrown into the vastness of interstellar space, far from the warming embrace of any star. Its atmosphere, a volatile cauldron of extreme chemistry, glimmers with the frozen, never-raining clouds of corundum and other refractories that create a kaleidoscope of reds and peaches against the blackness of space. Despite the fierce temperatures near its core, capable of sustaining metallic and ceramic clouds, the outer layers of its atmosphere are locked in a perpetual state of frozen stasis, crystalline and glittering like gemstones. Apaoria's isolation in the dark void presents a fascinating paradox. Its internal processes maintain an atmosphere alive with chemical reactions and a vibrant chromochemical palette, yet its surface and frozen clouds remain untouched by the dynamics that drive weather systems on planets orbiting stars. This gas giant tells a story of contrast - intense heat and frozen beauty, a world of fire and ice, drifting silently through the cosmos. The description of Apaoria showcases the compelling blend of real-world astrophysical principles with a creative classification system, illustrating how a gas giant, tossed from its solar system, might evolve and survive in the chilling expanse of space. Its unique characteristics make it a prime candidate for speculative scientific analysis and a vivid example of the diversity that might exist among exoplanets in our universe."},{"instruction":"Q2.

Given this, I'll simplify the code to address your clarified requirements directly. We will assume you have a DataFrame, possibly named \`df\`, which contains the P/E ratios for these assets. Let's proceed with the R code, ensuring we're meeting your condition: \`\`\`r # Assuming the necessary library is loaded library(dplyr) # Example data: Replace 'your_pe_ratios_here' with actual values assets <- c('Google', 'Tesla', 'Pfizer', 'Shell', 'AT&T', 'USDINR', 'EURUSD', 'USDCAD', 'USDCHF', 'NZDUSD', 'Crude', 'Natural Gas', 'Gold', 'Wheat', 'Ethanol') asset_types <- c('Stock', 'Stock', 'Stock', 'Stock', 'Stock', 'Forex', 'Forex', 'Forex', 'Forex', 'Forex', 'Commodity', 'Commodity', 'Commodity', 'Commodity', 'Commodity') # We'll simulate P/E ratios for these assets since actual values aren't provided set.seed(123) pe_ratios <- runif(15, 5, 30) # Simulated P/E ratios, replace with actual df <- data.frame(Asset = assets, Type = asset_types, PERatio = pe_ratios) # Sorting primarily by Type to ensure inclusion of at least one Commodity and one Forex # then by PERatio to prioritize assets with better (lower in this simulation) P/E ratios. df_sorted <- df %>% arrange(Type, PERatio) # Extract the first commodity and the first forex first_commodity <- filter(df_sorted, Type == 'Commodity') %>% slice(1) first_forex <- filter(df_sorted, Type == 'Forex') %>% slice(1) # Exclude the selected commodity and forex, then take the top 3 stocks based on P/E Ratio top_stocks <- filter(df_sorted, Type == 'Stock') %>% head(3) # Combine selections final_selection <- bind_rows(first_commodity, first_forex, top_stocks) # View final selection print(final_selection) # Optionally, save to CSV write.csv(final_selection, \\"final_portfolio_selection.csv\\", row.names = FALSE) \`\`\` Replace the 'your_pe_ratios_here' placeholder with your actual P/E ratio values.

Optionally, the final selection can be exported to a CSV file named \\"final_portfolio_selection.csv\\"."},{"instruction":"Can you give the above code using fportfolio and basicstats only","output":"Certainly! Since you mentioned using the \`fPortfolio\` and \`basicStats\`, it appears you're interested in portfolio analysis frameworks within R. However, it's important to note that the \`fPortfolio\` package and its related ecosystem primarily focus on portfolio optimization based on returns and risks rather than selection based on external criteria like the P/E ratio or specific asset types (e.g., Stocks, Forex, Commodities). Also, \`basicStats\` typically refers to computing basic statistical measures, which might not directly apply to filtering assets based on P/E ratios and asset types. Given these considerations, and without a direct function in \`fPortfolio\` or a \`basicStats\` package (assuming you're referring to functions for basic statistical measures) to select assets based on P/E ratios while ensuring diversity across asset types (Commodities, Forex, Stocks), we'll proceed with a more manual approach that aligns with your requirements. This approach doesn't directly use \`fPortfolio\` or \`basicStats\` since your task is more about pre-selection of assets based on specific rules rather than optimizing a portfolio's return/risk profile. Let's continue using \`dplyr\` for data manipulation due to its efficiency in handling such tasks, but I'll format the solution to reflect a focus on portfolio construction principles: \`\`\`r # Assuming you have 'dplyr' installed and loaded. If not, you can install it using install.packages(\\"dplyr\\") library(dplyr) # Simulated example data assets <- c('Google', 'Tesla', 'Pfizer', 'Shell', 'AT&T', 'USDINR', 'EURUSD', 'USDCAD', 'USDCHF', 'NZDUSD', 'Crude', 'Natural Gas', 'Gold', 'Wheat', 'Ethanol') asset_types <- c('Stock', 'Stock', 'Stock', 'Stock', 'Stock', 'Forex', 'Forex', 'Forex', 'Forex', 'Forex', 'Commodity', 'Commodity', 'Commodity', 'Commodity', 'Commodity') pe_ratios <- runif(15, 5, 30) # Simulated P/E ratios df <- data.frame(Asset = assets, Type = asset_types, PERatio = pe_ratios) # Assuming you want to keep the framework aligned with portfolio analysis, we'll prioritize based on the P/E ratio for now. # The selection is manual as it involves specific criteria not inherently statistical or optimizing in nature. # Select the minimum P/E ratio asset from each type to ensure diversity min_pe_commodity <- df %>% filter(Type == 'Commodity') %>% arrange(PERatio) %>% slice(1) min_pe_forex <- df %>% filter(Type == 'Forex') %>% arrange(PERatio) %>% slice(1) min_pe_stocks <- df %>% filter(Type == 'Stock') %>% arrange(PERatio) %>% slice(1:3) # Top 3 stocks # Note: Adjusting to take more stocks because we've already selected one commodity and one forex. final_selection <- bind_rows(min_pe_commodity, min_pe_forex, min_pe_stocks) # Display the final selection print(final_selection) # Export write.csv(final_selection, \\"final_portfolio_selection.csv\\", row.names = FALSE) \`\`\` This solution adheres to the spirit of portfolio construction by ensuring diversity in asset types (Commodity, Forex, Stock) and leveraging the P/E ratio for selection. However, it doesn't utilize \`fPortfolio\` or \`basicStats\` functions directly due to the nature of the task. If your portfolio optimization or analysis task moves beyond initial selection criteria toward return/risk optimization, incorporating \`fPortfolio\` would then become highly relevant, focusing on metrics like Sharpe ratios, variance, and expected returns."},{"instruction":"YOu know i have in total 15 assets then from that i have to select 5 with condition that Atleast one Commodity and one Forex…Stocks - Google, Tesla, Pfizer, Shell, AT&T Forex - USDINR, EURUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, NZDUSD Commodities - Crude, Natural Gas, Gold, Wheat, Ethanol.....................Q2.

Since there's a substantial amount of prerequisite work to generate historical price data, a risk-free rate, and P/E ratios, I'll structure the R code to generate these, then proceed to select a portfolio based on your strategies, and finally, suggest a simple method for weight allocation. Please note that due to the nature of the question, not all steps can be fully automated or executed without actual data or R in a live environment. However, I'll guide you through the process. You're expected to run these code chunks in your R environment, starting with the generation of historical price data: \`\`\`r # Assuming you have replaced 'emp_id' with your actual student/employee ID. # Generate Historical Price Data library(readxl) library(writexl) emp_id <- 23260775 # Example student/employee ID, replace with yours dig_count <- nchar(emp_id) - 3 rand_numb_init <- emp_id / (10 ^ dig_count) date_data <- read_excel(\\"Date.xlsx\\") # Make sure 'Date.xlsx' is in your working directory tickr_list <- c(\\"GOOGL\\", \\"TSLA\\", \\"PFE\\", \\"SHEL\\", \\"T\\", \\"USDINR\\", \\"EURUSD\\", \\"USDCAD\\", \\"USDCHF\\", \\"NZDUSD\\", \\"WTI\\", \\"NG\\", \\"XAU\\", \\"W1\\", \\"EH\\") set.seed(emp_id) raw_price_data <- matrix(, ncol = 1) multiplier <- seq(from = 3, to = 10, by = 0.5) for (i in 1:length(tickr_list)) { rand_price <- as.data.frame(runif(nrow(date_data), min=rand_numb_init, max= rand_numb_init * sample(multiplier, size = 1, replace = TRUE))) raw_price_data <- cbind(raw_price_data, rand_price) } raw_price_data <- raw_price_data[,-1] # Remove the initial empty column colnames(raw_price_data) <- tickr_list price_data <- cbind(date_data, raw_price_data) writexl::write_xlsx(price_data, \\"Historical_Price_data.xlsx\\") \`\`\` Next, generate the annual risk-free rate: \`\`\`r # Generate Annual Risk-Free Rate annual_rf <- abs(rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 0.75)) / 1000 \`\`\` Then, generate the Price to Earning (P/E) ratio: \`\`\`r # Generate P/E Ratio for each asset P_E_ratio <- runif(ncol(raw_price_data), min = rand_numb_init * 5, max = rand_numb_init * 5 * sample(multiplier, size = 1, replace = TRUE)) / 100 names(P_E_ratio) <- tickr_list \`\`\` Now, based on the scenario, we have two strategies for portfolio construction: **Strategy 1:** Based on Reward to Risk Ratio. It would require return calculations, which rely on the historical price data you've just generated. **Strategy 2:** Directly based on the generated P/E ratios. We can directly proceed with Strategy 2 since you've just generated the P/E ratios. Choosing the top 5 assets under Strategy 2 with the constraint: \`\`\`r # Assuming you've already transformed P_E_ratio into a dataframe df_pe <- data.frame(Asset = names(P_E_ratio), PERatio = P_E_ratio) # Splitting assets by type for constraint-based selection stocks_df <- df_pe[grep(\\"GOOGL|TSLA|PFE|SHEL|T\\", df_peAsset), ] forex_df <- df_pe[grep(\\"USDINR|EURUSD|USDCAD|USDCHF|NZDUSD\\", df_peAsset), ] commodities_df <- df_pe[grep(\\"WTI|NG|XAU|W1|EH\\", df_peAsset), ] # Selecting one asset each from Forex and Commodities with the best (lowest) P/E ratio selected_forex <- forex_df[which.min(forex_dfPERatio), ] selected_commodity <- commodities_df[which.min(commodities_dfPERatio), ] # Selecting the remaining three assets with the best P/E ratios from stocks selected_stocks <- stocks_df[order(stocks_dfPERatio), ][1:3, ] # Combining selections final_selection <- rbind(selected_forex, selected_commodity, selected_stocks) # Output to view selection print(final_selection) # Exporting writexl::write_xlsx(final_selection, \\"Selected_Assets_Strategy2.xlsx\\") \`\`\` This outlines how you would proceed based on Strategy 2, choosing assets based on P/E ratios while observing the constraint of including at least one asset from Commodities and one from Forex. Remember to adjust \`emp_id\` with your DCU Student No./employee ID. For **weight allocation**, a simple way to start is equal weighting for simplicity, but for more sophisticated approaches like mean-variance optimization or others, you would need to delve into historical returns, which goes beyond this response scope. Remember, actual returns calculations would be necessary to implement Strategy 1 rigorously, which would require a similar process of analysis and selection based on those returns vs. the standard deviation (risk) of those returns."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How can I help you today?"},{"instruction":"\\" Sneg with the fine meals yet again\\" explain please and make it a detailed breakdown line by line segment by segment in a detailed way","output":"The sentence \\"Sneg with the fine meals yet again\\" is a statement that may seem straightforward but carries nuances that can be better understood by breaking it down into its components. Given the provided context, here is a detailed breakdown of each segment of the sentence: 1. **\\"Sneg\\"** - This part of the sentence identifies the subject, which is presumably a name or nickname. The use of a specific name immediately personalizes the statement, hinting at an individual’s identity or character. 'Sneg' could also refer to a unique identifier for a business or brand, especially one possibly related to the food industry. In either case, without additional context, one must infer that ‘Sneg’ is known to the speaker and possibly to the anticipated audience. 2. **\\"with the\\"** - This phrase is employed to link the subject 'Sneg' with the subsequent description of her actions or state. It’s a prepositional phrase that serves as a bridge, setting up an expectation for what follows. Imagine it as a connector or a spotlight, drawing attention to what is about to be revealed about 'Sneg'. 3. **\\"fine meals\\"** - Here, the nature of 'Sneg's association or actions is clarified. The phrase 'fine meals' conjures images of high-quality or gourmet food. The choice of the adjective \\"fine\\" implies not just good quality, but a level of sophistication or elegance. Thus, 'Sneg' is being highlighted for something to do with meals that are above the ordinary in terms of quality, presentation, or perhaps ingredient selection. 4. **\\"yet again\\"** - This phrase suggests repetition and a sense of continuity from past events or actions. It’s an important modifier that informs us this is not a one-time occurrence. 'Sneg' engaging with 'fine meals' is something that has happened before, possibly frequently. The use of \\"yet again\\" implies expectation; it’s as if this behavior or outcome was anticipated based on 'Sneg's past actions or tendencies. This small phrase adds depth, indicating a pattern or characteristic behavior. Putting it all together, the sentence \\"Sneg with the fine meals yet again\\" conveys a scenario where 'Sneg,' who is identified in some unspecified capacity (a person, brand, or entity), is once more associated with creating, procuring, or being linked to high-quality meals. This action or state is not novel for 'Sneg,' as indicated by \\"yet again,\\" which suggests a repeated behavior or a reputation that has been established over time. The statement could be expressing admiration, surprise, acknowledgment, or a mixture of these sentiments, depending on the speaker's tone and context. In essence, the sentence appreciates or notes 'Sneg's consistent involvement with 'fine meals,' pointing to an established pattern or reputation for quality in relation to food. Without more context, it's challenging to discern whether the sentiment is positive, teasing, or critical, but it's clear that 'Sneg's penchant for quality meals is notable and recognized."},{"instruction":"te explico chat, tenemos que hacer un video viral para facebook e instagram.

This narrative not only reflects Japan's industrial rise but also showcases a unique blend of tradition, innovation, and an entrenched car enthusiast culture. **Post-World War II Era to the 1960s: The Beginnings** In the years following World War II, Japan prioritized rebuilding its industrial capabilities, and automobiles were primarily seen as functional vehicles. The designs were mostly conservative, focusing on economy and reliability. Iconic cars from this era, like the Toyota Crown and the Nissan Cedric, laid the foundation for Japan's automotive industry, emphasizing durability and compact efficiency. **1970s-1980s: The Rise of Japanese Auto Innovation** During the 1970s and 1980s, Japan experienced an automotive renaissance, characterized by the introduction of cars that balanced affordability, reliability, and performance. This era saw the birth of many iconic models and the beginning of Japan's global influence in the automotive industry. Japanese manufacturers like Toyota, Nissan, Honda, and Mazda began experimenting with more daring designs and advanced technology, culminating in models like the Toyota Corolla, Nissan Skyline, and Honda Civic.

Man hat davon auszugehen, daß der »Interpretationsirrtum« von Engels als ein prinzipieller zu bewerten ist, der schon sehr früh entstanden sein muß. Die Engelsschen Arbeiten von 1894/95, also die Ansätze zu einer Theorie der einfachen Warenproduktion, sind daher so zu deuten, daß hier ein jahrzehntealter Irrtum erstmals schriftlich ausgedrückt worden ist. Dieser Irrtum müßte spätestens 1859 entstanden sein, als sich Engels in seiner Rezension der Marxschen Kritik mit methodischen Grundproblemen auseinanderzusetzen hatte. Andernfalls wäre man zu der wenig überzeugenden Annahme genötigt, daß er sein 1859 gewonnenes adäquates Verständnis der werttheoretischen Methode zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt wieder vergessen habe.

Bailey scheint dieses Problem des Anfangs erstmals erkannt zu haben: »Der Wertbegriff wird nur gebildet - daher der Wert aus bloß quantitativem Verhältnis (...) in etwas von diesem Verhältnis Unabhängiges verwandelt (was, wie er meint, verwandle den Wert der Waren in etwas Absolutes [...]) -, weil außer den Waren Geld existiert, und wir so gewohnt sind, die Werte von Waren nicht in ihrem Verhältnis zueinander, sondern als Verhältnis zu einem Dritten (...) zu betrachten. Bei Bailey ist es nicht die Bestimmung des Produkts als Wert, das zur Geldbildung treibt und im Geld sich ausdrückt, sondern es ist das Dasein des Gelds, das zur Fiktion des Wertbegriffs treibt.« (26.3/143) Hier tritt die enge Verschlingung der Probleme der Werttheorie und der Probleme der Geldtheorie deutlich hervor. Wenn sich nämlich herausstellen sollte, daß der Marxsche Weg einer »Entwicklung« des Geldes aus der Ware nicht gangbar ist, dann wird man die Kategorie Geld als das logisch Erste der ökonomischen Theorie, als ihren mit den Mitteln der ökonomischen Analyse irreduziblen Grundbegriff akzeptieren müssen. Es ist zu vermuten, daß aus dieser Umkehrung der Priorität auch wertheoretische Konsequenzen resultieren. Die objektive Werttheorie wird nämlich gleichsam gegenstandslos, wenn es gelingen sollte, die Objektivität intersubjektiv gültiger Einheiten vom Geld herzuleiten. Bailey dürfte recht klar erkannt haben, daß die subjektive Ökonomie sich nicht damit begnügen kann, auf der Basis der subjektiven Werttheorie die Austauschrelationen einer prämonetären Naturaltauschwirtschaft zu erklären. ”翻译为中文","output":"因此，实际上只有从“逻辑”的立场出发才能恰当地将“起点问题”形式化为是否将“货币”理解为价值与使用价值的统一体，或是将货币作为逻辑上的首要因素；即是从“货币”衍生出“商品”还是从“商品”衍生出货币。贝利似乎首次认识到了这个起点问题：“价值概念只因为存在除商品以外的货币，我们因此习惯于不把商品的价值视为相互之间的关系，而是作为与第三者（...）的关系来看待，从而价值从仅是数量关系（...）转化为与这种关系独立的事物（正如他所认为，这将商品的价值转化为了某种绝对的东西[...]）。（...）在贝利那里，不是产品作为价值的决定导致了货币的形成并在货币中表达出来，而是货币的存在导致了价值概念的虚构。”（26.3/143） 这里清晰地展示了价值理论和货币理论问题的紧密交织。如果最终证明马克思从商品“发展”出货币的路径是行不通的，那么我们将不得不接受货币作为经济理论中的逻辑首要范畴、作为经济分析手段所无法还原的基本概念。可以预见，这种优先权的颠倒也将导致价值理论方面的后果。如果能够成功地从货币这一角度推导出客观性的互主观有效的单位，那么客观价值理论将变得无关紧要。 贝利很可能清楚地认识到，主观经济学不能满足于仅用主观价值理论来解释前货币自然经济中的交换关系。"},{"instruction":"请将“Es stellt sich ihr vielmehr die nicht minder wichtige Aufgabe, von einem als logisch Erstes gesetzten Geldbegriff her das zu begründen, was der subjektiven Ökonomie als bloßer Schein eines >absoluten< Werts gelten muß.

Althussers Behauptung, Marx habe gewisse Konstruktionen »wie in einer Erleuchtung hervorgebracht« und sei »nicht mehr imstande gewesen, sie theoretisch zu verknüpfen und zu bearbeiten«,114 läuft auf die These hinaus, daß von einer Marxschen Methode als einem logisch konsistenten Ganzen nicht die Rede sein könne.

Einen ersten Entwurf, der freilich mehr Fragen aufwirft als Antworten enthält, hat er bekanntlich bereits 1857 verfaßt. Etwa zur gleichen Zeit nahm er sich vor, »in 2 oder 3 Druckbogen das Rationelle an der Methode, die Hegel entdeckt (...) hat, dem gemeinen Menschenverstand zugänglich zu machen«. (29/260) Marx hat diesen Plan nie aufgegeben, aber vermutlich auch nie ausgeführt. Fünfundzwanzig Jahre später sucht Engels im Nachlaß von Marx vergeblich nach einem entsprechenden Manuskript: »Morgen werde ich endlich Zeit haben, einige Stunden der Durchsicht aller Manuskripte zu widmen, die der Mohr uns hinterlassen hat. Es handelt sich vor allem um einen Abriß über Dialektik, den er schon immer ausführen wollte. Er hat uns aber stets den Stand seiner Arbeiten verheimlicht«. (36/3) Es ist eine naive Vorstellung, Marx habe zwar im Kopf die neue Methode fix und fertig parat gehabt, aber im Laufe von fünfundzwanzig Jahren niemals die Zeit gefunden, »in 2 oder 3 Druckbogen« das »Rationelle« an Hegels Methode schriftlich festzuhalten. ”翻译为中文","output":"我相信，只有在同时考虑以下问题时，我们才能相对公正地讨论阿尔都塞的论点：如果马克思真的能够将他对于“辩证发展方法”的构想（31/313）发展成一个理论方法、逻辑学与社会科学的认识论的逻辑上封闭的整体，那么他就不会因为任何外在情况而阻碍自己将这样一个系统性阐述的方法以书面形式固定下来。众所周知，他在1857年就已经草拟了一个初稿，但这个初稿提出的问题比给出的答案要多。大约在同一时间，他计划“在2到3个印刷版中使常人能够理解黑格尔所发现的方法的合理之处”（29/260）。马克思从未放弃这一计划，但很可能也从未执行过。二十五年后，恩格斯在马克思的遗作中徒劳地寻找相应的手稿：“明天我终于会有时间，花几个小时检视‘老马克思’留给我们的所有手稿。主要是寻找他一直想完成的关于辩证法的概述。但他总是对我们隐瞒了他工作的进展”（36/3）。 认为马克思虽然在头脑中已经完全构想出新方法，但在二十五年里却从未找到时间将黑格尔方法的“合理之处”以“2到3个印刷版”书面固定下来，这是一种天真的想法。"},{"instruction":"请将“Wenn es auch Engels nicht geschafft hat und selbst »gegenwärtig der Zusammenhang von »formalen und »dialektischer Logik« noch immer einigermaßen unaufgeklärt ist«,115 dann kann man sich auch nicht mit der Behauptung abspeisen lassen, es sei ja eigentlich gar »nicht überraschend, daß Marx nie eine »Logik« oder »Erkenntnistheorie« im Sinne der Schulphilosophie geschrieben« habe: seine »Logik« sei »die Logik des Kapital« gewesen, »wie Lenin zutreffend« bemerkt habe.116 Lenin hoffte, daß sich mittels einer entsprechenden Interpretation des Kapital diese Arbeit nachholen ließe. Wenn die Vertreter der leninistischen Philosophie und Ökonomie dem Leninschen Desiderat nicht zu entsprechen vermochten, so kann man aus einer solchen Not nicht einfach die dialektische Tugend machen wollen, daß sich über die Methode getrennt vom Inhalt nichts aussagen lasse.117 Lenin setzte jedenfalls stillschweigend voraus, daß Marx während der Ausarbeitung des Kapital das fertige Ganze einer dialektischen Logik und Erkenntnistheorie im Kopf gehabt habe. So liest es sich denn auch in jedem le-ninistischen Lehrbuch der Philosophie; und von dieser Vorstellung leitet sich auch die Aufgabe her, die dem Kapital zugrunde liegende dialektische Logik herauszuarbeiten. Wie weit solche Arbeiten bisher gediehen sind, kann man dem Forschungsbericht des Zentralinstituts für Philosophie an der Akademie der Wissenschaften der DDR entnehmen. Es geht dabei um die Frage, wie die dialektischen »Grundgesetze untereinander zusammenwirken und worin die Systematik der von Marx begründeten Methode besteht, die auf keinen Fall schematisch eingesetzt werden kann«.

Although precise numbers can vary depending on the source and the specific poverty line definition used, it's widely acknowledged that a substantial portion of the Brazilian population lived in poverty during this period. According to data from the World Bank and other sources, it is estimated that during the early 1990s, around one-third of Brazil's population lived below the national poverty line. Given that Brazil's population was approximately 155 million in 1993, this would mean that around 50 million Brazilians might have been living in poverty at the time. This period predates many of the social programs that were later implemented to reduce poverty and inequality in Brazil, such as Bolsa Família, which began in 2003. It's important to note that these figures are estimates, and poverty measurement can vary significantly based on the criteria used, such as income levels, access to services, and regional cost of living differences."},{"instruction":"How Many Brazilians Live In The Poverty Line During 2003?","output":"In 2003, Brazil was still grappling with significant poverty levels, despite efforts to improve the situation. The country had introduced various social programs aimed at reducing poverty and inequality, the most notable being Bolsa Família, which was launched in October of that year. Bolsa Família consolidated several cash transfer programs into one, aiming to provide financial aid to Brazil's poorest families under the condition that they ensure children attend school and are vaccinated. According to data from the World Bank, in 2003, the proportion of the population living on less than 5.50 a day at 2011 international prices (a common poverty line for upper-middle-income countries like Brazil) was around 24%. Given that Brazil's population was approximately 182 million in 2003, this would suggest that roughly 43.7 million Brazilians were living under this poverty line. However, it's important to note that poverty estimates can vary significantly based on the specific poverty line and criteria used. For example, the national poverty line, which takes into account the cost of living and other factors specific to Brazil, might yield different poverty rates. Throughout the early 2000s, Brazil made considerable progress in reducing poverty and inequality, largely thanks to economic growth and policies focused on social inclusion. The success of Bolsa Família and other social initiatives contributed to significant decreases in poverty rates in the years following 2003."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
