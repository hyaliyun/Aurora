Pick from: [A]. no; [B]. yes;","output":"In order to answer the questions, I will first research the topics and provide well-reasoned responses to each question. 1. What is a good Uber driver rating? - To find this information, I will look into Uber's rating system and guidelines. 2. Can passengers rate Uber drivers if the driver cancels? - I will research Uber's policies on cancellations and their impact on driver ratings. Now, let's address each question individually. 1. A good Uber driver rating is usually around 4.7 or higher on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest score. This is because Uber considers a driver with an average rating below 4.6 to be at risk of deactivation. Therefore, a rating higher than 4.7 typically ensures that the driver is considered reliable and providing quality service. 2. Passengers usually cannot rate Uber drivers if the driver cancels the ride, as ratings are based on completed trips. However, frequent cancellations by a driver can negatively impact their overall standing with the Uber platform, and may lead to penalties or even deactivation. At this point, I have provided two separate answers to the given questions. Now I will determine if the questions are the same or not: Comparing the two questions, I can conclude that they are not the same. The first question asks about what is considered a good driver rating, while the second question asks if passengers can rate a driver when the driver cancels the ride.

Help as much as you can. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: As a professor I have grown accustomed to the opinion regarding American education. We are repeatedly told that American schools are failing, that colleges are not teaching, and that the students of today are not as good as the students of the past. There are, of course, problems with the education system. Because of economic inequality some schools are significantly better than others and the ideas of equality of education and equality of opportunity are cruel jokes. However, the mere fact that there are some serious problems does not mean that all the _ claims are true. One stock   claim is that America has fallen behind the world in education in terms of performance on various tests. While the fact that America is behind other countries is a point of concern, there are at least three points worth considering here. The first is the above-mentioned economic inequality which will tend to result in poorer performance when taking the average for America. The second is that many countries have put considerable effort into improving their education systems and hence it is worth considering that America's decline is also due to the improvement of others. The third is the matter of the measures-- do they, in fact, present an accurate picture of the situation? I am not claiming that the data is bad. I am merely raising a reasonable concern about how accurate our picture of education is at this time. Another stock claim is that American students are doing badly on standardized tests. While there is clearly value in assessment, it is reasonable to consider whether or not such tests are a proper and adequate measure of education. It is also worth considering whether the puzzle with these tests is itself causing damage to education. That is, as teachers teach for the test and students learn for the test, it might be the case that what is being taught is not what should be taught and what is being learned is not what should be learned. Question: The passage is written mainly to  _  . - defend American education - show dissatisfaction with American education - explain why American students do badly on tests - offer advice on American education reform The answer to this question is:","output":"defend American education"},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Appearing aloof, Ming accepts the position and Mary packs a bag of cash for him, advising that he maintain a low profile and prepare for the police academy; assuming that the song she put on the stereo is distracting him, she also gives him a copy of it. Ming is attracted to Mary, but is unwilling to express it due to his lowly position in the gang. It is then revealed that Mary ordered Kwuns assassination.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. When did the students do the first self portrait?

It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it. We'd go back to the car and set off a big string of fire crackers or shake the cat and slap on it and run like crazy. We'd watch from the woods as they drove like heck and come to a screeching stop at our roadblock. The guy would get out and try to lift the pole. Never happen. Then the car would drive the other way. That wouldn't happen because of the pipes. We'd go home leaving them in there. This was before cell phones, and it was miles to a pay phone. We'd go back the next day and find the stump and pole moved. We thought it was real funny until one night we set it up and beat on the trunk of a car. A couple was inside, getting it on. We hadn't noticed a guy sitting on the hood with a bottle of booze and a pistol. As we ran, he was shooting and we could hear bullets going through the underbrush. No one was hit, thank goodness. That was the end of that stunt. How does the group (or some) of boys feel after the shooting episode? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Thankful they were not hit - not enough information - Amused about the episode - Consider it fun to continue looking for parked cars The answer is:","output":"Thankful they were not hit"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Objective: shoes Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"To effectively answer this question, it is important to first understand what naive physics reasoning is. Naive physics, also known as folk physics, refers to the informal and intuitive understanding of the world's physical properties, which people develop without any formal education in the field of physics. Naive physics reasoning, therefore, refers to the act of making predictions and judgments about the world's physical properties by relying on common sense and intuition rather than scientific principles or formal education. Given that the objective is \\"shoes,\\" we need to evaluate two or more solutions in terms of such reasoning. As no specific solutions are provided in the question, let's consider the following two common scenarios related to shoes and evaluate them based on naive physics reasoning: Solution 1: Choosing the right shoe size and design for comfort Solution 2: Waterproofing shoes to protect them from water damage Solution 1: Choosing the right shoe size and design for comfort Using naive physics reasoning, it becomes apparent that selecting the appropriate shoe size and design is crucial for comfort. Intuitively, a person would recognize that a shoe that is too small or too big would cause discomfort, as it would either be too tight and restrictive or too loose and unstable. Furthermore, the design of the shoe should be able to accommodate the natural shape and movement of the foot. A shoe that forces the foot into a shape that goes against its natural structure will likely result in discomfort and potential health issues. The choice of material is also essential as it determines the breathability, flexibility, and overall comfort of the shoe. Solution 2: Waterproofing shoes to protect them from water damage Naive physics reasoning also supports the idea of waterproofing shoes as a sound solution. Intuitively, one understands that exposing shoes and the material to water could cause damage in the form of warping, discoloration, and mold growth. This would lead to the shoes having a shortened life span and reduce their functionality. Moreover, the reasoning suggests that waterproofing shoes would prevent water from penetrating the shoe, keeping one's feet dry and comfortable, and preserving the shoe's structural integrity for a more extended period. Comparing the two solutions, we can see that both of them hold merit when it comes to naive physics reasoning. Both solutions address essential aspects related to shoes, with Solution 1 focusing on comfort and fit, while Solution 2 tackles the issue of water damage and preservation. In conclusion, using naive physics reasoning, both Solution 1 (choosing the right shoe size and design for comfort) and Solution 2 (waterproofing shoes to protect them from water damage) can be considered sound solutions. They both address practical concerns regarding shoes, such as comfort, fit, and preservation, using common sense and intuition. While neither solution is superior to the other, as both are important when it comes to wearing and maintaining shoes, they both pass naive physics reasoning's logic test in their own regard."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. If you build a campfire, you start with a large stack of sticks and logs. As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Example of fire and heat\\" correctly answer the question \\"Ashes and gases in an example of what?\\"? Options:  -- no;  -- yes;","output":"-- yes; The response \\"Example of fire and heat\\" correctly answers the question \\"Ashes and gases in an example of what?\\" because the paragraph describes a campfire scenario where wood is burned, and as a result, it transforms into ashes and gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Republic of Bashkortostan (\\"Baqortostan Respublikah\\"), also known as Bashkiria is a federal subject of Russia (a republic). It is located between the Volga River and the Ural Mountains. Its capital is the city of Ufa. With the population of 4,072,292 as of the 2010 Census, Bashkortostan is the most populous of the republics in Russia.  - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.  - Ufa is a city in Russia, the capital of the Republic of Bashkortostan.  - Yekaterinburg, alternatively romanised as \\"Ekaterinburg\\", is the fourth-largest city in Russia and the administrative centre of Sverdlovsk Oblast, located in the middle of the Eurasian continent, on the border of Europe and Asia. At the 2010 Census, it had a population of 1,349,772.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - The term dialect (from Latin , , from the Ancient Greek word , , \\"discourse\\", from , , \\"through\\" and , , \\"I speak\\") is used in two distinct ways to refer to two different types of linguistic phenomena:  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - The Ural or Jayq/Zhayyq (, ), known as Yaik before 1775, is a river flowing through Russia and Kazakhstan in Eurasia. It originates in the southern Ural Mountains and ends at the Caspian Sea. At , it is the third-longest river in Europe after the Volga and the Danube, and the 18th-longest river in Asia. The Ural River is conventionally considered part of the boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia.  - Russia is not proportionately populated between the smaller western portion (almost 25%) of the country that is considered part of Europe, and the larger eastern portion (more than 75%) that is part of Asia. European Russia contains about 77% of the country's population (110,000,000 people out of about 144,000,000) in an area comprising almost 4 million km (1.54 million mi); an average of 27.5 persons per km (70 per mi). This territory makes up 38% of Europe. Its eastern border is defined by the Ural Mountains and in the south, it is defined by the border with Kazakhstan. This area includes Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the two largest cities in Russia.  - The Ural Mountains, or simply the Urals, are a mountain range that runs approximately from north to south through western Russia, from the coast of the Arctic Ocean to the Ural River and northwestern Kazakhstan. The mountain range forms part of the conventional boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia. Vaygach Island and the islands of Novaya Zemlya form a further continuation of the chain to the north into the Arctic Ocean.  - Novaya Zemlya (lit. \\"new land\\"), also known, especially in Dutch, as Nova Zembla, is an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean in northern Russia and the extreme northeast of Europe, the easternmost point of Europe lying at Cape Flissingsky on the Northern island. Administratively, it is incorporated as Novaya Zemlya District, one of the twenty-one in Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia. Municipally, it is incorporated as Novaya Zemlya Urban Okrug.   - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - The Volga is the longest river in Europe. It is also Europe's largest river in terms of discharge and watershed. The river flows through central Russia and into the Caspian Sea, and is widely regarded as the national river of Russia.  - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area. Moscow has the status of a Russian federal city.  - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.  - Novosibirsk is the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,473,754 as of the 2010 Census. It is the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast as well as of the Siberian Federal District. The city is located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River adjacent to the Ob River Valley, near the large water reservoir formed by the dam of the Novosibirsk Hydro Power Plant, and occupies an area of .  - Mount Yamantau ( Bashkir :  , Russian :   ) is in the Ural Mountains , Bashkortostan , Russia . The name means wicked mountain in the Bashkir language (   ) . It is also known as Mount Yamantaw . It stands at 1,640 metres ( 5,381 ft ) and is the highest mountain in the southern Urals . Along with Kosvinsky Mountain ( 600 km to the north ) , it is suspected by the United States of being a large secret nuclear facility and / or bunker . The closed military town of Mezhgorye ( Russian :  ) is situated nearby . As late as 2003 , Yamantaw was not yet fully operational . Large excavation projects have been observed by U.S. satellite imagery as recently as the late 1990s , during the time of Boris Yeltsin 's government after the fall of the Soviet Union . Two garrisons , Beloretsk - 15 and Beloretsk - 16 , were built on top of the facility , and possibly a third , Alkino - 2 , as well , and became the closed town of Mezhgorye in 1995 . They are said to house 30,000 workers each . Repeated U.S. questions have yielded several different responses from the Russian government regarding Mount Yamantaw . They have said it is a mining site , a repository for Russian treasures , a food storage area , and a bunker for leaders in case of nuclear war . Responding to questions regarding Yamantaw in 1996 , Russia 's Defense Ministry stated : \`\` The practice does not exist in the Defense Ministry of Russia of informing foreign mass media about facilities , whatever they are , that are under construction in the interests of strengthening the security of Russia . '' Large rail lines serve the facility . Mount Yamantaw is near one of Russia 's last remaining nuclear labs , Chelyabinsk - 70 , raising speculation that it already houses nuclear weapons . Russian newspapers reported in 1996 that it is a part of the \`\` Dead Hand '' nuclear retaliatory command structure .

The Turki language developed on the Karluk (Karluk-Khorezm languages) basis, which was a result of interaction of the Karakhanid language with the local Türkic languages (gradual replacement of \\"d\\"-type language with a \\"j\\"-type language). The Karakhanid Karluk language was adapted for a cycle of works in Khorezm, where it was enriched by Oguz and Kipchak elements and turned into one of the medieval Türkic languages. With the Turki were created Qutba's poem \\"\\"Khosrow and Shirin\\"\\" (1338), Khwarizmi \\"\\"Muhabbat-name\\"\\" (1353), Sutro Sarai \\"\\"Gulistan bi-t-Türki\\"\\" (1391), Mahmud al-Bukhari theological and didactic work \\"\\"Nahj al faradis\\"\\"(1358).  - Kazakhstan ( \\"Qazaqstan\\",  \\"Kazakhstan\\"), officially the Republic of Kazakhstan (\\"Qazaqstan Respwblïkas\\" \\"Respublika Kazakhstan\\"), is a transcontinental country in northern Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the ninth largest in the world, with an area of . Kazakhstan is the dominant nation of Central Asia economically, generating 60% of the region's GDP, primarily through its oil/gas industry. It also has vast mineral resources.  - Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with five million inhabitants in 2012, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea. It is politically incorporated as a federal subject (a federal city). Situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, it was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on May . In 1914, the name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd, in 1924 to Leningrad, and in 1991 back to Saint Petersburg. Between 17131728 and 17321918, Saint Petersburg was the imperial capital of Russia. In 1918, the central government bodies moved to Moscow.  - Nizhny Novgorod, colloquially shortened to Nizhny, is a city in the administrative center of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and Volga Federal District in Russia. From 1932 to 1990, it was known as Gorky, after the writer Maxim Gorky, who was born there. The city is an important economic, transportation, scientific, educational and cultural center in Russia and the vast Volga-Vyatka economic region, and is the main center of river tourism in Russia.

Available options: (a). Yes; (b). No;","output":"(b). No; The correct answer is not \\"an electrical storm\\" based on the information provided. In the given statement, \\"The flow of current in an electrical circuit is moved up and down,\\" the focus is on the flow of current within an electrical circuit, not an electrical storm. An electrical circuit is a closed loop that allows electrons to flow through a conducting path, producing various effects such as heat, light, or movement. The flow of current in the context of an electrical circuit generally refers to the movement of electrons through the conducting path. This flow can vary (up and down) based on several factors, including the voltage, resistance, and characteristics of the circuit components. An electrical storm, also known as a thunderstorm or a lightning storm, is a natural phenomenon characterized by the occurrence of lightning and thunder, accompanied by heavy rain, strong winds, or hail. The flow of current in an electrical storm, specifically in a lightning strike, is the result of a massive discharge of electrical energy between the Earth's surface and a thundercloud or between thunderclouds. While both an electrical circuit and an electrical storm involve the flow of electric current, they are different phenomena with distinct properties and behaviors.

(CNN) -- On Saturday, a company called SpaceX was scheduled to launch the first private mission to the International Space Station, demonstrating a freight-carrying capability NASA gave up when it retired its fleet of space shuttles in July. (The flight was aborted at the last second after a faulty valve was discovered; SpaceX officials said the launch was postponed till Tuesday or Wednesday.) Some NASA supporters are mourning what they see as the decline of U.S. leadership in space. But they should really be celebrating the dawn of a new era. After all, we've been stuck in low Earth orbit for several decades now, at considerable cost. Visionary plans for genuine space exploration have gathered dust at NASA, the National Research Council and other space-savvy places. They advocate relearning how to land on the moon or figuring out how to travel to Mars, an asteroid or the special orbital location where the James Webb Space Telescope will eventually operate. But after more than two decades of talking that talk, the U.S. has yet to walk that walk. Private space companies describe a vision that sounds like the original OPTIONS: - CNN: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - Earth orbit: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - International Space Station: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - James Webb Space Telescope: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - Mars: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - Meg Urry: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - NASA: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - National Research Council: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - SpaceX: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - U.S: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - U.S.: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - Urry: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation.","output":"Private space companies, such as SpaceX, describe a vision that consists of big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. This vision aligns with the main objective of advancing space exploration by leveraging the innovation and cost-effectiveness offered by private enterprises. By doing so, they aim to assist government space agencies like NASA in achieving their goals and maintaining the leadership of countries such as the U.S. in space. One of the advantages of private space companies is their greater flexibility in terms of decision making and execution, as they do not depend on government bureaucracy and budget allocations. This enables them to develop and test new technologies at a faster rate, which in turn allows for the rapid progress of space exploration. For instance, SpaceX has developed reusable rockets that significantly reduce the cost of launching spacecraft, making space exploration more affordable and accessible to a wider range of organizations and countries. Moreover, private companies can attract funding from different sources, including private investors and venture capitalists, which can help to bolster financial resources for audacious space ventures. This diversification of financial sources can alleviate the burden on taxpayers and the federal budget, allowing governments to allocate funds to other crucial areas such as education, healthcare, or national defense while still making significant strides in space exploration. Collaboration between public agencies like NASA and private players like SpaceX has the potential to synergize the strengths of both entities, ultimately leading to greater efficiency and more significant achievements in space exploration. In particular, the access to advanced technology provided by private companies can support government agencies to focus on research that involves deeper exploration of space and finding ways to improve life back on Earth. Furthermore, private companies can help stimulate public interest in space exploration and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs by offering out-of-the-box solutions and exciting new projects in the space industry. This includes plans by SpaceX for crewed missions to Mars, as well as asteroid mining initiatives and space tourism opportunities. By bringing novel ideas to the table and pushing the boundaries of space exploration, private companies can keep the public engaged and hopeful about the future of space travel. In conclusion, private space companies like SpaceX offer a new frontier for space exploration, with a progressive vision that includes big goals, achieved through small but steady steps. By collaborating with government bodies such as NASA and receiving support without undue interference from the nation, they can propel the space industry forward, maintain the leadership of countries like the U.S. in this arena, and ultimately bring humanity to the next phase in our journey through the cosmos."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Founded in 1892, the Carabane school was one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona.

Plot title: Nekromantik 2 Movie plot: The film begins where the first one left off, with a flashback to Robert \\"Rob\\" Schmadtke's suicide (Daktari Lorenz), whose corpse Monika (Monika M.) retrieves from a church's graveyard after the opening credits. This introductory scene establishes that Monika is not simply the local gravedigger. The body snatcher is depicted with a particularly feminine appearance: red nail polish in her fingernails, pencil skirt and polka dot blouse.[5] Monika apparently evades notice while carrying Rob's corpse into her apartment, where she unwraps him from his body bag. Images of tabloid headlines inform viewers of the source of Monika's knowledge of Rob and his activities.[5] Meanwhile, Mark (Mark Reeder) heads to his as-yet-unspecified job, and the film then cuts back to a scene of Monika undressing Rob. Mark's job is thereupon revealed to be dubbing porn films, and this scene foreshadows the next, in which Monika has sex with Rob's corpse. Betty (Beatrice Manowski), Rob's ex-girlfriend from the previous film, is then briefly introduced as she discovers, to her disappointment, that Rob's grave has already been robbed. Monika fails to have an orgasm and the sex scene ends with her running to the bathroom. She is disgusted, and about to vomit. The implication is that \\"the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak\\".[5] Once Monika has cleaned Rob's corpse, she takes photos with him using her camera's self-timer.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - In archaeology, Mesolithic (Greek: , \\"mesos\\" \\"middle\\"; , \\"lithos\\" \\"stone\\") is the culture between Paleolithic and Neolithic. The term \\"Epipaleolithic\\" is often used for areas outside northern Europe, but was also the preferred synonym used by French archaeologists until the 1960s.  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire.  - In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the northsouth position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run eastwest as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. Approximations employed. Two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of these coordinates. In the first step the physical surface is modelled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modelled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the \\"actual\\" surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.  - Kirkbymoorside is a small market town and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England, about north of York, midway between Pickering and Helmsley, on the edge of the North York Moors National Park.

The Vale of Pickering is a low-lying plain, orientated in an eastwest direction. It is well defined by the Yorkshire Wolds escarpment to the south, the Corallian limestone foothills of the North York Moors to the north, the North Sea coast to the east and the Howardian Hills to the west. The eastwest-orientated main roads (A64 and A170) in the vale follow the shoreline of the glacial lake, which formed in the vale after the last ice age. The main A169 road crosses the vale in a northsouth direction, joining the market towns of Malton and Pickering. At the eastern edge of the vale the A165 carries traffic along a northsouth coastal route through Scarborough. The main line railway crosses the eastern part of the vale from south to north west linking Malton to Scarborough and the east coast rail line links Scarborough to Filey, and Bridlington.

It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.  - Helmsley is a market town and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, the town is located at the point where Rye Dale leaves the moorland and joins the flat Vale of Pickering.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - A sundial is a device that tells the time of day by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky. In the narrowest sense of the word it consists of a flat plate (the \\"dial\\") and a \\"gnomon\\" which casts a shadow onto the dial. As the sun appears to move across the sky, the shadow aligns with different \\"hour-lines\\" which are marked on the dial to indicate the time of day. The \\"style\\" is the time-telling edge of the gnomon, though a single point or \\"nodus\\" may be used. The gnomon casts a broad shadow; the shadow of the style shows the time. The gnomon may be a rod, a wire or an elaborately decorated metal casting. The style must be parallel to the axis of the Earth's rotation for the sundial to be accurate throughout the year. The style's angle from horizontal is equal to the sundial's geographical latitude.  - The Howardian Hills take their name from the Howard family who still own local lands, and are located between the Yorkshire Wolds, the North York Moors National Park and the Vale of York.

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said it is at risk of being exported from the UK unless a buyer pays the asking price of Â£8,460. The temporary order was imposed earlier by Culture Minister Ed Vaizey. The use of gilding and the high quality of the brooch indicates it was used by an individual of significant social status. An illustration of the Virgin Mary in the 9th Century gospel manuscript, the Book of Kells, shows her wearing a brooch of similar type and also suggests it had a Christian meaning. Mr Vaizey said: \\"With an object as old and as rare as this one, it is important that we protect it for the UK in order to help us better understand what life, society and culture was like during Anglo-Saxon times. \\"I hope that the temporary export bar that I have put in place will result in a UK buyer coming forward to buy this brooch and save it for the nation.\\" The ban was imposed on the advice of the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (RCEWA). Leslie Webster, from the group, said: \\"This beautiful object has intriguing stories to tell, and would be a marvellous acquisition for a UK museum.\\" The identity of the owner is confidential according to the DCMS.

Your job interview serves as a first impression for a potential employer, so rescheduling may come off as unprofessional. If possible, rearrange the other parts of your schedule before rescheduling your job interview. Rescheduling a job interview can be a huge inconvenience to everyone involved. Because of this, it's important that you contact your potential employer to reschedule at least 24 hours before your scheduled interview. When you contact your interviewer, give a brief explanation for your need to reschedule. Be as honest as possible. Give your interviewer a few alternative dates that will work for your rescheduled interview.  If you're rescheduling due to another job interview, it's best not to tell your interviewer that. Tell them you've had a work or family conflict come up, and that you'd love to reschedule your interview for another time. If a life emergency happens and you cannot give 24 hour notice, contact your interviewer as soon as possible to let them know what happened. If it's a real emergency (you were injured, you have a family emergency, etc.), your potential employer should understand. If you're still interested in the job, express that when you call to cancel. Say something like \\"I'm very sorry, but an emergency has come up and I won't be able to make our interview tomorrow. I'm still interested in the position and would be extremely grateful if we could reschedule.\\" When possible, make direct contact with your potential employer instead of sending an email or leaving a message. Making contact via phone will make you look like a responsible professional. Make an effort to get in touch with your interviewer in numerous ways, and only leave a message or send an email if you cannot reach them via phone.  Never send a text message to reschedule an interview, as it will make you look unprofessional. If you end up leaving a message or sending an email, ask that your interviewer contact you to confirm they got your message. A job interview is normally scheduled around multiple people's schedules. Therefore, cancelling or rescheduling an interview is usually an inconvenience for multiple people. Don't assume that your interviewer's schedule revolves around you, and apologize for causing any inconvenience. Try to be flexible when you ask to reschedule your interview. If your interviewer sees that you are putting in good effort to make this interview work, they will be more likely to reschedule your interview. After you've contacted your interviewer about rescheduling, send them a personal note or email reiterating your apology and your interest in the company. Your interviewer may be frustrated or irritated by you cancelling, so use this note as an opportunity to let them know that you are genuinely sorry and would still like a chance to reschedule an interview.","output":"When you need to reschedule a job interview, first try to change your other plans, but if you must reschedule, contact the interviewer with an honest explanation, suggest new dates, and always be polite because it might inconvenience many people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I just had to trash loads of them because they were of such poor quality. Mary: Oh, absolutely Greg! I can't tell you how many times I've had to do that. The clothes nowadays just seem to deteriorate too quickly. Greg: Yeah, I thought it was just me. It's pretty disappointing when you have to throw them away after only a few months of use. Mary: It's true. Sometimes you think you're scoring a deal with inexpensive clothing, but it turns out being more costly in the long run since they don't last very long. And not just for our wallets, it's harmful for the environment too. Greg: Oh definitely! I've been reading about how the fast fashion industry has a significant negative impact on the environment. It's one of the primary causes of pollution and waste all around the world. Mary: Yes, I've been hearing a lot about that too. You know, textile production and manufacturing create a vast amount of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming. Moreover, the fashion industry consumes an outrageous amount of water. Greg: That's true. I remember reading that it takes thousands of liters of water just to produce one cotton shirt – and that's not even considering the pollution generated in the process. And to think of all the clothes we've just thrown away, it's such a waste of resources. Mary: Absolutely. I feel so guilty about all the clothes I've discarded without even thinking about it. If only there was a way we could reduce this wastage and minimize the environmental consequences. Greg: Well, I think it all comes down to being more conscious about our purchases. We should make an effort to buy only what we genuinely need, and invest in good-quality clothes that will last longer. Mary: I couldn't agree more, Greg. We should also try to support brands that are eco-friendly and prioritize sustainable production methods.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: One of the worst feelings you have as a professional athlete is the feeling after losing a game to a team that you should have beaten. That happened last night against the lowly Boston Celtics. They had only won 13 games the whole year and were really struggling. We had just come off a very good win against the Orlando Magic on the road and were feeling good about ourselves. The day did not start out good for us when we learned that T-Mac was going to miss the game with the flu. When you lose your best players (Yao, T-Mac) everyone must play a little harder and do a little bit more on the floor. We inserted Bonzi Wells into the lineup (he was the only one to have a good game for us), in place of T-Mac. It was a nasty game. We are usually one of the best three point shooting teams in the NBA and we only made 1 of 22 three point shots! I have never seen that happen. Never! Rafer Alston, Luther Head, and me combined to shoot 5 of 33 from the field. Ouch! You aren't going to win too many games like that. Even as poorly as we shot the ball, we STILL had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter but failed to make the winning plays that you must make to leave the floor victorious. In the locker room after the game, everybody felt terrible. When we play a bad game, we feel that we let our teammates down. There is a bad feeling in the pit of your stomach when you leave the gym and you just want to go home and not talk to anyone. It is a terrible feeling, but it is a feeling that makes you want to try harder and do better the next time. I'll talk to you guys later. Shane Options: A To blame the team for losing the game.

So, we can combine them: 0 = (13864*p - 13807*p) - 741 Which simplifies to: 0 = 57*p - 741 Now, we need to isolate the variable 'p' on one side of the equation. We can do that by adding 741 to both sides: 0 + 741 = 57*p - 741 + 741 Which gives us: 741 = 57*p Now, we need to solve for 'p' by dividing both sides of the equation by 57: 741 / 57 = 57*p / 57 The result will be: 13 = p So, the solution to the equation 0 = -13807*p + 13864*p - 741 is p = 13."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This tragic event highlights the unstable situation in Kabul, and the ongoing conflict between the Afghan government, Western forces, and insurgent groups such as the Taliban. The December 2009 attack occurred in a neighborhood previously thought to be secure, demonstrating the unpredictable nature of violence in war-torn areas. The suicide car bombing took place near the former Afghan vice president's home, adding a political dimension to the attack. It is likely that the perpetrator, or the group they were affiliated with, intended to send a message to the government and other power structures in Kabul. The fact that the attack also impacted a hotel frequented by Westerners highlights the continued threat to foreign nationals in the region, which further complicates international efforts to assist and stabilize the country. As the attack was carried out by a suicide car bomber, this indicates a level of organization and commitment on the part of the perpetrator or their support network. Such methods are typically used as a way to maximize damage and casualties and are difficult to predict or prevent. The aftermath of the attack saw eight people killed and nearly 40 wounded, illustrating the human cost of such acts of terror. Neighborhoods that were once considered safe become sites of fear and insecurity, and the lives of innocent civilians are forever changed. In a city like Kabul, where international diplomatic efforts and peacekeeping missions take place, the potential for violence to escalate or derail important work is always present. The December 2009 suicide car bombing is just one example of the ongoing challenges faced by the Afghan government, international forces, and NGOs working in the region. The security situation in Kabul, and throughout Afghanistan, is complex and fraught with danger. Addressing the root causes of this instability – ineffective governance, corruption, lack of economic opportunity, and the allure of extremist ideologies – will require comprehensive, long-term strategies that promote peace and development in the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Sandstorms hit northwestern China's Gansu Province and North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on the first day this year. According to Sun Landong,a meteorologist with the Lanzhou Meteorology Observatory,visibility was less than 100 meters in Minqin, a Gansu county near Inner Mongolia,because of sand. When visibility drops to less than 1 kilometer, it is called a sandstorm. The sandstorm in Minqin blew up dust in neighboring towns, such as Baiyin,Wuwei,Jinchang and Lanzhou,the capital city of Gansu Province Dust-laden winds also swept into Beijing. Brought by northwesterly blowing at more than 20 meters per second, dust first reached the capital's suburbs at 7 a. m.,downtown areas at 9 a. m. The winds,which died down during the night,brought the temperature down to as low as 8 0C below zero and many flights put off their planned time from the city's airport. It is quite rare for sandstorms,which are frequent between March and June,to happen in winter,when the earth is frozen. The sandstorms in Gansu and Inner Mongolia do not necessarily mean there will be more of them in the spring than last year,when they were serious,but Beijing is taking it very seriously. It is reported that Beijing will spend 6 billion yuan( US 725 million) in preventing sandstorms in the capital and has already set up a special team to make sure what causes them.

In the passage, the author talks about dealing with the effects of Gustav and how much of the city is without power. This implies that Gustav is a natural disaster, likely a hurricane, as they commonly cause power outages and widespread damage. Gustav is not a sort of Quake because the passage talks about power outages and disruption to the city's normal functioning, which is more characteristic of a hurricane.  Gustav is not an Angry man because the passage describes dealing with the effects of Gustav, which suggests it is a natural disaster. Angry men typically do not cause power outages and city-wide disruptions on the scale described in the passage.

The presidential daughter appeared on Fox Business Network Friday and said her silence was deliberate. “I have chosen, and I made a conscientious decision a long time ago, that I was not going to get into the fray, and that means that I’ll absorb the body blows that come my way,” Trump told Maria Bartiromo. Instead, she says she wants to \\"focus on the task at hand, which is serving the American people and using this moment in my life to advance an agenda that I deeply believe in and feel very fortunate to be able to work on.\\" Ivanka Trump had taken flak for not publicly criticizing the policy of separating families at the border—in fact, that was the source of Bee's criticism. When Bartiromo asked her if she had advised her father privately to ditch the policy, the first daughter said she had. “Of course, I have very strong opinions on that topic,” she said, per the Washington Post.

She expressed a commitment to focusing on \\"serving the American people\\" and using her current position to advance an agenda in which she strongly believes.  Ivanka faced criticism for not speaking openly about the controversial policy of separating families at the border, which was the primary source of Samantha Bee's objection.

Answer this question: Which best determines the number of wolves that can live in an area? pick from the following. * the amount of snow in the area each year * the number of birds that live in the area * the number of trees in the area * the amount of food available in the area. Answer:","output":"The best determinant of the number of wolves that can live in an area is the amount of food available in the area. It's essential to understand that the factors mentioned - amount of snow, number of birds, and number of trees - can indirectly impact wolf populations; however, the availability of food resources is the most predominant factor affecting their numbers and survival. Wolves, as carnivorous predators, primarily depend on large ungulates such as elk, deer, moose, and caribou as their primary food source. The presence and abundance of these prey species are essential in sustaining a healthy wolf population. Let's further discuss how the other listed factors are related to food availability and their impact on the number of wolves in an area: 1. The amount of snow in the area each year: Snowfall can impact the accessibility of prey for wolves. Deep snow could make it difficult for wolves to hunt, and sometimes snow can provide an advantage to the prey species, like deer, which are better adapted to navigating snowy terrains than wolves. However, the primary relationship between snow and wolves is that heavy snow can cause the prey population to decrease due to scarcity of food, especially in extreme conditions. When there are fewer prey, it directly impacts the number of wolves an area can support. 2. The number of birds in the area: Birds can play a minor role in a wolf's diet, but they are not a primary food source. While they provide supplementary food in certain situations, birds don't strongly correlate with the number of wolves an area can support. However, the presence of certain bird species can serve as an indicator of a healthy ecosystem, which could indirectly suggest an adequate prey population for wolves. 3. The number of trees in the area: Trees in an area provide shelter and habitat for both wolves and their prey. Dense forests can offer hiding spots for wolves to stalk their prey and can also provide cover to protect their young. On the other hand, an area with fewer trees might not provide sufficient cover, making it challenging for wolves to thrive. However, the number of trees is still not a directly determining factor for the number of wolves that an area can support. In summary, the amount of food available in an area, mainly as large ungulates, is the most significant determinant of the number of wolves that can live in that area. The other factors mentioned can indirectly impact the number of wolves through their effect on prey populations, but they are not directly responsible for the wolf population size. A healthy and sustainable prey population is key to the survival and success of wolf populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the snuff mill that was replaced by a bridge?, using the article: The newest bridge across the Parrett is Cocklemoor Bridge, a pedestrian footbridge close to the Great Bow Bridge. It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the River Parrett Trail. The next bridge upstream is Bicknell's bridge, which was formerly known as Bickling bridge, which carries the road from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney. It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a minor road over the river, and another minor road crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney (or silent) Mill and a lock. The mill, with an iron overshot wheel, was built to grind corn in 1823. Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the mill has been the subject of a feasibility study by the South Somerset Hydropower Group. Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the Parrett Iron Works, founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, which included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages. The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keeper's cottage still exist. Further south the river flows under the A303 near Norton-sub-Hamdon and the A356 near Chedington., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided article, the snuff mill that was replaced by a bridge was located on the site where Parrett Iron Works was later established, which is also the location of Carey's Mill Bridge. The article states that the Parrett Iron Works was founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, and Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. Although it does not directly mention the exact name of the snuff mill, it is safe to assume that it might have been referred to as 'Carey's Mill' since the bridge was named after it. This snuff mill was then replaced by the aforementioned establishment and their infrastructure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Solve this problem.","output":"Let's start with the given equation:  131*g - 351 = 230*g - 102*g The first step to solving for 'g' would be to simplify both sides of the equation. To simplify the right side, we have to combine like terms, so we subtract 102g from 230g which gives: 131*g - 351 = 128*g Next, we'll isolate 'g' by getting all the terms with 'g' on one side of the equation and the constants on the other. We can start doing this by subtracting 128g from both sides of the equation. The new equation is: 131g - 128g = 351 This simplifies to: 3g = 351 To solve for 'g', we'll divide both sides of this equation by 3: g = 351 / 3 So: g = 117 This means that the solution for 'g' in the equation 131*g - 351 = 230*g - 102*g is g = 117."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is an article: updated 4:48 AM EST, Fri November 7, 2014 (CNN) -- The director of the FBI defended Friday an agent's actions in impersonating an Associated Press reporter to track down a suspect -- a tactic criticized by the news agency as \\"unacceptable.\\" In a letter to the New York Times, FBI director James Comey said the deception had occurred in 2007, as the agency tried to solve a series of bomb threats and cyberattacks directed at a high school in the Seattle area. And he rebuffed criticism of the agency's methods, saying, \\"We do use deception at times to catch crooks, but we are acting responsibly and legally.\\" Comey said the agency had determined that the suspect was a narcissist and so set out to snare him making use of that. The agent who posed as an AP reporter \\"asked if the suspect would be willing to review a draft article about the threats and attacks, to be sure that the anonymous suspect was portrayed fairly,\\" he wrote. As a result of the suspect clicking on a link relating to the fake story, the agency was able to track him down using court-authorized tools, Comey said. \\"No actual story was published, and no one except the suspect interacted with the undercover 'A.P.' employee or saw the fake draft story,\\" he wrote. \\"Only the suspect was fooled, and it led to his arrest and the end of a frightening period for a high school.\\" However, AP executive editor Kathleen Carroll slammed the agency's tactics, according to an AP report. \\"This latest revelation of how the FBI misappropriated the trusted name of The Associated Press doubles our concern and outrage, expressed earlier to Attorney General Eric Holder, about how the agency's unacceptable tactics undermine AP and the vital distinction between the government and the press,\\" Carroll said in a statement. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press sent a letter Thursday to Comey and Holder expressing its deep concern over what it said was an \\"inexcusable\\" failure to comply with their own offices' guidelines on impersonation of the news media. \\"The utilization of news media as a cover for delivery of electronic surveillance software is unacceptable. This practice endangers the media's credibility and creates the appearance that it is not independent of the government,\\" it said. \\"It undermines media organizations' ability to independently report on law enforcement. It lends itself to the appearance that media organizations are compelled to speak on behalf of the government.\\" In a letter sent to the Justice Department last week, the AP requested Holder's word that the Justice Department would never again misrepresent itself as the news agency, an AP report said. The AP also asked for policies to ensure the department does not impersonate other news organizations in the future. \\"The FBI both misappropriated the trusted name of The Associated Press and created a situation where our credibility could have been undermined on a large scale,\\" AP General Counsel Karen Kaiser wrote. \\"The FBI may have intended this false story as a trap for only one person. However, the individual could easily have reposted this story to social networks, distributing to thousands of people, under our name, what was essentially a piece of government disinformation.\\" Comey's letter said the methods used in the case were \\"proper and appropriate\\" under Justice Department and FBI guidelines at the time -- but acknowledged that higher approval levels would probably be needed for the use of such a technique today. \\"Every undercover operation involves 'deception,' which has long been a critical tool in fighting crime,\\" his letter concluded. \\"The F.B.I.'s use of such techniques is subject to close oversight, both internally and by the courts that review our work.\\" Write a title for it.","output":"FBI Director Defends Agent's Impersonation of AP Reporter in 2007 Case, Amid News Agency's Criticism"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person that takes refuge with Denise?, using the article: Terry asks his boss's wife Sylvia to his apartment after an office party and the two go to bed. Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window.  At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement. As he leaves, he sees Carl's distinctive truck parked outside and rushes in again. He is too late, however, for in the dark she has been stabbed fatally and dies in Terry's arms.

Given the question: \\"Tenryū-class cruiser\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to? The answer is:","output":"The Tenryū-class cruiser belongs to the category of mean of transportation, more specifically in the subcategory of naval ships or military vessels. The Tenryū-class cruisers were a type of warship class used by the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War I and World War II. The Tenryū-class cruisers were designed to be scout cruisers or the fleet's \\"eyes\\" during naval engagements. They were intended to serve as fast, light cruiser vessels with powerful weaponry that could perform duties such as reconnaissance, escorting, and screening of larger warships. They were developed following the trend of other naval powers in terms of producing smaller, faster, and more versatile ships. The Tenryū-class cruiser comprised of two vessels: the Tenryū and the Tatsuta. Both ships were commissioned during World War I and saw effective service in various engagements throughout their careers, most notably during World War II.  The design of the Tenryū-class cruisers prioritized speed and firepower while sacrificing armor protection. They were equipped with an array of weapons, including four single 5.5-inch (140mm) guns, one 3-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft gun, and three Type 21 surface-to-air torpedoes. The ships also had a top speed of approximately 33 knots, which allowed them to effectively carry out their intended roles. During World War II, both ships of the Tenryū-class cruiser took part in major operations. The Tenryū participated in the invasion of the Philippines, the Battle of the Java Sea, and the Battle of Guadalcanal before being sunk by the USS Albacore submarine. The Tatsuta also participated in several operations, including the Battle of Midway and the Indian Ocean raid before being sunk by the submarine USS Sand Lance. In conclusion, the Tenryū-class cruiser falls under the category of mean of transportation, primarily in the naval ships or military vessels subcategory. They were crucial assets to the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War I and World War II, playing a crucial role in supporting larger warships and performing reconnaissance and escort missions. Although both ships were eventually sunk during World War II, their influence can still be felt today as a historical example of effective naval vessels designed with speed and firepower in mind."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why are the kids wearing those shirts ?","output":"Based on the information provided in the passage, it is difficult to determine the exact reason behind the kids wearing those shirts that read \\"My daddy is the Fallen Angel.\\" Nevertheless, we can suggest several possible scenarios drawn from the given context. 1. Expression of love and admiration: The shirts could symbolize the children's love and admiration for their father. By wearing shirts with a text referring to their dad as the \\"Fallen Angel,\\" the children are essentially paying tribute to him and showcasing their connection to him. The fact that the narrator finds the shirts \\"extra cute\\" suggests that this gesture is viewed positively by the observer. 2. Family theme or inside joke: The message on the shirts could be part of a family theme or an inside joke that the kids and their family members find amusing or meaningful. It is possible that \\"Fallen Angel\\" refers to an incident or an anecdote within the family circle, and the shirts are worn to reflect this shared understanding. 3. Parental choice: The choice to have the kids wear these shirts might have been made by their parents. The children, being very young, are unlikely to have chosen the shirts themselves. The parents might have thought it would be humorous or attractive to have their children wear matching shirts with the \\"My daddy is the Fallen Angel\\" text. 4. Public performance or event: The kids might be wearing those shirts as part of a public event or gathering, where wearing such outfits is appropriate or required. For instance, the family could be attending a themed party or a special occasion where people are encouraged to wear distinctive clothing with textual messages. In summary, although the specific reason behind the kids wearing those shirts is not explicitly mentioned in the passage, we can infer that it could either be an expression of love and admiration for their father, an inside joke, a decision made by the parents, or part of a public event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a series circuit, all the components are connected end-to-end in a single path so that the current flows through each component in turn. 2.

If any part of the loop is interrupted, such as by a switch or a break in the wire, the current cannot flow through the rest of the circuit, causing the entire circuit's electric current to cease. 4. This characteristic of cessation of current upon interruption, combined with the single-loop nature of the circuit, justifies calling it a series circuit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: Which element is last alphabetically in the Periodic Table?","output":"Zirconium is the element that appears last alphabetically in the Periodic Table. It is a chemical element with the symbol Zr and atomic number 40. Zirconium is a strong, lustrous, and corrosion-resistant transition metal with a silver-white appearance. The element's name is derived from the Persian word \\"zargun\\" which translates to \\"gold-colored.\\" However, despite the name, zirconium exhibits a silver-white hue rather than a golden one. Discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, zirconium is mainly obtained from minerals like zircon and baddeleyite. Today, zirconium is primarily used in a variety of applications, including as an alloying agent in materials that must withstand extreme conditions, such as high temperatures and corrosive environments. Due to its remarkable resistance to corrosion, zirconium has found use in the chemical industry where it constitutes a component of pumps, valves, and heat exchangers. It plays a significant role in the nuclear industry because of its low neutron-absorption cross-section, making it an ideal material for cladding fuel rods in nuclear reactors. Moreover, zirconium compounds have found application in various industries. For instance, zircon – a zirconium silicate – is used as an opacifier and refractory material in ceramics, while zirconium oxide is valued for its toughness and used in cutting tools, abrasive materials, and dental implants. Overall, zirconium's unique properties and diverse applications make it an important element in numerous industrial and technological advancements.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny the best metal album of all time? ?  As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), slated for launch in 2021, is one such groundbreaking marvel of engineering. With unparalleled capabilities that far surpass its predecessors, the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope, JWST is expected to uncover secrets from the very beginning of our universe, including the possibility of detecting light from the earliest galaxies. History of Telescopes The first known practical telescope was invented in the early seventeenth century by Dutch mathematician and astronomer Hans Lippershey. However, it was the works of Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei that garnered the attention of the world to the power of telescopes. Since then, telescopes have come a long way and undergone a multitude of advancements, including the iconic Hubble Space Telescope, which has been in orbit since 1990. JWST is envisioned as the scientific successor to Hubble. Named after NASA administrator James E. Webb, who played a pivotal role in the Apollo program, JWST is a collaborative effort between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The James Webb Space Telescope JWST is equipped with a large, segmented, and gold-coated mirror that measures 6.5 meters (over 21 feet) in diameter. This colossal mirror allows the telescope to collect more light and observe objects with greater detail than its predecessors. JWST is also configured to observe in the infrared spectrum, which is crucial in detecting light from the early universe. These capabilities make it possible for JWST to probe deeper into the cosmos than ever before, reaching regions that have been inaccessible until now. Discovering the Light from the Earliest Galaxies The universe came into existence nearly 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang. As the universe expanded and cooled, hydrogen atoms combined to form the first stars and galaxies. Detecting the light from these ancient celestial bodies is vital in understanding the origins of the universe and its evolution. Due to the expansion of the universe, the light emitted by these early galaxies has been stretched and redshifted to the infrared spectrum, making it challenging for most telescopes to detect. JWST is uniquely tailored to tackle this challenge. Its infrared capabilities, combined with its powerful mirror, enable the telescope to potentially capture light from faint galaxies that formed approximately 100 to 250 million years after the Big Bang. This remarkable feat will provide astronomers with invaluable information about the birth and evolution of these galaxies, helping us uncover the mysteries of the early universe. The First Galaxies and Their Impact on the Universe Observing the earliest galaxies will shed light on how they were formed, their cluster patterns, and how they interacted with dark matter. Studying these galaxies will also provide insights into the process of reionization – when the universe transitioned from being opaque to transparent due to the formation of stars and galaxies. Reionization allowed photons to travel through space, paving the way for the formation of more complex structures like larger galaxies, stars, and eventually, planets. The James Webb Space Telescope's groundbreaking capabilities are expected to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos. By potentially capturing the elusive light from the earliest galaxies, we can hope to answer some of the most profound questions about the origins and evolution of our universe. With these extraordinary accomplishments on the horizon, the age of cosmic discovery is poised to enter a thrilling new chapter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Stock Chart for Goldman Sachs Group Inc/The (GS)      Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein’s 19 million compensation for 2010, almost double the prior year, ended two years in which the firm’s top executives gave up cash bonuses.      Blankfein’s pay included 5.4 million in cash, 12.6 million in restricted stock, a 600,000 salary and about 464,000 in other benefits, a proxy statement from the New York- based firm showed. Blankfein’s 9.8 million pay for 2009 included 9 million in restricted stock plus salary and other compensation.      Cash awards are back at Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, after a 38 percent drop in annual earnings and a year in which the stock price ended close to where it began. While pay is up from 2008, when Blankfein, 56, and six other senior officers got no bonuses, it remains below Blankfein’s record-setting 67.9 million award for 2007.      “The fact that they would return to a more market-based pay is probably not surprising” after 2008 and 2009, said Rose Marie Orens, a senior partner at Compensation Advisory Partners LLC in New York. “They’re not quite back to anything remotely like what they paid in the prior years.”      Goldman Sachs’s 2010 share performance -- a decline of less than half of 1 percent -- outstripped competitors including Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which was the second- biggest U.S. securities firm after Goldman Sachs before both converted to banks in 2008. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), which reported a record profit last year, rose 1.8 percent during the year.      ‘Difficult Market Conditions’      “While our performance in 2010 was not as strong as in 2009 due to difficult market conditions for much of the year, we continued to create value for our shareholders and prudently manage our firm from a risk perspective,” Goldman Sachs said in the proxy.      All 30 members of the management committee received only restricted stock for their 2009 bonuses and four of them --Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, 55, President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, 50, and Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans, 53, and John S. Weinberg, 54 -- received the same 9 million award as Blankfein.      For 2010, Goldman Sachs once again matched those four executives’ bonuses to Blankfein’s 12.6 million in restricted stock and 5.4 million in cash. All four also received a 600,000 salary in 2010.      ‘Partnership Mentality’      “They’ve had a history of paying their top five like partners,” Orens said. “It’s unusual, but it really comes from their partnership mentality.”      The firm disclosed in January that Blankfein’s salary will increase to 2 million in 2011 and that Cohn, Viniar, Evans and Weinberg will each receive a 1.85 million salary starting this year. Each of them had received a 600,000 salary since 1999, the year the firm became a public company.      Blankfein and eight deputies reaped a total of 125 million during 2010 from their investments in private equity and hedge funds managed by the firm, the proxy disclosed. Blankfein’s payments, which included profits and any return of capital, totaled 27.2 million, outstripping his compensation.      After Blankfein, the largest fund distributions were 23.3 million to General Counsel Gregory K. Palm; 20.2 million to Cohn; 16.7 million to Viniar; and 13.7 million to Evans. The others disclosed in the filing were 10.9 million to Vice Chairman Michael S. Sherwood; 6.4 million apiece to Weinberg and General Counsel Esta E. Stecher, and 430,000 to Alan M. Cohen, global head of compliance.      Goldman Sachs’s executives stand to earn more cash bonuses in future years under a long-term incentive plan, the LTIP, disclosed in the proxy. The payments are contingent on two financial measures: return on equity and book value per share.      Board’s Choice      The initial measurement period is three years and the board can extend it through the end of 2018. The notional value of the award for all five executives named in the proxy was 7 million, a figure that wasn’t included in the 2010 compensation because it won’t be delivered for three years.      For the executives to receive the awards in full, return on equity, or ROE, must average 10 percent and book value per share must rise an average of 7 percent, the proxy shows. They will receive 150 percent of the bonus if the average ROE is 15 percent or more and book value per share climbs an average of 12 percent or more. The ROE target is below the firm’s long-stated goal of achieving 20 percent return on tangible equity, which equates to more than 15 percent ROE, over the economic cycle.      Eleanor Bloxham, president of the Corporate Governance Alliance in Columbus, Ohio, said Goldman Sachs seemed to be responding to regulators’ efforts to align pay to the firm’s longer-term performance.      ‘Paying out Cash’      “Going forward I’m pleased that the LTIP cash will include these deferral mechanisms so that it doesn’t encourage risk- taking and that risk measures look at longer-term horizons,” she said. “There’s still a way to go in this year’s plan because they’re paying out cash.”      To be sure, all of the executives own company stock worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Blankfein owned 3.29 million shares as of March 7, the proxy disclosed, worth 527.6 million at the 160.23 share price on April 1. Cohn’s 1.96 million shares were worth 313.4 million and Viniar’s 1.89 million shares were worth 302.4 million.      The SEC requires that the company’s proxy disclose how much compensation executives received during the fiscal year. Under that methodology, which includes awards received during 2010 for performance in prior years, Blankfein received a total of 14.1 million in compensation.      Goldman Sachs’s board has unanimously recommended that the firm give shareholders a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation every year.      The firm is set to hold its annual shareholder meeting at 9:30 a.m. on May 6 in Jersey City, New Jersey.

The Sisters of Saint Joseph of Boston, Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, the Sisters of St Francis of Philadelphia and the Benedictine Sisters of Mt Angel – all investors in the bank – have put their name to a proposal to review its remuneration policies, after it emerged its five most senior employees were collectively awarded 69.5m (£43m) in pay last year.      The securities and exchange commission disclosed the challenge in a filing ahead of Goldman Sachs' annual meeting next month.      The nuns asked that \\"shareholders request that the board's compensation committee initiate a review of our company's senior executive compensation policies and make available a summary report of that review by 1 October, 2011 (omitting confidential information and processed at a reasonable cost). We request that the report include:      1. An evaluation of whether our senior executive compensation packages (including, but not limited to, options, benefits, perks, loans and retirement agreements) are 'excessive' and should be modified.      2. An exploration of how sizeable layoffs and the level of pay of our lowest paid workers impact senior executive pay.      3. An analysis of the way in which fluctuations in revenues impact: a) the company's compensation pool; b) the compensation of the company's top 25 senior executives; and c) the company's shareholders.\\"      The nuns have made their feelings on Goldman's pay levels clear in previous years, with about as much success as the coalition government in its attempts to limit UK bank bonuses. Chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, who has claimed to be doing \\"God's work\\" at Goldman, saw his pay reach 14m in 2010, with four other senior executives receiving a similar amount.      Goldman said it would resist the request.      \\"Shareholders already have access to the information necessary to understand and assess the compensation decisions made with respect to our senior executives, and the firm as a whole. Our board believes that the preparation of the requested report would be a distraction to our compensation committee and our board, would entail an unjustified cost to our firm and would not provide shareholders with any meaningful information.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"In 2010, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein's compensation was 19 million, which was almost double from the prior year and marked the end of two years without cash bonuses for the firm's top executives.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The intro shows a camera recording faces of corpses, with their mouths being moved by medical students. Med school student Teddy Grey (Milo Ventimiglia) graduates top of his class from Harvard and joins one of the nationâs most prestigious pathology programs. There, a rivalry develops between a group of interns and Teddy. They invite him into their group, which entertains itself with a secret after-hours game at the morgue of who can commit the perfect undetectable murder. Eventually the group's leader, Jake Gallo, realizes that Teddy is sleeping with his girlfriend, Dr. Juliette Bath. When Teddy catches several members of the group in lies, he realizes that what initially seemed like vigilante killings are, in actuality, just innocent people murdered for sport. Teddy's fiancÃ©e Gwen arrives to stay with him in his apartment. Gallo, angered by Juliette's infidelity, kills her for the next game. However, just as they are about to begin the autopsy on Bath (in the meantime plotting Teddy's death), Gallo realizes that the gas has been left on in the room, resulting in a massive explosion as one of the group lights a meth pipe, killing everyone but Teddy who was not in the room. Gallo realizes what is about to happen and survives. Teddy is seen walking away from the explosion. Later, Gallo manages to kill Gwen in what he believes to be the \\"perfect murder\\". Upon completing his autopsy report on his murdered fiancÃ©e, Teddy is knocked out by Gallo and then is forced to trade verbal barbs with him. Teddy uses some of Gallo's own rhetoric against him in reverse psychology fashion, after which fellow pathologist Ben Stravinsky frees Teddy and together they kill Gallo in exactly the same way that he killed Teddy's fiancÃ©e. In the process, they vivisect Gallo. Answer:","output":"Considering the complex and twisted relationships between the characters, the underlying motivation for the killings, and the ultimate consequences faced by the main protagonists, an appropriate question about this movie plot could be: How does the dangerous rivalry between Teddy Grey and Jake Gallo escalate from a secret after-hours game of creating undetectable murders to a series of vengeful killings and manipulation, ultimately culminating in both Teddy and Ben Stravinsky seeking retribution for the loss of their loved ones by vivisecting Jake Gallo in the same manner as his crimes?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

This conclusion can be drawn from the statement in the text that says the European Association of Science Editors (EASE) \\"now has an international membership from diverse backgrounds, professional experiences, and job titles.\\" Although the text does not explicitly mention that the EASE members come from every continent or every country in the world, the term \\"international membership\\" strongly suggests that the members are not only from Europe but from various parts of the world. That's because \\"international\\" refers to involving more than a single country. Hence, the EASE members are likely to come from multiple countries and regions across the globe.  Created in France, the organization has broadened its scope and reach since its establishment in 1982, catering to those interested in science communication and editing worldwide. It comprises members who are diverse not only geographically but also in terms of their professional backgrounds and job titles. This could potentially include people working in different areas of science communication and editing, adding to the evidence that its members are globally dispersed. It's important to note that while the exact geographic distribution or representation is not detailed in the text (for example, it does not specify whether there are members from both developed and developing countries, or from countries in every continent), it is reasonable to deduce that the term \\"international membership\\" implies a global presence. In conclusion, given the international membership of EASE and the fact that the members come from diverse backgrounds, it is valid to say that EASE members come from all over the globe.

My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me.

A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Available options: (A). yes (B). no","output":"(A). yes One of the subjects of a treatise by Ibn Sina, also known as Avicenna, is metaphysics. Ibn Sina was a Persian polymath and one of the most significant thinkers in the history of Islamic philosophy. His work covered numerous disciplines, including medicine, astronomy, alchemy, and psychology. However, he is best remembered for his immense contributions to the field of philosophy. In his vast philosophical corpus, Ibn Sina wrote several treatises on the subjects of logic, ethics, and metaphysics, but his most famous work in philosophy is \\"Al‑Shifa\\" (The Healing) and \\"Al‑Najat\\" (The Deliverance). Within these treatises, he covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of these disciplines and builds upon the works of earlier philosophers like Aristotle and al-Farabi. These works played a crucial role in transmitting the ideas of Greek philosophy to the Islamic intellectual tradition. \\"Al‑Shifa\\" is a large encyclopedic work divided into four sections: logic, natural sciences, mathematics, and metaphysics. In his treatise on metaphysics, Ibn Sina elaborates on the nature of existence, causality, and the relationship between the material and immaterial worlds, developing and extending Aristotle's metaphysics. Notably, he introduces the argument for the existence of a \\"Necessary Existent,\\" which is a precursor to the arguments for the existence of God in later Western philosophy. Aside from his discussions on the nature of being and existence, Ibn Sina's treatise on metaphysics delves into the organization and structure of the universe, including the celestial spheres and the principles of motion. He also investigates questions about the nature of the human soul, arguing that the soul is independent of the body and can achieve immortality. In conclusion, one of the subjects of a treatise by Ibn Sina is metaphysics, which can be found in his famous works, \\"Al‑Shifa\\" and \\"Al‑Najat.\\" His contributions to this field not only had a significant impact on Islamic intellectual traditions but also influenced Western philosophy in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Question: \\"Which causes a smaller loss, Stoke shift loss or internal optical losses?\\"  Context: \\"Among the challenges being faced to improve the efficiency of LED-based white light sources is the development of more efficient phosphors. As of 2010, the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the YAG phosphor, with less than 10% Stoke shift loss. Losses attributable to internal optical losses due to re-absorption in the LED chip and in the LED packaging itself account typically for another 10% to 30% of efficiency loss. Currently, in the area of phosphor LED development, much effort is being spent on optimizing these devices to higher light output and higher operation temperatures. For instance, the efficiency can be raised by adapting better package design or by using a more suitable type of phosphor. Conformal coating process is frequently used to address the issue of varying phosphor thickness.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Stoke shift loss causes a smaller loss compared to internal optical losses. Step 1: Identify the information given in the context. - YAG phosphor has less than 10% Stoke shift loss. - Internal optical losses account for 10-30% of efficiency loss. Step 2: Compare the losses. - Stoke shift loss: less than 10% - Internal optical losses: 10-30% Step 3: Determine which loss is smaller. Based on the information given in the context, the Stoke shift loss (less than 10%) is smaller than the internal optical losses (10-30%).

Write an article based on this summary: Swallow a large mouthful of air. Force yourself to burp Take a shower with an abrupt temperature change. Trigger sudden emotions.","output":"Title: The Science Behind Triggering a Release: Sudden Emotions, Temperature Changes, and More Introduction Ever felt the need to release stress or a built-up emotion, but felt unable to do so? Sometimes our bodies require a little push to clear the air and make us feel more relaxed. In this article, we will explore some interesting ways that one can trigger a release in their body, allowing them to ease tension and feel lighter. Read on as we discuss swallowing a large mouthful of air, forcing yourself to burp, taking a shower with an abrupt temperature change, and triggering sudden emotions. 1. Swallowing a Large Mouthful of Air Step 1: Inhale deeply Start by taking a deep breath, filling up your lungs with fresh air. This action can help increase your blood's oxygen levels, leading to improved concentration and alertness. Step 2: Swallow the air While holding this large volume of air inside your lungs, use your throat muscles to swallow a significant portion of it. As the air moves down your esophagus, it will create pressure to facilitate a physical release. 2. Forcing Yourself to Burp Step 1: Create pressure After swallowing a large mouthful of air, you will need to apply pressure in the form of a forced burp. Since burping is a natural process to expel excess air from the digestive tract, this can lead to a feeling of relief. Step 2: Release Allow the burp to come out naturally, offering an instant release of tension. As the air escapes, you should feel lighter and more relaxed. 3. Taking a Shower with Abrupt Temperature Change Step 1: Begin with your preferred temperature Start by taking a shower at your ideal, comfortable water temperature. Allow your body to adjust to the warmth and enjoy the sensation as you begin to relax. Step 2: Switch to cold water Without warning, quickly turn the shower knob to a significantly lower temperature, so that the once warm water is now cold. This abrupt and unexpected change will shock your system, triggering the release of endorphins, which will help to reduce stress and tension. 4. Triggering Sudden Emotions Step 1: Identify the emotional trigger Consider which emotions are building up inside you. Pick one that needs a release and think of a situation or memory that can stir up these emotions. Step 2: Embrace the emotional release Allow yourself to feel the full spectrum of these emotions and embrace the catharsis that follows when you let go. This emotional release can lead to a state of well-being and overall mental and physical relaxation. Conclusion Our bodies often require a physical or emotional release to alleviate built-up tension and stress. By following these methods outlined in this article – swallowing a large mouthful of air, forcing yourself to burp, taking a shower with an abrupt temperature change, and triggering sudden emotions – you can successfully achieve a renewed sense of relaxation and satisfaction, leaving you lighter and more at ease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you tell me the answer to the greenback party and farmers' alliances both called for??","output":"The Greenback Party and Farmers' Alliances, both formed in the late 19th century in the United States, were political movements representing the interests of farmers, laborers, and small-scale producers. Their primary goal was to address the economic hardships faced by these groups due to various reasons, including falling crop prices and the lack of credit available for farmers. These organizations both called for major financial and economic reforms that would aid the struggling agrarian communities and bolster their economic stability. Key demands that were championed by both the Greenback Party and Farmers' Alliances include: 1. Monetary Policy Reform: Both movements recognized the need for reforming the nation's monetary system. The Greenback Party and Farmers' Alliances advocated for expanding the currency supply by increasing the circulation of greenbacks – the fiat paper money issued by the federal government during the Civil War. They believed that this inflationary policy would raise crop prices, ease the repayment of debts, and benefit the farmers. 2. Increased Availability of Credit: One major concern shared by these organizations was the difficulty farmers faced in obtaining loans to support their agricultural operations. They believed that the national banks catered mostly to the interests of Eastern industrialists and businesses, and the high-interest loans provided by local banks were too expensive for struggling farmers. As a result, both called for the establishment of public or cooperative banking systems that would lend money at lower interest rates, making credit more accessible to the agrarian communities. 3. Regulation of Railroads and Transportation: The high transportation costs due to unregulated railroad monopolies impacted the farmers' profits significantly. Both the Greenback Party and Farmers' Alliances demanded the stricter regulation of railroads and other transportation-related industries to ensure fair prices and treatment for farmers. They sought the transition of railroads and related services into public utilities, which would prevent monopolistic practices and provide better cost management of this vital resource. 4. Progressive Income Tax: An important aspect of the Greenback Party and Farmers' Alliances was their desire for a more equitable distribution of wealth. They supported the introduction of a progressive income tax, which would impose higher tax rates on wealthier individuals, thus helping to reduce income inequality and channel more resources towards the less privileged classes. 5. Direct Election of Senators: At the time, U.S. Senators were chosen by state legislatures, which often led to corruption and the selection of Senators who did not adequately represent the interests of farmers and laborers. Both movements advocated for direct election of Senators by the people, thereby promoting more democratic representation and addressing the concerns of rural populations. While neither the Greenback Party nor the Farmers' Alliances were ultimately successful in achieving their goals, they contributed to the eventual formation of the more influential Populist Party in the 1890s. This movement, which combined the objectives of these earlier organizations with new demands, significantly influenced U.S. politics and helped to bring about some long-lasting reforms in the nation's financial and political systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It involves physical activity and social interaction, both of which can effectively alleviate boredom.    - Smell smoke: This option does not seem to be related to alleviating boredom at all. The act of smelling smoke is not an activity that a bored child would typically do to entertain themselves.    - Reach over: This action also does not seem to be related to alleviating boredom. It is a simple physical movement, and not an engaging activity for a child. 4.

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.  John is studying a species in two similar countries, country A and country B. Country A has large population, but country B has small population of that species. John is pondering about how this species would fare in the future in these two countries.  Would country A see higher or lower growth rate of the species than country B? Answer:","output":"Based on the principles of population dynamics in nature, it is likely that Country A would have a lower growth rate of the species than Country B. This conclusion can be drawn by considering the following factors: 1. Resource availability - As described, when there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can reproduce more easily, resulting in a high birth rate, and thus, a high growth rate of the species. Since Country A has a large population of the species, it is likely that the resources are more limited compared to Country B, which has a smaller population. Consequently, the species in Country A could face increased competition for limited resources, making it difficult for each individual to thrive, reproduce, and contribute to population growth. 2. Carrying capacity - The carrying capacity refers to the maximum number of individuals of a species that a given environment can sustain. When an ecosystem reaches its carrying capacity for a specific species, the growth rate of that species decreases. As the population size in Country A is large, it is possible that it could be approaching or has already reached its carrying capacity for the species. On the other hand, the population of the same species in Country B is smaller, indicating that there might be more room for population growth before reaching its carrying capacity. 3. Density-dependent factors - As population density increases, some factors can cause higher mortality rates or decreased reproduction in a species due to increased competition. These factors, known as density-dependent factors, include limited food supply, increased predation, competition for mates, and increased exposure to diseases and parasites. In Country A, with a larger population, these density-dependent factors could contribute to a lower growth rate when compared to Country B. 4. Genetic diversity - Although not directly related to population growth rate, genetic diversity within a population is important for long-term sustainability. A smaller population, such as in Country B, is more prone to losing genetic diversity due to inbreeding. While this might not influence the immediate growth rate, it can result in long-term negative effects on the population, such as decreased adaptability, increased vulnerability to environmental changes, and a reduced ability to cope with diseases. In conclusion, considering the elements that influence population growth in nature, it is likely that Country A would experience a lower growth rate of the species compared to Country B. However, it is essential to keep in mind that actual outcomes might depend on various external factors, such as intervention efforts, changes in environmental conditions, or the introduction of new species into the ecosystem that could affect the dynamics of species growth."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Henry Moore was born in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale colliery in Castleford. He was an autodidact with an interest in music and literature. Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in clay and carving in wood. He professed to have decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of Michelangelo's achievements at a Sunday School reading.On his second attempt he was accepted at Castleford Grammar School, which several of his siblings had attended, where his headmaster soon noticed his talent and interest in medieval sculpture. His art teacher broadened his knowledge of art, and with her encouragement, he determined to make art his career; first by sitting for examinations for a scholarship to the local art college.  Moore's earliest recorded carvings – a plaque for the Scott Society at Castleford Secondary School, and a Roll of Honour commemorating the boys who went to fight in the First World War from the school – were executed around this time.Despite his early promise, Moore's parents had been against him training as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became a teacher at the school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles regiment and was injured in 1917 in a gas attack, on 30 November at Bourlon Wood, during the Battle of Cambrai. After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a physical training instructor, only returning to France as the Armistice was signed. He recalled later, \\"for...

Plot title: The Terror Movie plot: Set in 1806, the film tells the story of a lost French soldier in the Confederation of the Rhine named Andre Duvalier (Jack Nicholson) who is saved by a strange young woman named Helene (Sandra Knight). She looks like Ilsa, the wife of the baron (played by Boris Karloff), who died twenty years before. Investigating who the woman really is, Andre stumbles upon a hidden secret of the Baron: After he found Ilsa sleeping with another man named Eric, the Baron killed his wife while his servant killed Eric, or so he explains. All the while, the phantom of Ilsa remained under the control of a peasant witch (Dorothy Neumann), who has commanded the ghost to torment the Baron for the previous two years. Over the course of the film, Ilsa's ghost beseeches the Baron to kill himself, so they could be together. After much hesitation, the Baron decides to do so, perhaps to atone for his crimes. During the climactic scenes, Andre, as well as the Baron's butler Stefan (Dick Miller), try to stop him, eventually forcing the witch into compliance. Here it is revealed that the witch Katrina is in fact the mother of Eric, who she believes was killed by the Baron twenty years before, and that is why she has tried to make him commit suicide and damn his soul to hell. In a stunning revelation, Stefan reveals that Eric never died, that it was the Baron who was killed. Eric then took the Baron's place, living his life until he deluded himself into thinking he was the Baron. Katrina, realizing her folly only too late, goes with the two men to stop Eric from flooding the castle crypt and killing himself.

For those who follow such things, the name will be familiar: It's Craig Wright, the man Wired magazine identified as the all-but-certain creator of the digital currency last year. Now Wright himself has given interviews to the BBC, the Economist, and GQ to say that he is indeed the man behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright also posted a blog entry with technical details to buttress his claim, one that will surely be pored over in the coming days. \\"Satoshi is dead,\\" he writes. The Economist's takeaway: \\"Our conclusion is that Mr. Wright could well be Mr. Nakamoto, but that important questions remain. Indeed, it may never be possible to establish beyond reasonable doubt who really created Bitcoin.\\" Wright says he's come forward now to end the speculation—\\"there are lots of stories out there that have been made up and I don't like it hurting those people I care about,\\" he tells the BBC—but he says he isn't interested in being the \\"public face\\" of Bitcoin. \\"I just want to be left alone.\\" The revelation comes at a pivotal time for the currency, as two competing camps within the community wrestle with whether it should remain \\"smallish and pure\\" or go more mainstream, says the Economist. Wright says he chose the fictional name Nakamoto after a 17th-century philosopher and merchant in Japan. As for the name Satoshi, \\"some things should remain secret.\\" If he is indeed Nakamoto, Wright is a wealthy man, because \\"Nakamoto\\" holds the equivalent of about 450 million in Bitcoins.

It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the  Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack.

OPTIONS: a). making a model of outer space b). asking questions to other scientists c). collecting information about planets d). looking at the night sky with a telescope","output":"Option d). looking at the night sky with a telescope would best help a scientist discover a new planet. A telescope is a crucial tool for the observation and study of celestial objects, including planets. There are several reasons why using a telescope to look at the night sky would be the most effective way of discovering a new planet among the given options. First, telescopes allow scientists to observe the vast expanse of the universe more clearly and in more detail than the naked eye can. Telescopes can magnify the appearance of distant objects, making it easier to spot smaller or fainter objects, such as new planets, which may not be visible without their aid. The ability to study these faraway celestial objects up close is invaluable to scientists in their efforts to discover new planets. Second, telescopes can be equipped with specialized instruments, such as spectrographs, to analyze the light emitted by celestial objects, including planets. This can provide critical data about the composition, temperature, and other properties of these objects. The analysis of this data can help scientists identify unknown celestial bodies, including previously undiscovered planets. Third, modern telescopes have the capability to operate across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum. This versatility means that they can detect objects not only in visible light, but in other wavelengths such as infrared, radio, ultraviolet, or even X-ray. This extended range of observation increases the chances of detecting new planets that may not be detectable through visible light alone. Compared to the other options, using a telescope is a more direct and efficient way to discover a new planet. While making a model of outer space (option a) could help scientists visualize the positions and characteristics of known celestial objects, it is unlikely to lead to the discovery of new planets which were previously unknown. Option b, asking questions to other scientists, can be a valuable way to exchange information and ideas, but it would not necessarily lead to the discovery of a new planet. It would largely depend on the knowledge and findings of other scientists. Option c, collecting information about planets, might increase our understanding of known planets, but it would not directly contribute to the discovery of a new planet by actually observing the night sky and searching for undiscovered celestial bodies. In conclusion, option d). looking at the night sky with a telescope is the most effective approach to discovering a new planet among the presented options. It allows scientists to directly observe celestial objects with a level of detail and precision that cannot be achieved through other methods, and its versatility offers a broader range of observations to increase the likelihood of finding previously unknown planets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: Bake the pumpkin in oven at 350 degrees.","output":"Baking a pumpkin in the oven at 350°F (175°C) is a simple and delicious way to enjoy the flavors of fall. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you achieve the best results: 1. Preheat your oven: Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) and allow it to preheat while you prepare the pumpkin. 2. Select the right pumpkin: Choose a small pie or sugar pumpkin that is specifically meant for baking and not a large carving pumpkin. The smaller pumpkins tend to have sweeter and more tender flesh. 3. Clean the pumpkin: Thoroughly rinse the pumpkin with water to remove any dirt or debris. Pat it dry with a clean towel. 4. Cut the pumpkin: Use a sharp knife and cutting board to carefully cut the pumpkin in half or into quarters, depending on its size. Be extra cautious while cutting through the thick skin to avoid any accidents. 5. Scoop out the seeds and fibrous strands: Use a sturdy spoon or a pumpkin scraper to remove the seeds and strands from the pumpkin halves. Save the seeds for roasting, if you like. 6. Optional: Season the pumpkin: If you want a savory pumpkin dish, brush the cut sides of the pumpkin with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and any herbs or spices that you prefer. For a sweeter dish, brush the pumpkin with melted butter and then sprinkle with cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, or the sweetener and spices of your choice. 7. Prepare the baking sheet: Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil for easy cleanup. Place a wire rack on the baking sheet if you have one. 8. Arrange the pumpkin: Place the pumpkin halves or quarters cut-side down on the lined baking sheet or wire rack. This will allow the moisture to escape and help the pumpkin cook evenly. 9. Bake the pumpkin: Place the baking sheet with the pumpkin in the preheated oven and bake for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of your pumpkin pieces. It is ready when a fork can easily be inserted into the flesh. 10. Check for doneness: Keep an eye on the pumpkin as it bakes to ensure it does not overcook or burn. To test for doneness, insert a fork into the flesh. If it slides in easily, the pumpkin is cooked thoroughly. 11. Rest and cool the pumpkin: Once the pumpkin is fully cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool on the baking sheet or wire rack for about 10-15 minutes. 12. Prepare pumpkin puree, if desired: Once the pumpkin is cool enough to handle, you can scoop out the flesh and discard the skin. For a smooth puree, process the flesh using a food processor, immersion blender, or a fine mesh sieve. 13. Enjoy or store: You can now use the cooked pumpkin or pumpkin puree in various recipes such as pumpkin soup, pumpkin pie, or even pumpkin smoothies! Otherwise, store the pumpkin in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze for up to three months.

Ecologist Dr Derek Lee, founder of the Wild Nature Institute (WNI) , which conducts scientific research on at-risk wildlife species, took the amazing photographs in Tarangire National Park.      “Omo is leucistic, meaning many of the skin cells are incapable of making a pigment. Some are, so she is pale but not pure white, with red or blue eyes, as a true albino would be,” he explained.      “Omo is the only pale giraffe we are currently aware of, but we have also observed leucistic waterbuck, Cape buffalo and ostrich in Tarangire.      “Omo appears to get along with the other giraffes, she has always been seen with a large group of normally coloured giraffe, they don't seem to mind her different colouring.”      Photo: DEREK LEE/ CATERS NEWS      However he warned that her unique colour could make her a target for poachers in the African park.      He added: “Omo is now 15 months old. She survived her first year as a small calf, which is the most dangerous time for a young giraffe due to lion, leopard and hyena preying on them.      “Her chances of surviving to adulthood are good but adult giraffes are regularly poached for bush meat, and her colouration might make her a target.      “We and our partners are working on giraffe conservation and anti-poaching to help give Omo and her relatives a better chance of survival.      “We hope that she lives a long life and that someday she has calves of her own.”      The WNI blog adds: “We were lucky enough to see her again this January, almost exactly one year [after the first sighting].      “We are thrilled that she is still alive and well. A local lodge guide christened her Omo, after a popular brand of detergent here.” ||||| Researchers recently caught a glimpse of a white giraffe named Omo in the Tanzania’s Tarangire National Park. (Photo: Screenshot)      Researchers recently caught a glimpse of a white giraffe named Omo in the Tanzania's Tarangire National Park.

While Omo may appear to be an albino, she is actually leucistic, according to the organization.      “One way to tell the difference between albino and leucistic animals is that albino individuals lack melanin everywhere, including in the eyes, so the resulting eye color is red from the underlying blood vessels,” the organization said.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? of an overripe episode of tv 's dawson 's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story","output":"The sentiment of the given sentence appears to be negative. In order to understand this, let's break down and analyze the components of the sentence: 1. \\"of an overripe episode of tv 's dawson 's creek\\": The word “overripe” typically carries a negative connotation, implying that something has gone past its peak and is no longer fresh or enjoyable. In this context, the implication is that the episode in question is stale and not at its best, regardless of whether the show itself is considered good or bad. As a result, this part of the sentence has a negative sentiment. 2. \\"and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story\\": This segment refers to a version of a love story that has been “recycled” and “dumbed-down.” The word “recycled” indicates that the story is unoriginal and has borrowed heavily from other sources, which is generally seen as negative. Similarly, “dumbed-down” implies that the story has been simplified and reduced to a lower level of quality or intellectual engagement, further contributing to the negative sentiment. Thus, by considering the individual components of the sentence, it becomes evident that the sentiment of the entire sentence is negative. The sentence suggests that the subject matter is stale, unoriginal, and has been cheapened or oversimplified, and these are all negative qualities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: austin was a nice person so she improved lee's situation.  Given the context: How would Austin feel afterwards?  Possible answers: great, angry, upset A:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the context of the question to identify the key elements. In the question, the two main elements are:  - Austin was a nice person. - Austin improved Lee's situation. Step 2: Understand the emotional impact of each element. As Austin is described as a nice person, it can be deduced that they would have good intentions and possibly feel positive emotions when helping others. Moreover, the fact that Austin improved Lee's situation indicates that something beneficial or good has been done for Lee due to Austin's actions. Step 3: Assess the possible answers based on the context and the emotional impact of each element. Great: This answer aligns with the context and actions of Austin, as they are a nice person who helped improve Lee's situation. The feelings of accomplishment and fulfillment of helping someone else are consistent with possibly feeling great afterwards. Angry: This answer is not in line with the context, as there is no indication that Austin would feel angry after helping someone, since they are described as a nice person. Upset: This answer also does not align with the context. As a nice person who improved someone's situation, there is no reason to assume Austin would feel upset afterwards. Step 4: Choose the answer that best aligns with the context and emotional impact. Based on the analysis in Steps 1-3, I would choose answer: A: Great Reason: Austin, being a nice person, likely feels a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction after helping to improve Lee's situation.

In which city was the Arab League founded in 1945???","output":"The Arab League, also known as the League of Arab States, was founded in the city of Cairo, Egypt, on March 22, 1945. Cairo, the capital of Egypt, is not only a pivotal city in the region but also a historical and cultural center of the Arab world. The establishment of the Arab League was a result of the efforts of several Arab countries seeking to promote political, economic, cultural, and social cooperation amongst its members. The initial founding members of the Arab League were Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Transjordan (now Jordan), and Yemen. Over the years, other Arab countries joined the organization, and it now represents 22 member states in total. The objectives of the Arab League include strengthening the relationships between its member states, coordinating their policies, ensuring non-intervention in domestic affairs, respect for the sovereignty of member states, and encouraging joint economic and military projects. It also aims to safeguard the national independence, sovereignty, and cultural heritage of the Arab countries. Despite being established in Cairo, the Arab League's headquarters were not permanently housed in the city from the outset. Initially, the headquarters were situated in a temporary location until the construction of the league's official headquarters was completed. The Arab League building, a modern structure reflecting the shared aspirations of the Arab world, was finally inaugurated by Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt at the time, in 1957.  Since its inception, the Arab League has played a significant role in various key events and conflicts in the region, such as the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Suez Crisis in 1956, the Lebanese Civil War in 1975-1990, and the Gulf War in 1990-1991, among others. Although the league has faced various challenges and criticisms related to its effectiveness in resolving disputes within the Arab world, it remains as an essential forum for dialogue and consultation among its member states."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Due to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March Equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June 21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September 23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year.  - Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. Bears are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.  - Claudius Ptolemy (\\"Klaúdios Ptolemaîos\\", ; ) was a Greek writer, known as a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology. He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Koine Greek, and held Roman citizenship. Beyond that, few reliable details of his life are known. His birthplace has been given as Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid in an uncorroborated statement by the 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes. This is a very late attestation, however, and there is no other reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else than Alexandria, where he died around AD 168.  - Ursa Major (also known as the Great Bear) is a constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. One of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy (second century AD), it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It can be visible throughout the year in most of the northern hemisphere. Its name, Latin for \\"the greater (or larger) she-bear\\", stands as a reference to and in direct contrast with Ursa Minor, \\"the lesser she-bear\\", with which it is frequently associated in mythology and amateur astronomy. The constellation's most recognizable asterism, a group of seven relatively bright stars commonly known as the \\"Big Dipper\\", \\"the Wagon\\" or \\"the Plough\\" (among others), both mimics the shape of the lesser bear (the \\"Little Dipper\\") and is commonly used as a navigational pointer towards the current northern pole star, Polaris in Ursa Minor. The Big Dipper and the constellation as a whole have mythological significance in numerous world cultures, usually as a symbol of the north.  - Polaris, designated Alpha Ursae Minoris (Ursae Minoris, abbreviated Alpha UMi, UMi), commonly the North Star or Pole Star, is the brightest star in the constellation of Ursa Minor. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. The revised Hipparcos parallax gives a distance to Polaris of about 433 light-years (133 parsecs), while calculations by other methods derive distances around 30% closer.  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - Ursa Minor (Latin: \\"lesser-Bear\\", contrasting with Ursa Major), also known as the Little Bear, is a constellation in the Northern Sky. Like the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, Little Dipper: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the North Star.  - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant.  - In modern astronomy, the sky (celestial sphere) is divided into 88 regions called constellations, generally based on the asterisms (which are also called \\"constellations\\") of Greek and Roman mythology. Those along the ecliptic are the constellations of the zodiac.  - Amateur astronomy is a hobby whose participants enjoy watching the sky, and the abundance of objects found in it with the unaided eye, binoculars, or telescopes. Even though scientific research is not their main goal, many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring variable stars, tracking asteroids and discovering transient objects, such as comets and novae.  - The International Astronomical Union (IAU UAI) is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy. Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them.  - NGC 4194 , the Medusa merger , is a pair of interacting galaxies in the constellation Ursa Major . A region of extreme star formation 500 ly ( 150 pc ) across exists in the center of the Eye of Medusa , the central gas - rich region .  - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names.  - The Big Dipper (US) or Plough (UK) is an asterism consisting of the seven brightest stars of the constellation Ursa Major; six of them are of second magnitude and one, Megrez (), of third magnitude. Four define a \\"bowl\\" or \\"body\\" and three define a \\"handle\\" or \\"head\\". It is recognized as a distinct grouping in many cultures.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'galaxy'. The answer to this question is:","output":"NGC 4194, also known as the Medusa merger."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Shopping used to mean actually going to shops, but nowadays, you can shop without even leaving your house. Just sit in front of your computer, click your mouse and your things will be sent to your house in a couple of days. November 11this a big day for people who like shopping online. On that day last year, many online stores offered a big discount and free delivery service. The biggest online shopping sites in China,Taobao.com and Tmall.com ,sold things worth 19.1 billion yuan in total. \\"Goods online are often much cheaper. It also saves me a lot of time. And we often have more goods on many online stores than in shopping malls,\\" Wang Xin, an online shopping lover in Beijing, said to China Daily. She stayed up very late for a lot of cheap goods online. She spent several thousand that day. Another big advantage of online shopping is that it helps people get things from different cities, even different countries, _ . \\"I like eating duck neck very much and I often buy it on Taobao from shops in Wuhan. It's much more delicious than what our local   stores sell, but cheaper,\\" said Zang Xin, a girl in Yangzhou. While enjoying online shopping, many people also have worries, especially for middle school student buyers. Young students are easily attracted by advertisements on the Internet and buy things they don't need. \\"Middle school students should pay more attention to their study. Searching for things wastes their time,\\" said Jing Chunling, an education expert. \\"Besides, online shop owners have no idea of the ages of their buyers. Anyone can easily buy things that they want to. Some of goods are even bad for young students such as cigarettes and wine.\\" Question: According to the article, which of the following is not an advantage of shopping online? Options: A: It can save people time and money. B: Online stores have better quality goods. C: People can buy things from different places. D: Online stores may have more kinds of goods.","output":"The answer to the question \\"According to the article, which of the following is not an advantage of shopping online?\\", based on the information provided in the text, is B: Online stores have better quality goods. Let's analyze each option separately for clarity: A: It can save people time and money - The article supports this statement as an advantage. Wang Xin notes that, \\"Goods online are often much cheaper. It also saves me a lot of time,\\" and further points out that discounts and free delivery services are sometimes offered.  B: Online stores have better quality goods - The article does not mention or indicate that the quality of goods in online stores is better than that found in physical stores. Zang Xin, a customer, comments that she can buy a certain product, duck neck, which she finds tastier than what is available locally, but this is a matter of personal preference rather than a statement about the general quality of online goods. C: People can buy things from different places - The article mentions this as one of the advantages of online shopping. Wang Xin states that she can purchase goods from many online stores, implying a wide range of options, while Zang Xin verifies this advantage by explaining that she buys a product from another city because it's more delicious.  D: Online stores may have more kinds of goods - The article supports this statement. Wang Xin explains that there are often more goods available in online stores than in physical shopping malls.  So, it can be concluded from the article that the correct answer is B, as it does not indicate that online stores inherently have better quality goods as an advantage of online shopping."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: close up of yellow flowers and its leaves after a rain","output":"The most important words in the following sentence are \\"close up,\\" \\"yellow flowers,\\" \\"leaves,\\" and \\"rain.\\"  1. Close up: This phrase indicates a view or perspective at a short distance, allowing us to see small details of the subject matter. In the context of photography or videography, it refers to a shot that is taken from very close to the subject, which allows the viewer to observe a greater degree of detail and texture that's not usually discernible from a distance. 2. Yellow flowers: This term specifies the primary subject of the image, focusing on flowers that are yellow in color. It helps to describe the type and color of the flowers, which differentiates the scene from any other potential subjects. The mention of 'yellow flowers' brings to mind warmth, brightness, and a bit of cheerfulness. 3. Leaves: This word references another part of the plant or subject matter. It adds variety and extra context to the scene, as leaves often provide visual interest and texture. Additionally, leaves are a vital component of the plant's life cycle and are associated with growth and change. 4. Rain: The reference to 'rain' in this sentence adds another layer of depth, as it provides a sense of the environment, atmosphere, and timing in which the close-up was taken. Rain is often associated with freshness and rejuvenation, so it suggests the flowers and leaves might be glistening with water droplets, which typically adds an aesthetic appeal and enhances the overall impact of the scene. The mention of rain heavily impacts our understanding and appreciation of the image described. In summary, these four words – \\"close up,\\" \\"yellow flowers,\\" \\"leaves,\\" and \\"rain\\" – are crucial in providing essential information about the scene. They create a vivid mental image of yellow flowers and their leaves captured up close after a rain shower, allowing the reader to understand the context, details, and the aesthetic appeal of the scene."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sometimes, you feel as if you're on top of the world. But occasionally you feel horrible, and you lose things and you cannot focus on your schoolwork. For more than 20 years, scientists have suggested that high self-esteem   is the key to success. Now, new research shows that focusing just on building self-esteem may not be helpful. In some cases, having high self-esteem can bring bad results if it makes you less likeable or more upset when you fail at something. \\"Forget about self-esteem,\\" says Jennifer Crocker, a psychologist   at the University of Michigan, US. \\"It's not the important thing.\\" Feeling good Crocker's advice may sound a bit strange because it is good to feel good about yourself. Studies show that people with high self-esteem are less likely to be depressed, anxious, shy, or lonely than those with low self-esteem. But, after reviewing about 18,000 studies on self-esteem, Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University, has found that building up your self-esteem will not necessarily make you a better person. He believes that violent and wicked people often have the highest self-esteem of all. He also said: \\"There's no evidence that kids with high self-esteem do better in school.\\" Problems All types of people have problems. People with high self-esteem can have big egos   that can make them less likeable to their peers , said Kathleen Vohs, a psychology professor at Columbia University. People with high self-esteem tend to think more of themselves, Vohs says. People with low self-esteem are more likely to rely on their friends when they need help. What to do Researchers say it is best to listen to and support other people. Find positive ways to contribute to society. If you fail at something try to learn from the experience. \\"The best therapy   is to recognize your faults,\\" Vohs says. \\"It's OK to say, 'I'm not so good at that,' and then move on.\\" The new research comes to the conclusion that high self-esteem   _  .

And I got to live in my big house , alone . Except for the servants ... One of Whom I had Begun to believe was watching me . Why did the speaker hope that the one of the men would eventually take his wife away for good ?","output":"To understand why the speaker hoped that one of the men would eventually take his wife away, let's analyze the provided information step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the speaker's feelings and situation The speaker acknowledges that he doesn't want to shirk his duty as a husband. This shows that he recognizes his responsibilities and wants to fulfill them. However, he keeps finding his wife with other men, which causes him emotional turmoil. Step 2: Examine the speaker's response to the situation Despite the speaker's commitment to his duties, deep down, he hopes that his wife will be stolen away by someone else. This indicates that he is unhappy in his marriage and tired of his wife's infidelity. Step 3: Analyze the speaker's desires and end-result After his wife is taken away by another man, the speaker ends up living alone in his big house – something he seems to prefer over living with his wife. This situation suggests that the speaker desires solitude and peace, away from his spouse's unfaithfulness. Based on these steps, it can be concluded that the speaker hoped for one of the men to take his wife away for good because he was unhappy in his marriage and found it difficult to deal with his wife's infidelity. Her absence allowed him to live in peace and solitude, ultimately providing him some relief from the emotional strain their marriage had caused."},{"instruction":"Is this product review positive?

Opened in 1932, it was the first line of the Independent Subway System (IND), and the \\"Eighth Avenue Subway\\" name was also applied by New Yorkers to the entire IND system. Most of the line has four tracks, with one local and one express track in each direction, except for the extreme north and south ends, where only the two express tracks continue. The line is signaled as Line \\"A\\", with tracks A1, A3, A4, and A2 from west to east, running from approximately 800 at the south end to 1540 at the north end (measured in feet).  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Rector Street was a station on the demolished IRT Ninth Avenue Line .

It closed on June 11 , 1940 . The next southbound stop was Battery Place . The next northbound stop was Cortlandt Street for Ninth Avenue Line trains .  - An elevated railway (also known as El rail or simply El for short, and, in Europe, as overhead railway) is a rapid transit railway with the tracks above street level on a viaduct or other elevated structure (usually constructed of steel, concrete, or brick). The railway may be standard gauge, narrow gauge, light rail, monorail, or a suspension railway. Elevated railways are usually used in urban areas where there would otherwise be a large number of level crossings. Most of the time, the tracks of elevated railways that run on steel viaducts can be seen from street level.  - The IRT Ninth Avenue Line, often called the Ninth Avenue El, was the first elevated railway in New York City.

Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.\\".

Question: What is another word for higher power? Context: Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.

Mathieu Flamini believes Arsenal are finally getting to grips with the perils of life on the road in the Barclays Premier League after the Gunners rallied to hold Everton to a 2-2 draw at Goodison. The Londoners were humbled 3-0 on this ground late last season and looked to be heading for further embarrassment on Merseyside after Seamus Coleman and Steven Naismith gave Everton a two-goal lead going into the break. But, after Aaron Ramsey cut the deficit after 83 minutes, substitute Olivier Giroud headed a late equaliser from Nacho Monreal's cross. Scroll down for videos... On the road: Mathieu Flamini claims that Arsenal have learned how to play difficult away games. One downbeat note for the Gunners was the half-time substitution of Chilean Alexis Sanchez, their £35million summer signing, who manager Arsene Wenger felt 'struggled with the physicality' and which saw the lively Giroud brought on. But French midfielder Flamini said: 'We've learned a lot from last year about playing these kind of teams away and we came back today and tried to be stronger. 'We didn't give up until the last second so it was a game to remember for us. It was a great performance from the team because being 2-0 down was not easy for us. Even though we were losing in the first half we had a few occasions to score so it was a bit unfair for us.' Hope: Aaron Ramsey collects the ball after scoring late to bring the score to 2-1 at Goodison. Game changer: Olivier Giroud came off the bench to score the equaliser before a late ankle injury. Meanwhile, Arsene Wenger praised Giroud for changing the game after coming on as a second-half substitute. 'We looked much more dangerous (after Giroud came on),' the Arsenal manager said. 'I knew we were dominating the game in the second half and we needed some physical presence up front. That presence was very important. 'He had a very good second half.' Unfortunately for Wenger, Giroud suffered an ankle injury in the dying minutes and could now miss the second leg of Arsenal's Champions League play-off against Besiktas. 'It is a big game and I hope we have not lost him,' said Wenger of Giroud, who left Goodison Park with a protective boot on his left foot. 'In the final minute he stretched his ankle. At the moment it doesn't look too good. ' Not fit enough! Alexis Sanchez was withdrawn at half-time after an ineffectual performance. Sanchez is likely to lead the line against the Turks, who gained a 0-0 draw against the Gunners in Istanbul on Wednesday. Wenger said he had no option but to withdraw the £35million signing at half-time on Saturday. 'At the moment he is not completely ready physically,' Wenger said.

That question is not difficult to answer if we change the word poetry to songs. I sing when I feel good. When I sing my favorite songs, I feel even better. Sometimes when I am listening to music and to the song words, I feel that it was written for me. A good song always makes me feel something. There are songs that I sing in my head between classes and songs that I want to sing when the school bell rings by the end of the day. They help me get through the day.  _ I like songs about love and friendship. The extraordinary thing is that my feelings are more special when I sing my favorite songs in English. I also like reading. I used to avoid poetry until an e-friend told me I should recite poems and not look up the meaning of the words. Poetry uses many difficult words and idioms, but the best thing is to just forget about them. In the beginning I felt quite strange. Now I always lock the door. Reading aloud gives you a strange feeling, but when you have some practice and fall into the rhythm, and the sounds of the words, it is really a special experience. I started with small poems, but now I think I most like long poems. I have different feelings with different poems. When I have had a bad day at school, I read Keats and forget everything. When I am sad I read Wordsworth by the light of a candle. When the poem is finished, I close the book and my sadness is gone. According to the writer,   _  .

Given the question \\"How would Lee feel afterwards?\\", is \\"resentful\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"No, \\"resentful\\" would not typically be a valid answer in this context. Resentment is a feeling of bitter indignation due to perceived unfairness or having been wronged.  In the scenario you provided, Aubrey approaches Lee, who has just lost a game, and offers them a comforting hug. This act suggests that Aubrey is attempting to console Lee or provide emotional support during a possibly difficult time. The intention here is not negative or contentious; rather, it’s a gesture of empathy and care.  Usually, receiving support and empathy after experiencing a setback like losing a game would lead to feelings of gratitude, comfort, or potentially a lessening of disappointment due to the encouragement received. Lee might still feel disappointed about the loss, but they might also feel appreciative of Aubrey's gesture or reassured that they are not alone in their struggle. However, humans are complex creatures with a wide range of emotional responses. If Lee's feelings of loss and disappointment were so strong that they twisted Aubrey's comforting gesture into something negative – if, for instance, Lee viewed Aubrey's consolation as patronizing, or a reminder of their defeat – then it is possible, though not typical, for Lee to feel resentment.  Furthermore, if Lee's competitive nature blocked their ability to accept the loss, they may feel resentment that Aubrey isn't taking their defeat seriously or doesn't \\"understand\\" their competitive drive. But this response would depend on the depth of Lee's competitiveness and their personal relationship with Aubrey.  In general, 'resentful' wouldn't be the first emotion we would typically expect from Lee in this situation, given Aubrey's supportive approach. Instead, it would imply a more nuanced psychological reaction that might not be the most common or expected one. Without additional context to suggest this, 'resentful' does not seem to be a valid answer. More commonly, Lee would likely feel comforted, grateful, or at least less alone after Aubrey's empathetic gesture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who wrote a letter to Lieutenant Colonel L'Estrange?, using the article: William Hulton, the chairman of the magistrates watching from the house on the edge of St Peter's Field, saw the enthusiastic reception that Hunt received on his arrival at the assembly, and it encouraged him to action. He issued an arrest warrant for Henry Hunt, Joseph Johnson, John Knight, and James Moorhouse. On being handed the warrant the Constable, Jonathan Andrews, offered his opinion that the press of the crowd surrounding the hustings would make military assistance necessary for its execution. Hulton then wrote two letters, one to Major Thomas Trafford, the commanding officer of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry Cavalry, and the other to the overall military commander in Manchester, Lieutenant Colonel Guy L'Estrange. The contents of both notes were similar: Sir, as chairman of the select committee of magistrates, I request you to proceed immediately to no. 6 Mount Street, where the magistrates are assembled. They consider the Civil Power wholly inadequate to preserve the peace. I have the honour, & c. Wm. Hulton. The notes were handed to two horsemen who were standing by. The Manchester and Salford Yeomanry were stationed just a short distance away in Portland Street, and so received their note first. They immediately drew their swords and galloped towards St Peter's Field. One trooper, in a frantic attempt to catch up, knocked down a woman in Cooper Street, causing the death of her son when he was thrown from her arms; two-year-old William Fildes was the first casualty of Peterloo.Sixty cavalrymen of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, led by Captain Hugh Hornby Birley, a local factory owner, arrived at the house from where the magistrates were watching; some reports allege that they were drunk. Andrews, the Chief Constable, instructed Birley that he had an arrest warrant which he needed assistance to execute. Birley was asked to take his cavalry to the hustings to allow the speakers to be removed; it was by then about 1:40 pm.

Answer choices: - sweating  - attract females  - Release energy  - repels females  - attract enemies  - attract males  - adding heat  - dangerous Answer:","output":"The substance that male dogs have in their urine to mark their territory primarily serves to attract females. When a male dog urinates and thus marks its territory, it's essentially leaving a message via its urine that carries a wealth of information such as the dog's health, age, and sexual status. Thus, the marked territories can be seen as advertisements to available females. The scent can be picked up by female dogs who can determine if the male dog is suitable for mating. So, while the act of marking territory does assert a canine's dominance over a particular area, it also aims to attract females for the prospect of reproduction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The very first Solvay Conference in 1911 was indeed devoted to \\"the theory of radiation and quanta\\". This conference marked a key event in the history of modern physics, bringing together many of the greatest scientific minds of that time to discuss and share ideas on the cutting-edge research of radiation and the newly emerging concept of quanta.  The Solvay Conference is a prestigious international conference that has been held every few years since 1911, organized by the International Solvay Institutes for Physics and Chemistry. It was founded by Belgian chemist and industrialist Ernest Solvay to foster exchanges and collaborations between top scientists from different countries. The conference gained international renown for its impact on the development of quantum physics and related fields. The first Solvay Conference was held in Brussels, Belgium, and featured some of the brightest scientific minds of that era. Among the attendees were notable physicists like Max Planck, who introduced the concept of quanta in 1900, Albert Einstein, who developed the theory of relativity, and Marie Curie, who conducted groundbreaking research in radioactivity. These, along with other notable participants like Henri Poincaré, Ernest Rutherford, and Hendrik Lorentz, contributed significantly to the discussions that took place during the conference. In the context of the early 20th century, the theory of radiation and quanta was a groundbreaking topic that had the potential to revolutionize the understanding of the physical world. The discussions at the conference focused on the new concepts proposed by Max Planck and Albert Einstein on the quantization of energy and the behavior of electromagnetic radiation. The conference also saw intense debates regarding the nature of atoms, the interaction of light with matter, and the thermodynamics of radiation. The outcome of the first Solvay Conference was instrumental in setting the stage for the development of quantum mechanics, a fundamental theory in physics that would eventually replace classical mechanics for microscopic systems. Crucial developments in our understanding of atomic structure, wave-particle duality, and the uncertainty principle can be traced back to the interactions and debates held during this historic conference. In summary, the answer that the first Solvay Conference in 1911 was devoted to \\"the theory of radiation and quanta\\" is accurate and highlights the importance of this event in shaping the course of modern physics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mount Cameroon, also known as Buea Mountain or Mongo ma Ndemi, is one of Africa’s most active volcanoes. It is situated in the Southwest region of Cameroon near the Gulf of Guinea coast. This stratovolcano has had several eruptions in the past, with the most significant ones occurring in 1999 and 2000. Mount Cameroon is characterized by swift and frequent eruptions, which are mainly effusive in nature. The eruptions are typically characterized by the outpouring of lava flows from fissures along the summit and flanks, leading to the construction of parasitic cones and lava domes. Pyroclastic flows are typically not a major hazard during eruptions. Instead, lava flows and ashfall pose risks to surrounding areas, including nearby towns and villages. The 2000 eruption started on May 28 and lasted for about two months, ending in July. This eruption was similar in nature to previous eruptions at Mount Cameroon, with lava flows spewing from fissures and numerous small earthquakes preceding the eruption. The seismic activity prompted the evacuation of nearly 5,000 people from the surrounding villages of Bokosso, Bakingili, Molyko, and Limbe. The eruption resulted in substantial damage to infrastructure, particularly around the town of Bakingili, which was directly in the path of the lava flow. Significant ashfall affected nearby towns and roads, causing respiratory issues for some residents and impacting air travel. Additionally, the eruption destroyed farmland and crops, leading to food shortages in some areas. Since the 2000 eruption, Mount Cameroon has not experienced another significant eruption. However, given its history of frequent eruptions and ongoing monitoring by scientists, it is likely that Mount Cameroon will erupt again in the future. As it stands now, researchers continue to study the volcano and its associated hazards, working on developing better predictive models in order to minimize the impact on human populations when the volcano inevitably erupts again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House.  The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports.  But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office.  Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers.  \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded.  \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.  The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea.

In this statement, the user is discussing the limited control one has over certain events, specifically mentioning that the entries which emerge due to geogenic processes, rather than through active management, cannot be influenced easily. Geogenic processes refer to natural geological processes that occur within the Earth’s systems, such as volcanic activity, erosion, and movement of tectonic plates. These processes can have a significant impact on the environment and the Earth's surface, often leading to various forms of natural occurrences like earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. The user acknowledges that, even with the best of intentions, it is extremely difficult to have any substantial influence on these occurrences once a trend reversal has taken place. A trend reversal refers to a situation where a process or activity experiences a significant change in direction, usually from an upward trajectory to a downward one, or vice versa. The user is highlighting the challenge of exerting control on geogenic processes, as their effects typically unfold over long periods of time, sometimes as long as 50 to 100 years. In summary, the statement emphasizes the limitation human beings have in controlling natural geological processes that occur beneath the Earth's surface, and stresses that even the best efforts might not be enough to influence these events once a trend reversal has occurred.

Is the premise \\"People standing on a beach, one under a green umbrella\\" true if \\"There are people outside.\\"?","output":"The premise \\"People standing on a beach, one under a green umbrella\\" does not necessarily follow or is not implicitly confirmed by the statement \\"There are people outside\\".  Let's take a look at each proposition in detail: 1. \\"There are people outside.\\" - This statement gives us the information that there are individuals located in an outdoor setting. However, no specific details about this outside location are offered. We cannot infer from this statement alone that they are at the beach. They could be anywhere outside – in a park, on a mountain, on a street, etc. 2. \\"People standing on a beach, one under a green umbrella\\" - This premise is more specific. It not only tells us about the location (a beach), which is an outdoor setting, but also gives more detailed information, like the presence of an umbrella (which is green) under which one person is standing. While it's possible that these two scenarios could describe the same circumstance, that connection cannot be made from the information given.  Both scenarios share the common element of people being outside, but the first lacks the specificity of the second. For the first statement to confirm the second, it would need to provide more information that aligns with the details given in the second statement.  Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot definitively say that the two statements are inherently connected or that one confirms the truth of the other. The statement \\"There are people outside\\" could apply to countless situations, and without additional descriptors or qualifications, we can’t conclude that those people are necessarily \\"standing on a beach, one under a green umbrella.\\"  The information presented in the second premise is not contradicted by the first, but it is not explicitly supported by it either. The two statements could be related, but they could just as likely be describing completely different situations.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Which poet enjoyed the  same status as important ministers in the court? , can you please find it?   The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam. In his court were eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars (Ashtadiggajas) of the literary assembly. The most famous among them were Allasani Peddana who held the honorific Andhrakavitapitamaha (lit, \\"father of Telugu poetry\\") and Tenali Ramakrishna, the court jester who authored several notable works.

Summarize this article: Senior judge Lord Glennie was examining the case of a woman who is alleged to have been a victim of domestic abuse. Lawyers acting for the man accused of attacking her had wanted to access the woman's medical records. She sought legal aid for representation at the hearing, but the Scottish government refused her application. That decision has been overturned by Lord Glennie, who ruled that the woman's human rights had been breached. The ruling has been welcomed as \\"very significant\\" by anti-rape campaigners, who said many victims did not come forward as they did not want their medical records to be accessed. They also said that these records were frequently used to look for mental health issues, which was a \\"a significant violation of their privacy\\". The woman, known in court documents as WF, is the alleged victim in five of the seven charges of assault and domestic abuse faced by a man in a case at a Highland sheriff court. As part of the accused's case, defence lawyers wanted to recover all medical, psychiatric and psychological files relating to the woman over a seven-year period. But the woman maintained that such a move would infringe her human rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects the right to privacy and family life. The woman sought legal advice, and an application was made to the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) to allow her to be represented in opposition to the recovery proceedings. To the world I epitomise the old cliche of \\"asking for it\\". I am the perfect imperfect rape victim. I was drunk. I was wearing a short skirt. I knew the man who attacked me. I willingly, albeit under false pretences, went back to his home. But nothing prepared me - or rather, no one prepared me - for the fact that my previous mental health records were going to be lambasted in a courtroom full of strangers. While cross examining me, the QC asked something that shocked me. He asked me if I had ever self-harmed in the past. I was confused. I was angry. I didn't understand. When I was a young teenager - around 13-years-old - I was bullied at high school. I was depressed. I resorted to self-harm to deal with my pain. I had only confided this detail to a school psychologist, maybe my doctor. I hadn't even told my own mother. But here, at the trial of my rapist - some seven or more years later - this incredibly personal information was being broadcast to all - journalists, the jury, the judge, and worst of all, the man who only five months prior had repeatedly raped me. Read more about Sarah Scott's ordeal But SLAB refused the application, with the woman being told that - unlike in England and Wales - there was no provision in Scotland for legal aid to be granted to enable her to oppose her records being accessed. The woman then turned to the Scottish Ministers, who can grant legal aid in circumstances not covered by the rules. But they also rejected the move, claiming that the interests of the alleged victim could be protected without the need for them to personally participate and be represented at the hearing. Lawyers acting for the woman sought a judicial review at the Court of Session, and argued that the Scottish government was preventing the woman from participating effectively in a case where own her own rights were involved. It was also maintained that without adequate safeguards to protect them, the risk of disclosure of confidential medical and psychiatric records would be another reason why sex assault victims would not report such incidents to the police. The woman was backed in her case by Rape Crisis Scotland, which said the medical records of alleged victims were increasingly being used in sexual offence prosecutions. Lawyers acting for the Scottish Ministers argued that the alleged victim had no present right to be heard. But in his written statement, Lord Glennie said: \\"That is wrong. There may be no express provision in any statute or any rule requiring intimation to be made on the complainer or requiring her to be given an opportunity to be heard. \\"But she has that right by virtue of Article 8 and the absence of any specific provision in a statute or in court rules cannot take away that right. \\"What is required is for the lack of any specific provision to be addressed by the appropriate rule-making body.\\" The judge added: \\"The appropriate course for this court is simply to reduce the decision, founded as it is on an error of law as to the complainer's right to be heard, leaving the Scottish Ministers to make a new decision on a correct legal basis.\\" Sandy Brindley of Rape Crisis Scotland said the ruling was a very significant step in protecting complainers' privacy. She added: \\"The Scottish government has a strong track record in addressing violence against women but on this issue we consider that they have taken the wrong approach. \\"No other woman should have to go through what the petitioner in this case has been through, just to have her views heard on such a fundamental breach of her privacy.\\" Summary:","output":"A senior judge in Scotland, Lord Glennie, has ruled that the country's government breached a woman's human rights by refusing to grant her legal aid for representation in a case where her medical records were sought by her alleged domestic abuser. The Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) had told the woman that there was no provision in Scotland, unlike in England and Wales, for granting legal aid in such situations. The woman was backed by Rape Crisis Scotland, which claimed that victims' medical records were increasingly being used in sexual offence prosecutions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In his lifetime, Ray had done a number of things for which he was not proud, things he'd like to see just as well stuffed down a dark hole. Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more. Conflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings. People liked to be listened to. The illusion of having a voice was almost as good as actually having one. Isn't that why people still bothered to go to the polls on election day and vote? And it worked on most people. This woman was not one of them. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is probably true about Ray? Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, it is probably true that Ray has a background involving certain actions he regrets and is sensitive about being judged unfairly. He seems to have a sense of morality, as he believes in doing some good things in difficult situations, like giving CPR to a dead woman to comfort her children. Ray also seems familiar with conflict de-escalation techniques, which could indicate that he works or has experience in a job or position where managing conflicts or dealing with people's grievances is important."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Salvador Abascal ( 1910 -- 2000 ) was a Mexican politician and leading exponent of Mexican synarchism . For a time the leader of the National Synarchist Union ( UNS ) , Abascal represented the orthodox Catholic tendency within the movement .  - Falangism was the political ideology of the Falange Española de las JONS and, afterwards, of the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (both known simply as the \\"Falange\\"), as well as derivatives of it in other countries. Falangism is widely considered a fascist ideology. Under the leadership of Francisco Franco, many of the radical elements of Falangism considered to be fascist were diluted and it largely became an authoritarian, conservative ideology connected with Francoist Spain. Opponents of Franco's changes to the party include former Falange leader Manuel Hedilla. Falangism places a strong emphasis on Catholic religious identity, though it has held some secular views on the Church's direct influence in society, as it believed that the state should have the supreme authority over the nation. Falangism emphasized the need for authority, hierarchy, and order in society. Falangism is anti-communist, anti-capitalist, anti-democratic, and anti-liberal, although under Franco, the Falange abandoned its original anti-capitalist tendencies, declaring the ideology to be fully compatible with capitalism.  - The National Synarchist Union is a Mexican political organization. It was historically a movement of the Roman Catholic extreme right, in some ways akin to clerical fascism and falangism, violently opposed to the left wing and secularist policies of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and its predecessor the National Revolutionary Party that governed Mexico from 1929 to 2000 and since 2012.

Three years earlier both of the little girl's parents had died and there was no one to take care of her. She was taken away to live in a government office. But finally she was taken in and adopted by a family and became their daughter. Ellen said that she noticed the difference in the child's life after she was placed in a permanent  home and thought that maybe she and her husband could help a child in a similar way. They decided to become temporary parents and to take a child into their home on the weekends when the real parents could not take care of him or her.

Step 2: The Discovery - Jack receives a peculiar case involving a series of disappearances, all of which leaves the victims bewildered and cannot recall the events during their vanishing hours. - Frustrated with the lack of answers, Jack starts investigating the correlation between the cases and stumbles upon the existence of the L.O.O.K.E.R Gun. Step 3: Conflict - As Jack further investigates, he uncovers Dr. Hargreaves' plan to use the L.O.O.K.E.R Gun to rob a highly secured bank, by immobilizing the security personnel and staff, rendering them unable to stop her or remember her actions. Step 4: Meeting the Antagonist - Jack confronts Dr. Hargreaves about her invention and intentions, but is shot by the L.O.O.K.E.R Gun himself. He subsequently loses his sense of time, giving Dr. Hargreaves enough time to escape and make final preparations for the heist. Step 5: The Climax - Jack, struggling with the debilitating effects of the L.O.O.K.E.R Gun, slowly puts the pieces of his shattered memory back together, recalls the plans for the bank robbery, and reports the crime to the authorities. - Simultaneously, Jack tries to find a way to reverse the gun's effects and recover his lost time. Step 6: The Showdown - Jack confronts Dr. Hargreaves again at the bank, this time being more prepared and cautious. A chase ensues, leading to a thrilling and intense battle between Jack and Dr. Hargreaves, both trying to gain the upper hand. Step 7: Resolution - Jack ultimately subdues Dr. Hargreaves and gains access to her research, finding the antidote to the L.O.O.K.E.R Gun's effects. Dr. Hargreaves is apprehended, and the gun's victims finally regain their sense of time. - Having saved the day and learned the importance of valuing time, Jack refocuses on rebuilding his life and career as a more compassionate and efficient private investigator.

Here are possible answers to this question: - fast food restaurant - vegetable market - ireland - produce market - dessert spot  I believe the correct choice is \\"fast food restaurant\\", here's why: A:","output":"Fast food restaurants are indeed the correct choice among the provided options when it comes to businesses that use lots of potatoes. Let me provide you with a detailed explanation as to why this is the case: 1. Fast food restaurant: The primary reason fast food restaurants use a significant number of potatoes is due to the high demand for various potato-based products, such as french fries, hash browns, and potato wedges, among others. These items are staple menu choices in fast food chains globally.  French fries, in particular, are one of the most popular fast food items, with McDonald's alone serving approximately 9 million pounds of fries daily worldwide. Besides using large quantities of potatoes, fast food chains contribute to potato farming's development, sustaining the demand for potatoes in the market. 2. Vegetable market: A vegetable market, although being a place where potatoes are sold, does not directly involve using potatoes. Instead, they act as a platform for vendors to sell various vegetables, including potatoes. While this makes them an essential part of the supply chain, they do not consume potatoes themselves. 3. Ireland: Ireland has historically been associated with potatoes due to the Great Famine that occurred in the 19th century. However, the term \\"Ireland\\" does not necessarily refer to a business that uses or consumes potatoes. Although potatoes remain a popular food in Ireland, the country is not a business itself. 4. Produce market: Similar to a vegetable market, a produce market offers an assortment of fresh fruits and vegetables, including potatoes. Despite its role in selling large quantities of potatoes, a produce market does not utilize potatoes in the same way a fast food restaurant does. 5. Dessert spot: Although some dessert spots might use potatoes as a unique and surprising ingredient in certain dishes, the use of potatoes in desserts is not as widespread as their use in fast food restaurants. Potatoes are not a primary ingredient or a staple item in most dessert menus, making this option less relevant than fast food restaurants. In conclusion, fast food restaurants not only consume a large number of potatoes to provide popular menu items but also significantly impact the demand for potatoes in farming and the market. As a result, \\"fast food restaurant\\" is the correct choice for a business that uses lots of potatoes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This is how he did it.","output":"Yes, a linguist would likely find the sentence \\"This is how he did it.\\" to be a valid English sentence grammatically. Let's break down the sentence to understand its grammatical structure and components. 1. Sentence Structure: The sentence follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order typically found in English sentences. SVO order is when the subject comes first (in this case, \\"This\\"), followed by the verb (\\"is\\"), and then the object (\\"how he did it\\"). This sentence structure allows the reader to easily comprehend the main idea being conveyed. 2. Subject: In this sentence, \\"This\\" acts as a pronoun and serves as the subject. It is referring to a specific, previously mentioned event or activity. Pronouns are used in place of nouns and help to avoid repetition and enhance clarity. 3. Verb: The verb in this sentence is \\"is,\\" which is a form of the verb \\"to be.\\" The verb \\"to be\\" is often utilized to establish a connection between the subject and the subsequent information provided in the sentence. In this case, it is linking the subject \\"This\\" to the description of how the action was performed (\\"how he did it\\"). 4. Object: The object in this sentence is the noun clause \\"how he did it.\\" This clause functions as an object to provide additional information about the action being referred to by the subject, \\"This.\\" The noun clause contains its own structure: \\"how\\" is an adverb modifying the verb \\"did,\\" \\"he\\" is a pronoun functioning as the subject, and \\"did\\" is the auxiliary verb indicating past tense. 5. Clarity and Coherence: The sentence is clear and concise, which are essential elements of a grammatically correct and effective sentence. The combination of the subject, verb, and object provides a complete thought and conveys the intended meaning to the reader. To summarize, a linguist would regard \\"This is how he did it.\\" as a valid English sentence grammatically due to its adherence to standard sentence structure, appropriate use of parts of speech, and the clarity and coherence of the message being conveyed. The sentence is easily understood and effectively communicates the information about the action or event referenced by the pronoun \\"This.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: A government-backed pensioner bond offering competitive rates of up to 4% interest is to be offered for a further three months, George Osborne has said. Article:","output":"Title: Government-Backed Pensioner Bond with 4% Interest Extended for Three Months Introduction: Chancellor George Osborne announced the extension of the government-backed pensioner bond for an additional three months, providing pensioners with competitive interest rates of up to 4%. This extension aims to benefit thousands of pensioners seeking a safe and lucrative investment opportunity while bolstering the economy. Background of the Pensioner Bond: Pensioner bonds, also known as “65+ Guaranteed Growth Bonds” were first introduced by the UK government in January 2015. These bonds are specifically designed for citizens aged 65 and above, allowing them to purchase fixed-rate savings bonds with relatively higher interest rates than those available in the market. The bonds were initially introduced as a one-year and three-year option, providing attractive returns on investment for a significant portion of the UK's aging population. Reasons for Extending the Bond Offer: Chancellor George Osborne stated that the extension of the pensioner bond for an additional three months was motivated by two primary objectives. The first objective is to ensure that the UK's aging population has access to safe and lucrative investment opportunities that yield higher returns than the average savings account. This not only benefits pensioners but also provides a significant financial cushion for those entering retirement. The second objective behind the extension is to stimulate the economy. By offering higher interest rates than the current market conditions, the government-backed pensioner bond attracts more investors, leading to increased savings and investments. This simultaneously supports the growth of the economy and the financial stability of pensioners during their retirement years. Features of the Government-backed Pensioner Bond: The major features of the government-backed pensioner bond include: 1. Eligibility: Pensioner bonds are exclusive to individuals aged 65 and above. This age-specific investment opportunity enables older individuals to secure a lucrative investment plan designed to cater to their unique financial requirements. 2. Interest Rates: The major attraction of the pensioner bond is its competitive interest rates, which offer up to 4% returns on investments. Considering the current economic climate, these interest rates are considerably higher than what traditional savings accounts and investment products offer. 3. Investment Tenure: Pensioner bonds are offered as a one-year and three-year investment option. Investors have the flexibility to choose their preferred investment tenure and plan their finances accordingly. 4. Security: Pensioner bonds are backed by the UK government, making them an extremely secure investment option. This is particularly important for pensioners seeking financial stability during their retirement years and looking for safe avenues to invest their hard-earned savings. Benefits of the Bond for Pensioners: The pensioner bond's primary benefit is its attractive interest rates, which offer higher returns than most savings accounts and investment opportunities in the market. This enables pensioners to maximize their financial security by investing in a risk-free, high-yield investment instrument. Additionally, pensioner bonds can help mitigate the impact of inflation as they offer higher returns than traditional savings accounts. For retirees dependent on a fixed income, investing in bonds could provide them with supplementary income that outpaces price increases and maintains their purchasing power. Conclusion: The extension of the government-backed pensioner bond signifies the government's commitment to prioritizing the financial stability of its aging population. As the UK witnesses an increasing number of individuals entering their retirement years, the provision of secure and lucrative investment opportunities like the pensioner bond can play a pivotal role in ensuring their financial security, well-being, and continued contribution to the growth and prosperity of the nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Results During 3 500 004 person years of follow-up between 2004 and 2013 (median 7.2 years), a total of 11 820 men and 8404 women died. Absolute mortality rates according to spicy food consumption categories were 6.1, 4.4, 4.3, and 5.8 deaths per 1000 person years for participants who ate spicy foods less than once a week, 1 or 2, 3 to 5, and 6 or 7 days a week, respectively. Spicy food consumption showed highly consistent inverse associations with total mortality among both men and women after adjustment for other known or potential risk factors. In the whole cohort, compared with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week, the adjusted hazard ratios for death were 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.96), 0.86 (0.80 to 0.92), and 0.86 (0.82 to 0.90) for those who ate spicy food 1 or 2, 3 to 5, and 6 or 7 days a week, respectively. Compared with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week, those who consumed spicy foods 6 or 7 days a week showed a 14% relative risk reduction in total mortality. The inverse association between spicy food consumption and total mortality was stronger in those who did not consume alcohol than those who did (P=0.033 for interaction). Inverse associations were also observed for deaths due to cancer, ischemic heart diseases, and respiratory diseases.      The beneficial effects of spices and their bioactive ingredients such as capsaicin have long been documented in experimental or small sized population studies. For example, an ecological study showed that populations with a higher consumption of spices have a lower incidence of cancer. 4 The ingestion of red pepper was found to decrease appetite and energy intake in people of Asian origin and white people and might reduce the risk of overweight and obesity. 5 6 In addition, the bioactive agents in spices have also shown beneficial roles in obesity, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal conditions, various cancers, neurogenic bladder, and dermatological conditions. 7 8 9 Moreover, spices exhibit antibacterial activity and affect gut microbiota populations, which in humans have been recently related to risks of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, liver cirrhosis, and cancer. 10 11 12 These data collectively suggest that spices may have a profound influence on morbidities and mortality in humans; however, the evidence relating daily consumption of spicy foods and total and disease specific mortality from population studies is lacking.      Spices have been an integral part of culinary cultures around the world and have a long history of use for flavoring, coloring, and preserving food, as well as for medicinal purposes. The increased use of spices as flavorings in foods is a major trend worldwide. 1 2 In China, chilli pepper is among the most popular spicy foods consumed nationwide. 3      Subgroup analyses were conducted separately among participants who did and did not report fresh chilli pepper as one of their commonly used spices. We compared both with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week. We also examined the associations of spicy food consumption with total mortality among prespecified baseline subgroups based on age (<50, 50 to 59, or ≥60), smoking status (regular smoker, or not), alcohol consumption (regular drinker, or not), level of physical activity (categorized using tertile cut-offs), and body mass index (<24.0, 24.0 to 27.9, or ≥28.0). The tests for interaction were performed by means of likelihood ratio tests, which involved comparing models with and without cross product terms between the baseline stratifying variable and spicy food consumption as an ordinal variable.      To examine the robustness of our findings, we also conducted several sensitivity analyses: additionally adjusting for occupation and household income; additionally adjusting for histories of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, peptic ulcer, and gallstone or cholecystitis; adjusting for a 13 level detailed smoking variable, which incorporated the information on amount of smoking in regular smokers and the time since quitting in former smokers, instead of a four level smoking variable; excluding participants dying during the first two years of follow-up; excluding participants who had diabetes at baseline; excluding participants who reported exclusive use of other spices instead of any types of chilli; stratifying analyses by rural or urban residence; and stratifying analyses by follow-up duration (<3 or ≥3 years).      Multivariate models were adjusted for established and potential risk factors for death: age (continuous, serving as the underlying timescale); sex (male or female); level of education (no formal school, primary school, middle school, high school, college, or university or higher); marital status (married, widowed, divorced or separated, or never married); alcohol consumption (non-drinker, occasional drinker, former drinker, or regular drinker); smoking status (never smoker, occasional smoker, former smoker, or regular smoker); physical activity in MET hours a day (continuous); body mass index (continuous); intake frequencies of red meat, fresh fruits, and vegetables (daily, 4-6 days/wk, 1-3 days/wk, monthly, or rarely or never); prevalent hypertension and diabetes at baseline (presence or absence); menopausal status (for women only, premenopausal, perimenopausal, or postmenopausal); and status of family history of cancer, heart attack, stroke, or diabetes (presence or absence). We adjusted for the family history variables only in the corresponding analysis of cause specific mortality.      We measured person years from baseline (2004–08) until the date of death, loss to follow-up, or 31 December 2013, whichever occurred first. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of mortality for spicy food consumption, with age as the underlying time scale. We accounted for the group specific effect of 10 survey sites on the hazard function by stratifying on the survey site variable in the Cox model.      Trained staff blinded to baseline information classified any deaths occurring among participants by using ICD-10 codes (international classification of diseases, 10th revision). The deaths were grouped into seven categories: cancer (C00-C97), ischemic heart diseases (I20-I25), cerebrovascular diseases (I60-I69), diabetes mellitus (E10-E14), diseases of the respiratory system (J00-J99), infections (A00-B99), and all other causes. Losses to follow-up in this study refer to participants whose permanent registered residence was no longer in the study area, who could not be contacted after at least three reasonable efforts within one year, or who could be contacted but their new residence was out of the jurisdiction of the regional coordinating center.      We ascertained vital status by means of linkage with local disease surveillance points system death registries 15 and residential records. To minimize the under-reporting of deaths and to identify participants who had moved permanently out of the study areas, we also carried out separate active follow-up annually by reviewing residential records, visiting local communities, or directly contacting participants. 14 The causes of death were sought chiefly from official death certificates that were supplemented, if necessary, by a review of the medical records or undertaking a verbal autopsy using a validated instrument for those with an ill defined or unknown cause of death reported. The electronic linkage to the national health insurance claim databases started in 2011, which has become an important means of follow-up and helped to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and phenotyping of reported conditions, outcome adjudication, and further data collection. Linkage to local health insurance databases has been achieved for about 95% of the participants in 2013. Participants from both urban and rural areas had similar proportions of successful linkage to health insurance databases. Linkage to local health insurance database was renewed annually. Participants who failed to be linked to local health insurance database were actively followed annually by staff to ascertain their status, including hospital admission, death, and moving out of the study area. Linkage to a local health insurance database has become an important supplementary way of ascertaining deaths.      At baseline, trained staff measured body weight, height, and blood pressure using calibrated instruments. Body mass index was calculated as weight (kg)/(height (m) 2 . A stepwise on-site testing of plasma glucose level was undertaken using the SureStep Plus meter (LifeScan; Milpitas, CA). Prevalent hypertension was defined as a measured systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more, a measured diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more, self reported diagnosis of hypertension, or self reported use of antihypertensive drugs at baseline. Prevalent diabetes was defined as a measured fasting blood glucose concentration of 7.0 mmol/L or more, a measured random blood glucose concentration of 11.1 mmol/L or more, or self reported diagnosis of diabetes.      We obtained covariates from the baseline questionnaire, including sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, education, occupation, household income, and marital status), lifestyle behaviors (alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, physical activity, and intakes of red meat, fresh fruits, and vegetables), personal health and medical history (hypertension, diabetes, chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, peptic ulcer, gallstones or cholecystitis, and menopausal status for women only), and information on family members, including biological parents and siblings who had had cancer, heart attack, stroke, or diabetes. The daily level of physical activity was calculated by multiplying the metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) value for a particular type of physical activity by hours spent on that activity per day and summing the MET hours for all activities. Habitual dietary intake in the past year was assessed by a qualitative food frequency questionnaire. A participant was considered as having a family history of a particular disease if they reported at least one first degree relative with the disease.      After completion of the baseline survey in July 2008, about 5% randomly chosen surviving participants in 10 survey sites were resurveyed during August and October of 2008. 14 To test the reproducibility of the frequency of spicy food consumption, we included 1300 participants who completed the same questionnaire twice at an interval of less than 1.5 years (median 1.4 years). Spearman’s coefficient for the correlation between the two questionnaires was 0.71, indicating that spicy food consumption was reported consistently.      In the baseline questionnaire we asked the participants “During the past month, about how often did you eat hot spicy foods?”: never or almost never, only occasionally, 1 or 2 days a week, 3 to 5 days a week, or 6 or 7 days a week. The participants who selected the last three categories were further asked “When you eat spicy foods, what are the main sources of spices usually used?” (multiple choices allowed fresh chilli pepper, dried chilli pepper, chilli sauce, chilli oil, and other or don’t know).      The China Kadoorie Biobank is a prospective cohort study of over 0.5 million adults from 10 geographically diverse areas across China; participants were enrolled between 2004 and 2008 and have been followed up ever since for morbidities and mortality. Further details of the China Kadoorie Biobank study have been described elsewhere. 13 14 Briefly, a total of 512 891 adults aged 30-79 years had valid baseline data—that is, completed questionnaire, physical measurements, and a written informed consent form.      Fig 2 Subgroup analysis of associations between consumption of spicy foods ≥6 days a week and total mortality according to potential baseline risk factors. Hazard ratios for total mortality are for comparison of men and women who ate spicy foods ≥6 days a week with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week. Risk estimates for other categories of spicy food consumption are shown in appendix table 2. Horizontal lines represent 95% confidence intervals      We also analyzed the associations between spicy food consumption and total mortality according to other potential baseline risk factors for death; the inverse associations between spicy food consumption and total mortality were generally similar across subgroups stratified according to age, smoking status, level of physical activity, and body mass index (all P values for interaction >0.05) (fig 2 ⇓ and appendix table 2). Significant differences across stratums were observed for alcohol consumption, with a stronger inverse association among participants who did not consume alcohol than those who did (P=0.033 for interaction).      Fig 1 Subgroup analysis of associations between consumption of spicy foods ≥6 days a week and total and cause specific mortality according to consumption of fresh chilli pepper. Hazard ratios for death from all causes and from specific causes are for comparison of men and women who ate spicy foods ≥6 days a week with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week. Appendix table 1 shows the risk estimates for other categories of spicy food consumption. Horizontal lines represent 95% confidence intervals      We further performed stratified analyses according to whether the participants reported using fresh chilli pepper as their predominant spice. We found that the inverse associations of daily spicy food consumption with death due to cancer, ischemic heart diseases, and diabetes seemed stronger in the fresh chilli group than in the non-fresh chilli group in the whole cohort of women and men, and the results were statistically significant in the fresh chilli group (fig 1 ⇓ and appendix table 1).      In the sensitivity analyses, the associations of spicy food consumption with total and cause specific mortality did not change appreciably with additional adjustment for occupation and household income; or additional adjustment for histories of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, peptic ulcer, and gallstone or cholecystitis; or adjustment for a 13 level detailed smoking variable instead of a four level smoking variable; or excluding participants dying during the first two years of follow-up; or excluding participants with prevalent diabetes at baseline; or excluding participants with exclusive use of other spices instead of any types of chilli (data not shown). The associations of spicy food consumption with total and cause specific mortality were consistently observed in participants from both rural and urban areas and for different follow-up durations (<3 or ≥3 years).      After multivariate adjustment, spicy food consumption was inversely associated with the risks of death due to cancer, ischemic heart diseases, and respiratory diseases in the whole cohort (table 2). No statistically significant heterogeneity was observed in the associations between spicy food consumption and cause specific mortality by sex (all P>0.05). Nevertheless, the associations seemed to be less evident in men than in women (table 3). In addition, more frequent consumption of spicy foods in women was also significantly associated with a reduced risk of death due to infections.      During a median follow-up of 7.2 years (interquartile range 1.84 years; total person years 3 500 004), we documented 11 820 deaths among men and 8404 deaths among women. Absolute mortality rates according to spicy food consumption categories were 6.1, 4.4, 4.3, and 5.8 deaths per 1000 person years for participants who ate spicy foods less than once a week and 1 or 2, 3 to 5, and 6 or 7 days a week, respectively. Age adjusted and multivariate adjusted analyses showed a statistically significant inverse association between spicy food consumption and total mortality. In the whole cohort, compared with participants who ate spicy foods less than once a week, the adjusted hazard ratios for death were 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.96) for those who ate spicy foods 1 or 2 days a week, 0.86 (0.80 to 0.92) for 3 to 5 days a week, and 0.86 (0.82 to 0.90) for 6 or 7 days a week (table 2 ⇓ ). Compared with participants who ate spicy foods less than once a week, those who consumed spicy foods 6 or 7 days a week showed a 14% relative risk reduction in total mortality. The multivariate adjusted hazard ratios for total mortality among men, compared with men who ate spicy foods less than once a week, were 0.90 (0.83 to 0.98) for those who ate spicy food 1 or 2 days a week, 0.90 (0.83 to 0.99) for 3 to 5 days, and 0.90 (0.85 to 0.96) for 6 or 7 days a week; the respective hazard ratios among women were 0.88 (0.79 to 0.98), 0.78 (0.69 to 0.88), and 0.81 (0.75 to 0.87) (table 3 ⇓ ). There was no heterogeneity between men and women in any of the associations (P=0.723).      Table 1 ⇓ presents the age and site adjusted baseline characteristics of the participants according to the categories of spicy food consumption. Compared with participants who consumed spicy foods less frequently (3 to 5 days a week or less), those who consumed spicy foods almost every day were more likely to be rural residents, more likely to smoke tobacco and consume alcohol, and more frequently to consume red meat, vegetables, and fruits. Fresh and dried chilli peppers were the most commonly used types of spices in those who reported consuming spicy foods weekly (table 1).      Discussion      In this large prospective study, we observed an inverse association between consumption of spicy foods and total mortality, after adjusting for potential confounders. Compared with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week, those who consumed spicy foods almost every day had a 14% lower risk of death. Inverse associations were also observed for deaths due to cancer, ischemic heart diseases, and respiratory diseases. The associations were consistent in men and women.      Strengths and limitations of this study The strengths of this study include a large sample size, a prospective cohort design, and careful control for established and potential risk factors for death. This study does have a few limitations. Consumption of spicy foods may be correlated with other dietary habits and lifestyle behaviors. For example, in Chinese cuisine the cooking of chilli pepper and the production of chilli sauce and oil usually requires more oil, and intake of pungent foods may be accompanied by an increased intake of carbohydrate-rich foods such as rice to relieve the burning sensation. However, the lack of detailed dietary information in this study limited our ability to comprehensively adjust for total energy intake and other specific dietary factors. In addition, spicy food consumption may be correlated with socioeconomic status,16 which we partly controlled for in our analyses. Residual confounding by other unmeasured or unknown biological and social factors was still possible, although we carefully adjusted for several established and potential risk factors for death. However, residual confounding by the aforementioned or other confounding factors might have attenuated the inverse associations between spicy food consumption and mortality toward the null. Although chilli pepper was the most commonly used spice in our population, the use of other types of spices usually increases as the use of chilli pepper increases. Thus the health benefits of these spices apart from chilli pepper may also contribute to the observed inverse associations. Reverse causality is another possible explanation for our findings because people with chronic disease might abstain from spicy foods. However, we excluded participants who had cancer, heart disease, or stroke at baseline. Moreover, the results remained largely unchanged when we excluded participants dying during the first two years of follow-up from analyses or additionally adjusted for several major digestive system diseases that might deter people from consuming spicy foods. Although we employed multiple ways to maximize death ascertainment of participants, under-reporting of deaths might have occurred. However, the proportion of participants under-reported on death status would not depend on the levels of spicy food consumption. Considering that specificity of outcome detection is nearly perfect and sensitivity is lower than 100% in both exposure groups, outcome misclassification would produce little bias in estimating hazard ratio.17 The consumption of spicy foods was self reported; therefore, some measurement error is inevitable. The questionnaire on spicy food consumption used in our study has not yet been validated directly; however, previous studies have shown that using similar food frequency questionnaires could produce valid estimates of food consumption in a Chinese population.18 In addition, in a prospective study design, measurement errors may be non-differential and the measure of association is more likely to be biased toward the null. The consumption of spicy foods reported for a short period may not necessarily reflect the long term patterns of consumption. However, repeated collections of dietary information averaged 1.4 years in our cohort and have shown that the reported intakes of dietary factors including spicy foods were highly consistent over time. In addition, information was not available on how spicy foods were prepared and cooked. Such information would have enabled us to perform further analyses on the relation between spicy food consumption and mortality more extensively.      Comparison with other studies and potential mechanism Our study is the first to analyze the association between daily consumption of spicy foods and mortality in a prospective cohort. Our findings are in line with previous evidence showing potential protective effects of spicy foods on human health. Capsaicin is the main active component of chilli pepper. The beneﬁcial roles of capsaicin have been extensively reported in relation to anti-obesity, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antihypertensive effects, and in improving glucose homeostasis, largely in experimental or small sized population studies.7 8 9 Additionally, the antimicrobial function of spices, including chilli pepper, has long been recognized,3 19 and such a property may have an important effect on the gut microbiota in humans. In recent years, rapidly emerging evidence has implicated gut microbiota as a novel and important metabolic factor that affects the health of the host,20 and several studies in humans have related abundance, composition, and metabolites of gut microbiota to risk of obesity,21 22 23 diabetes,12 24 liver cirrhosis,11 and cardiovascular disease.10 25 However, how spicy foods and their bioactive ingredients may affect the composition and activity of gut microbiota has yet to be further investigated. In addition, our study suggested a threshold of around 1 or 2 days a week of spicy food consumption, beyond which the risk for mortality did not decrease further. Possible mechanisms might involve the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of bioactive ingredients and nutrients of spicy foods26; but further studies are needed to verify our findings. Our study indicated that spicy food consumption was particularly related to the reduced risk of mortality due to cancer, ischemic heart diseases, and respiratory diseases. Several previous epidemiological studies have suggested protective effects of capsaicin consumption on stomach or gallbladder cancer,7 9 27 although such effects were not consistently observed. The cardiovascular system is rich in capsaicin sensitive sensory nerves, which have an extensive role in regulating cardiovascular function.28 The antioxidant and antiplatelet properties of capsaicin and the important role of capsaicin in regulating energy metabolism may also contribute to its beneﬁcial effects on the cardiovascular system.7 9 28 29 30 31 32 Less well known are the possible mechanisms underlying the potentially beneficial effect of spicy foods on respiratory diseases. However, the anti-obesity, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antihypertensive effects of spicy foods would generally protect all these specific systems. Because the number of deaths from infections was relatively small, our study might not have had enough statistical power to rule out a possible relation between spicy food consumption and infections specific mortality. Compared with non-fresh spicy foods such as dried chilli pepper, chilli sauce, or chilli oil, fresh chilli pepper is richer in bioactive ingredients, including capsaicin, vitamin C, and other nutrients such as vitamin A, K, and B6, and potassium. In our stratified analyses we found that the inverse associations of spicy food consumption with certain cause specific deaths (cancer, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes) seemed to be stronger in those who consumed fresh chilli pepper than those who consumed non-fresh spicy foods. These data suggest that some of the bioactive ingredients are likely to be effective in driving the observed associations. Interestingly, a statistically significant inverse association between the daily consumption of spicy foods and diabetes, which was not observed in the whole cohort, was found in the subgroup that consumed fresh chilli pepper. This was consistent with previous evidence showing that dietary capsaicin may provide beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis.33 However, it remains unclear whether other nutrients abundant in fresh chilli pepper also have roles in lowering the risk of mortality. Intriguingly, we found that the inverse association was stronger in those who did not than did drink alcohol. Alcohol consumption has been related to an increased risk of mortality in some but not all previous studies.34 35 36 Even though moderate alcohol consumption has been related to a reduced risk of certain chronic diseases such as diabetes, moderately high alcohol consumption may increase energy intake37 and has been associated with increased mortality.38 In addition, alcohol intake also affects the metabolism of gut microbiota.39 40 Even though the precise mechanism remains unclear, the interaction between spicy foods and alcohol intake is biologically possible. We acknowledge that disease status might affect both alcohol and spicy food intakes, and we excluded participants with chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, or stroke at baseline from our analyses. Further investigations are warranted to validate our findings and explore the mechanisms. ||||| TIME Health For more, visit TIME Health      People who love chili peppers might be eating their way to a longer life, according to a new study published in The BMJ.      “We know something about the beneficial effects of spicy foods basically from animal studies and very small-sized human studies,” says study author Lu Qi, associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. Some of those preliminary studies have found that spicy food and their active components—like capsaicin, the compound found in chili peppers—might lower inflammation, improve metabolic status and have a positive effect on gut bacteria and weight, he says.      But human evidence remains scant. So Qi and a team of researchers looked at questionnaire data from about half a million adults all across China who participated in the China Kadoorie Biobank study between 2004-2008. Each person in the study reported their health status, alcohol consumption, spicy food consumption, main source of chili intake (fresh or dried, in a sauce or in an oil) as well as meat and vegetable consumption.      The researchers followed up with them about seven years later. Compared to people who ate spicy foods less than once a week, people who ate them just once or twice a week had a 10% reduced risk of death. Bumping up the spice consumption didn’t make much of a difference; those who ate spicy food 3-7 days a week were at 14% reduced risk of death compared to the most spice-averse group.      Eating chili-rich spicy foods was also linked to a lower risk of death from certain diseases, including cancer, ischemic heart diseases and respiratory diseases, they found. Further analysis revealed that fresh chili had a stronger protective effect against death from those diseases.      More research is needed to make any causal case for the protective effects of chili—this does not prove that the spicy foods were the reason for the health outcomes—but Qi finds this observational research valuable. “It appears that increasing your intake moderately, just to 1-2 or 3-5 times a week, shows very similar protective effect,” he says. “Just increase moderately. That’s maybe enough.”      MORE: 3 Reasons You Should Eat More Spicy Food |||||","output":"A study published in The BMJ has found that frequent consumption of spicy foods, especially fresh chili, has been linked to a lower risk of death.

I was first introduce to this place almost over 5 years ago and it started out great but I think I might have to break up with Teharu.   I'm more interested in the food so I'll start with that. I always get my usual when I go here and it's always Hawaiian, Vegas, Dragon, and Bake scallop. Now I live in East Mesa so it is a good 30 minutes drive to get here and let me tell you, it used to be worth it. The last 5 times I've been here has been a miss. Vegas roll was always cold, kind of defeat the whole purpose of having a deep fried roll? No? The Hawaiian roll, which is spicy tuna roll with tuna on top and spicy mayo is always unbearably spicy because I think they are trying to mask away fishy flavour since their fish isn't the greatest of quality, which I knew for the price wasn't going to be the greatest already so when it's extremely spicy, then i can't eat it so...?  Now what annoys me is the bake scallop because that was my absolute favorite but lately it's always been disgusting. Like it has a pee smell on the scallop so when you eat it, you feel like your eating someone's piss.   I never get to try new rolls anymore because the ones on the belt most of the time looks dried and like it's been there since they opened up for the day. And there's usually 1 left, what's so hard about replenishing it? Or do they wait for that one customer who just eats anything to eat it before they put out more? That's another thing that erks me, if you're a conveyer belt sushi, shouldn't you have someone dedicated to constantly stock the belt with a variety of sushi so that customers can grab? Lately it seems that they focus on orders more and then the belt becomes empty and sad.  When can the price of something stop being accountable for the quality you get? Yeah it's cheap but when can we stop saying, oh for the price it's not bad. And this is why restaurants continue to lack and not improve.   Oh and for the waiters and waitresses there, I'm not even going to waste my time writing about them because the don't bother wasting their time serving me.   So long story short.

The reviewer expresses concerns about their favorite rolls being consistently disappointing in recent visits, specifically mentioning issues with temperature, spiciness, and an unpleasant smell in the Bake Scallop roll. The review also addresses the lack of new rolls and their dissatisfaction with the conveyor belt sushi system, as they observe that the sushi on the belt appears old and not replenished frequently. The reviewer questions the price-quality relationship, indicating that while the price is low, they believe there should be limits to the compromises made in terms of food quality. They suggest that the \\"for the price it's not bad\\" mentality allows restaurants like this one to continue offering subpar dining experiences. Lastly, the reviewer briefly mentions poor service from the waitstaff at the restaurant but chooses not to elaborate on it, implying that it adds to the overall negative sentiments about the place.

She is transferred to the homicide division and promoted to the rank of inspector. Her deceased father's former partner, John Mills (Samuel L. Jackson), serves as her proud mentor. Shepard finds that she might once again have to prove herself in a department that takes no prisoners. When one of her former one-night stands is murdered, Shepard and her new partner, Mike Delmarco (Andy GarcÃ­a), are assigned to the case. Shepard, who has a drinking problem, soon falls under suspicion. Three more murders follow, each victim having had a relationship with her. Shepard begins to experience a mental breakdown, blacking out for increasingly long periods of time. Her father, a police patrolman, had gone on a killing spree back in the 1970s and then murdered her mother. She begins to fear that she has the same violent tendencies and that she has been committing murder in her disoriented state. Shepard finds out that Mills is the killer. He killed all of her lovers, as well as her parents, because he considered it his mission to prevent her growing up to be a dissolute woman like her mother. As her father's partner, Mills had felt the responsibility to inform him that his wife was a nymphomaniac, which drove him insane. As he had an illicit affair with Shepard's mother, Mills felt the need to kill her lovers. Also ashamed that he destroyed his partner's marriage and drove him insane, Mills decided to put him out of his misery by killing him. Shepard secretly transmits Mills' confession on a mobile phone, allowing her old partner to track them down.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of Albrecht the Elder's son?, using the article: Albrecht the Elder was 62 or 63  when his panel was painted early in 1490. Barbara's portrait may have been completed soon after, when she would have been around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, and would soon leave for Nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons Dürer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older.The sitters are presented in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.Albrecht the Elder's panel is usually, but not always, thought to..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"Considering the information provided in the article, the son of Albrecht the Elder is not explicitly named. However, we can deduce that their son is Albrecht Dürer, a famous painter, as he completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut and would soon travel as a journeyman painter to Nuremberg, which are known biographical details of Albrecht Dürer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Karen Horney was born Karen Danielsen on 16 September 1885 in Blankenese, Germany, near Hamburg. Her father, Berndt Wackels Danielsen (1836-1910), was Norwegian but had German citizenship. He was a ship's captain in the merchant marine, and a Protestant traditionalist (his children nicknamed him \\"the Bible-thrower\\", as he did indeed throw Bibles). Her mother, Clotilde, nee van Ronzelen (1853-1911), known as \\"Sonni\\", was also Protestant, of Dutch origin. Horney, together with fellow psychoanalyst Alfred Adler, formed the Neo-Freudian discipline.  While Horney acknowledged and agreed with Freud on many issues, she was also critical of him on several key beliefs.  Like many who held opposing views with Freud, Horney felt that sex and aggression were not the primary constituents for determining personality. Horney, along with Adler, believed there were greater influences on personality through social occurrences during childhood, rather than just repressed sexual passions. The two focused more on how the conscious mind plays a role in human personality, not just subconscious repression. Freud's notion of \\"penis envy\\" was particularly subject to criticism, as well. She thought Freud had merely stumbled upon women's jealousy of men's generic power in the world. Horney accepted that penis envy might occur occasionally in neurotic women, but stated that \\"womb envy\\" occurs just as much in men: Horney felt that men were envious of a woman's ability to bear children. The degree to which men are driven to success may be merely a substitute for the fact that they cannot carry, nurture and bear children. Horney also thought that men were envious of women because they fulfill their position in society by simply \\"being\\", whereas men achieve their manhood according to their ability to provide and succeed.  Horney was bewildered by psychiatrists' tendency to place so much emphasis on the male sexual organ. Horney also reworked the Freudian Oedipal complex of the sexual elements, claiming that the clinging to one parent and jealousy of the other was simply the result of anxiety, caused by a disturbance in the parent-child relationship.  Despite these variances with the prevalent Freudian view, Horney strove to reformulate Freudian thought, presenting a holistic, humanistic view of the individual psyche which placed much emphasis on cultural and social differences worldwide.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Why did she believe this?","output":"Karen Horney believed that influences on personality came more from social occurrences during childhood and conscious mind, rather than just repressed sexual passions. She thought that focusing only on sex and aggression was not enough to explain human personality. Horney and Adler paid more attention to how people's thoughts and experiences while growing up affected their personalities. They believed that understanding individuals required considering their culture and social differences as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What capsule showcased at the National Air and Space Museum was flown by the first American to orbit the Earth? Answer:","output":"The capsule showcased at the National Air and Space Museum that was flown by the first American to orbit the Earth is the 'Friendship 7' Mercury capsule. This historic space capsule was piloted by none other than astronaut John Glenn, who became the first American to orbit Earth on February 20, 1962. The 'Friendship 7' Mercury capsule is a significant artifact in the history of spaceflight as it is intimately connected with one of the critical milestones in the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union - the first human orbital flight by an American. John Glenn's mission on board the Friendship 7 placed the United States into an international competition with the Soviet Union, only a few months after Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin's historic orbital flight. This flight was part of Project Mercury, the first human spaceflight program of the United States, running from 1958 through 1963. With regards to the capsule itself, the Friendship 7 is a small, cone-shaped spacecraft with a cylindrical section at the rear. It measures just over 9 feet in height and has a maximum diameter of 6.5 feet. The nose cone containing the parachute system is housed in the cylindrical part of the spacecraft, and the astronaut sat in the cone-shaped section.  The spacecraft had very limited room, only enough for a single astronaut. The astronaut had to sit with his legs drawn up, in a sort of half-reclining position. The control panel, located right in front of the astronaut, included the main instrument panel, with all sorts of dials, gauges, warning lights, and switches. Among the innovative features of the spacecraft was its heat shield made of material that would burn away and thus dissipate reentry heat (a principle named \\"ablative cooling\\"). The spacecraft was also designed to remain in one attitude without any adjustments by the astronaut. The Friendship 7 flight lasted just under five hours and orbited the Earth three times, reaching a maximum altitude of approximately 162 miles and an orbital velocity of 17,500 miles per hour. Today, the 'Friendship 7' Mercury capsule is a prized exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., serving as a poignant reminder of the early era of human spaceflight and its milestone achievements. It stands as a testament to American innovation and courage in the face of the unknown, representing a significant chapter in the history of human exploration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The place was nearly empty when I carried Mia inside, just one couple and their kids sitting in a circle in the corner. The parents  glanced up at us, then went back to praying quietly. The kids stared at the floor the whole time. I dropped Mia into a chair at the nurses' station and waited. Behind the glass wall in front of me, three nurses were talking about their various ex-husbands. It sounded like the same guy to me. I was still waiting for them to figure this out when one of them came over and asked, \\"What's the problem?\\" \\"No problem,\\" I said. \\"I just want to drop her off.\\" We both looked at Mia. A string of drool slowly slipped from her chin to her chest. \\"Has she been drinking?\\" the nurse asked. \\"I'm not really sure,\\" I said. The nurse looked back at me. \\"You're not really sure? Now what does that mean?\\" \\"I don't know,\\" I said. \\"I found her. I thought maybe I could leave her here.\\" \\"Sure, we'll just have to fill out the paperwork for that,\\" the nurse said. She smiled at the other nurses when she said it, and I couldn't tell if she was joking or not. She had me go through Mia's pockets, but all I could find was a piece of paper with an address written on it. Five Crossings. I couldn't find her ID anywhere. The nurse entered my name and address on a form, then took us down the hall to another room. What seemed like hours later, an old, red-faced doctor finally came in. He glanced at Mia and then washed his hands in the sink. \\"You the father or the boyfriend?\\" he asked. \\"Neither,\\" I said. \\"I've only just met her.\\" I couldn't take my eyes off the garbage can in the corner.

A: The answer is:","output":"Science is a process of knowing about the natural universe through two main actions: Observation and Experimentation. 1. Observation: This is the process of gathering information about natural phenomena around us. It involves using our senses or specialized tools and instruments to monitor and study objects, events, or processes in nature. Observations can be qualitative, where we describe characteristics or properties, or quantitative, where we measure specific quantities or values. Systematic observations form the basis for forming hypotheses, which are testable explanations for the observed phenomena. 2. Experimentation: This is the systematic testing of hypotheses by manipulating variables under controlled conditions. In an experiment, the researcher typically designs a controlled environment where one or more independent variables are manipulated to observe the effects on a dependent variable. The researcher then records the data, which is analyzed and used to draw conclusions. This helps in verifying, refuting, or refining the hypothesis, ultimately contributing to the development of scientific theories. These two actions work together in an iterative process, as new observations may lead to new hypotheses and experiments, while experiments may prompt further observations. This systematic approach, known as the scientific method, allows scientists to gain an ever-evolving understanding of the natural universe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Every sad moment is truly moving, every light moment makes me smile. This truly is one of the best films I have ever seen and I wish there were more films like it.

He was born and educated in Scotland but moved to London, where he wrote a number of successful novels and plays. There he met the Llewelyn Davies boys, who inspired him to write about a baby boy who has magical adventures in Kensington Gardens (included in \\"The Little White Bird\\"), then to write \\"Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\\", a \\"fairy play\\" about an ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have adventures in the fantasy setting of Neverland.  - Neverland is a fictional location featured in the works of J. M. Barrie and those based on them. It is an imaginary faraway place, where Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, the Lost Boys and other mythical creatures and beings live. Although not all people who come to Neverland cease to age, its best known resident famously refused to grow up, and it is often used as a metaphor for eternal childhood (and childishness), immortality, and escapism. It was first introduced as \\"the Never Never Land\\" in the theatre play \\"Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\\" by Scottish writer J. M. Barrie, first staged in 1904.  - Immortality is eternal life, the ability to live forever. At least one species has potential biological immortality: \\"Turritopsis dohrnii\\".  - Escapism is the avoidance of unpleasant, boring, arduous, scary, or banal aspects of daily life. It can also be used as a term to define the actions people take to help relieve persisting feelings of depression or general sadness.  - The Little White Bird is a British novel by J. M. Barrie, ranging in tone from fantasy and whimsy to social comedy with dark, aggressive undertones. It was published in November 1902, by Hodder & Stoughton in the UK and Scribner's in the US, although the latter had released it serially in the monthly \\"Scribner's Magazine\\" from August to November. The book attained prominence and longevity thanks to several chapters written in a softer tone than the rest of the book, which introduced the character and mythology of Peter Pan. In 1906, those chapters were published separately as a children's book, Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens.  - Childhood is the age span ranging from birth to adolescence. According to Piaget's theory of cognitive development, childhood consists of two stages: preoperational stage and concrete operational stage. In developmental psychology, childhood is divided up into the developmental stages of toddlerhood (learning to walk), early childhood (play age), middle childhood (school age), and adolescence (puberty through post-puberty). Various childhood factors could affect a person's attitude formation.  - A mermaid is a legendary aquatic creature with the head and upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.  - The works of J. M. Barrie about Peter Pan feature many memorable characters . The numerous adaptations and sequels to those stories feature many of the same characters , and introduce new ones . Most of these strive for continuity with Barrie 's work , developing a fairly consistent cast of characters living in Neverland and the real - world settings of Barrie 's stories .  - Wendy is a given name generally given to females in English-speaking countries.  - Peter Pan is a character created by Scottish novelist and playwright J. M. Barrie. A free spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of Neverland as the leader of the Lost Boys, interacting with fairies, pirates, mermaids, Native Americans, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland. In addition to two distinct works by Barrie, the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include a 1953 animated film, a 2003 dramatic/live-action film, a TV series and many other works.  - Kensington Gardens, once the private gardens of Kensington Palace, are among the Royal Parks of London. They gardens are shared by the City of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and sit immediately to the west of Hyde Park, in western central London. The gardens cover an area of 270 acres. The open spaces of Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Green Park and St. James's Park together form an almost continuous \\"green lung\\" in the heart of London. Kensington Gardens are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.   - The Davies boys (the family only used the double surname Llewelyn Davies in formal contexts) were the sons of Arthur (18631907) and Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (18661910), the daughter of the French-born cartoonist and writer George du Maurier and sister of actor Gerald du Maurier. The boys were the first cousins of Gerald's daughter, the author Daphne du Maurier. They were the inspiration for J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan, in which several of the characters were named after them.  - Tinker Bell (Tink for short), is a fictional character from J. M. Barrie's 1904 play \\"Peter Pan\\" and its 1911 novelization \\"Peter and Wendy\\". She has appeared in multiple film and television adaptations of the Peter Pan stories, in particular the 1953 animated Walt Disney picture \\"Peter Pan\\". She also appears in the official sequel \\"Peter Pan in Scarlet\\" by Geraldine McCaughrean commissioned by Great Ormond Street Hospital as well as the \\"Peter and the Starcatchers\\" book series by Ridley Pearson and Dave Barry.   - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Thuringia: The landscapes of Thuringia are quite diverse. The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the 3000 km² wide Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): Dün, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffhäuser, Hohe Schrecke, Schmücke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, Hörselberge and Hainich. Within the Basin the smaller hill chains Fahner Höhe and Heilinger Höhen. South of the Thuringian Basin is the Land's largest mountain range, marked by the Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highland in the middle and the Franconian Forest in the south-east. Most of this range is forested and the Großer Beerberg (983 m) is Thuringia's highest mountain. To the south-west, the Forest is followed up by Werra river valley, dividing it from the Rhön Mountains in the west and the Grabfeld plain in the south. Eastern Thuringia, commonly described as the area east of Saale and Loquitz valley, is marked by a hilly landscape, rising slowly from the flat north to the mountainous south. The Saale in the west and the Weiße Elster in the east are the two big rivers running from south to north and forming densely settled valleys in this area. Between them lies the flat and forested Holzland in the north, the flat and fertile Orlasenke in the middle and the Vogtland, a hilly but in most parts non-forested region in the south. The far eastern region (east of Weiße Elster) is the Osterland or Altenburger Land along Pleiße river, a flat, fertile and densely settled agricultural area.

As far as we know, the earliest cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4. Bach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August. He initially concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. He was promoted to Konzertmeister on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the Schlosskirche. The first cantatas he composed in the new position were Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, for Palm Sunday, Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 for Jubilate Sunday, and Erschallet, ihr Lieder, BWV 172, for Pentecost. Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet, Salomo Franck, they contain recitatives and arias. When Johann Samuel Drese, the Kapellmeister (director of music), died in 1716, Bach hoped in vain to become his successor. Bach looked for a better position and found it as Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. However, the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience. He was released on 2 December 1717.In Köthen, Bach found an employer who was an enthusiastic musician himself. The court was Calvinist, therefore Bach's work from this period was mostly secular, including the orchestral suites, the cello suites, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and the Brandenburg Concertos. He composed secular cantatas for the court for occasions such as New Year's Day and the prince's birthday, including Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV...

Process:  - A red giant burns mass - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains - This inner core is known as a white dwarf.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose No bats in the area happens, how will it affect the inner core is smaller.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To examine the effect of the perturbation hypothesis on the process, we need to consider each step and determine if the presence or absence of bats in the area can influence or be connected to any of them.  Step 1: A red giant burns mass Justification: Bats are not involved in the process of a red giant burning mass. The burning process occurs due to nuclear fusion within the star and is not influenced by external elements like the presence or absence of bats.  Step 2: This mass creates high core temperatures Justification: Again, the creation of high core temperatures is not related to the presence or absence of bats. High core temperatures are a result of the nuclear fusion process within the star.  Step 3: The mass decreases Justification: The decrease in mass is a natural result of the nuclear fusion process and is not influenced by the presence or absence of bats in the area.  Step 4: The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center Justification: The inability to fuse carbon and oxygen is due to the internal processes within the star. It is not related to or influenced by external factors like the presence or absence of bats. Step 5: The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers Justification: The lack of gravity to hold the outside layers is an internal issue within the star. It is not related to or influenced by external factors like the presence or absence of bats. Step 6: The layers break away Justification: The layers breaking away is a result of the previous steps and the internal processes within the star. It is not related to or influenced by external factors like the presence or absence of bats. Step 7: Only the inner core remains Justification: The remaining inner core is again a result of the internal processes within the star. It is not related to or influenced by external factors like the presence or absence of bats. Step 8: This inner core is known as a white dwarf Justification: The naming and classification of the white dwarf are related to the properties and characteristics of the star. It is not related to or influenced by external factors like the presence or absence of bats. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the perturbation hypothesis of \\"no bats in the area\\" does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of a red giant transforming into a white dwarf. The processes involved in this transformation are related to the internal workings of the star and are not influenced by external factors such as the presence or absence of bats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The hypothesis, \\"Those aren't good reasons to promote them as safe,\\" also highlights that the reasons are inadequate to support the assertion of an item being safe.

What can I do to not feel depressed and like a stagnant human being when and in the hours after I wake up? Do those questions have the same meaning? OPT: (1). no (2). yes","output":"1. Is it bad when I wake up, walk to the hallway and feel like falling over and my eyes get blurry? Feeling like you're falling over and experiencing blurry vision upon waking up and walking to the hallway may be indicative of a health concern that requires attention. There are several potential causes for these symptoms, and it is essential to understand the possible reasons to address them effectively. Potential causes: a. Dehydration: Your body may be dehydrated after a long sleep, resulting in dizziness and blurry vision. Make sure to drink enough water to keep your body adequately hydrated. b. Low Blood Pressure: Sudden changes in position, such as getting up from lying down, may lead to a temporary drop in blood pressure called orthostatic hypotension. This causes dizziness and imbalance in some individuals. c. Low Blood Sugar: Low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia, can also produce dizziness, confusion, and blurry vision upon waking up. d. Sleep Apnea: This sleep disorder causes your breathing to stop and start during sleep. The interrupted oxygen supply can cause dizziness and other symptoms. e. Inner Ear Problems: Conditions such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) or Meniere's disease can cause dizziness and balance issues upon waking up. Consulting a healthcare professional is recommended to diagnose and address the specific cause of these symptoms.  2. What can I do to not feel depressed and like a stagnant human being when and in the hours after I wake up? To combat feelings of depression and stagnation in the morning, consider implementing the following strategies: a. Establish a regular sleep schedule: Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day helps regulate your internal clock, leading to improved mood and energy levels. b. Engage in physical activity: Exercise releases endorphins that can improve mood and alleviate depression. Incorporate physical activity into your morning routine, such as stretching, walking, or light exercise. c. Practice mindfulness: Morning meditation, deep breathing, or journaling can help you focus on positive thoughts and start your day with a clearer and more balanced state of mind. d. Plan your day: Create a daily to-do list or set goals for the day to establish structure, provide a sense of accomplishment, and combat feelings of stagnation. e. Eat a nutritious breakfast: An adequate and balanced meal helps ensure stable blood sugar levels, reducing feelings of fatigue and lightheadedness. f. Socialize: Connect with friends, family, or coworkers in the morning to foster a sense of community and belonging, which can alleviate depression. g. Seek professional help: If feelings of depression persist, consider speaking with a mental health professional for support and guidance.  3. Do those questions have the same meaning? (1). No, the questions do not have the same meaning. The first question addresses physical symptoms (dizziness and blurry vision) experienced upon waking up, while the second question focuses on emotional well-being (depression and stagnation) in the morning. Although both questions pertain to the individual's experience during and shortly after waking up, they address different aspects of the individual's health - one being physical and the other being emotional."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: who killed scarface in the end of the movie?","output":"In the 1983 crime drama film \\"Scarface,\\" directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, the character Tony Montana, also known as Scarface, is played by Al Pacino. The movie, a violent and thrilling exploration of the Miami drug trade in the 1980s, follows Montana's rise from a Cuban refugee to the ruthless leader of a powerful drug empire. Towards the end of the movie, Tony Montana's world begins to crumble due to his increasing paranoia, drug addiction, and mounting tensions with the Colombian drug lord Alejandro Sosa and his associates. Sosa becomes furious with Montana for failing to cooperate in the assassination of a journalist who was planning to expose Sosa's criminal activities. Montana's refusal to go through with the assassination, primarily because the journalist's wife and children would also be killed, leads Sosa to take drastic measures against him. In the climactic and final scene, Montana is betrayed by his man, Alberto \\"The Shadow\\" (played by Mark Margolis). Sosa, vowing to exact revenge on Montana, sends a squad of heavily-armed hitmen to infiltrate and attack Montana's mansion. As the invaders make their way through the mansion, they manage to kill many of Montana's loyal bodyguards and soldiers. Tony Montana, heavily intoxicated by cocaine and fueled by rage, confronts the assailants with a grenade launcher-equipped M16 assault rifle. He engages in a brutal and chaotic firefight, taking down numerous hitmen and sustaining multiple gunshot wounds in the process. However, Montana's eventual demise comes at the hands of \\"The Skull\\" (played by Geno Silva), one of Sosa's most trusted and deadly assassins. As Montana is occupied in the firefight and shouting defiantly at the remaining attackers, The Skull sneaks up behind him. Taking advantage of Montana's distraction, The Skull fires a single shot from his shotgun at point-blank range into Montana's back, dealing a lethal blow and causing Montana to fall into the mansion's decorative fountain below. Thus, it is \\"The Skull,\\" the henchman of Alejandro Sosa, who is ultimately responsible for the death of Tony Montana, better known as Scarface, at the end of the movie. This scene serves as a violently fitting conclusion to a film that showcases the destructive consequences of unbridled greed, ambition, and the brutal reality of the drug trade."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Another doesn't want Hawaii to be part of the","output":"United States anymore and believes that voting would reinforce that connection. Learn about their stories and reasons for not voting, and then think about ways to address their concerns or convince them to participate in the voting process. Here's a step-by-step plan to encourage these nonvoters to vote: Step 1: Research and gather information - First, read the stories and understand the individual reasons why each of the six nonvoters in Hawaii refrains from voting in elections. Step 2: Identify common concerns and misconceptions - Note down and analyze common concerns or misconceptions that these nonvoters share. This might include feeling uninformed, feeling too young, or having specific political views that make voting seem irrelevant to them. Step 3: Develop individualized strategies - For each nonvoter, brainstorm an individualized approach to create a conversation that would address their concerns and change their perspective. For example: - For the high school student, provide resources to help him become more informed and assure him that every vote counts, regardless of age. - For the individual who doesn't want Hawaii to be part of the United States, engage in a dialogue about the importance of participating in the democratic process to voice their opinion and work towards change. Step 4: Create a supportive and informative environment - Develop an outreach program offering educational resources, workshops, and discussions about the importance of voting, the electoral process, and current political issues. Step 5: Share stories and promote conversations - Encourage others to share their experiences and reasons for voting, highlighting the impact that one vote can have in the larger political landscape. Step 6: Monitor progress and adapt - Keep track of the progress made by these six individuals and adjust the strategies and conversation approaches as needed. By addressing the reasons these nonvoters refrain from voting and providing them with the necessary resources and support, we may start to see a change in their participation in the electoral process and, ultimately, contribute towards increasing voter turnout in Hawaii."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

US Stocks Gain as Oil Prices Tumble US stocks made strong gains in late-day trading on Wednesday, as a tumble in oil prices boosted investor confidence about the economy, but thin volume meant dealers were skeptical about the strength of the rally. What is this text about?","output":"This text is about a particular day in the US stock market, specifically focusing on the late-day trading session on a Wednesday. The primary theme revolves around an observed increase in US stock prices, which the writer attributes to a notable decrease in oil prices during that time. This decline in oil prices is thought to have positively impacted investor confidence in the economy, as lower oil prices can translate to reduced business costs and increased consumer spending due to lower gasoline prices. However, the text also implies that the trading volume on that specific day was relatively low, leading dealers and investors to express some skepticism about the sustainability and validity of the observed stock market rally. A low trading volume can indicate that fewer investors are participating in the market, potentially reducing the significance of the day's stock price movements. This hints at the possibility that the late-day rally might not be a solid indicator of continued growth or improvement in the stock market, but instead could be a short-term event driven more by market sentiment rather than long-term fundamentals. In summary, the text discusses a day in the US stock market when a sudden dip in oil prices led to a late-trading rally characterized by increased share prices. While the fall in oil prices seemingly boosted investor confidence in the economy, the thin trading volume on that day created doubts among market participants about the strength and longevity of the rally. It raises the question whether this increased stock market performance was due to strong economic signals or just a temporary market reaction to fluctuating oil prices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the first name of the person who accepted that his illness made it necessary to return to his parent's home, though he resented the regression?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In the months following Pink Moon's release, Drake became increasingly asocial and distant. He returned to live at his parents' home in Tanworth-in-Arden, and while he resented the regression, he accepted that his illness made it necessary. \\"I don't like it at home,\\" he told his mother, \\"but I can't bear it anywhere else.\\" His return was often difficult for his family; Gabrielle said, \\"good days in my parents' home were good days for Nick, and bad days were bad days for Nick. And that was what their life revolved around, really.\\"Drake lived a frugal existence; his only income was a £20-a-week retainer he received from Island Records (equivalent to £238 in 2018). At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes. He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: \\"He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back.\\" Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously depressed: \\"There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all.

Friends recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails.

Generate a short movie review that has \\"(1).\\" sentiment (Options:  (1). negative;  (2). positive;).","output":"Title: \\"The Abyss Speaks\\"  Review:  \\"The Abyss Speaks\\" emerges as a colossal disappointment in the realm of short films. The sheer lack of depth and creativity displayed throughout its painstaking 30-minute runtime leaves viewers yearning for the light at the end of this dreary tunnel.  From the outset, the film's premise appears intriguing—a group of explorers venturing into undiscovered chambers of an ocean abyss, only to encounter the unknown. However, the plot quickly dissolves into an unappetizing hodgepodge of trite dialogue, flat characters, and feeble attempts at tension building. The egregiously inadequate character development exacerbates the film's overall lack of impact. The protagonist, Jim, fails to inspire any semblance of human emotion or connection. His character is riddled with clichés and tired tropes that make it difficult for viewers to invest in his self-realizations and struggles. Moreover, the supporting characters are equally one-dimensional, with no apparent motivation or purpose beyond serving as hollow echoes of Jim's already lackluster personality. In a movie focusing on the mysteries and untamed forces of nature, the visual effects are laughably substandard. The abyss, supposedly an awe-inspiring manifestation of earth's untapped depths, comes across as feebly contrived through unconvincing CGI. The creatures that supposedly inhabit these depths are more reminiscent of poorly designed characters in an outdated video game than the ferocious beings we were promised. Furthermore, the pacing is inconsistent, causing the narrative to stutter and lose momentum continually. The lackluster editing and abrupt scene transitions only contribute to the disintegration of the visual and storytelling coherence. Equally frustrating is the score, which oscillates from deafeningly loud and obnoxious to laughably inappropriate given the context, thereby consistently undermining the movie's already meager intensity. In conclusion, \\"The Abyss Speaks\\" miserably fails to deliver an engaging short film experience. Riddled with unsympathetic characters, subpar visual effects, and an incoherent narrative, it comes as no surprise that it is overwhelmingly negative in sentiment. There is no denying that its disappointments will undoubtedly weigh heavily on it, dragging it deeper into the abyss of forgettable cinema."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the two names of the work that was well received in Gothenburg in 1860?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before.

The music itself was largely written by Sumner and Hook as the group jammed during rehearsals. Curtis's imagery and word choice often referenced \\"coldness, pressure, darkness, crisis, failure, collapse, loss of control\\". In 1979, NME journalist Paul Rambali wrote, \\"The themes of Joy Division's music are sorrowful, painful and sometimes deeply sad.\\" Music journalist Jon Savage wrote that \\"Curtis's great lyrical achievement was to capture the underlying reality of a society in turmoil, and to make it both universal and personal,\\" while noting that \\"the lyrics reflected, in mood and approach, his interest in romantic and science-fiction literature.\\" Critic Robert Palmer wrote that William S.

Edwin and Edward Bryant were standing outside about 3:15 a.m. in the 1300 block of North Hudson when a dark-color vehicle drove by and someone inside opened fire, according to Chicago Police. | Network Video Productions      Twin 17-year-old brothers were killed in a drive-by shooting early Sunday in Old Town — among 17 people shot and killed in Chicago between Friday evening and Monday morning.      It was the deadliest gun-violence weekend so far this year, according to homicide totals tracked by the Chicago Sun-Times. Besides those shot and killed, 41 other people were wounded in gun violence citywide.      Edwin and Edward Bryant were standing outside about 3:15 a.m. in the 1300 block of North Hudson when a dark-colored vehicle drove by and someone inside opened fire, according to Chicago Police.      The brothers were two of four teenagers shot dead in Chicago since early Saturday.      The spike in violence over the weekend was on the mind of Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson when he addressed the media at Navy Pier Monday morning, after a graduation ceremony for the department’s newest officers.      “It was a tough weekend,” Johnson said.      “Clearly there were a lot more people outside, but you would think people would be in a better frame of mind given the fact that the Cubs are playing in the World Series,” he added. “The majority of these shootings this weekend were gang-related, we know that.”      This year’s highest total for fatal shootings on a weekend had been 13; that number was reached on both Father’s Day and Labor Day weekends.      In another particularly violent stretch, nine people were killed in city shootings and 13 others were wounded on Monday, Aug. 9.      “Until we start holding repeat gun offenders accountable for these crimes, they’re going to keep seeing cycles of gun violence like this. The majority of these shootings this weekend were gang-related, we know that. But they just have no fear of the consequences of their actions,” Johnson said Monday. “These violent gun offenders are clearly giving us the message that they just don’t care about the rest of the city of Chicago. To be quite frank, I’m sick of it and I know the people in the communities are tired of it. That’s why we have to do a better job of holding those individuals accountable.”      Johnson said that in the case of the Bryant twins, “we do have video footage of that incident. We’re making progress on it. The two brothers, as far as we could tell, they didn’t have any documented gang affiliation. But the individuals they were with did. So it’s possibly gang-related.”      He added: “We are making substantial progress on a number of those cases over the weekend. We just have to ensure that we keep working hard and I know the detectives will.”      Edwin Bryant was shot in the chest and back and was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 3:45 a.m., according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office and police. Edward suffered gunshot wounds to the chest and head and was also taken to Northwestern, where he was pronounced dead about an hour later.      The fraternal twins were juniors at Marshall High School in the East Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side after transferring from Lincoln Park High School as freshmen, according to Edward’s youth basketball coach.      Edward played basketball for the Marshall and for the Chicago Demons, a youth basketball program in Old Town, according to Chicago Demons Coach Vince Carter. Edwin also played basketball until middle school.      Carter said Edward played on the Demons’ traveling team since 6th grade. Earlier this year, the Demons won the Bigfoot Classic in Houston and the Las Vegas Live tournament. About 30 teams competed in the tournament in Houston and about 75 teams in Las Vegas. “He was a big part of [those wins],” Carter said.      Standing 6-foot-5, Edward played forward and could dunk, Carter said. He “had a Kevin Durant look…and had been coming into his own in the last few years.” He probably would have played college basketball, and Division I college teams “were looking at him.”      “He played hard,” Carter said. “He loved basketball … but you had to push him to realize his potential.”      Edward can be seen dunking at the end of the video below that was Tweeted by a teammate.

Why do golden rings create a shadow in the form of a heart? Do those questions have the same meaning? Options:  -no.  -yes.","output":"To answer these questions, let's consider each one step-by-step: Question 1: How is shadow formed? Step 1: Identify light source A shadow is formed when there is a light source, such as the sun, a lamp, or any other illuminating object. Step 2: Recognize obstruction by an object When the light rays coming from the light source encounter an object, the object obstructs or blocks those rays. Step 3: Understand the blocked light Due to the object's opaque nature, it does not allow the light to pass through it, and thus the light doesn't reach the surface behind the object. Step 4: Shadow formation The area where the light is blocked on the surface behind the object appears darker compared to the surroundings, which is the shadow. Question 2: Why do golden rings create a shadow in the form of a heart? Step 1: Consider the position of the rings When two golden rings are placed one above the other with their rounded sides touching and their other ends apart, they create a shape that resembles a heart. Step 2: Light source The light source should be placed correctly to cast the shadow of the arranged rings. Step 3: Shadow cast When light falls on the arranged rings, they cast a shadow on the surface behind them in the shape of a heart, because of the way the rings are positioned. Question 3: Do those questions have the same meaning? Answer: no. Reason: While both questions are related to shadow formation, they address different aspects. The first question explains the general concept of shadow formation, while the second one is specific to a certain situation or object that creates a shadow in a particular shape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Rosa Luxemburg  (also Rozalia Luxenburg; Polish: Roza Luksemburg; 5 March 1871 - 15 January 1919) was a Polish Marxist theorist, philosopher, economist, anti-war activist, and revolutionary socialist who became a naturalized German citizen at the age of 28. She was, successively, a member of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL), the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD), and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). In 1915, after the SPD supported German involvement in World War I, she and Karl Liebknecht co-founded the anti-war Spartacus League (Spartakusbund), which eventually became the KPD. During the November Revolution she co-founded the newspaper Die Rote Fahne (\\"The Red Flag\\"), the central organ of the Spartacist movement. Context: Luxemburg was born on 5 March 1871, in Zamosc. She and her family were Polish Jews living in Russian-controlled Poland. She was the fifth and youngest child of timber trader Eliasz Luxemburg and Line Lowenstein. Luxemburg later stated that her father imparted an interest in liberal ideas in her, while her mother was religious and well read with books kept at home. The family spoke German and Polish, and Luxemburg also learned Russian. The family moved to Warsaw in 1873. After being bedridden with a hip ailment at the age of five, she was left with a permanent limp.  Starting in 1880, Luxemburg attended a gymnasium. From 1886, she belonged to the Polish left-wing Proletariat Party (founded in 1882, anticipating the Russian parties by 20 years). She began political activities by organizing a general strike; as a result, four of the Proletariat Party leaders were put to death and the party was disbanded, though the remaining members, including Luxemburg, kept meeting in secret. In 1887, she passed her Matura (secondary school graduation) examinations. After fleeing to Switzerland to escape detention in 1889, she attended the University of Zurich (as did the socialists Anatoly Lunacharsky and Leo Jogiches), where she studied philosophy, history, politics, economics, and mathematics. She specialized in Staatswissenschaft (government science), the Middle Ages, and economic and stock exchange crises.  Her doctoral dissertation, \\"The Industrial Development of Poland\\" (Die Industrielle Entwicklung Polens), was officially presented in the spring of 1897 at the University of Zurich, which awarded her a Doctor of Law degree. Her dissertation was published by Duncker and Humblot in Leipzig in 1898. She was an oddity in Zurich as she was one of the very few women with a doctorate. She plunged immediately into the politics of international Marxism, following in the footsteps of Georgi Plekhanov and Pavel Axelrod.  In 1893, with Leo Jogiches and Julian Marchlewski (alias Julius Karski), Luxemburg founded the newspaper Sprawa Robotnicza (\\"The Workers' Cause\\"), which opposed the nationalist policies of the Polish Socialist Party. Luxemburg believed that an independent Poland could arise and exist only through socialist revolutions in Germany, Austria, and Russia. She maintained that the struggle should be against capitalism, not just for Polish independence. Her position of denying a national right of self-determination under socialism provoked a philosophic disagreement with Vladimir Lenin. She and Leo Jogiches co-founded the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL) party, after merging Congress Poland's and Lithuania's social democratic organizations. Despite living in Germany for most of her adult life, Luxemburg was the principal theoretician of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland (SDKP, later the SDKPiL), and led the party in a partnership with Jogiches, its principal organizer.

Q: Abstract: The effects of electrical stimulation of the vagi on gas transport mediated by high-frequency, low tidal volume ventilation (HFV) was examined in 10 anesthetized, paralyzed, propranolol-treated dogs. Gas transport efficiency was estimated by measuring the rate of CO2 removed from the lungs (Vco2) achieved during 45-s bursts of HFV applied before (control 1), during, and after (control 2) electrical stimulation of the transected vagi. During vagal stimulation the heart rate was maintained by electrical pacing. During the 15-s phase of vagal stimulation pulmonary impedance increased from 3.6 +/- 0.7 to 6.2 +/- 2.2 cmH2O X l-1 X s, and Vco2 increased. When the electrical stimulation of the vagi was stopped, impedance and Vco2 returned to prestimulation values. Vco2 was always higher during electrical stimulation of the vagi when HFV of a fixed volume was applied over a range of frequencies or when a fixed oscillation frequency was used over a range of tidal volumes. The effects of vagal stimulation on HFV-mediated gas transport were quite similar to the effects of moving the locations of the bias flow inlet and outlet into the lung such that tracheal volume was decreased by 20 ml, an amount equivalent to estimated change in control airway volume thought to occur during vagal stimulation. We simulated the effects of vagal stimulation and decreased tracheal volume on Vco2 by using a previously described model of HFV-mediated gas transport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) A:","output":"Vagal Stimulation and High-Frequency Ventilation"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What three bodily fluids did Serrano use for the album cover art for Reload and Load? from the following article ?  After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy,... Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"What three bodily fluids did Serrano use for the album cover art for Reload and Load?\\" is: 1. Semen: Andres Serrano used his own semen in creating the cover art for Metallica's \\"Load\\" album. This artwork, titled \\"Blood and Semen III,\\" involved pressing a mixture of Serrano's semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. 2. Blood: The same artwork for \\"Load\\" also used Serrano's blood mixed with his semen for the pressing between plexiglass sheets. 3. Urine: For the follow-up album \\"Reload,\\" Serrano created another artwork, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Although the article does not specifically mention the third body fluid, based on the information provided, we can conclude that urine is the third fluid used by Serrano in creating the cover art for the Reload album."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until the start of the concert, an estimated 500,000 audience members made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.The stage backdrop depicted an urban rooftop with water tank and air outlet, symbolic of New York's skyline.  At twilight, the backing band went onstage, followed by New York's mayor, Ed Koch, who announced, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, Simon and Garfunkel!\\" The duo entered through a side stage door, took center stage amid audience applause, looked at each other and shook hands, and began the concert with their 1968 hit \\"Mrs. Robinson\\". After the second song, \\"Homeward Bound\\", Simon delivered a short speech which began, \\"Well, it's great to do a neighborhood concert.\\" He then thanked the police, the fire department, the park administration and finally Ed Koch. The audience booed at the mention of Koch but applauded as Simon continued. Simon & Garfunkel played twenty-one songs in total: ten by the duo, eight by Simon, one by Garfunkel, a cover of  The Everly Brothers' \\"Wake Up Little Susie\\", and the medley version of \\"Maybellene\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The little Tootsie Pop boy can finally rest easy.      Mathematicians at New York University conducted a very important experiment to find out exactly how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop. Drum roll, please.      One thousand.      For those patient enough to not take a bite, graduate student Jinzi Mac Huang determined it would take 1,000 licks to make it through one centimeter of candy, which is approximately half the length of one Tootsie Pop. The study was done to explore the effects of dissolving materials within a fluid flow, such as rocks in geological environments and pills for pharmaceutical applications. The lollipop angle was just a fun side effect.      “We used these results to figure out in general how fluids dissolve materials, and we realized that that is basically what you’re doing when you’re enjoying a lollipop,” applied mathematics professor Leif Ristroph told ABC News.      “Using that model, we can take an object of any size and kind of a typical flow speed that would be determined by how fast you lick candy, and then determine how long it would take for that to dissolve all the material away,\\" Ristroph said.      Using that model and a giant homemade ball of candy, they got to the rough estimate of 1,000 licks, though the study conductors weren’t able test out the theory themselves.      “We started to test it, and it’s hard. Resisting the temptation to just bite into one is tough,” Ristroph admitted.      Tootsie Roll got in on the fun, too, when they heard that NYU was conducting the study by sending them boxes of lollipops for “research.”      “How many licks is a question fans of our candy have asked us for decades,” Tootsie Roll Industries President Ellen Gordon told ABC News. “We’re thrilled that New York University has conducted a study to help find out how many licks it really takes to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop.” ||||| Not Candy Crushâ€”Scientists Identify Nature of Candy Sculpture      A team of scientists has identified the complex process by which materials are shaped and ultimately dissolved by surrounding water currents. The study, conducted by researchers at NYUâ€™s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Florida State University, appears in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.      â€œHow flowing fluids generate unique shapes through erosion or dissolution is complex and fascinating,â€? says Leif Ristroph, an assistant professor at NYUâ€™s Courant Institute and the paperâ€™s senior author.      The researchers studied this effect by immersing hard candy in a water current. They found that a peculiar but consistent shape emerges and then persists before eventually vanishing. This same â€˜sculptureâ€™ results regardless of the candyâ€™s initial form and the speed of the water flow.      The authors were also surprised to find that their work offers a long-sought answer to a question from childhood: How many licks does it take to reach the center of a lollipop? By formulating a theory for how flows cause dissolving and shrinking, the researchers calculated an estimate of about 1,000 licks.      But the work addresses some serious science, too. Understanding how materials dissolve is at the heart of the chemical and pharmaceutical industriesâ€”their products rely on the incorporation of solid compounds into solutions within reactors and within the human body.      The work also has relevance in geologyâ€”the research links the morphology of eroding and dissolving surfaces to the flows present, which could offer a way to explain the unusual but consistent shapes of landscapes and landforms.      Conducted in NYUâ€™s Applied Math Lab, the study involved experiments using pieces of hard candy, cooked up by the researchers and measuring about two inches. Simple shapes, such as spheres or cylinders, were then placed in a water tunnel, which allows for washing of these bodies by well-controlled flows. The researchers captured the change of candyâ€™s shape using time-lapse photography and used these measurements to formulate a theory for how flows affect dissolving.      The study was led by Jinzi Huang, a doctoral student at the Courant Institute, and also includes Professor Nicholas Moore of Florida Stateâ€™s Department of Mathematics. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Mathematicians at New York University discovered that it takes about 1,000 licks to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  Fred was a good athlete in his youth, and so was Vic. Fred started eating junk food and other fatty foods in his 30's. His cholesterol is very high now. Vic became a vegan later,and he is in a very good physical shape.

Latif Yahia (Dominic Cooper), an Iraqi soldier fighting in the Iran-Iraq War, is called to become a \\"fedai\\" (\\"body double\\" or political decoy) for Uday Hussein (also played by Cooper), the playboy son of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein (Philip Quast). Latif comes from an upper-class family and had attended school with Uday, where the other students would remark on their likeness. Latif initially refuses the position, but is imprisoned and tortured, ultimately relenting when his family is threatened.Latif undergoes minor cosmetic surgery to perfect his resemblance to Uday and, over the next three years, practices emulating the young Hussein's mannerisms and wildly volatile persona. He is given access to all of the luxurious benefits of the Husseins' fortune, including massive palaces, expensive wardrobes and Uday's Ferrari Mondial 3.2 and various other exotic cars. Latif tries to resist Uday's exorbitant merrymaking and erratic behavior, at one point fleeing a nightclub in another of Uday's Ferraris to attempt to see his family, who believe he has died in the war. However, he is apprehended by Uday's bodyguards and beaten. After an appearance at a conference with several Kuwaiti leaders, an attempt is made on Uday's (Latif's) life, apparently by a member of a rebel opposition group, possibly a Kurd. The real Uday, though, is more concerned with the Kuwaitis, who he believes have been slant drilling from Iraq's Rumaila oil field. Iraq invads Kuwait in August 1990 which begins the First Gulf War. With the fall of Kuwait, Uday proclaims \\"The Age of the Sheikhs is over!\\"Uday's increasingly violent, sadistic tendencies are displayed when he kidnaps a 14 year-old school girl and forces her to escort him to a party. At the party, (based on an actual 1988 celebration honoring Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's wife Suzanne), the strung-out Uday becomes enraged with his father's personal bodyguard Kamel Hana Gegeo (Mehmet Ferda).

One-third ponder leaving Bay Area amid costs, congestion It is so difficult to keep up with the Joneses, especially while navigating through all the gridlock traffic, that a third of Bay Area residents are thinking about clearing out in the next few years. Housing costs and a lack of availability, high prices in general and traffic topped the list of concerns in the latest of a series of surveys of residents in the nine counties surrounding San Francisco Bay. Optimism was, in fact, pretty hard to find in the poll of 1,000 residents by the Bay Area Council, a business-sponsored public policy advocacy group. “This is our canary in a coal mine,” said Jim Wunderman, president and chief executive officer of the council, which has been pushing, often against the grain of public opinion, for more high-density housing to be combined with more transit options in already developed areas. Wunderman foresees trouble if nothing is done to ease the crunch. “We need to act with urgency,” he said about the need for more affordable housing. “We need to act decisively, and we need to act regionally to address the underlying problems of housing and traffic that are causing discontent and aggravation.” Photo: Lea Suzuki, The Chronicle Only 40 percent feel the region is headed in the right direction, and an equal percentage believe it is “seriously off on the wrong track,” according to the poll.

One-third ponder leaving Bay Area amid costs, congestion A mass exodus is not likely despite the fact that 34 percent of Bay Area residents said they are strongly or somewhat likely to move out. The poll found that an additional 54 percent of the respondents plan to stay put and 31 percent of those people are adamant about staying in the Bay Area. Still, a good many citizens are disgruntled. Only 40 percent feel the region is headed in the right direction, and an equal percentage believe it is “seriously off on the wrong track,” according to the poll. The most optimistic folk also happened to have the highest incomes. San Francisco residents were No. 1 in the region on the glum scale, with 52 percent saying the Bay Area is going off the rails, so to speak. The pessimism pretty clearly tracks the recent surge in Bay Area housing prices. Last year, 55 percent felt things were heading in the right direction. In 2014, 57 percent were looking on the bright side, the poll said. And, in case the source of people’s gloom wasn’t clear, pollsters asked folks to list their top three problems. Cost of living got the top score, with 25 percent of residents declaring it the most serious problem. Housing, with 23 percent, and traffic, with 13 percent, were next on the Bay Area’s list of big troubles. In all, 64 percent of residents in the survey identified cost of living, 48 percent named housing and 39 percent ranked traffic among their top three issues. The trifecta of complaints in 2016 pounded last year’s biggest concern — the California drought — like a heavy El Niño rainstorm. Only 1 percent of Bay Area residents named the lack of water as the biggest problem this year, compared with 24 percent last year. The results are in line with a previous poll released Wednesday by the Bay Area Council, which also showed a marked increase in concern about the availability and affordability of homes compared with previous years. Curiously, the majority of residents in that poll thought more housing and a better transportation system should be built outside the Bay Area. Neither Wunderman nor Sarah Sherburn-Zimmer, the director of San Francisco’s Housing Rights Committee, agrees with that solution. Sherburn-Zimmer says rent control, tighter eviction controls and more affordable instead of luxury housing would go a long way toward solving the problem. “San Francisco residents know that when you build luxury housing, rents and evictions in the surrounding neighborhood go up,” she said. “They don’t want whole neighborhoods being bulldozed so you can build housing for the wealthy.” The survey, conducted between Feb. 12 and March 9 by the Oakland research firm EMC Research, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

Initially, I had planned on installing a beautiful, luxurious bathtub in the guest bathroom to provide my friends and family with a comfortable and relaxing bathing experience during their visits. I believed that the addition of a bathtub would not only increase the visual appeal of the bathroom but also create an atmosphere of warmth and serenity, making the guest's stay more enjoyable and memorable. However, upon careful measurement and consideration of my guest bathroom dimensions, I found that the bathroom simply could not accommodate the vast size of the bathtub I had chosen. While I was aware that bathtubs come in different shapes, sizes, and materials, the gorgeous, freestanding bathtub that I fell in love with was too large for the limited floor space in my guest bathroom. As a result of the bathtub's overwhelming size, it would not allow for enough clearance for other bathroom fixtures, such as the toilet, sink, and vanity, while still meeting safety codes and requirements. Additionally, the installation of such a large bathtub could potentially interfere with proper ventilation, window access, and doorway clearance, leading to reduced functionality and diminished overall bathroom experience for my guests. Given these obstacles, I realized that it would be more practical to opt for alternative solutions to enhance the guest bathroom experience. Some of the options I considered included installing an elegant, walk-in shower with stylish fixtures and a frameless glass enclosure, opting for a more compact, space-saving bathtub design, or forgoing the bathtub idea altogether in favor of adding unique and functional décor elements to create a spa-like atmosphere for my guests. Ultimately, while I was initially disappointed that my dream of having a grand, luxurious bathtub in my guest bathroom could not materialize due to the bathtub being huge, I realized that there were plenty of other creative and practical ways to make the space inviting, comfortable, and aesthetically pleasing. By focusing on the importance of balance, efficiency, and function, I could still design a guest bathroom that would leave a lasting impression on the visitors who stay in my home, ensuring that their overall experience is enjoyable, comfortable, and unforgettable."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Break out of a cycle of dependency whereby the addict relies on you and, in turn, your assistance inadvertently helps the person keep up the addiction. This is called negative enabling. Learn to say \\"no\\" and commit yourself to it; it is perhaps one of the most important components of bringing about transformation in an addict. It's also important to note that the addict will likely not respond well to your commitment to saying \\"no\\" since she may be used to getting what she wants and when.   If the person is a family member or friend, you'll need to think about money in particular. Decide if you are willing to lend the person money or not. Many people don’t like to lend money knowing that it will be spent on drugs, whilst others see it as stopping the addict from perhaps committing crime and getting into further trouble if she is caught. Make up your mind about this matter and stick to it. If you don't want to lend money, firmly let the person know the reasons you are unwilling and don't waver. If you are willing to lend to the person, have her sign debtor's notes for each loan and let her know that you plan to pursue any unpaid debts. If the person does let you down, stop lending to her.  In addition, don't enable the behavior or try to keep up with the person by joining in the drug use. You need to keep yourself safe first and foremost. Avoid covering up or making excuses for the person's behavior or taking over the person's responsibilities (whether they be work, family, or otherwise). Doing so shields the person from the negative consequences of her behavior. She needs to learn that what she is doing has adverse consequences. Very few people addicted to heroin manage to complete a detox and remain clean on their first attempt. If your loved one does relapse, don't lose faith and do something drastic like disown her or kick her out. Remember that most people relapse a few times before they make it. Even when the person is past the withdrawal stage, recovery is not yet a certain thing as it encompasses much more than just getting rid of the person's physical dependency on heroin.  Heroin addiction is not all physical. When someone is trying to recover from heroin addiction, they also need to deal with the mental aspects of their addiction and the triggers that led the person to engage in the behavior in the first place. Even though the withdrawal symptoms might have gone, the mental addiction will still be there, urging her to use again. Thus, treatment will have to involve dealing with those underlying issues in order to truly remove the impetus to relapse. If (or when) the person fails, don't take it as a personal insult and instead offer support for the next time she tries. Be supportive and try not to be suspicious of the person all the time; appreciate that it is hard to overcome a heroin addiction and show compassion for this trial. Instead of nagging the person when she slips or falls on the path to recovery or trying to control her every move and behavior, offer understanding and empathy. The very fact that the person wants to try to get better and beat the addiction is encouraging. Remember that recovery is not linear, like going simply from point A to point B. There are lots of ups and downs. Don't keep asking the person if she is still clean or lecturing her about not starting again. If you're constantly nagging the person, she will begin to lose trust and comfortability with you and may even start keeping things from you. Offer provide praise and encouragement when the person does something to further her recovery or as a way to mark a milestone on the path to recovery (such as one-week sober or 30 days sober). This is also called positive enabling, which refers to behaviors that encourage change in a person addicted to drugs. Enable the person to continue her recovery and her path of change by reminding her that you love her and that you too are committed to her betterment. Once the person is receiving treatment, whether that be by entering a rehabilitation center, seeing a therapist, or going to meetings, remain an active part of their recovery process. Getting the person to get help and treatment with only the first stage of recovery. Your loved one will need your support in order to carry on with the treatment and be successful in beating the addiction. Show the person that you are invested in her and her long-term recovery.  One way to stay involved is to try to attend therapy sessions or meetings that allow guests of people addicted to drugs. This may also help you build understanding and empathy as you will come to learn about heroin addiction and how it affects people. Inquire about the person's recovery. However, rather than ask the person in a Q-and-A format or other style that resembles an interrogation rather than a conversation (e.g. \\"Did you go to a meeting today?\\";\\"Did you talk in therapy today?\\", etc.), consider asking open-ended questions that allow the person to shape the narrative they want to tell (e.g., \\"How have the meetings been going?\\" and \\"Have you learned anything new about yourself throughout this process?\\"). Summary:","output":"The article discusses methods on how to effectively help someone battling heroin addiction. This includes not enabling the addict's negative behavior known as \\"negative enabling.\\" It emphasizes the necessity of taking a firm stand, specifically saying \\"no\\" to the addict, which can potentially cause discomfort as they might be accustomed to getting their way.  The article also considers financial interactions, advising one to make a decision whether to lend the addict money or not, and stick to it. Should you decide to lend money, the addict should sign debtor's notes, and if they fall short on their obligations, all future loans should be halted. Maintaining your safety is crucial and refraining from indulging in drug use with the addict or covering for the consequences of their actions is recommended. The addict should realize the adverse results of their behavior themselves.  Relapses are common during recovery from an addiction, and the article advises that a relapse should not be a cause for shunning the individual. The recovery process is multifaceted, and not linear, involving both physical and mental detoxification. The mental aspect of addiction is linked to triggers which led to the addictive behavior and it is important that these are addressed in treatment to prevent relapse. Perseverance and patience are key to the recovery process, constant nagging or questioning could lead to distrust, instead, constructive engagement is advised. Positive enabling, which provides encouragement for change and recovery, is beneficial. Celebrating milestones in the recovery process can reinforce positive behavior. Continued support and involvement in the treatment process can significantly contribute to treatment success. This can include attending therapy sessions, meetings, showing constant investment and commitment to the recovery process. Creating a conversation about the recovery process rather than questioning in an interrogative manner builds trust and provides the recovering individual a chance to join the narrative about their journey to recovery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: Walter and Jesse, two coworkers, are sitting at a hotel bar having a drink together after a long day at a conference when they start discussing their homes. Jesse says that he just recently discovered that the home he has been living in his entire life has had asbestos in it. Walter says that he has never lived in a home with asbestos.  and a hint : Many different chemical substances cause cancer. Dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have been shown to cause cancer ( Figure below ). In fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens. Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Using smokeless tobacco can also cause cancer. Other chemicals that cause cancer include asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, and nickel.  Please answer this question : Is Jesse's chance of having cancer higher or lower than Walter's? Answer:","output":"Based on the given situation and information, it appears that Jesse's chance of having cancer is potentially higher than Walter's. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that Jesse has been living in a home with asbestos present, which is a known carcinogen. Long-term exposure to asbestos fibers can lead to serious health problems, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and other respiratory diseases. However, it is essential to consider other factors that may also contribute to an individual's overall cancer risk. As mentioned, there are dozens of chemicals that cause cancer, and some of these are present in tobacco smoke. If Walter or Jesse are smokers or have been exposed to significant amounts of secondhand smoke, their cancer risk could be further increased. Moreover, individual genetics, lifestyle factors, and environmental exposures can also impact a person's cancer risk. Factors such as diet, exercise, sun exposure, and family history should be considered when assessing overall cancer risk. In summary, while Jesse's chance of having cancer may be higher than Walter's due to prolonged exposure to asbestos, it is crucial to consider a broader range of factors when determining overall cancer risk. The chances of developing cancer are influenced by a combination of factors such as genetics, lifestyle choices, and environmental exposures, so comparing their risks solely on asbestos exposure might not be an accurate representation of the complete picture. To get a better understanding of each individual's cancer risk, one should consider consulting a healthcare professional and possibly conducting a comprehensive risk assessment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This can cause people to feel upset or even be mean to each other. Some countries might hide bad things they did in the past or make other people seem not as good. This can happen because the people in charge or the teachers change the true story. For example, some French books might be a little mean to Americans, and Japan tried to make its students forget about a very sad event that happened a long time ago.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Live Feed is set in some unnamed Chinese/Japanese Asian district somewhere as five American friends, Sarah (Ashley Schappert), Emily (Taayla Markell), Linda (Caroline Chojnacki), Mike (Lee Tichon) & Darren (Rob Scattergood) are enjoying a night on the town & taking in the sights. After a scuffle in a bar with a Japanese Triad boss (Stephen Chang) they decide to check out a porno theatre, as you would. Inside they are separated & quickly find out that the place belongs to the Triad boss who uses it to torture & kill people for reasons which aren't made clear. Can local boy Miles (Kevan Ohtsji) save them? This Canadian production was co-written, produced & directed by Ryan Nicholson who also gets a prosthetic effects designer credit as well, one has to say that Live Feed is another pretty poor low budget shot on a camcorder type horror film that seems to exist only to cash in on the notoriety & success of Hostel (2005) & the mini craze for 'torture porn' as it's become known. According the IMDb's 'Trivia' section for Live Feed writer & director Nicholson wrote it after hearing about certain activities taking place in live sex theatres, for my money I reckon he wrote it after watching Hostel! The script is pretty poor, there is no basic reason given as to why this porno theatre has a big fat ugly freak dressed in bondage gear lurking around torturing & killing people, none. Was it for the Triads? Was it for his pleasure? Was it to make snuff films to sell? Some sort of explanation would have been nice. Also why did he turn on the Triad boss at the end? If your looking for a film with a coherent story then forget about Live Feed. It seemed to me to be some sort of uneasy misjudged mix of sex, S&M, horror, torture, gore & action films which doesn't come off. I mean just setting a horror film in a porn theatre isn't automatically going to make your film any good, there still needs to be a decent script & story, right? The character's were fairly poor clichés & some of their actions & motivations were more than a little bit questionable. It moves along at a reasonable pace, it's fairly sleazy mixing gore, sex & nudity but it does look cheap which lessens the effect. Director Nicholson doesn't do anything special here, the editing is choppy & annoying, he seems to think lighting almost every scene with neon lights is a good idea & the film has a cheap look about it. Available in both 'R' & 'Unrated' versions I saw the shorter cut 'R' version which really isn't that gory but I am prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the 'Unrated' version & say that it might be much, much gorier but I can't say for sure. There's a fair amount of nudity too if that's your thing. I wouldn't say there's much of an atmosphere or many scares here because there isn't & aren't respectively although it does have a sleazy tone in general which is something it has going for it I suppose. Technically Live Feed isn't terribly impressive, the blood looks a little too watery for my liking & entire scenes bathed in annoying neon lights sometimes makes it hard to tell whats happening, it to often looks like it was shot on a hand-held camcorder & the choppy editing at least on the 'R' rated version is at times an annoying mess. Shot on location in an actual porn theatre somewhere in Vancouver in Canada. The acting is poor, sometimes I couldn't tell if the actresses in this were supposed to be crying or laughing... Live Feed is not a film I would recommend anyone to rush out & buy or rent, I didn't think much of it with it's very weak predictable storyline lacking exposition & which goes nowhere, poor acting & less than impressive gore (at least in the 'R' rated cut anyway).

Please answer the following question: What exactly is a lie ?Is it anything we say which we know is untrue ?Or is it something more than that ?For example, suppose a friend wants to borrow some money from you. You say \\"I wish I could help you, but I am short of money myself.\\" In fact , you are not short of money but your friend is in the habit of not paying his debts and you don't want to hurt his feelings by reminding him of this. Is this really a lie ? Professor Jerald Jellison of the University of southern California has made a scientific study of lying. According to him, women are better liars than men, particularly when telling a \\"white lie\\", such as when a woman at a party tells another woman that she likes her dress when she really thinks it's terrible. However, this is only one side of the story. Other researchers say that men are more likely to tell more serious lies, such as making a promise that they have no intention of carrying out. This is the kind of lie politicians and businessmen are supposed to be particularly skilled at :the lie from which the liar hopes to profit or gain in some way. Research has been done into the way people's behavior changes in a number of small, unimportant ways when they lie. It has been found that if they are sitting down at the time, they tend to move about in their chairs more than usual. To the trained observer they are saying \\"I wish I were somewhere else now\\". They also tend to touch certain parts of the face, particularly the nose. One explanation of this may be that lying causes a slight increase in blood pressure. The tip of the nose  is very sensitive to changes and the increased pressure makes it itch. Another gesture that gives liars away is what the writer Decmond Morris in his bookMan Watching calls the \\"mouth cover\\". He says that there are several typical forms of this ,such as covering part of the mouth with the fingers, touching the upper lip or putting a finger of the hand at one side off the mouth. Such a gesture can be understood as an unconscious  attempt on the part of the liar to... The writer of the passage  _  .

We already know what the film is about. Five beautiful girls being targeted by a 'romantic' serial slasher, a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago. His trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards, maggot-infested chocolates and a bleeding nose. His weapon of choice: well, take a pick - axe, knife, electric powerdrill, bow and arrow, hot iron, etc. Ok, so basically it's a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexuality. Horror movies aren't supposed to be Shakespeare, but I'm not gonna go there. I love horror movies, but not all of them. This one, I adore. It's up there with some of my other favorites. It's funny, sexy and scary. The killer's mask is childishly creepy, and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky. The acting is topnotch: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are a lot of fun. I really did wish to see much, much more of Katherine Heigl. I am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon. Jessica Capshaw is a very capable actress, and Jessica Cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in Urban Legend 2. The smaller parts were also good; Hedy Buress was a hoot ('bleedmedry.com') and that younger version of Denise Richards looked frightfully like her. Highlights: Every death scene had a particular distinction to it. The creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue. The hottub scene, while ludicrous, was well done. And the audiovisual maze was sinister. The soundtrack is great, with creepy music and some fine alternative tunes. Lowpoint: I felt as though the killer wasn't featured enough, we barely saw the mask, and it wasn't featured at all during the climax.

The twist at the end wasn't that big of a surprise, but I'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole 'explaining killer' routine.

Who was born first, Nikolai Chebotaryov or  Leonid Khachiyan?","output":"Nikolai Grigorievich Chebotaryov was born first, ahead of Leonid Genrikhovich Khachiyan. Chebotaryov was born on June 15, 1894, whereas Khachiyan was born much later, on May 3, 1952. The two mathematicians are known for their significant contributions to different fields of mathematics.  Nikolai Chebotaryov was a Soviet mathematician from Ukraine. He was one of the leading algebraists during his time. He mainly worked in the fields of algebra, number theory, and complex analysis. Chebotaryov is best known for his work on Galois theory, particularly the Chebotaryov Density Theorem, which is an important result in number theory and algebraic geometry. Apart from this, he also played a significant role in the development of mathematical education in the USSR. Chebotaryov taught at various universities and founded the Kazan school of algebra as well as served as the head of departments at the University of Kazan. On the other hand, Leonid Khachiyan was an Armenian-American mathematician and computer scientist. He made considerable contributions in the field of mathematical optimization, specifically linear programming. Khachiyan is primarily famous for devising the ellipsoid method, a groundbreaking approach to solving linear programming problems. In 1979, his work on the algorithm paved the way for understanding the complexity of these problems and marked them as solvable in polynomial time. The ellipsoid method had a significant influence on the development of the field of optimization algorithms later on. Khachiyan was a professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey, where he taught and researched until his untimely death in 2005. To summarize, Nikolai Chebotaryov was born first on June 15, 1894, and was a prominent figure in algebra and number theory. Leonid Khachiyan was born on May 3, 1952, and was a key contributor to the field of linear programming and optimization.

The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, Juan Bautista Chapa, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location. In early 1689, Spanish authorities received a plea, written in French. Jumano scouts had received these papers from the Caddo, who asked that they be delivered to the Spanish. The papers included a parchment painting of a ship, as well as a written message from Jean L'Archevêque. The message read: I do not know what sort of people you are.

An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280–1385 and 1420–1480. During 2011 an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste.

Writing for the New York Times, Dwyer describes the Macombs Dam Bridge he used to walk across as a boy, and how it was the site of a May 1971 ambush shooting of NYPD officers Joseph Piagentini and Waverly Jones. He recalls four other NYC police officers viciously attacked (two of them, Gregory Foster and Rocco Laurie, died) over the next year, noting that \\"in an instant this weekend, it seemed as though 43 years had not passed, and that it was 1971 again.\\" Ramos' and Liu's deaths shocked New York, which hadn't seen an officer fatally shot on duty since 2011, or partners die together since two auxiliary officers were gunned down in 2007, per the New York Daily News and the Officer Down Memorial Page. Dwyer touches upon the differences between the NYPD of his day and the current NYPD—specifically, the more diverse makeup of today's officers, men and women from 50 countries who \\"speak scores of languages\\" to create a \\"Police Department [that] looks more like the city than ever.\\" And yet, he sadly notes, that diversity isn't bulletproof: \\"To the person who killed Officers Liu and Ramos, just as to the people who killed Officers Jones and Piagentini, Foster and Laurie, the only color that mattered was blue. All of them, with skin tones that ran from black to white, got bullets to the head.\\" But while Dwyer laments how the vitriol on social media is a \\"river of rage\\" that shows \\"contempt for racial [and] political others,\\" he ends with the words of Ramos' aunt, who told reporters Sunday she hopes \\"we can move forward and find an amicable path to a peaceful coexistence.\\" Click for the full piece. Expand this summary.","output":"The murders of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu on December 20, 2014, evoked memories of a similar tragic event in the early 1970s for New York Times writer Jim Dwyer. He recounts the May 1971 ambush shooting of NYPD officers Joseph Piagentini and Waverly Jones on the Macombs Dam Bridge, an event that profoundly impacted the city. Within the next year, four other NYPD officers were violently attacked, with two of them, Gregory Foster and Rocco Laurie, succumbing to their injuries. The heart-wrenching deaths of Ramos and Liu shocked the people of New York, who had not witnessed a fatal police officer shooting since 2011. The last time partners had died together was in 2007 when two auxiliary officers were gunned down. This tragedy underscores the dangers faced by officers in the line of duty. The composition of the NYPD has evolved through the years. Dwyer highlights the increased diversity, with officers hailing from 50 countries and speaking numerous languages. Today's Police Department is more representative of the city's multicultural landscape than ever before. Sadly, however, this diversity does not provide immunity from violence. Officers from various backgrounds, including those of African American and Caucasian descent, were targeted for their allegiance to the police force, not their skin color. The toxic environment on social media fuels hatred and contempt for those with different racial and political beliefs. Despite this barrage of negativity, Dwyer finds solace in the words of Ramos' aunt, who expressed hope that the community could find a peaceful way forward. The tragic deaths of NYPD officers Ramos and Liu, as well as their fallen colleagues from the past, serve as a painful reminder of the sacrifices law enforcement officers make to protect and serve their communities. It also calls for unity and understanding in a divided society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.  - Flower Mound is an incorporated town located in Denton and Tarrant counties in the U.S. state of Texas.

Given the question: Given the below context:  The dignitaries and canons constituted the chapter and had the primary role of aiding the bishop in the governance of the diocese. Often the bishop was the titular head of the chapter only and was excluded from its decision-making processes, the chapter being led by the dean as its superior. As the diocese of Moray based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral, the bishop was allowed to participate within the chapter but only as an ordinary canon. Moray was not unique in this: the bishops of Aberdeen, Brechin, Caithness, Orkney and Ross were also canons in their own chapters. Each morning, the canons held a meeting in the chapterhouse where a chapter from the canonical rulebook of St Benedict was read before the business of the day was discussed. Bishop Brice's chapter of eight clerics consisted of the dean, precentor, treasurer, chancellor, archdeacon and three ordinary canons. His successor, Bishop Andrew de Moravia, greatly expanded the chapter to cater for the much-enlarged establishment by creating two additional hierarchical posts (succentor and subdean) and added 16 more prebendary canons. In total, 23 prebendaries had been created by the time of Andrew's death, and a further two were added just before the Scottish Reformation. Prebendary churches were at the bestowal of the bishop as the churches either were within the diocesan lands or had been granted to the bishop by a landowner as patronage. In the case of Elgin Cathedral, the de Moravia family, of which Bishop Andrew was a member, is noted as having the patronage of many churches given as prebends.Rural Deans, or deans of Christianity as they were known in the Scottish Church, supervised the priests in the deaneries and implemented the bishop's edicts. There were four deaneries in the Moray diocese—Elgin, Inverness, Strathspey and Strathbogie, and these provided the income not only for the cathedral and chapter but also for other religious houses within and outside the diocese. Many churches were allocated to support designated canons, and...  Guess a valid title for it!

Please answer the following question: Process: - Energy builds up in the crust of the earth - The energy causes the fault lines give way - The earth&#x27;s plates move - The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions - The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it.  Question: suppose more seismic waves occur happens, how will it affect less stronger earthquakes.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"If more seismic waves occur, it is likely that they will have some effect on less strong earthquakes. Let's break this down step by step: 1. Energy builds up in the crust of the Earth due to tectonic plate movement and other geologic processes. 2. This energy causes fault lines to give way, allowing the Earth's plates to move. The movement of these plates can lead to earthquakes of various magnitudes. 3. When an earthquake occurs, the energy radiates out from the fault in all directions in the form of seismic waves.  4. These seismic waves shake the Earth as they travel through it, which is what we perceive as an earthquake. Now, if there are more seismic waves occurring, it could potentially cause one or both of the following situations: A. The increased seismic wave activity might trigger other nearby faults to slip, causing additional less strong earthquakes. This would result in an overall increase in the frequency or number of smaller earthquakes. B. Alternatively, the increased seismic wave activity might cause some of the built-up energy in the Earth's crust to be released more frequently in the form of smaller earthquakes, rather than being stored up and released in one larger, more powerful event. Considering these possibilities, the answer to the question is A: more. The occurrence of more seismic waves could potentially lead to more less strong earthquakes, either by triggering additional smaller earthquakes or by causing the built-up energy in the Earth's crust to be released more frequently in smaller events."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: President Donald Trump suffered a political setback Tuesday when Democrats won easy victories in governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey. In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\\" he said. Political analysts said Democratic enthusiasm and a focus on Trump were clearly on display in both states. \\"We have heard for months and months about all this energy on the left. It had not materialized until tonight,\\" said Steve Peoples of the Associated Press. \\"A big night for Democrats and, really, it was a repudiation of sorts of the Trump nationalist message.\\" Even some Republicans saw the results as a rejection of the Trump political brand.

Bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynic-about-to-reform as in \\"Casablanca\\", and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them - but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him? It doesn't, so he can't be a cynic; Hawks wanted it both ways: a character who is both the \\"cool lone cynic\\" and yet a well-meaning humanitarian. I don't think so... Bacall does her non-chalant \\"cool babe\\" routine for the first time, and there are plenty of overrated, not all-too interesting so-called \\"sexual innuendo\\" exchanges between her and Bogey; these dialogues sound silly by today's standards. \\"Just purse your lips and whistle...\\". A load of crap... She was 19 when this was made but looks a lot older, and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day. Her bony face, with its sharp features, is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de Havilland, the cuteness of a Myrna Loy, let alone the likability of an Irene Dunne. Bacall was more suited for playing vampires, not femme-fatales. (In real life she is very much like her face: a Hollywood bitch.) There is a scene in which Bacall breaks into tears; very unsuitable for her character. There are two or three bad musical numbers - but my fast-forward button was ready.

He moves his skeptical wife Olivia and their daughter Lily into the house during the restoration project, and Olivia's aunt Connie, who has a fascination with the supernatural, comes to visit. During the restoration, George stumbles upon an enigmatic message scrawled on a wall hidden behind a painting, which reads, \\"The sparrows are flying again.\\" Intrigued, both by the message and the undeniable energy the house seems to carry, George and Connie decide to unravel the mystery. Olivia reluctantly agrees, fueled by her worry for her husband's growing obsession. Act 2: The Cryptic Clues George locates old newspaper articles and journals belonging to the property's previous owners, dating back a century. The journal of Abigail Winston implies a tumultuous love affair between Abigail and her husband Thomas. Thomas, entranced by occult practices, sought to capture a supernatural entity in sparrow form to harness its power. When Thomas disappeared, Abigail was left behind, penniless and heartbroken, believing she'd been abandoned. As George, Olivia, and Connie follow the cryptic clues left by Abigail, they begin to experience eerie occurrences around the house. Lily claims to see and interact with a young woman in Victorian clothing, who can control swarms of sparrows—a detail that chills her family. Act 3: Finding the Entity's Treasure Eventually, George uncovers Thomas's hidden occult library, filled with artifacts and lore regarding the supernatural entity known as \\"the Sparrow Queen.\\" George, Olivia, and Connie deduce that Thomas didn't abandon Abigail but was rather taken by the Sparrow Queen due to his growing obsession. As they push to find a method to release the trapped souls of Abigail and Thomas, the Sparrow Queen manifests. They learn that the Queen's immense power can only be passed on to a new host, whom she chooses once every century. Olivia, fearing that the Sparrow Queen intends to take Lily, agrees to participate in the ritual to save her child. Act 4: The Final Sacrifice The family scours the Victorian mansion for artifacts needed for the ritual to put Abigail and Thomas to rest and stop the Sparrow Queen's hold on the house. Aunt Connie, studied in occult practices, guides them through the ritual that navigates a harrowing spiritual realm, culminating in Olivia's heartfelt acceptance of the power to save her child. As the intensity climaxes, the Sparrow Queen releases Abigail and Thomas' souls into the afterlife and transfers her power to Olivia, who makes a selfless decision to channel her new energy into healing the world and sparing Lily from a cursed fate. In the end, the family is forever changed but united stronger than ever, as the power of love and sacrifice triumphs over darkness.

Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.  After reading the above, is \\"Increases\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What happens to the size of the chest when the diaphragm muscle relaxes?\\"?","output":"No, \\"Increases\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"What happens to the size of the chest when the diaphragm muscle relaxes?\\". The correct answer is \\"Decreases\\". When the diaphragm muscle relaxes, it causes the chest cavity to decrease in size, which in turn increases the air pressure inside the lungs and allows air to leave the lungs during exhalation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Explanation: Acid rain has the potential to affect the growth and development of mushrooms. While it doesn't directly impact any step of the mushroom growth process, it can indirectly affect the conditions in which the process occurs. Acid rain alters the pH of soil and water, which may in turn, affect the availability of nutrients, such as phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and nitrogen, which are vital for the growth and development of mushrooms. In the case of less acid rain, the soil conditions would be less acidic and more suitable for the growth of mushrooms, allowing for better nutrient absorption and overall healthier growth. This results in a positive indirect impact on the growth process of the mushrooms. However, since acid rain is not a direct part of the mushroom growth process itself, we can conclude that the perturbation is indirectly impacting a step of the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper. So, assuming we can continue to move forward, that is something we would bring to our conference on the 7th when we have our two-hour immigration meeting,... House Leadership probably thinks that: - Lawmakers need more vacation time - Queen of the hill debate is wrong - Trump will not approve the immigration bill - not enough information Answer:","output":"The issue of immigration and border security, particularly concerning the status of the 700,000 undocumented young people known as DACA recipients or Dreamers, has been a divisive and complex topic within the U.S. Congress. The recent effort by moderate Republicans to force a \\"queen of the hill\\" debate by gathering signatures on a rare discharge petition has been met with resistance from House leadership and conservatives. The petition requires 218 signatures to initiate the debate, with all 193 House Democrats expected to sign on, they are just two signatures away from this threshold. However, as Congress is currently in an 11-day holiday recess, this effort is temporarily on hold, allowing all party members to contemplate their future strategies. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face difficult re-election campaigns in their districts in November, making this issue particularly sensitive. The DACA debate has been ongoing since President Trump terminated the program last September, urging Congress to devise a permanent legislative solution. Upon their return to Washington, lawmakers face a critical deadline, as June 7 is the last possible date for the petition to mature before the seven-week summer recess begins. Representative Jeff Denham, a leader of the petition effort, has expressed that talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus have been productive. The caucus, a conservative voting bloc, seeks significant security concessions in return for a citizenship pathway for DACA recipients. Denham claims that an agreement in principle for a 12-year path to citizenship for Dreamers has been reached, but the challenge lies in putting that information on paper. The conference on June 7 will likely be the determining factor for any progress on this issue. House leadership may hold certain concerns or beliefs in this matter, such as: 1. Lawmakers need more vacation time, and as such an extended holiday or summer recess may be necessary. 2. They may think the \\"queen of the hill\\" debate is an inappropriate approach or does not adhere to regular legislative procedures. 3. House leadership could worry that President Trump will not approve the immigration bill, rendering their efforts futile or politically divisive. 4. They might believe that there is not enough information available to properly address the DACA recipients' issue, border security measures, and the overall immigration policy. Regardless of these concerns, the immigration issue remains a pressing matter in the U.S., and the fate of Dreamers in particular hangs in the balance. It is crucial for all sides to engage in productive discussions and strive to find a solution that both respects the rule of law and acknowledges the unique circumstances these young people face."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, You are given an amazon food product review and its summary.

Article: When people reunite with their loved ones, it's usually a wildly happy moment. But what is their most common response to seeing them again? It may seem strange, but most of the time they break down in tears. Now a group of psychologists from Yale University in the US say they have found the reason why, and that crying tears of joy may well be the body's way of restoring emotional balance. \\" _ seem to take place when people are unable to tolerate strong positive emotions, and people who do this seem to recover better from those strong emotions,\\" Oriana Aragon, the lead researcher, told The Telegraph. Aragon and her fellow psychologists looked at hundreds of participants' emotional responses to different things, including happy reunions and cute babies. Many participants said they would react in a negative or aggressive way to the positive things -- to cry at happy moments and want to pinch a cute baby's face or even tell them \\"I want to eat you up!\\" But then researchers found that these people were able to calm down from strong emotions more quickly. \\"We want a happy, middle spot. Extreme is not good. It's hard on our bodies,\\" Aragon told The Washington Post. There are many other examples of times when people respond to a positive experience with a negative emotional reaction. At an exciting concert, fans scream in horror at their idols. People who have just had a big lottery win are often in floods of tears. \\"These findings advance our understanding of how people express and control their emotions, which is importantly related to mental and physical health, the quality of relationship with others, and even how well people work together,\\" said Aragon. The psychologists then went further and claimed that the reverse was also true. Strong negative feelings may also bring out positive expressions. For example, people often laugh when they are nervous or they are in a difficult or frightening situation. Also, have you ever seen a character smiling at a time of extreme sadness in a movie?

David Petraeus, the outgoing top commander of the NATO forces in Afghanistan, formally  transferred authority Monday to incoming commander Marine Corps Gen.  John Allen. Several senior Afghan and NATO officials, including U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen, attended the change-of-command ceremony in Kabul. \\"Throughout, we will keep our eyes on the horizon -- the future  of Afghanistan, \\" Allen told the audience, \\" a nation of free people at  peace, governed under its constitution, pursuing economic enterprise and  development, in a secure and stable environment free from the extremism and  terrorism that has plagued this wonderful country and its people for more than a  generation. In the end -- together we  will prevail.\\" He inherits a force that is coming under renewed attack just as NATO prepares to begin the first phase of handing over provincial security to Afghan security forces. On Monday, three service members with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force were killed in a blast in eastern Afghanistan. Their deaths bring to 34 the number of international troops who have died in Afghanistan in July.. Since the start of this year, 314 coalition soldiers have died in the country. For his part, Petraeus plans to retire from the Army at the end of August and assume the CIA director's job September 6. \\"I wanted this job,\\" Petraeus, 58, said at his Senate confirmation hearing. \\"I am taking off the uniform I have worn for 37 years to do this the right way.\\" Dubbed King David for turning around what seemed like a losing battle as top U.S. commander in Iraq before he went to Afghanistan, Petraeus  is considered a top general in his era, with Esquire magazine naming him one of  the most influential people of the 21st century. He took over in Afghanistan on July 4 last year  unexpectedly after a Rolling Stone magazine article prompted the  resignation of Gen. Stanley McChrystal. \\"We've jokingly said that I went to the White House for the monthly  National Security Council meeting on Afghanistan and Pakistan with  President Obama, and came out with a new job,\\" Petraeus said. \\"And  that's not far from the truth.\\" The U.S. military is losing the architect of modern-day counterinsurgency operations. Petraeus wrote his doctorate dissertation on the lessons America learned in Vietnam. Later, he devised the Army/Marine field manual, challenging the military to think differently about how it relates to the civilian population in dealing with a bloody insurgency. This week, ahead of his departure, Petraeus assessed the results of his strategy in Afghanistan. \\"What we have done is implement the so-called NATO comprehensive approach, a civil-military campaign ... that does indeed embody many of the principles of the counterinsurgency field manual that we developed back in 2006, and which we employed in Iraq in the surge of 2007-2008,\\" he said in an interview with NATO-TV. \\"I think generally, it has borne fruit.\\" He said it has been a difficult journey, rife with setbacks, but coalition forces have halted the momentum of the Taliban in much of the country and reversed the insurgent hold in restive Helmand province. Petraeus' experience in working with the CIA on counterinsurgency efforts in the field was cited as a reason for his nomination as the spy agency's director. CNN's David Ariosto, Moni Basu and Samson Desta contributed to this report. Write highlights for this article.","output":"General David Petraeus was the top commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan. He gave his position to General John Allen, who is now in charge. They had a special ceremony to do this. General Petraeus has done important work to stop bad people causing problems in Afghanistan and Iraq. He will now stop being a soldier and be the leader of a group called the CIA. This group helps the country be safe by finding information about dangerous things happening in the world. General Allen will work with people from different countries to make Afghanistan safe and peaceful. Some people have died trying to do this, but they hope to help Afghanistan become a better place in the end."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Gloriously irascible, the 27 year-old Scot mentally and technically outmuscled Tomas Berdych in what became something of a grudge match to reach his fourth Australian Open final at the Rod Laver Arena on Thursday. After a shaky start Murray played superbly – as well as he has done since winning Wimbledon – to advance 6-7 (6-8), 6-0, 6-3, 7-5 in three hours and 26 minutes. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Australian Open: Murray wins 6-7 (6-8) 6-0 6-3 7-5 against Berdych. Andy Murray is through to the Australian Open final after beating Tomas Berdych in four sets in Melbourne. Murray shows his delight after booking his place in the Australian Open final for the fourth time in his career. Murray and Berdych shake hands after an intense semi-final showdown that lasted just shy of three and a half hours. Murray's fiancee Kim Sears celebrates her partner's victory on Thursday at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne. Murray fought back from a set down to beat Berdych 6-7, 6-0, 6-3, 7-5 in a match that lasted almost three and a half hours. Murray will play either Novak Djokovic or Stanislas Wawrinka in the Australian Open final on Sunday in Melbourne. There was little love lost in a contest which was transformed after Berdych said something at the changeover following the first set that clearly riled Murray. It had been boiling up before then, and even the normally demure Kim Sears became unusually animated, caught uttering the odd oath in the supporters' box. Murray admitted afterwards that there was an unusual edge to it all, given that he was in opposition to his ex-coach Dani Vallverdu for the first time. He drew on that, as was obvious when he broke back in the first set and directed his celebration towards his opponent's box. It might have been habit, but probably not. 'There was a little bit of extra tension, it was a big match,' said Murray. 'A lot was made of Dani working with him. We have been friends since we were 15 years old. I thought it was a bit unfair to create a bit of extra tension out of it but it was there. Everyone calmed down after a bit.' Murray looked in supreme form again - as he has done for the past fortnight over in Melbourne. Dani Vallverdu, Murray's former coach, watches on from Berdych's box and Murray admitted that added 'extra tension' Murray gestures after losing the opening set on a tiebreak after fighting back from 5-3 down. The sun peaks through on a mild Australian evening in Melbourne as thousands watch inside the Rod Laver Arena. Berdych later explained what he said when the two passed at the changeover that seemed to annoy Murray. 'I really remember it well. I say to myself \\"well done Tomas\\". That’s it. I think I’m allowed to do that when I win a set. What, I have to be worried about every word I am going to say? I just pumped myself up for winning the first set then sat on the chair. Maybe next time I should stay even more calm, and that’s it. It was a great battle a good match, unfortunately with a bad end for me.' Murray, the 27 year-old Scot, also wanted to prove a point about his hiring of Amelie Mauresmo, saying: 'A lot of people criticised me working with her and I think so far this week we've shown that women can be very good coaches as well. 'Madison Keys who reached the semis here and had her best tournament is also coached by a woman in Lindsay Davenport and I see no reason why that can't keep moving forward like that in the future. 'I'm very thankful for Amelie for doing it. It was a brave choice from her to do it and hopefully I can repay her in a few days.' Murray fought back in the second set - beating Berdych to love in a stunning half hour of tennis. Murray had plenty of British supporters in the crowd as he looked to progress to the final. Berdych celebrates winning the first set after holding his nerve in the tiebreak. The No 6 seed added: 'I was obviously disappointed to lose the first set. I had a couple of chances at the end and break points at 5-5. I felt like I started to play better as the set went on and tried to stick to my game and was then very aggressive at the start of the second set. 'I changed tactics a little bit but also I was getting more comfortable with the conditions and the heavy ball that Tomas hits. In the second set I made him do most of the running. I started dictating the points, getting the first strike in. After losing a tough set like the first it as important to get the momentum back.' The reward is a fiendishly tough final, against either the world No 1 Novak Djokovic or defending champion Stan Wawrinka, who face off on Friday. Murray will have an extra day to recover, although historically that has never been a huge advantage here. Murray had to hurdle some advertising hoardings during an intense third set - which he eventually won. Murray's fiancee Sears watches on nervously at Rod Laver Arena as the semi-final unfolds on Thursday. Ester Satorova was also there to cheer on her fiancee Berdych - but he ultimately went down to Murray. Singer Kenny Rogers and former player Evonne Goolagong Cawley watched on from the stands as Murray progressed comfortably. On whether he would be watching their semi-final, Murray said: 'I will definitely watch a little bit but judging by their matches in the last couple of years here I might be in bed before they're finished. So far both have been playing fantastic tennis so whoever has got tickets for that is very lucky.' Less contentiously than the spats, there were also several technical aspects that underpinned one of the more memorable victories of Murray's career. The Scot's first serve was excellent, particularly the slider he has perfected out to the deuce court. His movement was superb, and he frequently outmaneuvered the 6ft 5in Czech around the baseline. A tendency of Berdych has been to serve in a predictable fashion, and when he tried to push Murray wide with the serve the British No 1 was more agile to respond, and he began to read it perfectly from the second set onwards. Berdych, the perennial nearly man, could not adjust his thinking as much as the master tactician Murray, who is now in his eighth grand slam final. The Czech didn't get a sniff after winning the tiebreak, with Murray far too strong for him. Murray pulled Berdych apart after losing the first set and goes into his fourth Australian Open final. Wimbledon 2013 - beat Novak Djokovic 6-4, 7-5, 6-4. Australian Open 2013 - lost to Novak Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 3-6, 2-6. US Open 2012 - beat Novak Djokovic 7-6, 7-5, 2-6, 3-6, 6-2.

Setting: Paris, France Plot: Act 1: Avery Collins, a recent American college graduate with a degree in Music, arrives in Paris to explore her love for jazz. After finding a local guide, Julien, to show her the best sites and jazz clubs, they stumble into a hidden gem called \\"The Parisian Euphony,\\" a legendary underground jazz club founded during the 1920s by an African-American expatriate, Joseph Collins. This intimate venue has a rich history and has hosted some of the most famous Jazz artists like Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, and Django Reinhardt.

Act 2: Determined to keep the club's legacy alive, Avery learns to play Jazz with Julien, an accomplished jazz guitarist, and gradually integrates herself into the club's tight-knit community of musicians and patrons. Her ambition to restore the club to its former grandeur sets off a series of events that attract the attention of a wealthy real estate developer, Antoine Lefèvre, who has plans to repurpose the prime location for a luxury hotel complex. Avery and Julien then learn that the club is on the brink of foreclosure and must take immediate actions to save it. Simultaneously, Avery's research into her family history reveals that she is a direct descendant of Joseph Collins, who not only contributed significantly to the Parisian jazz scene but was also part of the French Resistance during World War II. Deeply moved by her connection to the club's founder, Avery becomes even more determined to preserve the club's vibrant history and the spirit of her ancestor. Act 3: As the looming threat of the club's closure grows, Avery and Julien devise a plan to host a grand benefit concert, inviting some of the biggest names in the Jazz world to perform, including a renowned jazz musician who got their start at the very venue, Nathalie Dupont. With Avery's passion for the cause and Julien's connections within the Parisian jazz scene, the concert garners widespread attention among the Parisian cultural community and draws the interest of a wealthy and mysterious benefactor, Mr. Girard. The benefit concert is a smashing success, with Nathalie Dupont delivering a soul-stirring tribute to Joseph Collins and the rich history of Parisian Jazz.

He had never had any pets before, but was always excited to see the other dogs and cats in his neighborhood. Since his birthday was in June, he spent a lot of time playing outside with his new puppy, which he named Max. Max and Joey would often run through fields in a game of chase. They also liked to go through the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek. They never went near the lake because Joey was afraid of water. One day, Max hid a little too well and Joey couldn't find him. Joey spent the afternoon looking for his German Shepherd where they often played, like the field and forest. Joey was a shy boy who often read by himself, and Max was his best friend. After dinner, he went to look for Max one last time before he had to take a bath and go to bed. He heard some barking on the next street, so he ran to see if it was his puppy. Sure enough, he saw Max playing with a poodle. The dogs were having so much fun.

One of the uses for scales that assess sexual orientation is determining what the prevalence of different sexual orientations are within a population. Depending on subject's age, culture and sex, the prevalence rates of homosexuality vary depending on which component of sexual orientation is being assessed: sexual attraction, sexual behavior, or sexual identity. Assessing sexual attraction will yield the greatest prevalence of homosexuality in a population whereby the proportion of individuals indicating they are same sex attracted is two to three times greater than the proportion reporting same sex behavior or identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Furthermore, reports of same sex behavior usually exceed those of gay, lesbian, or bisexual identification.

The band's members are Adam Lazzara (lead vocals), John Nolan (lead guitar, keyboards, vocals), Eddie Reyes (rhythm guitar), Shaun Cooper (bass guitar) and Mark O'Connell (drums). The band has released three studio albums with various past members Fred Mascherino (guitar, vocals), Matthew Rubano (bass guitar), and Matthew Fazzi (guitar, keyboards, vocals). On June 10, 2005, it was announced that the band had signed with major label Warner Bros. Records and would begin recording their third album later in 2005. That month, the group contributed \\"Error: Operator\\" to the video-game adaption of Fantastic Four, and it was later added to the film's soundtrack as well.  On September 21, 2005, it was announced that Taking Back Sunday had begun recording their third album with Eric Valentine. The group chose Valentine because he had produced Queens of the Stone Age's Songs for the Deaf (2002) and Third Eye Blind's self-titled album (1997). On April 25, 2006, Taking Back Sunday released their third album, entitled Louder Now, on Warner Bros. Records. The members' comments on the album reflected the dramatic change the band had undergone in the two years since their last release. Matt Rubano noted that the move to a major label was not something the band took lightly, but it was a move that made sense given the band's tumultuous past. Lazzara stated that fans seemed to feel their live shows had more energy than their recordings, and that Louder Now brought more of that across.  Taking Back Sunday received mainstream exposure by appearing on the late night talk shows The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and Late Night with Conan O'Brien, as well as the teen drama Degrassi: The Next Generation in an episode entitled \\"What's It Feel Like To Be A Ghost?\\".  In December 2006, the band released its first documentary, Louder Now: PartOne, featuring behind-the-scenes tour footage and four live concerts. Following months of touring to support Louder Now, Taking Back Sunday appeared in the American leg of Live Earth on July 7, 2007. During the summer of 2007, Taking Back Sunday was also a part of Linkin Park's Projekt Revolution tour, along with My Chemical Romance, HIM, and several other bands.  On October 30, 2006, the band's former record label, Victory Records, released Notes from the Past, which featured four songs from Tell All Your Friends, six songs from Where You Want To Be, and two B-sides: The Ballad of Sal Villanueva and Your Own Disaster ('04 mix). The band then released Louder Now: Part Two on November 20, 2007, a DVD of unreleased live concert footage from their show at Long Beach Arena in Long Beach, California, which included special features such as the video for \\"Twenty-Twenty Surgery\\", made to be released in Europe. The DVD was packaged with a companion CD featuring eight live tracks, two B-sides that were previously unreleased in America, and a special \\"Twelve Days of Christmas\\" track. In 2007, the band contributed the song \\"What's It Feel Like to Be a Ghost?\\" to the soundtrack for the science fiction action film Transformers, although the song did not appear in the film.

ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. What did the friars record on their parchment scrolls?

The project to build a base on the moon will begin soon after 2020, with astronauts living there within four years. The project comes after several excellent scientists and environmentalists asked humans to look beyond Earth to ensure the survival of the species  . Eventually, the moon will be a base for humans to explore the solar system and one day land on Mars. NASA began planning for the first moon landing since 1972 when George Bush, the US president, announced his new plan for space exploration four years ago. NASA has already talked about the design of the Orion spacecraft that will replace the old space shuttle fleet in 2010. The plan for the moon base, however, is the first detailed explanation of how NASA intends to prepare for the first manned exploration of deep space and a possible Mars mission within 30 years. Scientists also believe that the south pole on the moon contain rich natural gases such as the rare helium-3 that could be used as fuel for the generation of nuclear power. Besides, teams of astronauts living there for six months at a time would mine for hydrogen and oxygen to make water and possibly rocket fuel.

Vinalhaven, situated in Knox County, is a part of the Fox Islands in Penobscot Bay. The referenced island community building built in 1911-12 is the Vinalhaven Town Office & Memorial Library building, which is also known as the 'Home for Aged People.' The Vinalhaven Town Office & Memorial Library building is an impressive three-story edifice constructed in a High Victorian Gothic architectural style. Designed by prominent architect Carl F. Bryant, this community building served multiple purposes, including as a library, town offices, and meeting place for the island's residents. Originally funded by a donation of 15,000 by two leading Vinalhaven islanders William A. Calderwood and John O. Woster, the building was specifically constructed to cater to various purposes, thereby fulfilling their vision of a multi-use community space for the island residents. In its initial years, the community building housed the town offices, public meeting spaces, a library, and a designated area for the elderly. Over the years, the island's population has fluctuated, and the building continues to be utilized for official and public purposes, though the facilities and their usage have evolved. The Vinalhaven Town Office & Memorial Library building holds significant historical value and reflects the rich heritage and solidarity of the Vinalhaven island community. This symbol of community effort was built over a century ago and still stands as a central meeting point and purposeful space for the town's inhabitants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both questions are inquiring about the time required to prepare for the CAT exam. So the answer to your question is, II. yes, these two questions are asking the same thing. Now, let's address the primary question regarding the preparation time for the CAT examination. The Common Admission Test (CAT) is a highly competitive exam conducted by the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) for admission to postgraduate management courses in prestigious management institutes across India. The duration of preparation for the CAT exam varies depending on the individual's academic background, familiarity with the test format, and personal learning pace. On average, most candidates require 6 to 12 months of intense preparation to achieve a good score on the CAT exam. However, it is essential to remember that this is just a general guideline and can differ from one candidate to another. Factors that can influence the duration of preparation include: 1. Academic background: If a candidate has a strong foundation in Mathematics, Logical Reasoning, and English, they may require less time for preparation than someone who needs to build or strengthen these fundamentals. 2. Prior exposure to similar exams: Candidates who have previously appeared for similar aptitude tests may be familiar with the test format and question patterns, which may reduce preparation time. 3. Study schedule: A consistent and comprehensive study schedule can help candidates cover the vast syllabus effectively and make the best use of the available time. Moreover, balancing work or other commitments with study time can impact preparation duration. 4. Learning resources: Access to quality learning materials, coaching classes, and mock tests can help candidates get a better understanding of the exam format and difficulty levels. This can contribute to a more focused and efficient preparation process. 5. Individual learning pace: Every candidate has a unique learning style and pace. Some may grasp concepts faster, while others might need more time for in-depth understanding and practice. To ensure adequate preparation, it's crucial to start by evaluating your academic strengths and weaknesses, set realistic goals tailored to your individual needs, develop a strategic study plan, and regularly review your progress. Regular mock tests, performance analysis, and focused improvement will play a vital role in determining your optimal CAT exam preparation duration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: He got a job dancing and waving an advertisement, he got to be outside instead of stuck inside the what? Possible A: advertisement, magazine, store, web page, bus  Why is \\"store\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Store\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense in the context of the question because it provides a logical and relatable scenario. When we break down the question and the given information, we can understand why \\"store\\" makes the most sense. Question: He got a job dancing and waving an advertisement, he got to be outside instead of stuck inside the what? The question describes a situation or a job where the individual is required to dance and wave an advertisement. From this context, we can deduce that the person must have been involved in some form of promotional activity or marketing campaign. It is common for businesses and stores to hire people to dance, wear costumes, or wave signs outdoors to attract customers' attention and increase foot traffic inside the establishment. Now, let's analyze each possible answer: A. Advertisement This option doesn't make sense as an answer because the question already mentions the individual waving an advertisement. Being stuck inside an advertisement isn't a plausible scenario, as advertisements are not physical places. B. Magazine A magazine, like an advertisement, is not a physical location where a person can be \\"stuck inside.\\" Magazines contain advertisements but are not directly related to the context. C. Store A store is a physical location where people work, shop, and conduct business transactions. A person can be inside a store and interact with customers or perform various tasks related to the job. So, the individual's prior job could have been an indoor position at a store. The new job as an advertisement waver allows them to be outside in contrast to their previous role. D. Web page A web page is a digital platform, not a physical location, so it doesn't align with human common sense to be a suitable answer. People cannot be physically \\"stuck inside\\" a web page. E. Bus Although a bus is a physical location, it doesn't align with the context of the question. Generally, buses are not associated with dancing or waving advertisements. Individuals who work in buses typically have roles such as drivers or ticket collectors. Based on this analysis, \\"store\\" is the most aligned answer with human common sense because it offers a relevant and plausible scenario. A person working inside a store as an employee, and later obtaining a job as a dancer or waver for an advertisement, would likely appreciate the opportunity to work outdoors instead of being confined within the store premises. This connection between the two job environments makes \\"store\\" a sensible choice in this context."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Last year, during the month of October, something very interesting happened to him. Now remember, October is that fun month when you go trick-or-treating on Halloween! But our story is not about Halloween candy. It’s all about computers and email. You see, an email is like a letter, but instead of sending it through the mail with a stamp, people send it through the internet. It's like when mommy sends a message to daddy when he's away at work. But sometimes, people want to peek into others' letters, which is not nice at all. And this is what our friend Mohareb was accused of doing - sneaking a peek into his friend’s email without them knowing! Hacking, the term used to describe what Mohareb allegedly did, is a bit like opening someone else's toy chest without their permission. Imagine if one of your friends came into your room and opened your treasure box of toys without asking you. They would find all your special things inside, and you might not feel safe anymore.   This is how Mohareb's colleague must have felt when they thought their email account was being looked into. Just like you would protect your favourite toys, they called for help to protect their emails. So, what happened to Mohareb after he was accused? Well, he was arrested. That might sound a little scary, but it's like when you break a rule, you might get a time out, so you can think about what you did wrong. When grown-ups break important rules, like not respecting others' privacy, they sometimes have to deal with more serious consequences like getting arrested.

With Bono's schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions stretched through August 2000.Released in October of that year, All That You Can't Leave Behind was seen by critics as a \\"back to basics\\" album, on which the group returned to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound. For many of those not won over by the band's forays into dance music, it was considered a return to grace; Rolling Stone called it U2's \\"third masterpiece\\" alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The album debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 12 million copies. Its lead single, \\"Beautiful Day\\", was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Ireland, the UK, Australia, and Canada, while peaking at number 21 in the US. The song earned Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Record of the Year. At the awards ceremony, Bono declared that U2 were \\"reapplying for the job ... [of] the best band in the world\\".

Q:-  The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood  What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"The last step of the process after the liver releases glucose into the blood is the restoration of blood sugar levels to a normal range. This is achieved through the following sequence of events: 1. As glucose is released into the bloodstream by the liver, blood sugar levels begin to rise. This increase in blood glucose is detected by the body's various monitoring systems, particularly the pancreatic cells responsible for producing and releasing hormones involved in glucose regulation. 2. When blood sugar levels return to a normal range, the alpha cells in the pancreas, responsible for glucagon secretion, stop producing and releasing glucagon. This action helps to prevent further breakdown of glycogen into glucose, thereby preventing blood glucose levels from rising too high. 3. At the same time, the beta cells in the pancreas detect the rise in blood glucose levels and respond by producing and releasing insulin. 4. Insulin is a hormone that helps cells throughout the body to absorb and utilize glucose for energy. Its presence signals the cells to take in glucose from the blood, which further helps to stabilize and maintain normal blood sugar levels. In summary, the last step of the process is the restoration of blood sugar levels to a normal range, which is achieved through the interplay of pancreatic hormones (glucagon and insulin) and their regulation of glucose production, release, and absorption by the liver, muscles, and other tissues throughout the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was one of the happiest Saturday mornings I had spent with my little daughter, Gigi. That is, until two strangers threw her into their car and sped away. It seemed like a bad dream. I could barely whisper when the police questioned me. For hours we waited,but there was no word on the whereabouts of the car. Tears would start to come. Then nothing. I was numb with fear. \\"Go home, Ma'am,\\" the police officer said. \\"I'll have someone drive you. We'll also want to monitor your telephone. The kidnappers might call, and we'll want to keep track. Trust me, these guys can't get far. \\" After what had just happened, it was hard for me to trust anything.

Hundreds of reporters waited outside the court, in the hope of learning \\"shocking\\" information about the case, which includes well-known military singer Li Shuangjiang's son, who gang-raped a woman with another four men on February. The case was not a public hearing because it includes teenagers, whose privacy must be protected under law, but many details had been exposed by the lawyers before the trial.

Article: Traffic Management Traffic lights are key tools for regulating traffic How.They are not, however, perfect.Drivers exchange the traffic jams that would happen at unmanaged crossings for a pattern of stop-go movement that can still be annoying, and which bums more fuel than a smooth passage would.  Creating such a smooth passage means adjusting a vehicle's speed so that it always arrives at the lights when they are green.That is theoretically possible, but practically hard.Roadside signs wired to traffic lights can help get the message across a couple hundred metres from a crossing, but such signs are expensive, and are not widespread.Margaret Martonosi and Emmanouil Koukoumidis at Princeton University, and Li-Shiuan Peh at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however, have an idea that could make the process cheaper and more effective.Instead of a hardwired network of signs, they propose to use mobile-phone applications. For a driver to benefit, lie must load the team's software , named SignalGuru, into his phone and then put it on a special thing attached to the inside of his car's windscreen, with the camera lens   pointing forward.SignalGuru is designed to detect traffic lights and track their status as red, yellow or green.It broadcasts this information to other phones in the area that are fitted with the same software, and --if there are enough of them ?the phones thus each know the status of most of the lights around town.Using this information, SignalGuru is able to calculate the traffic-light schedule for the area and suggest the speed at which a driver should travel in order  to avoid red lights. Tests in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where five drivers were asked to follow the same route for three hours, and in Singapore, where eight drivers were asked to follow one of two routes for 30 minutes, revealed that SignalGuru was capable of predicting traffic-light activity with an accuracy of 98.2% and 96.3% respectively, in the two cities.This was particularly impressive because in Cambridge the lights...

Mesozoic The Early Jurassic spans from 200 million years to 175 million years ago. The climate was much more humid than the Triassic, and as a result, the world was very tropical. In the oceans, Plesiosaurs, Ichthyosaurs and Ammonites fill waters as the dominant races of the seas. On land, dinosaurs and other reptiles stake their claim as the dominant race of the land, with species such as Dilophosaurus at the top. The first true crocodiles evolved, pushing out the large amphibians to near extinction. All-in-all, reptiles rise to rule the world.

If you still feel strongly about becoming a sannyasa, you can ask the ashram leaders about the process to join officially. Question 2: Asking if Osho was a genuine person means to ask if he was truly honest and sincere in his teachings and actions. Some people believe he was genuine, while others have different opinions. It's important to learn more about him and decide for yourself if you think he was genuine or not. So, the two questions are not the same thing.

Last year, more than 5,000 petitions were filed in Idaho for protection orders in domestic violence cases. More than 12,000 victims contacted shelters or crisis hotlines.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the first name of the person who was only fourteen when wed?  At the court in Ferrara, a collection of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest. This group, which led to the formation of the concerto delle donne, performed within the context of the Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to the court in 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers. The Duke did not announce the creation of a professional, all-female ensemble; instead, the group infiltrated and gradually dominated the musica secreta, so that after the dismissal of Brancaccio for insubordination in 1583, no more male members of the musica secreta were hired. Even when Brancaccio was performing with the consort it was referred to as a ladies' ensemble, because women singing together was the most exciting aspect of the group. This new ensemble, the concerto delle donne, was created by Alfonso in part to amuse his young new wife, Margherita Gonzaga d'Este (she was only fourteen when they wed in 1579), and in part to help the Duke achieve his artistic goals for the court. According to Grana, a contemporary correspondent, \\"Signora Machiavella [Lucrezia], Signora Isabella, and Signora Vittoria have abandoned the field, having lost the backing of Luzzaschi\\". The first recorded performance by the professional ladies was on November 20, 1580; by carnival season in 1581, they were performing together regularly.This new \\"consort of ladies\\" was viewed as an extraordinary and novel phenomenon; most witnesses did not connect the second period of the concerto delle donne with the group of ladies who sang in...

Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza.

Which official knocks three times on the doors to the chamber of the House of Commons at the state opening of a British parliament????","output":"The official who knocks three times on the doors to the chamber of the House of Commons at the state opening of a British parliament is known as the Black Rod. The Black Rod is a senior officer within the parliamentary administration, whose full title is the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod or Lady Usher of the Black Rod, depending on the holder's gender. The Black Rod plays a crucial role in the ceremonial opening of the British parliament, known as the State Opening of Parliament, which marks the beginning of a parliamentary session. The State Opening of Parliament is an event attended by the British monarch, who delivers the Queen's Speech, outlining the government's agenda for the upcoming parliamentary session. It is a highly formalized occasion, steeped in tradition and rich in symbolism. The event begins with the preparation and securing of the Palace of Westminster, which houses both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Members of the House of Lords, the upper house of the British parliament, then gather in their chamber, awaiting the arrival of the monarch. Meanwhile, the members of the House of Commons, the lower house of the British parliament, assemble in their own chamber, presided over by the Speaker of the House of Commons. The Black Rod is responsible for summoning the members of the House of Commons to attend the Queen's Speech in the House of Lords. To do this, the Black Rod proceeds from the House of Lords to the House of Commons, accompanied by an entourage of parliamentary officials. Upon reaching the entrance of the House of Commons' chamber, the ritual knocking takes place. The doors to the chamber are slammed shut in the face of the Black Rod, symbolizing the independence of the House of Commons and its resistance to the influence of the monarch. The Black Rod then knocks three times on the door with their staff, a three-foot-long ebony rod topped with a gold lion, from which the title \\"Black Rod\\" originates. The knocking is a request for permission to enter the chamber and summon the MPs to the House of Lords. Following the knocking, the door to the House of Commons chamber is opened, and the Black Rod enters the chamber, bowing to the Speaker of the House. They then announce to the assembled MPs, \\"The Queen commands this Honourable House to attend Her Majesty immediately in the House of Peers.\\" This summons the MPs to proceed to the House of Lords and hear the Queen's Speech. The MPs follow the Black Rod into the House of Lords, led by the Speaker and other ceremonial figures. This elaborate ritual at the State Opening of Parliament emphasizes the centuries-old power dynamics between the monarchy, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons, as well as the roles they play in the British constitutional structure. The Black Rod's role as the official who knocks three times on the chamber door highlights the importance of tradition and ceremonial proceedings in British parliamentary life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:I can use this background: Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility.  Now, I have a new situation: David is a physician with the children's hospital. He is seeing four patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, and patient D. Patient A is a male with Klinefelter's syndrome. Patient B is female with Turner syndrome. Patient C is a male and does not have any of these illnesses. Patient D is a female and she too does not have any of these illnesses.  Answer this question please: Would patient B be shorter or taller than patient D? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, Turner syndrome causes characteristic features such as short stature in affected females. Since Patient B is a female with Turner syndrome and Patient D is a female without any of these illnesses, Patient B would likely be shorter than Patient D.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: In all relationships, communication is key. Many fights and misunderstandings stem from a lack of communication. Going forward, it's important to be 100% honest about your actions and feelings in your friendship.  If an issue arises in the future, make it clear that you'd like to resolve those issues by talking with each other instead of talking to other people or doing something that either of you may regret. Bring issues up immediately instead of bottling up your feelings. When we suppress feelings and emotions, we are more likely to boil over and say or do something we regret. If a problem arises, address it right away. It is important to know what you and your friend expect out of a friendship in order for it to work. For example, you may deal with situations differently, or some things may bother you more than others. This is why you must establish expectations.  Tell your friend what you need from them in a friendship. Being honest will help your friend to better meet your needs. Explain to your friend what you need from them using the \\"I-message\\" formula: \\"I feel _____ when you _______ and I need for you to _______.\\" Refrain from assigning blame to your friend, though. Ask your friend what they need from you in a friendship. Again, friendship is a two-way street. Therefore, you need to meet your friends needs as well. Ask them to be honest about how you can be a better friend to them. Be ready to meet both needs. Resolution begins when you start understanding each other and the situation. As you hear similar needs from each other, the differences are put aside and you are able to work things through. It's impossible to move forward if you are unable to forgive. Holding onto anger or grudges isn't healthy for you and will ruin any chance you have of a real friendship. It takes a lot of strength to forgive, but it will help you grow as a person and as a friend.  Tell your friend that you forgive them – it is an important factor in rebuilding trust for both of you. It will mean a lot to your friend to hear that you forgive them, and saying \\"I forgive you\\" will help you move on from the situation.  If you cannot forgive this person for their actions, you cannot be friends with him or her. Trying to have a relationship with someone you hold anger towards isn't healthy for you or for them.

Please answer the following question: Two brothers went to the doctor for their yearly examination. Liam found out he has high cholesterol, while Rudy found out his triglycerides and cholesterol are within normal parameters.  Which brother was more at risk for atherosclerosis?  Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. A:","output":"Based on the provided information and hint, it seems that Liam is more at risk for atherosclerosis. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. Atherosclerosis is a disorder in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of arterial walls. This leads to the formation of plaques that can restrict or block blood flow. 2. High cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. 3. Liam has been diagnosed with high cholesterol, while Rudy's cholesterol is within normal parameters. This indicates that Liam has a greater amount of cholesterol that could potentially contribute to plaque formation in his arteries. 4. Since the presence of cholesterol is a major factor in the development of atherosclerosis, and Liam has higher cholesterol levels than Rudy, it can be inferred that Liam is more at risk for developing atherosclerosis.

Who was World Chess Champion immediately prior to Bobby Fischer?","output":"The World Chess Champion immediately prior to Bobby Fischer was Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union (Russia). Boris Vasilievich Spassky was born on January 30, 1937, in Leningrad, USSR. He is a French-Russian grandmaster and former World Chess Champion. He was the tenth World Champion, holding the title from 1969 to 1972. Spassky won the crown from Tigran Petrosian and lost it to Bobby Fischer. His emphasis on logical and strategic play earned him a reputation as one of the most universal players of his era, being highly skilled in all aspects of the game. A prodigious talent in his youth, Spassky achieved major successes early in his career; he became an International Grandmaster in 1955 at the age of 18 and won the World Junior Championship in 1955, the USSR Chess Championship twice (1961, 1973), and the Mar del Plata tournament in 1960. In the 1969 World Championship match, Boris Spassky defeated Tigran Petrosian to become the World Champion. Over a period of two months, the two players competed in Moscow, Russia, with Spassky finally emerging as the victor 12.5 to 10.5, successfully claiming the world title. Spassky would go on to lose his World Championship title to Bobby Fischer, an American chess grandmaster, in what is arguably the most famous chess match in the history of the game, often referred to as the \\"Match of the Century.\\" The event took place in Reykjavík, Iceland, from July 11 to August 31, 1972. The Cold War tensions added to the significance of the match. The match captured the world's attention and was viewed as symbolizing the political confrontation between the two superpowers. Fischer's victory ended 24 years of Soviet domination of the World Championship. Following his loss, Spassky continued to be an active and strong player, competing in many tournaments and even contending for the World Championship title again, but he never regained the title. Besides Russia, he also represented France in the Chess Olympiad after he gained French citizenship in 1978. Boris Spassky is an important figure in the world of chess. Despite losing his title to Bobby Fischer, his skill and vast contribution to the game have left a lasting impact, making him one of the game's greats. His games, marked by a combination of tactical sharpness and strategic soundness, continue to be studied by aspiring players around the world."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Q: Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell in the third phase of what process?

Here is a question about this article: The \\"standard complement\\" of double winds and brass in the orchestra from the first half of the 19th century is generally attributed to Beethoven. The exceptions to this are his Symphony No. 4, Violin Concerto, and Piano Concerto No. 4, which each specify a single flute. The composer's instrumentation usually included paired flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns and trumpets. Beethoven carefully calculated the expansion of this particular timbral \\"palette\\" in Symphonies 3, 5, 6, and 9 for an innovative effect. The third horn in the \\"Eroica\\" Symphony arrives to provide not only some harmonic flexibility, but also the effect of \\"choral\\" brass in the Trio. Piccolo, contrabassoon, and trombones add to the triumphal finale of his Symphony No. 5. A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver \\"storm\\" and \\"sunshine\\" in the Sixth. The Ninth asks for a second pair of horns, for reasons similar to the \\"Eroica\\" (four horns has since become standard); Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussion—plus chorus and vocal soloists—in his finale, are his earliest suggestion that the timbral boundaries of symphony should be expanded.

Article: A lot of grown-ups worry that spending too much time playing video games isn't good for a kid's health. Now some doctors have noticed that kids who bring their hand-held game players to the hospital seem less worried about being there. These patients also seem to experience less pain when they are concentrating on a superhero adventure or a car race. At the Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Maryland, young patients are finding hospital visits easier to deal with, thanks to a test program called the Hospital-based On-line Pediatric Environment (HOPE). Patients in HOPE have a life-threatening condition where their kidneys no longer filter wastes from their blood. To get their blood cleaned, these kids must be hooked up to dialysis  machines at the hospital three times a week, for at least three hours each time. HOPE allows kids to play online sports, racing, and adventure games with each other. Eventually they will be able to connect with kids in other hospitals who are suffering from the same problem. \\"We want to use the power of the Internet to bring together kids who feel that they are separated by their illness, and let them know that they are not alone,\\" said Arun Mathews, the doctor who heads the program. He loves video games himself and got the idea to connect kids all over the country. Many researchers elsewhere are testing video game programs that might help young patients.

A 6-day-old Wisconsin baby who vanished from a home early Thursday has been found safe at an Iowa gas station, authorities said Friday. The U.S. attorney in Madison, Wisconsin, has filed charges of kidnapping against Kristen R. Smith, in the case of 6-day-old Kayden Powell, who was found at an Iowa gas station Friday after going missing from the child's Wisconsin home early Thursday. Smith took Kayden Powellt from a home in Wisconsin and transported the the infant across state lines to Iowa, the federal complaint against her claims. An officer found Kayden Powell Friday morning. The child was swaddled in blankets inside a tote bag at a West Branch, Iowa, gas station, according to Town of Beloit, Wisconsin, police Chief Steven Kopp. \\"Despite frigid temperatures, Kayden was found alive, and appears to be doing very well,\\" Kopp said. \\"In the words of EMS officials, he is in excellent health.\\" The baby was found outside the building, according to G.B. Jones, acting special agent in charge of the Milwaukee office of the FBI. \\"We're all very, very fortunate that this baby is alive,\\" Jones said. Smith was jailed Thursday in Iowa on an unrelated fraud warrant out of Texas after police investigating Kayden's disappearance contacted her on her cell phone and asked her to report to a nearby police station, authorities said. When police searched her car, they found baby clothes, but no sign of the infant, Kopp said Thursday. Kayden's mother is 18-year-old Brianna Marshall. Smith reportedly said at the home that she was Marshall's half-sister and that she, Marshall and the baby's father would be moving to Colorado, according to CNN affiliate WKOW.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who does the man that killed the bounty hunter's wife pay to help him? ?  A preacher witnesses his family and a group of refugees seeking shelter in his church murdered by a gang of ruthless outlaws led by Colonel Cusack.  After his wife makes him promise to never seek revenge, he instead becomes a bounty hunter. When he steps in to defend a woman in a saloon, the bad guy and his two friends (who happen to be allied with The Colonel), give him a beating and toss him into the street. A woman with a \\"past\\", named Maggie, takes him in to care for him. He stays in her extra room, but she insists he give up his gun while at her home because she has a daughter. The local sheriff, on Cusacks's payroll, is meanwhile trying to run off some squatters. The Sheriff's gang attempts to intimidate the squatters, but once The Preacher learns of the Sheriff's and The Colonel's dealings, he visits the squatters, who tell him they paid for the land but never got the deed. A few days later the Sheriff's posse burns down a few of the squatter's tents. The Preacher attempts to negotiate peacefully with the Sheriff, and so visits Cusack.  Cusack tries to persuade The Preacher to join his mob, which he refuses.  The Sheriff then sends a message to The Preacher by having some of his men rough up Maggie. Unarmed still because of his agreement with Maggie, The Preacher catches the gang in the act and overcomes one of the men's guns, scaring the men off. The Preacher gets his gun back from Maggie and sets out to visit the Squatters again, and is met by the Sheriff and some of his gang. The Preacher, now armed, tells the Sheriff that the squatters have a right to stay. Gunfire ensues, and The Preacher shoots the sheriff. The rest of the bad guys run off.

Similarities in embryos are evidence of common ancestry. All vertebrate embryos, for example, have gill slits and tails. Most vertebrates, except for fish, lose their gill slits by adulthood. Some of them also lose their tail. In humans, the tail is reduced to the tail bone. Thus, similarities organisms share as embryos may be gone by adulthood. This is why it is valuable to compare organisms in the embryonic stage.

Bob was a medical student and he studied drugs administered to people with viral diseases, while his colleague Liam decided to study other types of drugs, such as antibiotics and anticoagulants.  Which colleague studied less about the development of antiretroviral drugs? A:","output":"In this scenario, Liam, who decided to study other types of drugs such as antibiotics and anticoagulants, would have studied less about the development of antiretroviral drugs in comparison to Bob. Bob, the medical student who focused on drugs administered to people with viral diseases, would have been more involved in the study of antiretroviral drugs. Antiretroviral drugs are a class of medications that help suppress the replication of retroviruses within an infected person's body, specifically treating diseases like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Since antiretroviral drugs are specifically designed to target viral diseases, Bob's area of study would have naturally led him to learn more about these types of drugs and their development. On the other hand, Liam is focused on studying antibiotics and anticoagulants. Antibiotics are medications used in the treatment of bacterial infections. These drugs target and eliminate bacteria, not viruses; thus, they are less relevant to the study of antiretroviral drug development. Anticoagulants, also known as blood thinners, are medications that help prevent blood clots from forming or growing larger within the body. These drugs are used to treat or prevent various conditions, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. Anticoagulants do not address viruses or bacteria directly and would not typically be connected to antiretroviral drug development.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: \\"Room for improvement\\" Review: I'm giving the de.blinkt.openvpn app a 3-star rating, for it sits comfortably between brilliance and mediocrity. The ability to create a secure internet connection using a virtual private network on my mobile device is absolutely valuable in today's digital world. Moreover, the provision to allow safe and encrypted connections renders this app a worthy companion for web surfers. Difficulties start popping up from the initial setup. Despite being tech-savvy, I found the configuration process somewhat complicated and less user-friendly. A novice user may face even more hassles while setting up their VPN connection. Improved guidance with a simplified setup process would go a long way in boosting the user experience. The performance of the app isn't entirely stable. While it delivers fairly reliable connections most of the time, I have still experienced some fluctuating speeds. On some days my internet speed was fantastic with no noticeable lag, on others, it left much to be desired. Improvements on this front would deepen the usability of the app. One positive aspect I'd like to highlight is the minimalistic design and ease of navigation. Post-setup, hopping between different tabs and options doesn't feel like a chore. However, the app sometimes hangs and crashes, which disrupts the navigation experience. Stability updates could possibly rectify this issue. All in all, de.blinkt.openvpn has the potential to be a great app but falls short with some speed and stability issues. With more streamlined functionalities and stronger performance, I can easily see myself boosting my rating from a lukewarm three stars to an enthusiastic four or even a full five-star rating.  Justification:  The objective was to write a 3-star review based on the package de.blinkt.openvpn. A 3-star review implies that the app has both pros and cons, rather than being entirely good or bad.

Answer the question below:   Water furthest away from shore will have more or less dissolved nutrients than water near shore?    Assuming that:  Therefore, water nearer shore usually contains more dissolved nutrients than water farther from shore.","output":"Water nearest to the shore generally has more dissolved nutrients than water farther from the shore. This difference in nutrient concentration can be attributed to several factors. 1. Runoff: Water near the shore often receives runoff from land, which can contain organic materials, minerals, and other nutrients. These nutrients enter the nearshore water and dissolve, thereby increasing the concentration of nutrients close to the shore. 2. River inputs: Many rivers and streams discharge into the ocean or other water bodies, carrying nutrients from terrestrial environments. Water near the shore, where freshwater inputs are more significant, will have a higher concentration of dissolved nutrients than water further away from the shore. 3. Coastal upwelling: Coastal upwelling occurs when winds push surface water away from the shore, and cooler, nutrient-rich water from deeper areas rises to replace it. This process effectively brings nutrients from the deep ocean to the surface and increases the concentration of dissolved nutrients near the shore. 4. Mixing: Water near the shore, particularly in estuaries and bays, often experiences greater mixing due to tides, currents, and wind action. This mixing can bring nutrients from deeper waters to the surface, increasing dissolved nutrient concentrations near the shore. 5. Human activities: Anthropogenic sources, such as wastewater discharge and runoff from agricultural lands, can increase the nutrient concentration near the shore. These activities can introduce excess nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus into coastal waters, contributing to eutrophication. In contrast, water far from the shore has fewer of these nutrient sources, so it typically exhibits lower dissolved nutrient concentrations. This can lead to a more oligotrophic environment with lower primary productivity of phytoplankton and other organisms that rely on these nutrients to thrive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hillary also helped his home country, New Zealand, build a research center on Antarctica, called Scott Base. He visited it in January 2007, when he was 87 years old. In the 1900s, many people like Hillary saw Antarctica as an exciting place. Scientists are interested in how glaciers  flow and melt. They also worry that global  warming is making glaciers melt faster. It has caused a 75 percent increase in ice loss in the last 10 years, according to a new study. Scientists say ice loss could cause water levels around the world to rise faster than expected. Ice is melting faster than expected because of global warming. Researchers in Antarctica are studying many other subjects too. Some use the cold weather and clear air as a way to study things that affect other parts of the globe. Antarctica has the cleanest air in the world. That allows scientists to compare the air there to the air in polluted places. Antarctica is the darkest place on earth, so it is a great place to study the stars. Some scientists are even studying penguin droppings . They have developed a new test to learn more about penguins' diets. Question: The final result of global warming is that   _  . - there would be no ice - water levels could rise faster - the climate would become warm - the ocean would be polluted","output":"The final result of global warming mentioned in the article is that water levels could rise faster."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In 1943, when I was 4, my parents moved from Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, to Fairbanks, Alaska, where adventure was never very far away. We arrived in the summer, just in time to enjoy the midnight sun. All that sunlight was fantastic for Mom's vegetable garden. Working in the garden at midnight tended to throw her timing off, so she didn't care much about my bedtime. Dad was a Railway Express agent and Mom was his clerk. That left me in a mess. I usually managed to find some trouble to get into. Once I had a little Are going in the dirt basement of a hotel. I had tried to light a barrel  of paint but couldn't really get a good fire going. The smoke got pretty bad, though, and when 1 made my exit, a crowd and the police were there to greet me. The policemen took my matches and drove me Mom and Dad were occupied in the garden and Dad told the police to keep me, and they did! I had a tour of the prison before Mom rescued me. 1 hadn't turned 5 yet. As I entered kindergarten, the serious cold began to set in. Would it surprise you to know that I soon left part of my tongue on a metal handrail at school? As for Leonhard Seppala, famous as a dog sledder  , I think I knew him well because I was taken for a ride with his white dog team one Sunday. At the time I didn't realize what a superstar he was, but I do remember the ride well. I was wrapped   heavily and well sheltered from the freezing and blowing weather. In 1950, we moved back to Coeur d'Alene, but we got one more Alaskan adventure when Leonhard invited us eight years later by paying a visit to Idaho to attend a gathering of former neighbors of Alaska.

Translate this to English?","output":"The given statement is already in English. However, I can provide a more detailed and longer explanation of the statement to provide better understanding. The statement provided refers to how the majority of Russian citizens were supportive of the conclusion of autocratic rule in their country, despite having differing opinions on various other matters. Autocracy is a system of governance in which the ruler has unlimited power and authority. In the context of Russia, this most likely refers to the period of the Russian Empire and the reign of the Tsars, who had complete control and dominance over the nation's governance. Although the population of Russia celebrated the end of autocratic rule, it is important to note that their agreement on this subject did not mean they were united on all other aspects or beliefs of governance and policy. The Russian people had their own opinions, perspectives, and ideas on how their nation should progress, especially regarding what kind of political system should take place after the fall of autocracy. Some may have leaned towards a democratic or socialist system, while others would have preferred different forms of governance altogether. This diversity in thought and ideas highlights how, despite a shared agreement on the abolishment of autocracy, there were still significant differences among the Russian population, which would undoubtedly have had lasting implications for the nation's political landscape and its future. The statement essentially underscores the idea that reaching a compromise on one issue does not automatically guarantee agreement on all other matters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It tells us that the musician is wearing a brown coat and tennis shoes, but it does not provide any information about the condition or age of the tennis shoes. The hypothesis presented is: \\"The tennis shoes are old.\\" This is a speculative assumption or statement about the age or condition of the musician's tennis shoes. Comparing the hypothesis to the premise, we can see that the premise does not provide any information regarding the age or condition of the tennis shoes. The premise focuses solely on the musician's action (walking) and the fact that he is wearing tennis shoes and a brown coat. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is an assumption about the tennis shoes' age or condition. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the premise does not tell us whether the hypothesis is true. There is no information within the premise that confirms or denies the tennis shoes' age.

Answer:","output":"Monique Pronk, also known as Monica Maria Pronk, was born on 4th August 1958 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. She is a notable figure in the sport of rowing established in RIC, a renowned sports club in Amsterdam. This indicates her strong association with athletics and local sport organizations, which may have fostered her career. Monique possesses a competitive physique suitable for her sport; she weighs approximately 45 kilograms and stands 1.58 meters tall. These measurements are important considering that in a sport like rowing, a combination of strength, endurance, and agility, achieved through a balanced weight and height, can significantly impact performance. Driven by her passion for rowing, she dedicatedly pursued the sport at her home ground, embedding herself into Amsterdam's robust athletic culture. Even though comparing \\"Monica Maria Pronk\\" and \\"Monique Pronk,\\" suggests that she may have undergone a name change at some point, there remains little doubt about her recognition in the sporting domain of Amsterdam under both identities.  In conclusion, Monique Pronk, born in Amsterdam in 1958, serves as an exemplar of passion and discipline in the sport of rowing. She competes with impressive physical credentials and has made valuable contributions to Amsterdam's rich sporting heritage.   Why I wrote this: 1. I begin by introducing Monique Pronk, mentioning her full name and alternate name as listed in the facts. This is to clear any confusion if these two names refer to the same individual. Also, and very importantly, I mentioned her birthplace and birthdate to provide basic personal information right at the start. 2. Next, I touched on her career as a rower and her association with the Amsterdam-based sports club, RIC. This helps establish her professional background. 3. Following that, I described her weight and height. Since rowing is a physically demanding sport, it's critical to mention these aspects of her physique to illustrate her fitness for the sport. 4. Lastly, I concluded by summarizing her contributions to the sport and the impact she's had on Amsterdam's sporting scene.

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama  Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of  Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

Combine the translated segments into a sentence: \\"היית צריך להיות אוהב דרמה, ולהיות מאוד, מאוד מהיר\\" Note: Translating between two such different languages inevitably involves some interpretation and rearrangement.

He was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States, on August 30, 1901. He gained fame with his \\"Inside\\" books, a series of travelogues that provided readers with a detailed look at political, social, and economic aspects of different countries. His most well-known book, \\"Inside Europe\\" (1936), along with other successful works like \\"Inside Asia\\" (1939) and \\"Inside Africa\\" (1955), solidified his status as a distinguished American journalist, widely recognized for his chronicling of the world events and exploration of diverse cultures. So, in John Gunther's case, your assumption is correct; he is American. On the other hand, Halldór Laxness (1902-1998) was an Icelandic writer and a laureate of the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was born on April 23, 1902, in Reykjavik, Iceland. He is best known for his novels that delved into the sociopolitical landscape of Iceland and offered deep insights into human nature. His prominent works include \\"Independent People\\" (1934-35), \\"The Atom Station\\" (1948), and \\"World Light\\" (1937-40), among others. In 1955, Halldór Laxness was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his extraordinary and prominent authorship, which has granted him a lasting place in world literature. To clarify, Halldór Laxness is not an American but an Icelandic writer. In conclusion, while John Gunther was an American journalist and author, Halldór Laxness was an Icelandic writer. Although they both made significant contributions to literature and journalism, their nationalities differ, making it clear that not both are American."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

CHAPTER VIII  THE SEARCH FOR DICK  \\"Dick is taking his time, that's certain.\\"  The remark came from Sam, after the boys who had been left in the alleyway had waited the best part of half an hour for the elder Rover's reappearance.  \\"Perhaps he has found something of interest,\\" suggested Frank.  \\"And perhaps he has fallen into a trap,\\" put In Tom. \\"I've a good mind to hunt him up.\\"  \\"If you go I'll go with you,\\" said Sam.  \\"I don't want to be left out here alone,\\" said Frank. \\"Let us wait a little longer.\\"  The best part of an hour passed, but of course nothing was seen or heard of Dick.  \\"I shan't wait any longer,\\" began Tom, when they saw the front door of the tenement opened and two men hurried forth. Both had their hats pulled far down over their eyes and had their coat collars turned up, even though the night was warm.  \\"Out of sight!\\" cried Sam in a low voice, and they dropped down behind the stoop of the second tenement.  \\"One of those men was Buddy Girk!\\" ejaculated Tom, when the pair had passed up the alleyway.  \\"And don't you know who the other was?\\" demanded Sam. \\"It was Dan Baxter's father!\\"  \\"Impossible, Sam. Arnold Baxter is in the hospital, and--\\"  \\"It was Dan Baxter's father, as true as I'm born, Tom. No wonder he walked with a cane!

Answer the following question: The fruit harvest was awesome this year, so Mary decided to experiment by candying some raspberries, apricots and apples. She didn't candy plums, cherries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious.  Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apricots or cherries?  Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Mary decided to candy raspberries, apricots, and apples, and she didn't candy plums, cherries, or pears. The candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma, and tasted delicious. The process of candying fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, involves placing whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel in heated sugar syrup. The syrup absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. This process can take from several days to several months, depending on the fruit's size and type. Candying fruit allows it to retain its quality for a year, as the fruit becomes saturated with sugar. This sugar saturation prevents the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavorable osmotic pressure it creates. Considering that Mary candied apricots but not cherries, it is the apricots that are saturated with sugar within her selection of fruits. The cherries have not undergone the process of being turned into candied fruit, so they do not have the same sugar saturation or preservation benefits as the apricots, raspberries, and apples that Mary decided to candy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this product review negative? A:","output":"Yes, this product review is undeniably negative. The author expresses immense displeasure and dissatisfaction with the product in question and uses strong language and exclamation marks to emphasize their feelings. There are several indicators in the review highlighting the negativity: 1. The title itself - \\"Disgusting Review\\"     This indicates that the author finds the product repulsive and wants to warn others by giving it an extremely unfavorable title.     2. The use of strong negative language    Words like \\"WORST,\\" \\"AWFUL,\\" and \\"sick\\" demonstrate the author's distaste for the product and their inability to find any redeeming qualities in it. 3. Personal frustration and emotions    The reviewer expresses a desire to \\"smack\\" the girl involved in the product, which exhibits an emotional response of disgust and irritation. 4. Lack of comparison to others    The author states that they aren't even comparing the girl's talent to someone else (Amy Lee, in this case) since, in their eyes, the girl possesses no talent at all. 5. Not purchasing the product    The reviewer is relieved that they didn't waste their money buying the CD and only listened to the previews. This sentiment further reinforces the review's negative stance, as it shows the author didn't think the product was worth purchasing. 6. The closing statement    By ending the review with a declaration of the girl's lack of talent, the author solidifies the negative perspective on the product and leaves a lasting impression on potential buyers. Overall, the review is blatantly unfavorable, with the author employing various elements to passionately communicate their displeasure and aversion towards the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The barks of dogs surrounded me as I got off the bus. They ran around their cages jumping up and down. My heart became soft at the sight of these poor creatures. I entered the building and discovered more unwanted animals. A white rabbit jumped around in its cage. I walked around the shelter,screaming \\"oh\\" and \\"ah\\" at every animal,as they looked out of their cages,waiting for love and help. A pit bull particularly interested me. She was as gentle as a baby. I slightly touched her head with affection as she sat on the floor. The pit bull licked my hand with appreciation as she cried. A litter of puppies were in the cage opposite the pit bull. They snuggled together for warmth as one of the puppies let out a weak bark,as if calling to its mother. Recognizing my love and willingness to help these puppies,the director suggested I give them a bath. I lifted one of the puppies,Yukie,from his brothers and sisters. His black fur was as soft as cotton candy. I held him tightly. The sweet smell of liquid soap surrounded the wash area. The puppy seemed like a tiny fish,swimming delightedly in a pool. Water dropped down his black,soft ears as he tried to shake off the heavy water. I wrapped Yukie in a towel as he licked my hand. After all the cleaning and drying,he looked as if he'd come from an expensive pet shop. I kissed his little face as I unwillingly placed him back. Next,I walked some dogs around the shelter. They jumped out of their cages,unable to hold back their urge for exercise. I ran around with them,while touching them gently and talking to them. They moved back when the time came to put them back. The time came to leave. I silently promised these creatures to come and again provide them with love. The sad eyes and the faces of these creatures will always be impressed on my memory.

There's no mention of the author deciding to adopt Yukie, nor is there a mention of Yukie having black fur with white spots, or that it could be sold at a high price.

Would \\"Washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation that would be built on republican lines using federal power.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"While it is true that Washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation built on republican lines using federal power, this statement does not answer the specific question of when he was elected president. To provide a detailed and long answer, let's first address the correct answer to the given question: George Washington was elected as the first President of the United States on February 4, 1789. Although he did not want to initially be president, he was urged to accept the role by other founding fathers due to his leadership during the Revolutionary War and his general popularity. Now, let us explain some context to George Washington's vision of a great and powerful nation, which could serve as a supplementary response to the question: Following the Revolutionary War, the newly formed United States struggled to build a cohesive and sustainable government. The Articles of Confederation, the first governing document enacted by the U.S., proved to be insufficient in creating a strong central governing body. Washington, along with other founding fathers such as Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, recognized the importance of having a more powerful central government in order to maintain unity among the states and protect the nation's interests at home and abroad. This led to the framing of the United States Constitution, which aimed at creating a more efficient federal government that would have a better balance of power among the three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. Washington's vision of a great and powerful nation built on republican lines meant that he wanted a government that functioned for the benefit of its citizens, with checks and balances in place to prevent tyranny and provide equal representation. Washington also believed in the importance of federal power, especially when it came to matters such as raising revenue for the country, providing for a national defense, and regulating interstate commerce. He faced numerous challenges throughout his presidency, where he worked diligently to enforce federal power and establish precedents that would be followed by future presidents. For example, the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 showed Washington's commitment to federal authority by suppressing the insurrection using military force, thereby demonstrating the power and authority of the federal government. Furthermore, George Washington was also a proponent of neutrality in foreign affairs, aiming to prevent the United States from being drawn into international conflicts that could hinder its growth and development. In his farewell address, Washington emphasized this stance by advising Americans to steer clear of permanent alliances and to instead focus on nurturing its own growth and prosperity. In conclusion, although the statement \\"Washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation that would be built on republican lines using federal power\\" accurately represents George Washington's vision for the United States, it is not a direct answer to the question of when he was elected president. The election of George Washington as the first President of the United States took place on February 4, 1789, and his vision for a strong, united, and prosperous nation laid the foundation for the country's continued growth and development over the centuries to follow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

DeLay was known to \\"primary\\" Republicans who resisted his votes (i.e., to threaten to endorse and to support a Republican primary challenge to the disobedient representative), and, like many of his predecessors in Congress, used promises of future committee chairmanships to bargain for support among the rank-and-file members of the party. Employing a method known as \\"catch and release\\", DeLay allowed centrist or moderately conservative Republicans to take turns voting against controversial bills. If a representative said that a bill was unpopular in his district, then DeLay would ask him to vote for it only if his vote were necessary for passage; if his vote were not needed, then the representative would be able to vote against the party without reprisal, a practice which has been followed by other party leaders and whips from both sides of the aisle, Democrat and Republican, respectively, when in power.  In the 108th Congress, a preliminary Medicare vote passed 216-215, a vote on Head Start passed 217-216, a vote on school vouchers for Washington, D.C., passed 209-208, and \\"Fast track\\", usually called \\"trade promotion authority\\", passed by one vote as well. Both political supporters and opponents remarked on DeLay's ability to sway the votes of his party, a method DeLay described as \\"growing the vote\\". DeLay was noted for involving lobbyists in the process of passing House bills. One lobbyist said, \\"I've had members pull me aside and ask me to talk to another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I've never been asked to work on a bill--at least like they are asking us to whip bills now.\\" His ability to raise money gave him additional influence. During the 2004 election cycle, DeLay's political action committee ARMPAC was one of the top contributors to Republican congressional candidates, contributing over 980,000 in total.  Partly as a result of DeLay's management abilities, the House Republican caucus under him displayed unprecedented, sustained party cohesion.  On September 30, 2004, the House Ethics Committee unanimously admonished DeLay because he \\"offered to endorse Representative [Nick] Smith's son in exchange for Representative Smith's vote in favor of the Medicare bill.\\" Answer this question \\"Did he have any other methods or tactics?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Yes, DeLay had other methods and tactics.

John Bruce \\"Jack\\" Thompson (born July 25, 1951) is an American activist and disbarred attorney, based in Coral Gables, Florida. Thompson is known for his role as an anti-video-game activist, particularly against violence and sex in video games. During his time as an attorney, Thompson focused his legal efforts against what he perceives as obscenity in modern culture. This included rap music, broadcasts by shock jock Howard Stern, the content of computer and video games and their alleged effects on children. Thompson was involved in a similar suit in Alabama in 2005 on behalf of the families of police personnel killed by Devin Moore, a teenager who was reportedly a compulsive Grand Theft Auto player. The lawyer's participation in the case, however, ran into a dispute over his pro hac vice, or temporary, admission to practice in that state. The opposing attorneys sought removal of the privilege by arguing that Thompson's conduct was unethical and claiming that he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails. The judge added that Thompson had violated his gag order during Moore's criminal trial. Thompson tried to withdraw from the case, but his request was denied by the judge, who went ahead and revoked Thompson's temporary admission to the state bar.  For his part, Thompson said he thought the judge was trying to protect Moore's criminal conviction at any cost. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney who claimed to have influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.  In the aftermath of this lawsuit, Thompson lobbied Alabama attorney general Troy King to file a civil suit and call on retailers not to sell \\"cop-killing games\\". After the slaying of another police officer in Gassville, Arkansas by Jacob D. Robida, an 18-year-old fugitive, Thompson again raised the possibility of a connection to Grand Theft Auto, but investigators found no evidence that video games were involved. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: what else can you tell me about the case that was interesting?","output":"One interesting aspect of the case from the article is when it mentions, \\"He [Thompson] also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney who claimed to have influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.\\" This demonstrates Thompson's belief that there was a possible bias in favor of the gaming companies involved in the case and potential unethical conduct on the part of the judge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the R silent? How do I say the German R in brot and frau? It makes no sense and I can't pronounce it. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"To address your first question, \\"brot\\" is already a German word, and it translates to \\"bread\\" in English. The R in \\"brot\\" is not silent. For your second question, the German 'R' in \\"brot\\" and \\"frau\\" has a unique pronunciation that can be challenging for non-native speakers. Here is a step-by-step explanation for pronouncing the German 'R': 1. Relax your tongue, and keep it flat at the bottom of your mouth. 2. Push the back part of your tongue towards the uvula (the small, fleshy projection hanging from the back of the soft palate), without touching it. 3. To produce the 'R' sound, gently constrict air by narrowing the passage between the back of your tongue and your uvula while exhaling. 4. For \\"brot,\\" the 'R' comes after the initial 'B,' so you'll need to make a smooth transition from the 'B' sound to the German 'R' sound I described. 5. For \\"frau,\\" follow a similar approach, moving from the 'F' sound to the German 'R' sound, followed by the 'AU' diphthong. Your third question asks if the first two questions are paraphrases of each other. No, they are not exact paraphrases, as they address different aspects. The first question asks how to say \\"brot\\" in German and whether the R is silent, while the second question specifically asks for pronunciation guidance on the German 'R' in \\"brot\\" and \\"frau\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the best way to: How can I drain browned beef?","output":"Draining browned beef is an essential step in many recipes, as it helps to remove excess fat and grease, which can lead to health problems and negatively impact the flavor and texture of your dish. Below, you'll find a detailed, step-by-step guide on the best way to drain browned beef. 1. Gather necessary tools and materials: To properly drain browned beef, make sure you have the following items on hand:    a. A large skillet or pan    b. A slotted spoon or spatula    c. A large heat-safe bowl or container    d. A colander or mesh sieve    e. A couple of layers of paper towels or a heat-safe plate 2. Cook the beef: Begin by cooking the ground beef in the skillet or pan over medium heat until it is browned and no longer pink. Make sure to break up the beef into small, bite-sized pieces using the slotted spoon or spatula, and to stir the meat frequently to ensure even browning. 3. Turn off the heat: Once the beef is fully cooked, turn off the heat and allow the beef to sit in the skillet for a minute or two. This will give the beef a chance to cool slightly, which can make it easier and safer to handle during the draining process. 4. Transfer the beef using a slotted spoon: Using a slotted spoon or spatula, transfer the cooked beef from the skillet to the colander or mesh sieve, which should be placed over the heat-safe bowl or container. The slotted spoon will help separate the meat from the excess fat and grease. 5. Allow the beef to drain: Let the beef sit in the colander or mesh sieve for a few minutes to allow the excess fat and grease to drain into the bowl or container below. You can also gently shake the colander or press down on the beef with the slotted spoon or spatula to help encourage the draining process. 6. Pat the beef with paper towels (optional): If you want to remove even more excess fat and grease, you can place the drained beef on a couple of layers of paper towels or a heat-safe plate. Gently pat the beef with additional paper towels to absorb any remaining fat. Be careful not to press too hard, as this could cause the beef to crumble. 7. Discard the excess fat: After the beef has been properly drained, carefully dispose of the collected fat and grease. Avoid pouring the fat down your sink, as it can lead to clogged pipes. Instead, allow the fat to cool and solidify in the bowl or container, then spoon it into a sealable plastic bag and discard it in the trash. 8. Return the beef to the skillet: Now that your beef is drained, you can return it to the skillet for further cooking, if your recipe calls for additional ingredients or steps. If not, you can transfer the drained beef to a serving dish or storage container. By following these steps, you'll effectively drain the excess fat and grease from your browned beef, resulting in a healthier, more flavorful meal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care. I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent. We had ‘Unexpected Song’ played as she walked down the aisle at the church; the lyrics really summed up how we felt about each other and how we had gotten together… Unexpected Song Michael Crawford YouTube. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How long did the relationship last? Options: - About 2 years. - About 10 years. - not enough information - About 8 years.","output":"The correct answer is \\"About 10 years.\\" Justification: If we look at the given information, the user mentions he started dating his ex-wife at the age of 17. They got married when he was 19. Further in the story, the user says they separated after about 8 years. This means that the total duration of their romantic relationship (dating + marriage) lasted roughly 10 years. So, \\"About 10 years\\" is the correct choice."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. North's agent has revealed that Scarlets are in talks with the Saints. Davies says the Welsh regions are almost admitting they are just breeding grounds for Europe's top clubs. \\"If we're going to be nurseries then we are almost throwing the towel in on the domestic front,\\" he said. \\"If we want to compete, let's do so. If we don't, let's say so and not lead anybody up the garden path.\\" North, 20, has a year left on his Scarlets contract and is not actively seeking a transfer, according to his agent. But Christian Abt claims the region, who have refused to comment, have been talking to the Saints and \\"possibly a few other parties\\" about North's future. He says the financial difficulties facing the Welsh regions are a factor in the North talks. Scarlets, like the three other Welsh regions, are struggling financially and will be operating under a self-imposed £3.5m salary cap next season. They recouped an undisclosed fee after allowing Ben Morgan to join Gloucester at the end of last season, and would expect to pocket a significant amount for North, who is rated as one of world rugby's most destructive wingers. Should he move, North would join fellow Wales stars Jamie Roberts and Dan Lydiate in leaving the domestic game at the end of the season. Alex Cuthbert has bucked the recent trend by extending his contract with Cardiff Blues, who have also tempted Gethin Jenkins back from Toulon. But a steady trickle of Wales players have been lost in recent seasons, lured by the offer of significantly higher wages in England and France. \\"Finances are obviously coming into play here, probably on both sides,\\" added Davies, a former chief executive of Cardiff RFC. \\"It's no secret that all the Welsh regions are struggling financially so if the Scarlets can secure a healthy return for [Saints] buying North's contract out, it's obviously of appeal to them. \\"And of course in terms of George North securing his own future, if a club like Northampton comes in and doubles or triples his salary then he's obviously going to look after his own welfare. \\"I don't think we can attribute blame on anybody - it's a commercial reality these days.\\" But Davies does fear that while Wales are flourishing on the international stage, having just clinched the Six Nations title for the fourth time in nine years, the domestic game is being left behind. No Welsh team reached this season's quarter-finals of Europe's elite club competition, the Heineken Cup, and all four regions have called for greater financial support from the Welsh Rugby Union. \\"We're almost saying as a nation that we can't or don't want to compete on the domestic front,\\" said Davies. \\"I find that quite sad. Welsh rugby should make a statement that we want to compete with the best in Europe. \\"It's fine at Six Nations level - that's very important as we've seen in recent weeks - but there are still 30 other weekends in the season when I'm sure Welsh rugby supporters would love to see the Welsh regions competing with the top French and English clubs.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"This is a story about a rugby player named North. His team, Scarlets, is talking to another team called Saints about his future. The man named Davies is worried that Welsh rugby teams like Scarlets are becoming a place where young players learn before they go to bigger teams in Europe. He wants Welsh rugby teams to compete with the best teams in Europe, but they don't have enough money. Many good players from Wales have left to play in England and France for more money. Davies believes this is a problem for Welsh teams and their fans."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.
