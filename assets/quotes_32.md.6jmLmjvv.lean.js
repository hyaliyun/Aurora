To switch cameras, we'll have to add logic to both \`GetOnHoverboard()\` and \`GetOffHoverboard()\` methods to enable the hoverboard's camera and disable the player's main camera, and vice versa. Here's how you could modify the script to handle the camera switching: 1. Add two public \`Camera\` variables, one for the player's main camera, and another for the camera attached to the hoverboard. 2. Disable the player's main camera when getting on the hoverboard and enable the hoverboard's camera. 3. Reverse these actions when getting off the hoverboard. Here's how you might update your code: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class PlayerHoverboardInteraction : MonoBehaviour { // ... existing code ... // Add references to the different cameras [Header(\\"Camera Settings\\")] public Camera playerMainCamera; // Assign the player's main camera in the inspector public Camera hoverboardCamera; // Assign the hoverboard's camera in the inspector // ... existing code ... private void GetOnHoverboard() { // ... existing code to get on the hoverboard ... // Switch cameras if (playerMainCamera != null) playerMainCamera.enabled = false; if (hoverboardCamera != null) hoverboardCamera.enabled = true; // ... other logic for getting on the hoverboard, if needed ... } private void GetOffHoverboard() { // ... existing code to get off the hoverboard ... // Switch cameras back if (hoverboardCamera != null) hoverboardCamera.enabled = false; if (playerMainCamera != null) playerMainCamera.enabled = true; // ... other logic for getting off the hoverboard, if needed ... } } \`\`\` With these updates, the script now includes logic to toggle the enabled state of the player's main camera and the hoverboard's camera when getting on and off the hoverboard. This assumes that each camera is set up correctly in the scene, with the appropriate components attached. Please ensure you assign the \`playerMainCamera\` and \`hoverboardCamera\` references in the Unity Editor by dragging the relevant camera objects into the script fields in the Inspector. The approach here is straightforward – we're simply enabling one camera and disabling the other when switching between the player and hoverboard's point of view."},{"instruction":"Any chance you could provide the full whole edited script please?","output":"Absolutely!

Some spam campaigns may only send out a few hundred or thousand emails, while others can involve millions or even billions of emails. The scale of the campaign depends on various factors, including the intentions and capabilities of the spammers."},{"instruction":"how do they get email lists that big? I know you can buy them in some places but how else do they do it?","output":"Spammers typically gather email addresses for their campaigns in various ways: 1. Scraping: They may use software or bots to scrape websites, forums, social media platforms, and other online sources for email addresses. This method involves automatically collecting email addresses from different web pages. 2. Data breaches: Spammers may obtain email lists through data breaches. When hackers breach a company's or website's database, they can access and steal user information, including email addresses, which can then be used for spam campaigns. 3. Phishing: Spammers sometimes trick individuals into revealing their email addresses through phishing techniques. They may send deceptive emails pretending to be trustworthy organizations, asking recipients to provide their email addresses or other personal information. 4. Harvesting: Spammers can create their own email lists by using email harvesting techniques. These involve using software to extract email addresses from public sources like websites or online directories. 5. Purchasing lists: Some spammers buy email lists from data brokers, marketing companies, or other sources that collect and sell email addresses. These lists may be obtained legally or illegally. It is important to note that spamming is unethical and illegal in many jurisdictions."},{"instruction":"i heard some of them generate them and then check them somehow. I get how they generate them but how do they check them?","output":"Spammers often use a technique called email list verification or email list cleaning to check the validity of email addresses. The process typically involves the following steps: 1. Syntax check: The email list is first checked for syntax errors, ensuring that email addresses are in the correct format (e.g., [email protected]). 2. Domain check: The verification process then verifies the domain of each email address. It checks if the domain exists and has valid DNS records. 3. SMTP check: Next, spammers use the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to check the email server's responsiveness. They establish a connection with the recipient's email server to check if it accepts incoming emails for the recipient's address. 4. Disposable email address check: Disposable email addresses or temporary email services are often used to generate fake or temporary addresses. Spammers may cross-reference the email addresses with known disposable email address providers and mark them as invalid. 5. Role-based address check: Role-based email addresses are those associated with a specific position or function (e.g., [email protected]). Spammers may identify and remove or mark such addresses as invalid. 6. Bounce check: Some email list verification services also perform a bounce check. They simulate sending an email to each address and check for bounce responses indicating that the email address is no longer valid. By performing these checks, spammers can filter out invalid email addresses and focus their spam campaigns on a smaller, more targeted list. However, it is essential to reiterate that spamming is illegal and unethical."},{"instruction":"text: What Kwanzaa means for Black Americans by Frank Dobson 2017 1. what is the central idea of the aritcle a.

The heavy bass from within vibrates faintly in the background. The camera pans to a large, burly man, the archetype of an East End enforcer type, donned in a leather jacket. He has a hardened, yet concerned look on his face. This is DAVE, our guide for the night.] Dave (looking directly into the camera): Alright there. Name's Dave. You might think I'm the sort who thrives on trouble, but let me tell ya - the things I've seen are enough to make you think twice about your night out. [Cut to interior, a fast-paced, vibrant club scene. Young people dance and drink.] Dave (voiceover): Looks fun, doesn't it? And it should be. It's your time to let loose, have a laugh with your mates. But a good time can turn sour real fast when you're not careful. [The scene slows down and zooms in on a young woman, LUCY, as her drink is left unattended.] Dave (voiceover): Take Lucy 'ere. Out for her mate's birthday and not a care in the world. [An unseen figure slips something into Lucy's drink. The scene switches back to Dave, now inside the club.] Dave: But it only takes a moment of lookin' away, and your night can end up a nightmare. Watch your drinks. [Dave picks up a drink from the bar, demonstrates using a drink cover and shows a poster about drink-spiking awareness next to the bar.] Dave: Use these. They're drink covers. Simple, effective. And see these posters? Lots of info there. Report suspicious stuff to bar staff or security. [Transition to a crowded dance floor. The camera focuses on a vibrant character, TOMMY, dancing wildly but bumping into others aggressively.] Dave (voiceover): There's Tommy. Got a bit too much firewater in 'im, startin' to get rowdy. Know your limits; don't be like Tommy. [The scene escalates to Tommy starting a fight. Security swiftly intervenes.] Dave: You don’t need to get into scraps to have a story to tell. Know when you've had enough. [Cut back to Dave, now standing by a wall lined with safe transport options and buddy system reminders.] Dave: And what about when it's time to head home? You might be tempted to save some quid and walk alone, or jump into a sketchy unlicensed cab. [The scene shows a young man, JAKE, considering these unsafe options, then cuts back to Dave shaking his head.] Dave: Don't be a mug, eh? Plan your ride home before you head out. Always use a licensed taxi or a well-known app. And stick with your mates. [Dave walks outside where a young couple is helping their friend into a licensed taxi.] Dave: Like these good people. Stick together. Look out for each other. [Dave looks back at the camera, his tone softening.] Dave: Listen, I'm not trying to scare ya. I just want you to have a good time without the pain and the regrets. Scenes like this? [Gestures behind] They're happening too often. [The camera zooms in on Dave as he glances around at the now quiet street, reflecting on the contrast between the joy inside and the potential dangers outside.] Dave: So keep your wits about ya. Club hard, but club smart, yeah? It's your night out, so why waste it? [Dave nods and walks off, disappearing into the night as the screen fades to black with text appearing: \\"Stay Safe.

We see an old-fashioned pub with laughter and the clinking of glasses emanating from inside. The camera pans to MR. SMITH, a gruff, older East End 'enforcer' type standing outside in the cool night. He's seen it all and has a commanding presence that demands attention.] Mr. Smith (looking sternly into the camera): Evening, folks. Call me Mr. Smith. You’re out to have a good time, so why let a daft decision ruin all that? Let’s have a chat about keeping your night out from turning into a right nightmare. [Cut to a vibrant bar interior, energetic music playing, people laughing, dancing, and enjoying their drinks.] Mr. Smith (voiceover): This here is everyone's local - where memories are made. But one wrong move, and it's a night you'll want to forget. [Scene zooms in on a group of young men, obviously inebriated, starting to push and shove during animated banter. One man, DANNY, throws a punch, and a brawl erupts.] Mr. Smith: Meet Danny. Couple of pints too far, and now he's throwing punches. Temper flared, and it's all gone south. [Scene switches to police cars flashing their lights outside the pub. Officers are handcuffing Danny.] Mr. Smith (standing beside the police activities): A scrap might feel big in the moment, big man. But it's nothing compared to what follows. You get nicked, you’re spending the night in a cell instead of your bed. And that's the best case. [We see Danny the next day, looking disheveled, regretful, and receiving a court summons.] Mr. Smith (in a more reflective tone): Worst case? You’re looking at charges, a criminal record. It's not just tonight you’re ruining, it's your future, too. Jobs, travel, all that gets a lot harder with a record. [The scene changes to a hospital where paramedics rush in a party-goer on a stretcher.] Mr. Smith (sobering voiceover): It can end up worse than that. Hospitals, injuries – or landing someone else there. No one wants that on their conscience. [Cut back to Mr. Smith standing outside the pub, shaking his head.] Mr. Smith: But it doesn’t have to go that way. It’s simple. Keep a level head. Walk away from trouble. Enjoy your night, make a plan for how you're getting home, watch out for your mates. [He gestures to a sign outside the pub promoting responsible drinking and another offering numbers for local taxi services.] Mr. Smith: Pubs like this got numbers for cabs, safe ways to get you back to your doorstep. Use 'em. [He gives a knowing nod to the camera.] Mr. Smith: Remember, joy of the night's not in the last punch thrown, it’s in the laughs had and the memories kept.

He's tough, seen his fair share of dodgy deals, and he doesn't mince words.] Mr. Smith: Look lively, you lot. Mr. Smith here. Got a moment? Good. 'Cause I'm about to unwrap the truth about a different sort of package. One that can land you in a world of trouble. [Cut to a flashback scene. We see a younger, naive-looking individual being handed a small, wrapped parcel in a dark alley.] Mr. Smith (voiceover): It might seem like easy money. A quick favor, carrying a little something for someone. No harm, right? Wrong. [The flashback freezes as police lights start to flash.] Mr. Smith (back in the present): Here’s the deal. That package? Could be drugs, could be weapons, or worse. And when you're caught – not if, but when – you're the one in cuffs. [Cut to a scene of a tense courtroom. The young individual from the flashback is standing trial, with their family watching, disappointed and distressed.] Mr. Smith (standing in the courtroom): Think it’s just about you? Nah. Your family, your friends – it hurts them all. And your future? Forget about it. [The scene switches back to Mr. Smith, who now leans against a railing, a grim look on his face.] Mr. Smith: Let's not kid ourselves. These \\"quick favors\\" fuel gangs, hurt communities, tear families apart. And for what? A couple of quid? [The scene changes to a happier street scene with kids playing football and neighbors chatting.] Mr. Smith (voiceover): It could be your street next, your mates, your family caught up in the mess you helped make. [Cut back to Mr. Smith. He's walking now, serious demeanor, engages directly with the camera.] Mr. Smith: So here's the score. Someone hands you a 'package', you’ve got a choice. Make the smart one. [He stops beside a poster on a lamppost showing a hotline for reporting illegal activities anonymously.] Mr. Smith: See something shady? Speak up. There’s hotlines, there's police you can talk to. No names, just information. Help keep your streets clean. [He gives a firm nod directly into the camera.] Mr. Smith: Look after your own, and don't wrap yourself in a package of trouble.

He carries the weight of hard-earned wisdom in his eyes.] Mr. Smith (with a resolute tone): Morning. Mr. Smith here. We need to have a word about the things you \\"don't see.\\" You know, the sort of stuff that happens when good people turn a blind eye. It's a conscience thing, and believe me, it isn't up for sale. [Flashback to a busy neighborhood street with shops, people going about their business, ignoring a clear exchange of illegal goods in broad daylight.] Mr. Smith (voiceover): You've seen it, even if you tell yourself you haven't. Dodgy deals in the open, thinking if they act casual, we'll all just mind our own. [The action pauses, and a red circle highlights the illicit exchange in the crowd.] Mr. Smith (now in view in the paused scene): See this here? This is where the harm starts. Might seem like none of your business, but it is. Drugs, stolen goods, worse – it hits the community hard. [Cut back to Mr. Smith in the present, the street behind him now quiet and empty.] Mr. Smith: Look, I've been around. Seen people who know better claim they've seen nothing. But here's the rub: that silence? It helps nobody. [Transition to a gloomy scene inside a flat where a distressed family deals with the effects of crime in their community.] Mr. Smith (voiceover, more emotive now): People hurt, kids caught up in the crossfire, families broken. Because nobody \\"saw\\" anything. That's the price of silence. [Mr. Smith walks slowly down the street, passing by Missing Person posters and community notice boards pleading for information on various issues.] Mr. Smith: The thing is, we're all part of this tapestry of streets and lives. And when you pull one thread thinking it doesn't touch you, the whole thing can unravel. [He stops, facing the camera, and his tone shifts to one of encouragement and call to action.] Mr. Smith: I've seen too much to sit quiet – and I reckon, so have you. It's not about snitching, it’s about protecting what's ours. Your conscience isn't just for you, it's the part of you that looks out for all of us. [He points to a nearby public phone with signs around it informing people how they can anonymously report crimes.] Mr. Smith: So, let’s do right. Speak up. That phone over there? It's a lifeline for our streets. Or talk to a community officer. Do it anonymous, but do it. Because trust me, guilt weighs heavier than you think, and a clear conscience is something you can't put a price on.

He looks straight into the camera with a hint of disappointment.] Mr. Smith: Rent-free they say. Live the easy life, no need to graft. But let me tell you something about this 'free' life. [Cut to a montage of scenes showing young lads being recruited by criminal entities, getting entangled in illegal activities, and flashing material goods that come with it.] Mr. Smith (voiceover): Maybe you've been offered a piece of the pie. A sweet deal to make a bit of dosh with no hard work involved. Maybe even a place to crash, all expenses paid. Tempting, innit? [The scenes quickly shift to the dire consequences: arrests, raids, and anxious families.] Mr. Smith: But here's the sting. There's no such thing as a free lunch. Those handouts, they come with strings. Heavy ones. And when they're pulled...

Your prospects? Gone. Trust me, these four walls ain't the life you're dreaming of.

Real charm is working for what you've got, building something lasting.

Honest work, learning a trade, making something you can be proud of - that's real living.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking and infantilizing physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of her pants is, and then proceeds to tauntingly scold for being the stinkiest girl there is in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that her grown daughter - the returning woman - can be so childishly smelly from pooping her pants.","output":"**INT.

As the camera zooms out, we transition to our protagonist, *AYSHA*, mid-20s, full of life, with long jet-black hair bundled loosely under a colorful scarf. Aysha wears a lightweight traditional shalwar kameez, decorative yet practical for the student always on the move. Pacing hastily, Aysha clutches her stomach, her face tinted with the slightest grimace, hinting at the tempest brewing within. _Aysha's race against time began after a two-hour lecture, wherein her stomach’s murmur grew into a roar. Too embarrassed to use the college restrooms and certain she could make it home, she now faces the consequences of her miscalculation._ **CUT TO:** **EXT.

Este tipo de adquisiciones pueden llevarse a cabo de varias maneras, como por ejemplo: 1. **Oferta pública de adquisición (OPA) directa a los accionistas:** La empresa que busca el control presenta directamente a los accionistas de la empresa objetivo una oferta atractiva para comprar sus acciones a un precio generalmente mayor al del mercado, con el objetivo de obtener suficientes acciones que les permitan controlar la empresa. 2. **Guerra de proxies (proxy fight):** La empresa que intenta la adquisición persuade a los accionistas para que voten a favor de su propia lista de directores en la junta general de accionistas de la empresa objetivo. Si la empresa adquirente puede reemplazar suficientes miembros de la junta, puede obtener el control sin tener que comprar la empresa directamente. 3. **Compra de acciones en el mercado abierto:** A veces, si las acciones de la empresa objetivo están disponibles en cantidades suficientes, la empresa adquirente puede comprar las acciones en el mercado abierto hasta alcanzar un porcentaje que les permita influir o controlar la compañía. La empresa objetivo puede emplear una serie de tácticas defensivas para protegerse de la compra hostil, como la píldora venenosa (poison pill), el caballero blanco (white knight), el paraguas dorado (golden parachute), entre otros. - **Píldora venenosa (poison pill):** Una estrategia que hace que las acciones de la empresa sean menos atractivas para la empresa adquirente. Por ejemplo, permitir que los actuales accionistas (excluyendo al adquirente hostil) compren más acciones a un precio con descuento. - **Caballero blanco (white knight):** La empresa objetivo busca un comprador más amigable o acuerdo preferible para evitar la compra hostil. - **Paraguas dorado (golden parachute):** Compensaciones lucrativas a los ejecutivos en caso de perder su empleo debido a una adquisición, lo cual incrementa el costo de la adquisición. La compra hostil es parte de la dinámica del mercado y a menudo es un componente de estrategias corporativas y maniobras financieras. En algunos casos, puede llevar a un acuerdo entre las empresas, mientras que en otros puede resultar en una batalla prolongada y disputas legales."},{"instruction":"Qué piensa el liberalismo de la compra hostil?","output":"El liberalismo económico, en su sentido más puro, promueve la libre competencia y el mercado como el regulador principal de la economía. En este contexto, las compras hostiles pueden ser vistas como un elemento natural y válido del libre mercado. Aquí están algunas consideraciones que un liberal clásico podría tener respecto a las compras hostiles: 1. **Libre mercado:** En una economía de mercado, las empresas son libres de competir por recursos, incluidas otras empresas. Una compra hostil es simplemente una manifestación de esa competencia. 2. **Eficiencia del mercado:** Defensores del liberalismo podrían argumentar que las compras hostiles contribuyen a la eficiencia del mercado al permitir que los recursos (en este caso, las empresas) sean asignados de manera más efectiva. Si una empresa no está siendo gestionada eficientemente y sus acciones están subvaluadas, una compra hostil puede reflejar una corrección de mercado, llevando la empresa bajo la dirección de un equipo gestor que puede mejorar su rendimiento. 3. **Derechos de propiedad:** El liberalismo enfatiza los derechos de propiedad privada. Los accionistas de una empresa tienen el derecho de vender sus acciones a quien quieran, incluyendo participantes en ofertas de adquisición hostiles. 4. **Responsabilidad corporativa:** Algunos liberales podrían ver las compras hostiles como una forma de responsabilidad corporativa. Si la gestión de una empresa no está actuando en el mejor interés de los accionistas (valor de la empresa, dividendos, etc.), una adquisición hostil puede ser un medio para reorientar la empresa hacia las necesidades y deseos de sus verdaderos dueños - los accionistas. 5. **Innovación y adaptación:** El proceso de compra hostil puede ser traumático para una empresa, pero también puede forzar la innovación y adaptación, lo que finalmente puede ser beneficioso para la economía en su conjunto. Sin embargo, es importante señalar que incluso dentro del liberalismo económico pueden existir diferentes interpretaciones y enfoques sobre cuán rigurosamente se deben aplicar estos principios. Algunos podrían argumentar que ciertas regulaciones o prácticas de gobernanza corporativa son necesarias para proteger a los accionistas minoritarios, empleados y otros intereses dentro del entorno empresarial. En última instancia, aunque la tendencia del liberalismo puede ser favorable hacia las compras hostiles como un mecanismo del mercado, también reconocerá la importancia de un marco ético y legal que asegure la transparencia y la equidad en el proceso."},{"instruction":"Es una forma ilegal?","output":"No, una compra hostil no es ilegal por sí misma. Es una táctica legítima en el mundo corporativo y una parte reconocida del funcionamiento de los mercados de capitales. Las compras hostiles se llevan a cabo en el marco de las leyes y regulaciones financieras que rigen las adquisiciones de empresas. En la mayoría de las jurisdicciones, existen reglas estrictas diseñadas para garantizar que las compras de acciones y las ofertas de adquisición se realicen de manera justa y transparente, protegiendo los derechos de todos los accionistas involucrados. Por ejemplo, muchas ofertas de adquisición hostiles deben seguir procedimientos regulados, como: - Presentar la oferta a los reguladores del mercado antes de hacerla pública. - Proporcionar a los accionistas de la empresa objetivo la información pertinente y suficiente para tomar una decisión informada. - Respetar los periodos de aceptación y otras condiciones definidas por la ley. - Revelar la adquisición de ciertos porcentajes de participación en una empresa a las autoridades del mercado. Si bien las compras hostiles son legales, las empresas y los individuos implicados deben asegurarse de no incurrir en prácticas prohibidas, como el uso de información privilegiada, la manipulación del mercado, o violar otras normativas específicas como las leyes antimonopolio. La \\"hostilidad\\" de la compra se refiere simplemente al hecho de que la dirección de la empresa objetivo no la aprueba ni desea que se produzca, no a la legalidad de la transacción en sí. Cabe destacar que algunas prácticas relacionadas con la adquisición hostil, como medidas defensivas o estrategias agresivas, pueden ser sujetas a discusión legal o ética, pero la acción de intentar comprar una empresa sin el consentimiento de su dirección no es en sí misma ilegal."},{"instruction":"OPA obligatoria puede ser el ejemplo de la adquisicion de YPF del gobierno argentino?","output":"La expropiación de YPF por parte del gobierno argentino no es un ejemplo de una Oferta Pública de Adquisición (OPA) obligatoria, sino más bien un caso de nacionalización o expropiación. Una OPA obligatoria suele ser un término que se utiliza en el contexto de las regulaciones del mercado de valores y se refiere a una situación en la que un inversor que adquiere una participación significativa en una empresa cotizada está legalmente obligado a hacer una oferta a todos los demás accionistas de la empresa. El propósito de la OPA obligatoria es proteger a los accionistas minoritarios ofreciéndoles la oportunidad de vender sus acciones a un precio justo cuando se produce un cambio significativo en la propiedad de una empresa. En contraste, el caso de YPF se refiere a la decisión del gobierno argentino en 2012 de nacionalizar la petrolera, que en ese momento estaba controlada mayoritariamente por la empresa española Repsol. El gobierno argentino tomó esta medida a través de la aprobación de una ley que expropió el 51% de las acciones de YPF en manos de Repsol, citando el interés público y la soberanía energética como las razones detrás de la nacionalización. La nacionalización involucró la intervención directa del Estado en los activos de una empresa y se llevó a cabo mediante un acto legislativo, que es diferente de una OPA donde una entidad (ya sea una empresa o un individuo) hace una oferta de compra mediante un proceso de mercado. El asunto de YPF fue objeto de una controversia internacional y llevó a Repsol a buscar compensación por lo que consideraba una expropiación de sus activos sin una compensación adecuada. Eventualmente, el gobierno argentino y Repsol llegaron a un acuerdo sobre la compensación."},{"instruction":"\\"El propósito de la OPA obligatoria es proteger a los accionistas minoritarios ofreciéndoles la oportunidad de vender sus acciones a un precio justo cuando se produce un cambio significativo en la propiedad de una empresa. \\" No fue eso lo que pasó? luego de la expropiación la argentina debía ofertar el resto de las acciones pero no lo hizo","output":"La situación que describes es diferente a una OPA obligatoria típica en el contexto de las regulaciones de mercado. Las OPAs obligatorias generalmente se producen en situaciones donde un comprador, normalmente una entidad privada, alcanza una participación que supera un umbral regulatorio en una empresa cotizada en bolsa. Las leyes y regulaciones del mercado de valores, como la Directiva de OPA de la Unión Europea, estipulan que, en ese caso, el comprador debe hacer una oferta de compra por el resto de las acciones de la empresa para proteger a los accionistas minoritarios. La nacionalización o expropiación de YPF fue una decisión unilateral del gobierno argentino, que utilizó su poder legislativo para tomar el control del 51% de las acciones de la empresa, argumentando razones de interés público y soberanía energética. Esto no fue el resultado de una transacción en el mercado abierto ni fue realizado por una entidad privada que buscaba adquirir una participación controlante en la empresa a través de los mecanismos del mercado. Después de que ocurre una nacionalización o expropiación, normalmente se espera que el gobierno ofrezca una compensación a la empresa que ha sido expropiada (y por extensión a sus accionistas), y esa compensación debería reflejar el valor justo del interés adquirido. La compensación puede tomar diferentes formas y puede estar sujeta a negociación o litigio, como sucedió en el caso de YPF y Repsol. En efecto, después de la expropiación de YPF, el gobierno argentino tendría que lidiar con la cuestión de las acciones restantes que no fueron expropiadas. Sin embargo, esto no se maneja en el mismo marco que una OPA obligatoria en un escenario de mercado abierto. Las acciones de compensación y las eventualidades posteriores a la expropiación están sujetas al marco legal específico bajo el cual se realizó la nacionalización. En el caso de YPF, Repsol demandó al gobierno argentino por lo que consideró una compensación injusta, y el asunto se resolvió finalmente a través de un acuerdo negociado."},{"instruction":"compra hostil es lo mismo que OPA hostil?","output":"La compra hostil y la OPA (Oferta Pública de Adquisición) hostil están estrechamente relacionadas, pero no son exactamente lo mismo. A continuación se explica la diferencia: **Compra Hostil:** Se refiere a la adquisición de una compañía que se hace en contra de la voluntad de su actual equipo de gestión o junta directiva. La \\"hostilidad\\" proviene de la resistencia de la empresa objetivo a ser comprada. Esta adquisición puede llevarse a cabo por diversas vías, como la compra directa de acciones en el mercado, maniobras estratégicas para ganar el control de la junta directiva, o a través de una oferta directa a los accionistas. **OPA Hostil:** Es un tipo específico de compra hostil que se realiza a través de una oferta pública de adquisición. En una OPA hostil, la empresa que intenta adquirir la otra (empresa adquirente) hace una oferta directa a los accionistas de la empresa objetivo para comprar sus acciones, generalmente a un precio superior al del mercado, en un intento de obtener una participación mayoritaria sin la aprobación de la junta directiva de la empresa objetivo. Por lo tanto, todas las OPAs hostiles son un tipo de compra hostil, pero no todas las compras hostiles se realizan a través de una OPA. Una compra hostil puede implicar una OPA hostil como estrategia clave, pero también puede incluir otros métodos para obtener el control de una empresa contra la voluntad de su junta directiva actual."},{"instruction":"Es inmoral la compra hostil?","output":"La cuestión de si una compra hostil es inmoral o no depende en gran medida del marco ético o de los valores individuales que se apliquen a la situación. Esta es una cuestión subjetiva y puede variar según la perspectiva de diferentes grupos interesados: 1. **Desde el punto de vista del mercado:** Una compra hostil puede considerarse una parte legítima de la actividad económica en un sistema de libre mercado. En este sentido, se ve como un mecanismo de mercado para corregir ineficiencias corporativas y realinear los recursos con gestiones más eficientes. Desde esta perspectiva, no se consideraría inmoral, sino más bien una expresión de la dinámica natural del mercado. 2. **Desde el punto de vista de la junta directiva o de la gerencia de la empresa objetivo:** Podrían ver la adquisición hostil como una acción agresiva e injusta, especialmente si creen que están actuando en el mejor interés de la empresa y sus accionistas a largo plazo. Aquí, los conceptos de lealtad, el compromiso con los empleados y la visión a largo plazo pueden llevarlos a ver la adquisición hostil como algo inmoral. 3. **Desde el punto de vista de los accionistas:** Si los accionistas reciben una prima significativa sobre el valor de mercado de sus acciones, pueden ver una OPA hostil como moralmente aceptable o incluso positiva, independientemente de los sentimientos de la gerencia. La moralidad de la acción podría entonces ser considerada en términos del valor que se les entrega. 4. **Desde el punto de vista de los empleados:** Los empleados pueden ver una adquisición hostil con preocupación debido al riesgo de reestructuración, despidos o cambios en la cultura corporativa. Para ellos, puede parecer inmoral si resulta en un impacto negativo en sus vidas laborales sin tener en cuenta su bienestar. 5. **Desde una perspectiva ética corporativa:** Algunos argumentarían que una adquisición que solo busca el beneficio financiero a corto plazo, sin considerar otros factores como el impacto social, ambiental o el bienestar de los empleados, podría ser considerada inmoral. El debate también involucra discusiones más amplias sobre responsabilidad corporativa, capitalismo accionista versus capitalismo de partes interesadas, y el equilibrio entre maximizar el valor para los accionistas y considerar las necesidades de otros grupos interesados. En resumen, no existe un consenso claro sobre si las compras hostiles son morales o inmorales; la percepción varía según la perspectiva y los valores aplicados al análisis de la práctica."},{"instruction":"Сколько существует целых чисел о 0 до 999,которые не делятся ни на 2, ни на 3, ни на 5, ни на 7","output":"Чтобы найти количество целых чисел от 0 до 999, которые не делятся на 2, 3, 5 и 7, нам нужно использовать принцип включений и исключений. Сначала вычислим, сколько чисел делится на каждое из этих простых чисел, а затем найдем числа, которые делятся на их комбинации, для того чтобы исключить повторения. Для делимости на 2: Делимые на 2 числа – это все четные числа. Их количество можно найти, разделив 999 на 2 и округлив вниз: 999 / 2 = 499.5, что дает нам 499 полных пар чисел, значит 499 чётных чисел (0 считаем чётным числом). Для делимости на 3: Делимые на 3 числа получим, разделив 999 на 3: 999 / 3 = 333, значит, существует 333 числа, которые делятся на 3. Для делимости на 5: Делимые на 5 числа – это все числа, оканчивающиеся на 0 или 5. Их количество найдем, разделив 999 на 5: 999 / 5 = 199.8, что дает нам 199 полных пятёрок чисел. Для делимости на 7: Делимые на 7 числа найдем, разделив 999 на 7: 999 / 7 ≈ 142.71, значит, существует 142 числа, которые делятся на 7. Теперь вычислим количество чисел, делящихся на комбинации этих чисел (например, на 2 и 3, на 2 и 5, и т.д.), чтобы избежать их двойного счета. Для делимости на 2 и 3 (т.е. на 6): 999 / 6 = 166.5, значит, существует 166 чисел, которые делятся на 2 и 3. Для делимости на 2 и 5 (т.е. на 10): 999 / 10 = 99.9, значит, существует 99 чисел, которые делятся на 2 и 5. Для делимости на 2 и 7 (т.е. на 14): 999 / 14 ≈ 71.36, значит, существует 71 число, которое делится на 2 и 7. Для делимости на 3 и 5 (т.е. на 15): 999 / 15 = 66.6, значит, существует 66 чисел, которые делятся на 3 и 5. Для делимости на 3 и 7 (т.е. на 21): 999 / 21 ≈ 47.57, значит, существует 47 чисел, которые делятся на 3 и 7. Для делимости на 5 и 7 (т.е. на 35): 999 / 35 ≈ 28.54, значит, существует 28 чисел, которые делятся на 5 и 7. Теперь учитываем числа, которые делятся на 2, 3 и 5 (т.е. на 30): 999 / 30 = 33.3, значит, существует 33 числа, которые делятся на 2, 3 и 5. Для делимости на 2, 3 и 7 (т.е. на 42): 999 / 42 ≈ 23.79, значит, существует 23 числа, которые делятся на 2, 3 и 7. Для делимости на 2, 5 и 7 (т.е. на 70): 999 / 70 ≈ 14.27, значит, существует 14 чисел, которые делятся на 2, 5 и 7. Для делимости на 3, 5 и 7 (т.е. на 105): 999 / 105 ≈ 9.51, значит, существует 9 чисел, которые делятся на 3, 5 и 7. И, наконец, для делимости на 2, 3, 5 и 7 (т.е. на 210): 999 / 210 ≈ 4.76, значит, существует 4 числа, которые делятся на все эти числа. Принцип включений и исключений гласит, что для определения количества элементов, которые не принадлежат ни к одному из выбранных множеств, необходимо: сначала сложить количество элементов каждого множества, затем вычесть количество элементов, принадлежащих их попарным пересечениям, потом добавить количество элементов, принадлежащих пересечению по три множества, и, наконец, вычесть количество элементов, принадлежащих пересечению всех четырёх множеств. Имя скажем N — это количество чисел, которые не делятся ни на 2, ни на 3, ни на 5, ни на 7. Общее количество чисел от 0 до 999 равно 1000 (включая 0). Тогда: N = 1000 - (делятся на 2) - (делятся на 3) - (делятся на 5) - (делятся на 7) + (делятся на 2 и 3) + (делятся на 2 и 5) + (делятся на 2 и 7) + (делятся на 3 и 5) + (делятся на 3 и 7) + (делятся на 5 и 7) - (делятся на 2, 3 и 5) - (делятся на 2, 3 и 7) - (делятся на 2, 5 и 7) - (делятся на 3, 5 и 7) + (делятся на 2, 3, 5 и 7) Подставляем найденные значения: N = 1000 - 499 - 333 - 199 - 142 + 166 + 99 + 71 + 66 + 47 + 28 - 33 - 23 - 14 - 9 + 4 Выполняем вычисления: N = 1000 - 1173 + 477 - 75 + 4 N = 233 Таким образом, существует ровно 233 целых числа от 0 до 999, которые не делятся на 2, 3, 5 и 7."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

She’s usually here by now.” Sayori: “Maybe she’s running late today. Let’s give her a few more minutes.” (putting her hand on her baby bump) “Either way, little Sachiko’s worried, too. She’s not kicking as much as she should…” Monika: “Oh no, that’s concerning. We should definitely check up on Natsuki. Is there anyone who has her contact information?” Yuri: “I do. We exchanged numbers for club-related discussions. I’ll send her a text and see if everything is alright.” (Yuri pulls out her phone and starts typing.) Sayori: “Thank you, Yuri. Hopefully, she’ll reply soon. I’m really worried about both Natsuki and Sachiko.” Monika: “I’m sure she’ll be okay. Maybe she just had a busy morning or got caught up in something. But it’s important for us to make sure she’s safe and feeling well.” Yuri: “I’ve sent the message. Now, we’ll just have to wait for her reply.” (Several minutes pass, but there’s no response from Natsuki.) Monika: “This is unusual. Natsuki usually responds quickly. I’m starting to get more concerned.” Sayori: “Me too. I hope nothing happened.” (Suddenly, the clubroom door opens, and Natsuki rushes in.) Natsuki: “Sorry, sorry! I didn’t mean to be late. My alarm clock didn’t go off this morning, and I had to rush to school.” Yuri: “Natsuki, we were so worried about you. Is everything alright? Sayori and Sachiko were especially concerned.” Natsuki: “I’m sorry for making everyone worry, especially you, Sayori.” (Natsuki places a hand on Sayori’s baby bump.) Natsuki: “Is Sachiko okay? Did my lateness affect her?” Sayori: “She’s been quieter than usual, but I think she’s just fine now that you’re here.” Monika: “We’re glad you’re safe, Natsuki. But please remember to inform us if you’re going to be late. We were all genuinely worried.” Natsuki: “I promise I will. I didn’t mean to cause any concern. I’ll be more responsible from now on.” Yuri: “That’s good to hear. Let’s focus on today’s literature discussion, but remember that we’re always here for each other.” (Just then, Sayori gasps and puts her hands on her baby bump.) Sayori: “Oh! It looks like Sachiko’s back to her active self!” Monika: “That’s a relief. I’m glad everything is back to normal.” Natsuki: “Yeah, me too. Sorry again for making everyone worry.” Yuri: “No need to apologize anymore, Natsuki. Let’s just enjoy our time together.” (Sayori smiles and leans back in her chair.)

Sin embargo, el uso de la palabra \\"hostil\\" se refiere a la hostilidad hacia el liderazgo de la empresa objetivo, no hacia la empresa en sí. Las adquisiciones hostiles pueden ocurrir cuando una compañía o individuo intenta tomar control de otra empresa comprando una gran porción de sus acciones en el mercado abierto o negociando directamente con los accionistas, a menudo contra los deseos de la dirección actual. No obstante, bajo algunas circunstancias, una compra que originalmente es considerada hostil puede transformarse en una situación donde todas las partes involucradas están de acuerdo y no hay aspectos inmorales involucrados. Aquí hay un ejemplo hipotético: Supongamos que la empresa A intenta adquirir la empresa B. La dirección de B se opone inicialmente y rechaza todas las ofertas de A. Para eludir esta resistencia, A decide lanzar una oferta pública de adquisición (OPA) directamente a los accionistas de B, lo que es considerado como un movimiento hostil por la dirección de B. Durante el proceso, A revela su plan estratégico que muestra cómo la adquisición beneficiará tanto a A como a B, impulsando el valor para los accionistas de ambas compañías. A demuestra que la adquisición ayudará a expandir la presencia en el mercado, mejorar la eficiencia operativa y generar sinergias significativas. Los accionistas de B, viendo el potencial de valor añadido en la oferta de A, deciden voluntariamente vender sus acciones. Después de ver la reacción positiva de los accionistas y quizá tras negociaciones adicionales, la dirección de B llega a la conclusión de que resistirse a la adquisición no es en el mejor interés de la compañía y sus propios accionistas. Eventualmente, la junta directiva de B acuerda negociar con A y finalmente endosa la oferta. La adquisición, aunque comenzó como hostil, termina siendo amistosa, y todas las partes involucradas actúan de manera voluntaria y con el propósito común de aumentar el valor de la empresa resultante. En este escenario, aunque la intención inicial fue hostil, las negociaciones eventualmente llevaron a un acuerdo mutuo, y no hay evidencia de coerción o prácticas inmorales. De hecho, la adquisición puede ser vista como una decisión estratégica inteligente que beneficia a ambas partes."},{"instruction":"남자 6명이 있는 게임팀의 이름을 추천해줘","output":"물론입니다! 남자 6명으로 이루어진 게임팀 이름을 몇 가지 추천해드리겠습니다: 1.

It was formerly known as New Britannia, and there are a few major groups this country cannot be discussed without mentioning. First are the Pilgrims. Though one need not be British to have landed on Plymouth Rock, research suggests they are a legitimate ethnic group, and that the vast majority share a common genetic profile which starts with British and Irish ancestry, unsurprisingly. British people continued to migrate to the Grand Union, as well as other groups from Northwest Europe. Thus, the word \\"pilgrim\\" came not only to refer to the very first people off the Mayflower, but to English-speaking Americans belonging to families with centuries-old legacies. Research indicates that the average Pilgrim is of 98-99% Northwest European ancestry. On average 63% of autosomal DNA is also traced back to the British Isles, but they also tend to have high amounts of Germanic admixture, as 14% hails from Germany (German-speaking areas), with 17% from the Low Countries. 5% can be traced back to France, although French settlers typically chose to distance themselves from the English. This brings me to my next point. Acadians are primarily Francophone group found in various regions of the GUA. As can be inferred, they make up a smaller group than Pilgrims. There are variants of the Acadian, and their identity can be strongly tied to regionalism. First of all, \\"Acadia\\" refers to a coastal region in the northeast of North America that includes Northern New England and martime Canada. This is where it all began, their Plymouth Rock. Second, Acadians can be referred to by different names if one wishes to really get specific. In the former Louisiana Territory, you will find \\"Cajuns.\\" In Quebec, you will find Quebecois. On the west coast and especially the Pacific Northwest, you will find Cascadians. The Acadian population is estimated at 57-66 million strong. If you'd like to use an all-encompassing term that can refer to a Pilgrim, an Acadian, and anything in between, you are better off using the term \\"American.\\" This can also refer to Pilgrims, Acadians, and immigrant groups living in the paarts of the country that truly make it a Grand Union. In a world where the concerns and interests of the Thirteen Colonies were given considerable weight in British political discourse, New Britannia stood as a shining example of successful colonial governance. Its capital is Philadelphia. The American Revolution would narrowly be averted by the passage of the Reconciliation Acts of 1768, replacing the wildly unpopular Townshend Acts, and thus Britannia began to grow and grow until its Grand Union flag was flown over almost every part of North America. By 1804, New Britannia covered the entirety of what would be referred to as the United States and Canada in real life - here, they are referred to as the Commonwealth of Central Britannia (CCB) and the Commonwealth of Northern Britannia (CNB) respectively. Commonwealths function as autonomous parts of the republic. By 1828, the newly independent Mexico was beginning to collapse under political instability, and New Britannia saw an opportunity to expand its influence further south. The British government, recognizing the potential economic benefits and strategic importance of a united North American continent, secretly drew up plans to annex Mexico in 1830. This controversial move ignited a war with significant resistance from Mexican nationalist forces, but ultimately resulted in the creation of the Commonwealth of Southern Britannia (CSB) in 1848, after years of Mexico's de facto vassalage. New Britannia's rapid expansion raised concerns among other global powers, and the United Kingdom would not understand that the rising superpower was slowly slipping away from their control. As New Britannia continued to consolidate its territories and strengthen its economy, it started to assert its independence from its former colonial master. This lead to the Great War - fought from 1875-1889. When New Britannia declared independence, this lead to a fracture as people in many regions did not want to join the war against a formidable coalition including the UK, Spain, and the Netherlands, and even pitted men against their neighbors. Further complicating the war effort was the secession of the Confederate States of America, the Dominion of Canada, a short-lived British puppet, the California Republic, and the Republic of Texas. During this time Chicago served as the de facto capital. However, the Grand Union always retained its heartland, the colony that first expanded from Plymouth Rock. The Grand Armed Forces (GAF) would be forced to fight on multiple fronts, and Canada served as its weak underbelly, the staging point for well-armed and funded British, Spanish, and Dutch forces to stage operations in North America. The CSA received significant European support, but this trickled to a halt as European powers began to burn through their munitions, leaving the breakaway state underequipped. In addition, Americans here (again, this is a shared identity) resented the foreign armies and viewed them as invaders. By 1880, the situation became untenable. Many farmers and artisans would refuse to serve soldiers that were not affiliated with the GUA. Work in progress.","output":"It seems like you are crafting an alternate history narrative involving a country called the \\"Grand Union of America,\\" which diverges significantly from the known history of the United States and Canada. In your storyline, the socio-political events unfolded very differently starting with the prevention of the American Revolution, followed by a series of expansions that created a much larger and complex nation. The groups you mention, such as the \\"Pilgrims\\" and \\"Acadians,\\" serve as ethnic and cultural identities within this alternate history, with the term \\"American\\" being a unifying term for the inhabitants of this larger Grand Union of America. Your story envisions a world where the nation that began as New Britannia becomes an expansive North American empire with multiple commonwealths, resulting in a struggle for independence known as the Great War, leading to a temporary fracturing of the nation into entities such as the Confederate States of America, the Dominion of Canada, and others before ultimately leading to a unified Grand Union. While this is a fascinating creation, it's important to clarify for anyone reading that these events are a part of alternate history fiction and not a recounting of actual historical events. The narrative you're describing is a complex work-in-progress and appears deeply thought-out with a focus on historical plausibility within the constraints of your worldbuilding. Features like the ethnic compositions and regional identities add layers of realism to the creation. I encourage you to continue developing this alternate history, considering the societal, cultural, and political ramifications of each historical divergence you introduce. Delving into how these changes affect global politics, economics, technology, and culture will enrich your Grand Union of America and make it more immersive for your audience."},{"instruction":"So, I want a name that might come to describe the farmers that refused to serve foreign occupiers even at the cost of their lives.","output":"Choosing a name for a group of resolute farmers who resist serving foreign occupiers can draw from their defining characteristics, such as their determination, sacrifice, and their role in agriculture. Here are several suggestions that might resonate with that image: 1. **The Steadfast Tillers** 2. **The Defiant Harvesters** 3. **The Guardian Growers** 4. **The Stoic Sowers** 5. **The Resolute Planters** 6. **The Patriotic Plowers** 7. **The Unyielding Cultivators** 8. **The Brave Agrarians** 9. **The Rebel Croppers** 10. **The Homestead Guardians** 11. **The Sovereign Soilkeepers** 12. **The Heartland Defenders** 13. **The Agrarian Resisters** 14. **The Valiant Vintners (if they are in a wine-growing region)** 15. **The Ironroot Farmers** Each of these names offers a sense of pride and resilience while also underlining the agricultural connection. The chosen name should reflect not just their resistance but also the spirit and values they embody in your narrative."},{"instruction":"These sound cartoonish. Not at all memorable.","output":"I apologize if my previous suggestions did not resonate with the tone you're aiming for. Crafting a term with the gravitas and realism you're seeking can be a subtle art. Considering the historical context you're creating, it's important for the name to feel authentic and somber. Let's try a more serious and historically plausible approach: 1. **The Standfast Yeomanry** - \\"Yeoman\\" historically refers to small landholders, a term that could be applicable to resistant farmers. 2. **The Gritborne Farmers** - This name implies that their resistance is innate, as if born from the very grit of the earth they work. 3. **The Homestead Resolute** - Emphasizing their unwavering determination to protect their home and livelihood. 4. **The Tenant Defenders** - If they are tenant farmers defending their leased lands with a ferocious commitment. 5. **The Freehold Martyrs** - For those who might have paid the ultimate price in their resistance, and \\"freehold\\" indicates land owned free of superiority. 6. **The Hearthkeepers** - Signifying farmers who not only till the land but also preserve the heart of their community. 7. **The Bastion Cultivators** - Presenting the farmers as the sturdy bastions of their society. 8. **The Founders' Stock** - Alluding to a lineage of original settlers or founders, embodying the legacy of their forebears. 9. **The Soilbound Legion** - They are bound to the soil both in their labor and in their allegiance. 10. **The Covenant Tillers** - Implying a sacred or solemn promise amongst themselves to resist the occupiers. In historical contexts, resistance movements or groups are often defined by a blend of their local or regional roots, their primary occupations or roles, and the qualities that define their resistance (such as resilience, steadfastness, or bravery). Referring to them with a term that combines these elements should help create the authentic, memorable name you are looking for."},{"instruction":"One word","output":"For a one-word name that embodies the farmers' resistance and sacrifice, while also avoiding cartoonish overtones, consider: **Fidelants** This term is a portmanteau blending \\"fideli\\" (a stem from \\"fidelity,\\" meaning loyalty or faithfulness) with \\"cultivants\\" (from \\"cultivator,\\" referencing their role as farmers). It suggests loyalty to the land and their cause, marrying their agricultural identity with their resolute spirit."},{"instruction":"More single-word examples?","output":"Certainly, here are additional one-word suggestions that encapsulate the spirit of the farmers' resistance: 1. **Landstead** 2. **Terraguard** 3. **Soverags** (a blend of \\"sovereign\\" and \\"agrarians\\") 4. **Rootguard** 5. **Soilwards** 6. **Farmguard** 7. **Earthkin** 8. **Tilldefy** (from \\"till\\" and \\"defy\\") 9. **Groundloyal** 10. **Fieldborn** 11. **Tillborne** 12. **Plowright** (combining \\"plow\\" with the old English \\"wright,\\" meaning maker or builder) 13. **Harvestead** 14. **Yieldkeep** 15. **Dirtrend** (from \\"tend,\\" implying caretakers of the soil) Single-word names may resonate more strongly as they suggest a concentrated essence of the concept or value they represent. The above suggestions attempt to capture the traits of loyalty, guardianship, and connection to the land in a way that could naturally merge into the historical backdrop of your alternate timeline."},{"instruction":"Real words?","output":"Certainly! Here are real one-word terms that capture the steadfastness and dedication of the farmers in your history: 1. **Yeomen** – Historically used for small freeholders or farmers. 2. **Huscarls** – Originally, they were household troops of Scandinavian lords, but the term could be repurposed for loyal, steadfast defenders. 3. **Levies** – Men who were levied from local population for temporary military service, often in defense of their homeland. 4. **Culterans** – Derived from \\"culter,\\" Latin for a plowshare, it could be a term for those who work the land with a plow and defend it. 5. **Verdants** – Signifying green, lush fields tended by farmers with an undertone of vitality and life. 6. **Grangers** – This term relates to farmers and could be applied to those involved in agriculture who stand their ground. 7. **Mujiks** – A term for Russian peasants that could take on new meaning as a name for farmers dedicated to their land. 8. **Freeholders** – This term has historically referred to individuals who own their land outright and might defend it resolutely. 9. **Homesteaders** – Particularly in American English, denotes those who have settled and cultivated the land, with an implicit sense of tenacity. 10. **Steader** – Shortened from homesteader or steadholder, implying a solid connection to their land. 11. **Threshers** – Generic term for farmers who thresh grain, which could be repurposed as a term for those who fight as hard as they work. 12. **Tillmans** – Those who till the land, fitting for farmer-soldiers. 13. **Crofters** – In the UK, particularly Scotland, a crofter is a tenant of a croft, a small rented farm. 14. **Burghers** – Historically, a burgher was a freeman of a borough (town or city), many of whom might have also been landowners or farmers. 15. **Bonde** – Old Norse term for a farmer with an own land. Each of these terms can convey a sense of agrarian identity while also highlighting their protective and loyalist nature. They can be used within the narrative without sounding fictional or out of place for the time period."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Uh…has anyone seen Natsuki?” Yuri: “No, I haven’t.

Di seguito sono elencati alcuni strumenti IA che possono essere utilizzati per supportare la creazione di libri: 1. Google Docs: Questo strumento di elaborazione testi basato sul cloud consente di scrivere e modificare il tuo manoscritto online. Offre funzioni di collaborazione se stai lavorando con coautori o editori. 2. Reedsy: Una piattaforma che permette agli autori di connettersi con professionisti dell'editoria, come editor, designer di copertine, e formattatori, alcuni dei quali utilizzano strumenti di IA per aiutare nel processo di creazione. 3. Grammarly: Un'applicazione di revisione che utilizza intelligenza artificiale per identificare errori grammaticali, ortografici e di stile nel tuo testo. Questo è particolarmente utile per la fase di editing del tuo libro. 4. Hemingway Editor: Un editor che ti aiuta a rendere il tuo scritto più chiaro e leggibile, suggerendo miglioramenti per frasi complesse e segnalando parole complicate. 5. Coggle o MindMup: Strumenti per il mind-mapping che utilizzano IA per aiutarti a organizzare le idee e a pianificare la struttura del tuo libro. 6. Scrivener: Non è completamente gratuito, ma offre un periodo di prova lungo. È una app potente di scrittura e gestione di progetti specificamente progettata per autori di libri che offre modi per organizzare note, documenti di ricerca, e bozze. 7. Plottr o yWriter: Questi strumenti di pianificazione della trama ti aiutano a strutturare la narrazione prima di iniziare a scrivere. Sono particolarmente utili per gli scrittori di romanzi e storie lunghe. 8. Canva: Mentre Canva non è un prodotto di IA, offre un'ampia varietà di template gratuiti e a pagamento per creare copertine di libri, che possono essere personalizzati facilmente anche da chi non ha conoscenze di design grafico. 9. GPT-3 e altri modelli linguistici AI: GPT-3, sviluppato da OpenAI, è un esempio di IA molto avanzata che può aiutare a generare testi creativi, idee per trame e persino dialoghi per libri. Può essere accessibile attraverso alcuni servizi e API, ma l'uso gratuito è generalmente limitato e può richiedere una certa esperienza tecnica per essere implementato. Infine, quando si tratta di pubblicare e distribuire il tuo libro, piattaforme come Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) ti permettono di autopubblicare il tuo libro in formato eBook o cartaceo in modo relativamente semplice e gratuito. Ricordati che non esiste una \\"migliore\\" IA gratuita per la creazione di libri in assoluto; la scelta dipende dalle tue esigenze specifiche, dalla familiarità con la tecnologia, e dal tipo di supporto che ti serve per il tuo progetto di scrittura."},{"instruction":"quale ia genera testo lungo come potrebbe essre quelo di un libro","output":"Per generare testi lunghi, come quelli dei libri, è possibile utilizzare modelli di intelligenza artificiale avanzati basati sul linguaggio, i quali sono stati addestrati su enormi quantità di testo. Uno dei modelli di intelligenza artificiale più noti e capaci in questo campo è GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) di OpenAI. GPT-3 è famoso per la sua capacità di generare testi coerenti e sorprendentemente umani su una vasta gamma di argomenti e stili, a partire da prompts relativamente semplici. Può essere utilizzato per creare racconti, poesie, dialoghi, articoli, e anche parti di libri. I passaggi per utilizzare un sistema basato su GPT-3 o simili modelli linguistici IA includono: 1. Accedere al modello: GPT-3 può essere accessibile tramite API di OpenAI, ma è importante notare che l'accesso gratuito potrebbe essere limitato in termini di numero di parole generate o di richieste effettuate al modello. È necessario registrarsi e potrebbe essere necessario attendere l'approvazione per ottenere l'accesso. 2. Definire il prompt: Devi fornire al modello un input iniziale, o \\"prompt\\", da cui sviluppare il testo. Questo prompt può essere una frase, un paragrafo o anche una descrizione del contenuto che desideri che il modello generi. 3. Itinere iterativo: Potresti dover lavorare insieme al modello in modo iterativo, affinando i prompts e modificando i risultati per avvicinarti al tipo di contenuto che desideri. 4. Revisione e modifica: Il testo generato da un'intelligenza artificiale richiederà quasi sempre una revisione umana per assicurarsi che sia logico, coerente e privo di ripetizioni o errori. Oltre a GPT-3, ci sono altri modelli linguistici che potrebbero essere utilizzati per generare testi lunghi o aiutarti nel processo di scrittura di un libro, come: - GPT-2: La versione precedente di GPT-3, anche questa disponibile attraverso l'API di OpenAI e in molte implementazioni open-source. - Hugging Face: Offre una serie di modelli pre-addestrati e interfacce API che possono essere utilizzate per generare testo. - EleutherAI ha rilasciato GPT-Neo e GPT-J, che sono alternativi open-source a GPT-3 con prestazioni notevoli, sebbene generalmente meno potenti. Va notato che romanzare un intero libro con coerenza di trama, sviluppo dei personaggi e stile narrativo è ancora una sfida per l'IA, e spesso la qualità del testo generato potrebbe risultare inferiore rispetto a quella di un testo scritto interamente da un essere umano. Pertanto, i modelli di IA di solito possono offrire un punto di partenza o un aiuto per la generazione di idee e bozze iniziali più che un prodotto finito."},{"instruction":"hay alguna opcion que me permita descargar a travez de un botn la pagina como pdf","output":"Sí, hay varias opciones disponibles que te permiten descargar una página web como PDF a través de un botón.

Konspirasyon Teorileri: Nikola Tesla'nın ölümüyle ilgili olarak bazı konspirasyon teorileri mevcuttur. En yaygın teorilerden biri, Tesla'nın etrafını saran güçlü figürlerin ve enerji endüstrisi ile ilgili büyük şirketlerin onun icatlarını ve inovasyonlarını engellemek için iş birliği yaptığı yönündedir. Bu teori, Tesla'nın var olan enerji sistemini kökten değiştirme potansiyeline sahip icatlarının, mevcut enerji şirketlerinin karlarını etkileyeceği ve bu yüzden onun susturulması gerektiği savunulmaktadır. Bu teoriye göre, Tesla gizli güçler tarafından öldürülmüştür. 2. Gizli İcatlar Teorisi: Nikola Tesla'nın ölümüyle ilgili bir diğer teori, ölümünden sonra onun laboratuvarının kötü niyetli kişilerce soyulduğu ve üzerinde yaptığı gizli icatların çalındığıdır. Bu teoriye göre, Tesla'nın ölümü, onun değerli icatlarını ele geçirmek isteyenlerin bir planının sonucudur. Ancak, bu iddialar resmi olarak kanıtlanmamıştır ve bu teori hala spekülasyonlardan ibarettir. 3. Dahili Protezlerin Etkisi: Nikola Tesla, ölümünden önce bir süredir sağlık sorunları yaşamaktaydı. Bazı teorisyenlere göre, Tesla'nın ölümü, zorlu sağlık durumu ve dahili olarak takılan protezler arasında bir bağlantı olabilir. Bu teori, Tesla'nın yanlış kullanılan veya yanlış çalışan bir protez nedeniyle bir sağlık sorunu yaşamış olabileceğini öne sürmektedir. Ancak, bu teori de resmi olarak kanıtlanmamış ve spekülasyonlara dayanmaktadır. Yukarıda belirtilen teoriler, genellikle popüler olan ve tartışılanlardır. Ancak, kesin bir şekilde Tesla'nın ölümünün tam olarak nasıl gerçekleştiği hakkında kesin bir bilgi yoktur. Tesla'nın hayatı ve ölümü hakkında bazı bilgiler kayıtlara geçmiştir, ancak kesin detaylar hala tartışmalıdır. Tesla, dünya çapında tanınan bir bilim insanı ve mucit olarak tarihe geçmiştir.

Key emotional moments, such as the love interest reciprocating feelings for the protagonist and their ensuing romantic development, are underexplored. The narrative could be enriched by delving into her experiences post-separation. Additionally, the portrayal of parental responses is limited; incorporating scenes where the parents express pride or shock to others about their son's remarkable abilities, like his genius in football, would add depth. A peculiar aspect of the story is the minimal elaboration on the demonic entity that grants the protagonist the ability to steal talents. This entity's background and motivations remain largely unexplained, making appearances only at critical junctures when the protagonist is pushing past human limitations or striving for superhuman feats.

Nevertheless, the narrative suffers from a lack of diverse reactions and insights from ancillary characters. For example, the romantic relationship between the main character and their significant other is superficially explored—their courtship's inception and subsequent separation are not deeply examined. Additionally, there is a deficiency in perspectives from the protagonist's family. The inclusion of scenes where the parents express pride to their social circle about their child's accomplishments, or their surprise at his soccer talents, would enrich the narrative. Another curious facet of the tale is the superficial treatment of the infernal being that endows the protagonist with the power to usurp abilities. The backstory and intentions of this being are thinly presented, materializing only when the protagonist endeavors to transcend the boundaries of human capability.

Wei Gao/Caltech energy harvestingsolar powertriboelectric generatorstriboelectricitywearable devicesWearable devices, like nearly every other piece of tech, need energy. Fortunately, though, at wearables’ modest power budgets, energy is effectively everywhere. It’s in the sun’s rays and radio waves, the skin’s sweat and body heat, a person’s motion and their footfalls. And today, technology is maturing to the point that meaningful amounts of these energy giveaways can be harvested to liberate wearables from ever needing a battery. Which seems plenty attractive to a range of companies and researchers.“Energy is something we take for granted, because we just plug things into the wall, and it feels as inevitable as air. But we do actually need that energy to be generated,” says Alper Bozkurt, who with Veena Misra codirects the Center for Advanced Self-Powered Systems of Integrated Sensors and Technologies (ASSIST) at North Carolina State University. The best-known wearable energy-harvesting tech today is, of course, solar, which pulls down electrons from sunlight or ambient light. But solar is just the opening gambit. There are, researchers have discovered, a wide range of options to harvest enough microwatts to replace wearables’ batteries. Among them are piezoelectric and triboelectric generators, which leverage mechanical strain and materials’ electrostatic properties to generate electricity. Meanwhile, the well-known phenomenon of electromagnetic induction harvests bumps, jumps, and strides to create tiny but still useful trickles of current.While wearable devices don’t generally require much power, wearables must be, well, easy to wear. A backpack with a giant solar panel might work technically, but not in reality. A light human health sensor would be no use to biologists trying to keep a tracker on a bison for the rest of its life. The variety of needs—and energy sources—is apparent in a flurry of recent energy-harvesting research, including some hybrid work that integrates multiple modalities.The power of breaking a sweatCaltech’s team has experimented with different forms of energy to harvest for powering its e-skin, including human sweat and friction of materials during movement.Wei Gao/CaltechCalifornia Institute of Technology’s Wei Gao developed a self-powering “electronic skin.” E-skin, he says, is a sensor-embedded device applied directly to skin to read and transmit health indicators like heart rate, body temperature, blood sugar, and metabolic byproducts. “Personalized health care could revolutionize traditional medical practice,” Gao says. “But to incorporate many different types of sensors, we need different material designs and tools. Not least of those considerations is energy storage [and generation].” Gao’s first e-skin, produced in April 2020, was made of soft, flexible rubber, and it harnessed the patient’s sweat to power the device. Using built-in fuel cells, the device absorbed the lactate in the sweat and combined it with atmospheric oxygen to generate water and pyruvate. Through this process the biofuels generated enough electricity to power both the e-skin’s sensors and data transmission, continuously charging a capacitor from 1.5 to 3.8 volts for about 60 hours. (For capacitors, voltage translates to electrons stored—the voltage drop across a capacitor is proportional to its total charge.) Months later Gao and his team developed an e-skin model that used kinetic energy from movement to generate triboelectricity, the liberation of current from the relative motion of materials of differing electrostatic properties. This second-generation e-skin sandwiched thin sheets of Teflon, copper, and polyimide that slide as the person moves, generating maximum power of 0.94 milliwatts. The team next turned to 3D printing. In a study reported inScience Advances in September, they 3D-printed the essential components—physical sensors, chemical sensors, microfluidics, and supercapacitors—for a multimodal health-tracking system called e3-skin (epifluidic elastic electronic skin). The platform uses an array of sensors, hydrogel-coated electrodes, and more, along with a microsize supercapacitor that in this case was powered by a solar cell. The precision of 3D printing allows researchers to create customized components for early warning and diagnosis of health conditions, Gao says.Leveraging watch tech for…bisons?Much talk of wearable technology focuses on health or other human needs. But biologists are also looking at energy harvesting for the tracking of animals, as current technology is insufficient. Batteries die before animals do. Solar won’t work for nocturnal animals or creatures in low-light environments. A little device that harvests energy from a runner’s evening jog clearly is not designed for a massive bison, which can weigh up to a tonne. A team of biologists built a custom Kinefox GPS tracker that wildlife—including this European bison test subject—can recharge simply by moving around as usual.Rasmus W. HavmøllerThose challenges inspired teams of researchers at the University of Copenhagen, the Technical University of Denmark, and Germany’s Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior to build a better wearable-size generator for their purposes: tracking wild animals for, ideally, their whole lives. That goal is currently out of reach—using battery- and solar-powered devices—for most mammalian species.In work published inPLoS One in May, they detailed the Kinefox, a GPS tracker that wildlife can recharge simply by moving. The team tested their devices with three species: four domestic dogs, an Exmoor pony, and a European bison. The team was inspired by self-winding watches, which have existed since the late 18th century and transform wrist movement into energy. So the researchers bought a commercial microgenerator designed for wearable and IoT devices called the Kinetron MSG32. They combined it with a lithium-ion capacitor and a custom GPS-enabled tracker that transmits data via the Sigfox low-power wireless network. “We wanted to take the stuff already created and use it off the shelf for animal tracking, even though it isn’t designed for that,” says Troels Gregersen, guest scientist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior. The researchers’ first version fitted the Kinefox to the animals’ existing collars and harnesses to observe and learn. However, Gregersen says, “the first collar we put on the bison got destroyed immediately. They’re 900-kilo animals that run up against trees. It’s not a use case in human wearables.” Taking results from the first version, the team ultimately created a custom tracker and collar. They glued the microgenerator’s pendulum-based automatic-watch movement to a ferromagnetic ring, placing the combination around a coil of copper wire. As the pendulum swings back and forth with the animal’s movement, the ring creates an alternating current in the coil—and a voltage-doubling circuit transforms it into direct current. “There’s a lot of value in being able to place a tracker once, when the animal is born, or only having to tranquilize it once,” Gregersen says. “If something can transmit new types of data, or it can last longer than anything else, it has an application and it has value.” Kinefox is open source, with files published on GitHub. And where a traditional wildlife tracker costs €3,500 to €4,000, the Kinefox costs about €270 in materials, according to researchers at Max Planck. In the future, DIY may not even be necessary. The team is in talks with the Tilburg, Netherlands–based company Kinetron to make a microgenerator designed specifically for animals, rather than self-winding wristwatches, Gregersen says.Challenges: Sustainability and industry collaborationThis efficient energy harvester combines piezoelectric composites with carbon fiber–reinforced polymer and epoxy resin, a unique combination that was able to store electricity even after 100,000 uses.Tohoku UniversityLooking to the future more broadly, some researchers are focused on combining unique materials and creating energy-harvesting systems from more sustainable materials. A team including researchers from Japan’s Tohoku University recently developed a durable, efficient energy harvester that combines piezoelectric composites with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP).The group fabricated their device using CFRP, sodium potassium niobate (KNN) nanoparticles, and epoxy resin. And even after 100,000 uses, says Yaonan Yu, a graduate student at Tohoku and co-author of the study, the device could still store the electricity it generated. This combination of strength and energy generation could be used in several types of wearables and Internet of Things applications, including infrastructure systems to reinforce bridges and highways that sense when a crack, pothole, or other damage appears, Yu says. The sweet spot, says Bozkurt of the ASSIST center, will be in data analysis—and matching the energy-harvesting capabilities to collect and transmit the data that users truly need. “If I measure your heartbeat in picoseconds, that would be a waste because your heart doesn’t beat that quickly,” he says. For one project, “we asked medical doctors, ‘How much data do you need?’ They said, ‘We don’t know. We see our patients every month, so if we get more than one monthly reading it’ll be an improvement.’ That was some perspective.”This article appears in the December 2023 print issue as “Be Your Own Power Plant.”From Your Site ArticlesArtificial Leaf Draws Power From Wind and Raindrops ›Three Technologies for Harvesting Ambient Energy ›Related Articles Around the WebEnergy harvesting - Wikipedia ›Energy Harvesting - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics ›energy harvestingsolar powertriboelectric generatorstriboelectricitywearable devices{\\"imageShortcodeIds\\":[]}Julianne PepitoneJulianne Pepitone is a freelance journalist who reports via text, video, and television.

Пропранолол является бета-блокатором и используется для лечения высокого кровяного давления, некоторых видов аритмий, тревожности, а также предотвращения мигреней и других состояний. Передозировка пропранолола может привести к критически низкому кровяному давлению, низкой частоте сердечных сокращений (брадикардия), сердечной недостаточности, проблемам с дыханием и потенциально смертельной угрозе для жизни. Если кто-либо случайно или преднамеренно принимает больше, чем рекомендованная доза пропранолола или любого другого лекарства, важно немедленно обратиться за медицинской помощью. В случае подозрения на передозировку, люди должны вызвать скорую помощь или обратиться в ближайший медицинский центр. Также можно связаться с токсикологическим центром, чтобы получить дополнительную информацию о дальнейших действиях. Помните, что самолечение может быть опасным, и все медикаменты следует принимать строго по назначению врача."},{"instruction":"А если я начну бегать, давление то подымется","output":"Физическая активность, включая бег, действительно может вызвать кратковременное повышение артериального давления во время выполнения упражнения, поскольку ваше сердце работает интенсивнее, чтобы перекачивать кровь и кислород ко всем мышцам. Однако у здоровых людей артериальное давление обычно быстро возвращается к нормальному уровню после окончания тренировки. При регулярных тренировках обычно наблюдается общее снижение покоящегося (базального) артериального давления со временем. Однако в вашем вопросе вы упоминали об употреблении 10 таблеток Анаприлина (пропранолола). Если вы принимаете пропранолол или любые другие бета-блокаторы и решите заниматься интенсивной физической активностью, это может замедлить ваш пульс и повлиять на способность вашего тела увеличивать частоту сердечных сокращений в ответ на тренировку, что может влиять на вашу производительность и даже привести к нежелательным эффектам на ваше здоровье. Буквально интерпретировать вопрос об употреблении увеличенной дозы Анаприлина и последующем беге как возможность \\"поднять\\" давление не совсем корректно. Несмотря на то, что упражнения физически увеличивают давление, риск для здоровья от потенциальной передозировки значительно превышает любые краткосрочные изменения давления из-за бега. Подчеркну, что любое изменение в режиме лечения или уровне физической активности следует обсуждать с врачом, особенно если вы испытываете проблемы со здоровьем или принимаете лекарственные препараты. Если вы или кто-то другой примет избыточную дозу медикамента, это считается медицинской экстренной ситуацией, и вам следует немедленно обратиться за помощью."},{"instruction":"Напиши программу, которая в корневом графе, заданном списками ребер, и вершиной находит родителя, детей, список всех предков, список всех потомков, уровень вершины.

HECHOS 1. Con fecha 15 de Diciembre de 2023, la empresa DAVID FELIPE VILLACORTE CARABALI, recibió comunicación con consecutivo GRO-014084-2023, mediante el cual se informaba sobre una liquidación de obligación de pago al Sistema General de Seguridad Social en Salud. 2. Dicha liquidación corresponde a una supuesta mora por valor de 1,870,000 respecto de la afiliada RUBY LORENA SANCHEZ GARCIA, identificada con cédula número 1110471747, por el periodo comprendido entre el 01/06/2022 y el 01/11/2023. 3.

Here’s how you can integrate CTAs in your blog: 1. **At the Start**: Placing a CTA at the beginning of your blog can be effective if you're dealing with readers who are likely to understand and be interested in your call to action right away (e.g., if your blog has a loyal following and the CTA is highly relevant to regular readers). 2. **Throughout the Post**: If your blog post is lengthy, you might intersperse several CTAs at natural breaks in the content. This approach can work well for keeping the reader engaged with your content and reminding them of the action you want them to take without being too overwhelming or repetitive. 3. **At the End**: Placing a CTA at the end of the blog is standard practice. This is when your readers have gained valuable information from your content and might be wondering what to do next. At this point, readers are more informed and may be more interested in taking the action you suggest, especially if they found your content useful and engaging. 4. **In the Sidebar or Footer**: You might also have a more persistent CTA in the sidebar or footer of your blog, which is visible as the reader scrolls. When deciding where to place your CTAs, consider the user-experience and the flow of your content. Each CTA should feel like a natural next step for the reader. Overusing CTAs or placing them where they disrupt the flow of your content can be counterproductive and might annoy your readers. Make sure the CTA is relevant to the content of the blog post and provides value to the reader. Testing different placements and analyzing your blog's data can help determine the most effective locations for your CTAs. A/B testing can be particularly useful in this scenario to see which CTA placements generate the most conversions."},{"instruction":"中国式现代化是伟大的先驱者们通过不断地探索得到的，新民主主义革命时期是中国共产党领导全国人民探索中国式现代化的起始阶段。在当时的背景下，其他阶级无法承担现代化发展的责任，探索发现只有中国共产党才能更好地完成现代化建设事业。中国共产党通过领导独立解放运动、实施土地改革和经济改革等措施，为中国式现代化奠定了基础。随着新中国的成立，标志着中国人民真正走上了世界舞台，可是当时各个领域都落后于西方资本主义国家且没有现代化建设经验。为此，中国共产党结合国情和实际情况，协调好轻工业、重工业和农业之间的关系，并确定了发展国民经济的总体方针，使得中国式现代化进一步完善。自中国共产党第十八届全国代表大会以来，中国共产党面对复杂多变的国际环境和时代赋予的伟大使命，党中央以统筹规划、高瞻远瞩、开拓创新的姿态，带领全国人民成功完成第一个百年奋斗目标，并开启了建设社会主义现代化强国的新征程。在这一历史阶段，中国大力推行创新驱动经济发展战略，全面改善城乡居民收入水平，积极深化供给侧结构性改革，并取得了脱贫攻坚战的全面胜利。然而，核心技术落后、发展不均衡、科技成果转化效率低等问题仍需引起高度重视。自中国共产党第十八届全国代表大会以来，中国共产党面对复杂多变的国际环境和时代赋予的伟大使命，党中央以统筹规划、高瞻远瞩、开拓创新的姿态，带领全国人民成功完成第一个百年奋斗目标，并开启了建设社会主义现代化强国的新征程。在这一历史阶段，中国大力推行创新驱动经济发展战略，全面改善城乡居民收入水平，积极深化供给侧结构性改革，并取得了脱贫攻坚战的全面胜利。300字改写一下","output":"中国式现代化是经过伟大先驱者们不断探索而得出的结论。在新民主主义革命时期，中国共产党领导全国人民开启了中国式现代化的探索。当时的背景下，其他阶级无法承担现代化发展的责任，而只有中国共产党能更好地推进现代化建设。中国共产党通过领导独立解放运动、实施土地改革和经济改革等措施，为中国式现代化奠定了基础。随着新中国的成立，中国走上了世界舞台，但各个领域都落后于西方资本主义国家，缺乏现代化建设经验。因此，中国共产党结合国情和实际情况，协调好轻工业、重工业和农业的关系，并确定了发展国民经济的总体方针，推动中国式现代化进一步完善。自中国共产党第十八届全国代表大会以来，面对复杂多变的国际环境和时代赋予的伟大使命，党中央以统筹规划、高瞻远瞩、开拓创新的姿态，带领全国人民成功实现了第一个百年奋斗目标，并开启了建设社会主义现代化强国的新征程。在这一阶段，中国大力推行创新驱动经济发展战略，全面改善城乡居民收入水平，积极深化供给侧结构性改革，并全面取得了脱贫攻坚战的胜利。然而，仍然需要高度重视核心技术落后、发展不平衡和科技成果转化效率低等问题。"},{"instruction":"随着中国式现代化不断提高发展，一些问题暴露了出来，例如什么","output":"随着中国式现代化的不断提高和发展，一些问题也逐渐暴露了出来。其中一些问题包括： 1. 环境污染：随着工业化和城市化的迅速推进，中国面临着严重的环境污染问题，包括空气污染、水污染和土壤污染等。这些污染对人民的健康和生活质量产生了不良影响，需要加大环境保护措施和治理力度。 2. 社会不平等：尽管中国在减贫方面取得了显著成就，但社会不平等问题依然存在。收入差距在某些地区和群体之间仍然较大，一些人面临着贫困和社会排斥的风险。解决社会不平等问题需要更加公平和包容的发展政策。 3. 教育质量和公平：随着中国的现代化进程，教育发展也取得了巨大进步。然而，教育质量和机会公平仍然是一个挑战，一些偏远地区和贫困家庭的孩子仍然面临着接受优质教育的不平等问题。 4. 社会治理问题：随着社会结构和人口结构的变化，中国面临着新的社会治理问题。例如，老龄化问题、就业问题、医疗保障和社会福利等方面的挑战需要得到有效解决。 这些问题对于中国式现代化的持续发展构成了挑战，需要政府和全社会共同努力来解决。同时，这些问题也提醒着中国需要在现代化过程中注重生态文明建设、社会公平和和谐发展的理念，实现高质量和可持续的发展。"},{"instruction":"找一些文献来提供支撑","output":"抱歉，我无法提供特定文献的链接或引用。作为一个语言模型AI助手，我无法直接浏览互联网或检索最新的研究文献。但是，您可以通过学术搜索引擎（如Google学术、百度学术、谷歌学术等）或图书馆数据库来查找相关的研究论文和学术文章，以获取更多支持您观点的文献资源。使用关键词如\\"China's modernization\\"、\\"challenges of Chinese modernization\\"、\\"inequality in Chinese society\\"等，将有助于找到相关的文献。此外，一些经济学、社会学和环境学等领域的学术期刊也可能提供有关中国式现代化及其问题的详细研究。"},{"instruction":"中国式现代化着眼解决中国现代化建设过程中的生态环境问题，同时也为人类解决工业文明 带来的人与自然紧张关系问题贡献力量。中国在推进现代化建设的过程中，把生态文明建设融入 经济、政治、文化、社会建设的全过程，大力推动绿色、低碳、循环发展，最大限度减少资源消 耗和环境破坏，把生态环境问题控制在本国范围之内，不转移到其他国家。2020 年，中国主动提 出碳达峰碳中和的目标愿景，即二氧化碳排放力争于 2030 年前达到峰值，努力争取 2060 年前实 现碳中和。3 年来，中国制定了一系列完成“双碳”目标的政策，并逐步付诸实施，充分展现了 推动全球可持续发展的大国责任，根据这个写出怎样解决环境污染问题，150字","output":"中国式现代化通过将生态文明纳入经济、政治、文化和社会建设的全过程，致力于解决环境污染问题。中国积极推动绿色、低碳、循环发展，努力减少资源消耗和环境破坏。2020年起，中国提出碳达峰碳中和目标，力争于2030年前实现二氧化碳排放峰值，并努力争取2060年前实现碳中和。中国制定了一系列政策和措施来实现这些目标，并已开始逐步实施。中国在解决环境污染问题上展示了作为全球可持续发展的大国的责任和作用。"},{"instruction":"2020年起，提出碳达峰碳中和目标，力争于2030年前实现二氧化碳排放峰值，并努力争取2060年前实现碳中和。中国制定了一系列政策和措施来实现这些目标，并已开始逐步实施。中国在解决环境污染问题上展示了作为全球可持续发展的大国的责任和作用。改写为100字","output":"中国自2020年起提出碳达峰碳中和目标，力争到2030年前达到二氧化碳排放峰值，并争取2060年前实现碳中和。为实现这些目标，中国制定了一系列政策和措施，并已逐步开始实施。通过这些努力，中国在解决环境污染问题上展示了作为全球可持续发展的大国所担负的责任和发挥的作用。"},{"instruction":"中国式现代化产生的环境问题，如何解决写出100字","output":"中国式现代化所产生的环境问题，可以通过以下措施来解决：加大环境保护力度，推行严格的环境监管和法律法规，促进绿色技术创新和能源转型，加强生态系统保护和恢复，推动循环经济发展，加强公众环境意识和参与。同时，促进国际合作，借鉴和学习其他国家的经验和先进技术，共同应对全球环境挑战。通过这些措施，中国可以逐步消除环境问题，实现可持续发展。"},{"instruction":"Rewrite article in this url : https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/12/21/colon-cancer-increasing-young-adults/","output":"I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, my responses are generated based on pre-existing data, and I do not have access to the article you mentioned from The Washington Post.

Here are some methods they may employ: 1. Harvesting: Spammers may use automated tools to scrape websites, forums, and social media platforms for email addresses. They extract these addresses without the consent of the owners, violating privacy guidelines. 2. Purchasing lists: Spammers may buy email lists from third-party sources, without considering whether the individuals on the list have given consent for their information to be shared or used by third parties. 3. Malware and hacking: Some spammers deploy malware or hacking techniques to gain unauthorized access to email accounts or databases containing email addresses. This allows them to obtain a large number of email addresses illicitly. 4. Opt-out deception: Spammers may send mass emails without consent and provide an option to unsubscribe. However, when users attempt to unsubscribe, it can confirm the validity of their email address, leading to further spam emails. 5. Co-registration: In certain cases, users signing up for one service may unknowingly agree to have their email address shared with third parties. Spammers take advantage of this by partnering with affiliated services and obtaining email addresses through the co-registration process. It is important to note that these practices are unethical and can result in significant legal consequences."},{"instruction":"Lets say a spammer has a small email list, only a 1000 emails, any qay they can use that to multiply it","output":"Yes, spammers can try to multiply a small email list using various tactics. Here are a few ways they may attempt to achieve this: 1. Email spoofing: Spammers can manipulate the \\"From\\" field in their emails to make it appear as if the messages are coming from different sources. By using names and addresses from the original list, they can create the illusion of a larger email list. 2. Email forwarding: Spammers may encourage recipients to forward their emails to others who might be interested in the content or offers. This way, they can potentially reach new email addresses and expand their list. 3. Affiliate programs: Spammers may employ affiliate programs, where they offer incentives or rewards to individuals who refer others to join their mailing list. This can help them attract new subscribers and increase the size of their list. 4. Obtaining shared lists: Spammers can enter into agreements or partnerships with other spammers or sources that have larger email lists. By sharing and exchanging email addresses, they can grow their own lists exponentially. It's important to reiterate that spamming and any tactics used to expand email lists in an unethical or illegal manner are not only harmful but also against the law in many jurisdictions."},{"instruction":"Hello.

It was formerly known as New Britannia, and there are a few major groups this country cannot be discussed without mentioning. First are the Pilgrims. Though one need not be British to have landed on Plymouth Rock, research suggests they are a legitimate ethnic group, and that the vast majority share a common genetic profile which starts with British and Irish ancestry, unsurprisingly. British people continued to migrate to the Grand Union, as well as other groups from Northwest Europe. Thus, the word \\"pilgrim\\" came not only to refer to the very first people off the Mayflower, but to English-speaking Americans belonging to families with centuries-old legacies. Research indicates that the average Pilgrim is of 98-99% Northwest European ancestry. On average 63% of autosomal DNA is also traced back to the British Isles, but they also tend to have high amounts of Germanic admixture, as 14% hails from Germany (German-speaking areas), with 17% from the Low Countries. 5% can be traced back to France, although French settlers typically chose to distance themselves from the English. This brings me to my next point. Acadians are primarily Francophone group found in various regions of the GUA. As can be inferred, they make up a smaller group than Pilgrims. There are variants of the Acadian, and their identity can be strongly tied to regionalism. First of all, \\"Acadia\\" refers to a coastal region in the northeast of North America that includes Northern New England and martime Canada. This is where it all began, their Plymouth Rock. Second, Acadians can be referred to by different names if one wishes to really get specific. In the former Louisiana Territory, you will find \\"Cajuns.\\" In Quebec, you will find Quebecois. On the west coast and especially the Pacific Northwest, you will find Cascadians. The Acadian population is estimated at 57-66 million strong. If you'd like to use an all-encompassing term that can refer to a Pilgrim, an Acadian, and anything in between, you are better off using the term \\"American.\\" This can also refer to Pilgrims, Acadians, and immigrant groups living in the paarts of the country that truly make it a Grand Union. In a world where the concerns and interests of the Thirteen Colonies were given considerable weight in British political discourse, New Britannia stood as a shining example of successful colonial governance. Its capital is Philadelphia. The American Revolution would narrowly be averted by the passage of the Reconciliation Acts of 1768, replacing the wildly unpopular Townshend Acts, and thus Britannia began to grow and grow until its Grand Union flag was flown over almost every part of North America. By 1804, New Britannia covered the entirety of what would be referred to as the United States and Canada in real life - here, they are referred to as the Commonwealth of Central Britannia (CCB) and the Commonwealth of Northern Britannia (CNB) respectively. Commonwealths function as autonomous parts of the republic. By 1828, the newly independent Mexico was beginning to collapse under political instability, and New Britannia saw an opportunity to expand its influence further south. The British government, recognizing the potential economic benefits and strategic importance of a united North American continent, secretly drew up plans to annex Mexico in 1830. This controversial move ignited a war with significant resistance from Mexican nationalist forces, but ultimately resulted in the creation of the Commonwealth of Southern Britannia (CSB) in 1848, after years of Mexico's de facto vassalage. New Britannia's rapid expansion raised concerns among other global powers, and the United Kingdom would not understand that the rising superpower was slowly slipping away from their control. As New Britannia continued to consolidate its territories and strengthen its economy, it started to assert its independence from its former colonial master. This lead to the Great War - fought from 1875-1889. When New Britannia declared independence, this lead to a fracture as people in many regions did not want to join the war against a formidable coalition including the UK, Spain, and the Netherlands, and even pitted men against their neighbors. Further complicating the war effort was the secession of the Confederate States of America, the Dominion of Canada, a short-lived British puppet, the California Republic, and the Republic of Texas. During this time Chicago served as the de facto capital. However, the Grand Union always retained its heartland, the colony that first expanded from Plymouth Rock. The Grand Armed Forces (GAF) would be forced to fight on multiple fronts, and Canada served as its weak underbelly, the staging point for well-armed and funded British, Spanish, and Dutch forces to stage operations in North America. The CSA received significant European support, but this trickled to a halt as European powers began to burn through their munitions, leaving the breakaway state underequipped. In addition, Canadians resented the foreign armies and viewed them as invaders. By 1880, the situation became untenable. Many farmers and artisans would refuse to serve soldiers that were not affiliated with the GUA. These were called the Grangers. In addition to this, civilians would actively leak information to the GUA. Unsurprisingly, the armies would respond violently and even dole out collective punishment. Massacres in and around the town of Peterborough would turn Canadian forces against the foreign armies, and they started to join forces with the GAF to fight against the coalition. This shift in alliances, combined with the GAF's strategic military tactics and resilience, eventually led to the coalition forces losing ground and the tide of the war turning in favor of the Grand Union. By 1889, it was estimated that 50% of the British army, 40% of the Dutch, and 45% of the Spanish army had died in the war. Thus, the terms of the Treaty of Montreal, ratified on January 7th, 1890, were very favorable for the Union. Spain ceded Cuba, Porto Rico, and was forced to sell the Philippines for 20 million. The British ceded Jamaica, keep going","output":"Bermuda, British Guiana, and several other Caribbean islands, as well as recognizing the GUA's sovereignty over all of North America. The Netherlands was required to formally recognize the GUA's control over the Dutch West Indies and pay reparations. This marked a significant turning point in global power dynamics, establishing the Grand Union of America as a dominant force on the international stage. With peace restored, the Grand Union set out to consolidate and unify its diverse territories. The Confederacy was reincorporated into the Union, though not without lingering tensions and an extended period of reconstruction. The Dominion of Canada was dissolved, and its provinces became new Commonwealths of the GUA, bringing the Northern territories firmly into the fold. Similarly, the independent Republic of Texas and the California Republic were reintegrated, further solidifying the Union's control over the continent. As the 20th century dawned, the Grand Union of America focused on internal development and technological advancement. The new century brought about rapid industrialization and innovation, with the GUA leading the way in fields such as aviation, automotive engineering, and electricity. The economic growth was astounding, and the newly minted \\"American\\" identity began to coalesce across the continent, though regional cultures remained strong. Internationally, the Grand Union emerged as a key player in world affairs. Its vast resources, strategic positioning, and economic might made it an indispensable ally or adversary. The Grand Union's influence was felt across the globe, as it engaged in diplomacy, trade agreements, and occasionally military interventions when its interests were threatened. Socially and culturally, the GUA became a melting pot of different heritages and traditions. Pilgrims, Acadians, and various immigrant groups contributed to a rich tapestry of American society. Over time, the differences between these groups blurred, creating a cohesive national identity that celebrated both diversity and unity. Environmental stewardship also became a priority in the early 20th century, with the Grand Union implementing progressive conservationist policies to protect its vast wilderness areas. National parks and protected lands were established from the Everglades in the southeast to the great forests of the northwest, ensuring that the natural beauty of the continent would be preserved for future generations. The Grand Union of America's unparalleled growth also presented challenges, including the need for a robust legal system that could handle the complexities of a superstate. The federal government, with Philadelphia as its capital, established regulatory bodies to manage the economy, environmental concerns, and civil rights issues. Despite its impressive might, the GUA was not without internal strife, as debates over states' autonomy, federal power, and individual liberties often rose to the forefront of national discourse. In the face of a rapidly changing world, the Grand Union evolved to meet the needs of its people and assert its place as a leading global superpower. Its influence on politics, economy, and culture would spread far beyond its expansive borders, shaping the course of history in ways that few other nations could."},{"instruction":"Write a list of decades from the 1950s to the 2010s, and for each decade, 1 animated movie that was released in that decade, and for each movie, a hilarious plot summary of a fictious \\"Super-{DECADE}\\" version of the movie (e.g. \\"The Lion King: Super-1990s Edition\\", which is set in the decade in which the movie released and is filled with references to pop cultural things that were popular in that decade","output":"Here's a list of decades from the 1950s to the 2010s, along with an animated movie from each decade.

This way, we avoid passing the \`Mesh\` reference to the job and still achieve the desired parallel processing for the leaf transformations."},{"instruction":"Do you see anything else that could optimize performances? If yes, order them by impact.","output":"Certainly! Here are some additional optimizations that could be considered, ordered by potential impact: 1. **Burst Compiler Attributes**: Ensure that the Burst compiler is being used to its full potential. Adding \`[BurstCompile(FloatPrecision.Standard, FloatMode.Fast)]\` to your job struct can improve performance by allowing the compiler to make optimizations that favor speed over precision. 2. **Cache-Friendly Data Layout**: If possible, restructure your \`LeafData\` to be more cache-friendly. This might involve using \`float3\` and \`quaternion\` from the Unity Mathematics library instead of \`Vector3\` and \`Quaternion\`, as they are designed to work better with Burst and can be more cache-friendly. 3. **Reduce Allocator.TempJob Allocations**: Allocator.TempJob is fast but still has overhead. If you're generating leaves frequently, consider using \`NativeArray\` with \`Allocator.Persistent\` and reuse the arrays across frames, resizing as necessary. This avoids the cost of frequent allocations and deallocations. 4. **Parallel CombineMeshes**: The \`CombineMeshes\` call is currently on the main thread and can be a bottleneck. If Unity's API allows, try to find a way to parallelize this or at least reduce the frequency of calls by combining larger batches of meshes at once. 5. **Job Scheduling Strategy**: Adjust the \`batchCount\` parameter in the \`Schedule\` method to find the optimal value for your specific workload and hardware. The ideal batch size can vary depending on the number of cores and the complexity of the job. 6. **Memory Access Patterns**: Analyze and optimize the memory access patterns in your job. Ensure that you're reading and writing to memory in a way that minimizes cache misses. This might involve reordering operations or changing how you iterate over data. 7. **Frustum Culling**: Implement frustum culling to avoid processing leaves that are outside of the camera's view. This can significantly reduce the number of leaves that need to be processed. 8. **Level of Detail (LOD)**: Implement LOD for leaves. When leaves are far from the camera, use simpler meshes or even billboard sprites to represent them. This reduces the number of vertices and triangles that need to be processed. 9. **Asynchronous Mesh Combining**: If possible, perform mesh combining asynchronously to avoid stalling the main thread. This could be done using \`AsyncGPUReadback\` if the API allows, or by using a separate thread and carefully managing thread synchronization. 10. **Pooling**: If the number of leaves fluctuates, consider implementing a pooling system for the \`CombineInstance\` array to avoid frequent allocations and garbage collection. 11. **Garbage Collection Optimization**: Minimize garbage collection by avoiding unnecessary allocations in frequently called methods. Use \`NativeArray\` and other unmanaged memory structures judiciously to control memory lifecycle. 12. **Custom Mesh Generation**: Instead of using \`CombineMeshes\`, consider generating the mesh data manually in the job and then setting the mesh data directly. This could potentially be more efficient but requires careful management of vertex and index buffers. Remember that the impact of these optimizations can vary based on the specifics of your project, and it's important to profile your game to identify the actual bottlenecks before deciding which optimizations to implement. Always measure the performance impact of each change to ensure it's beneficial."},{"instruction":"Unity profiler shows that it is the CombineMeshes method that takes the longest. Can I do anything about that?","output":"If Unity Profiler indicates that \`CombineMeshes\` is the primary bottleneck, there are several strategies you can consider to mitigate this issue: 1. **Batching**: Instead of combining meshes every time a leaf is added, you can batch the process. Accumulate a certain number of leaves before calling \`CombineMeshes\`. This reduces the frequency of the expensive operation but may introduce a delay in visual updates. 2. **Asynchronous Combining**: If your game's architecture allows, you could move the combining process to a separate thread. Unity's main thread must remain free from race conditions and thread-unsafe operations, but you can prepare the data in a separate thread and then apply the combined mesh in the main thread. 3. **Incremental Combining**: Combine smaller subsets of leaves incrementally instead of all at once. This spreads the workload across multiple frames, which can help reduce frame spikes. 4. **LOD System**: Implement a Level of Detail (LOD) system for the leaves. By reducing the complexity of the leaf meshes at greater distances, you can decrease the number of vertices and triangles that need to be combined. 5. **Static Batching**: If the leaves do not move frequently, consider using static batching. This is a built-in Unity feature that combines static objects into fewer mesh instances at build time, reducing runtime overhead. 6. **GPU Instancing**: If the leaves share the same material, you can take advantage of GPU instancing. This technique renders multiple copies of the same mesh in a single draw call, which can be more efficient than combining meshes into a single mesh. 7. **Custom Mesh Generation**: As a more advanced technique, you can manually generate a single mesh from all the leaves. This involves creating a custom mesh by manually combining vertex and index buffers. This gives you full control over the process and can be optimized for your specific use case. 8. **Frustum Culling**: Implement frustum culling to avoid processing and combining meshes for leaves that are not visible to the camera. 9. **Object Pooling**: Use object pooling for the \`CombineInstance\` array to avoid the overhead of allocating and deallocating the array each time you combine meshes. 10. **Optimize Mesh Data**: Simplify the leaf mesh if possible. Fewer vertices and simpler materials can make the combining process faster. 11. **Use Mesh.CombineMeshes with mergeSubMeshes**: If you have multiple sub-meshes and materials, consider using the \`mergeSubMeshes\` option to combine all sub-meshes into a single sub-mesh, reducing the number of draw calls. 12. **Mesh Compression**: Use mesh compression to reduce the size of the mesh data, which can sometimes speed up the combining process. It's important to profile each of these changes to ensure they have a positive impact on performance. Some of these strategies may introduce new complexities or trade-offs that need to be carefully considered."},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Они используются для символического представления концепций и эмоций, что делает их легко узнаваемыми и запоминающимися для зрителей. В контексте мотивационного видео визуальные метафоры могут буквально воплощать борьбу, целеустремленность, рост или триумф. Примеры визуальных метафор для мотивационного видео могут включать: 1. **Преодоление препятствий:** прыжок через барьеры на трассе бега с препятствиями может символизировать преодоление жизненных сложностей. 2. **Путь к успеху:** изображение дороги или лестницы, ведущей к горизонту или к вершине, может отображать путь к достижению целей. 3. **Перемены и рост:** распускающийся цветок или дерево, меняющее сезонные убранства, могут символизировать рост, изменения и развитие. 4. **Яркий свет:** включение моментов с рассветом или лучами солнца, прорезающими тьму, может отражать новые начинания и прозрение. 5. **Переворот:** зажженная лампочка или молния могут символизировать идею или озарение, момент, когда всё становится на свои места. 6. **Рукопожатие или объятие:** часто обозначает удачу в делах, дружбу, партнерство или поддержку. 7. **Баланс:** изображение человека, стоящего на одной ноге или балансирующего предметы на руке, может олицетворять баланс в работе и личной жизни. Ключ к эффективному использованию визуальных метафор заключается в том, чтобы они были последовательными с сообщением и общим настроением видео. Они должны быть интуитивно понятны и в то же время несли в себе достаточно глубины, чтобы зритель мог установить личную связь с представленными образами.

Their decline began in the first century AD, following the annexation of their capital, Petra, by the Roman Empire in 106 AD. As trade routes shifted and the importance of their overland monopolies diminished, the Nabateans lost their economic power. They were further impacted by the changing political landscape and the spread of Christianity. By the time of the Islamic conquest in the 7th century AD, the Nabatean culture had largely assimilated with surrounding populations and their distinct identity vanished over time."},{"instruction":"What is the ideal environmental, temperate, and atmospheric conditions for carbon-based lifeforms?","output":"Carbon-based lifeforms, especially as we know them on Earth, thrive in a range of environmental conditions but generally require certain temperate and atmospheric characteristics for optimal survival. Ideally: - **Temperature**: Most Earth-based carbon lifeforms prefer a moderate temperature range of about 0-40°C (32-104°F), which allows for liquid water, a crucial component for life. - **Atmosphere**: An atmosphere that contains oxygen is essential for aerobic organisms, while some lifeforms may also thrive in environments rich in carbon dioxide or methane. Atmospheric pressure that allows for the stability of liquid water, typically close to Earth's average at sea level (101.325 kPa), is also important. - **Water**: An ample supply of water in liquid form is a key solvent and medium for biochemical reactions. - **Stable Environment**: For more complex organisms, a stable environment without extreme fluctuations in conditions is necessary to sustain life cycles. - **Energy Sources**: A consistent source of energy, such as sunlight or chemical energy (for example, from hydrothermal vents), is vital for the sustenance of life. Due to the vast diversity of lifeforms and extremophiles that can exist in conditions that are harsh for humans and other complex life (like in high radiation, extreme cold or heat, high salinity, etc.), this description is not exhaustive but rather indicative of where the majority of known carbon-based life thrives."},{"instruction":"قصات شعر طويل 2022","output":"من المتوقع أن تكون هناك العديد من القصات الشعر الطويل الجميلة والمتنوعة في عام 2022. إليك بعض الأفكار الممكنة: 1. قصة الشعر المستقيم الطويل: يعتبر الشعر المستقيم الطويل دائمًا أنيقًا وعصريًا. يمكنك تنسيقه بشكل مستقيم كامل أو إضافة بعض الأطراف المموجة لإضافة بعض الحجم. 2. قصة شعر طويل متناغم: تعتبر هذه القصة مناسبة للأشخاص الذين يحبون تنسيق شعرهم بأسلوب بسيط وناعم. يتميز بالطول والتدرجات الناعمة في الأطوال. 3. شعر طويل مع الطبقات: تعتبر الطبقات مناسبة للأشخاص الذين يرغبون في إضافة بعض الحجم والحركة إلى شعرهم الطويل. يمكن إضافة الطبقات في جميع الأطوال أو فقط في الأطراف. 4. شعر طويل مموج: إذا كان لديك شعر طويل وتحب الأمواج الطبيعية، يمكنك تجربة هذه القصة. يمكن اعتماد أسلوب الأمواج الطبيعية في جميع الأطوال أو فقط في الأطراف. 5. شعر طويل مع البنج: يعتبر البنج طريقة جميلة لتحقيق تغيير بسيط في الشكل العام للشعر الطويل. يمكن استخدام البنج لإطار الوجه أو جعله طفيفًا في جميع الأطوال. لا تنسي أن تختار القصة التي تناسب شكل وجهك وقوام شعرك وأهم شيء هو أن تكون مرتاحة وسعيدة بها."},{"instruction":"تسريحات شعر للمناسبات ناعمة","output":"إليك بعض الأفكار لتسريحات الشعر الناعمة المناسبة للمناسبات: 1. تسريحة اللفة الجانبية: قم بتجهيز الشعر وتجعيده قليلاً، ثم قم بملفه على جانب الرأس وأمسكيه بمشبك جميل. هذه التسريحة تعطي مظهرًا أنيقًا ورومانسيًا. 2. تسريحة الضفيرة الجانبية: قم بنزع شعر جهة واحدة إلى الجانب وانسلخيه ثم قم بعمل ضفيرة فرنسية على طول الشعر. أمسكي الضفيرة بمشبك أو مطاط وقومي بتثبيتها بشكل لطيف. 3. تسريحة الكعكة العالية: قم بتجميع الشعر في كعكة عالية على قمة الرأس. يمكن إضافة بعض الأطراف المتناثرة لإضفاء مظهر ناعم ورقيق. 4. تسريحة الشعر المموج المنسدل: قم بإضافة بعض الأمواج الطبيعية إلى شعرك المفرود المنسدل. يمكن استخدام مكواة الشعر أو أداة تجعيد للحصول على الأمواج المناسبة. 5. تسريحة الزهرة الجميلة: قم بتجهيز شعرك بتسريحة كعكة على قمة الرأس ومن ثم قم بإضافة زهرة جميلة حسب الرغبة في المنتصف. يمكن استخدام زهرة طبيعية أو زهرة اصطناعية. تذكري أن تستخدمي منتجات تصفيف الشعر ومثبت الشعر لضمان ثبات التسريحة طوال اليوم. كما يمكنك استشارة خبيرٍ في صالون تصفيف الشعر لمساعدتك في تحقيق التسريحة المناسبة لشكل وجهك ونوع شعرك."},{"instruction":"تسريحات شعر بسيطة للمناسبات","output":"إليك بعض الأفكار لتسريحات الشعر البسيطة والجميلة للمناسبات: 1. تسريحة الضفيرة الجانبية المنخفضة: قم بنزع شعر جهة واحدة إلى الجانب وانسلخيه ثم قم بعمل ضفيرة بسيطة ومنخفضة. ثبتي الضفيرة بمشبك جميل أو بعض الزهور الطبيعية. 2. تسريحة الكعكة البسيطة: قم بتجميع الشعر في كعكة منخفضة عند قمة الرأس. قم بتلف الشعر حول نفسه وثبته بمشبك. يمكن إضافة بعض الفروع الناعمة أو الزهور لزيادة الجمال. 3. تسريحة الضفيرة الجانبية المنسدلة: قم بعمل ضفيرة فرنسية بسيطة على جهة واحدة من الرأس ثم اتركي الضفيرة تنسدل بشكل طبيعي على الكتف. هذه التسريحة تعطي مظهرًا أنيقًا ورومانسيًا. 4. تسريحة الشعر الملتوي: قم بأخذ قسم من الشعر وثنيها نحو الداخل وثبتها بمشبك. قم بتكرار هذا الطراز لبعض الأجزاء الأخرى من الشعر. تترك الشعر تنساب بشكل طبيعي على الكتفين. 5. تسريحة الزهرة البسيطة: قم بتجميع الشعر في كعكة بسيطة على قمة الرأس ومن ثم قم بإضافة زهرة بسيطة أو زهرة صغيرة حسب الرغبة في المنتصف. استخدمي مثبت الشعر ومشابك الشعر للمساعدة في تثبيت التسريحة وتأكدي من راحتك وثقتك بها."},{"instruction":"قصات شعر طويل رجال","output":"هنا بعض الأفكار لقصات الشعر الطويل للرجال: 1. قصة الشعر المسترخية: يمكنك ترك الشعر الطويل ينسدل بحرية على الأكتاف بطريقة مسترخية وعفوية. يمكن إضافة بعض الطبقات لإضفاء حجم وحركة إلى الشعر. 2. قصة الشعر المنسدل بنصف الذيل: قم بربط الشعر في ذيل الحصان منتصف الرأس. سيعطي هذا الشكل مظهرًا أنيقًا ورجوليًا للشعر الطويل. 3. قصة الشعر المجعد: إذا كنت تملك شعر مجعدًا، فيمكنك تركه ينمو بحرية ويظهر تجعيده الطبيعي. يمكن استخدام منتجات تعزيز التجعيد لإبراز التجعيد بشكل أفضل. 4. قصة الشعر المضفور: يمكنك تجعيد الشعر الطويل وعمل ضفائر أو تجعيده في شكل المضفر المناسب لك. يعطي هذا الشكل مظهرًا فريدًا وجميلًا. 5. قصة الشعر المنسدل بأكمله: إذا كان شعرك طويلًا جدًا وترغب في مظهر بسيط ومرتب، يمكنك ترك الشعر ينسدل بطريقة متساوية على كلا الجانبين والظهر. لا تنسى أن تهتم بصحة شعرك من خلال العناية اليومية وقص الأطراف بانتظام للحفاظ على طوله ومظهره الصحي. كما يمكن استشارة مصفف الشعر للمساعدة في اختيار القصة المناسبة لشكل وملمس ونوع شعرك."},{"instruction":"Используя знания из школьного курса биологии и содержание текста и «Молекулярно-генетические методы при расследовании преступлений», ответьте на следующие вопросы. 1.

Молекулярно-генетические методы при расследовании преступлений Текст В современной криминалистике для доказательства вины подозреваемых часто используются молекулярно-генетические методы. Как известно, человек — диплоидный организм, имеющий по два аллеля каждого гена, один из которых пришел от отца, второй — от матери. С помощью полимеразной цепной реакции (ПЦР) можно получить ДНК-копию аллелей конкретного человека. При этом используются такие гены, по которым полиморфизм (различия аллелей между организмами) достаточно высок. Если аллели, обнаруженные в ДНК подозреваемого, совпадают с аллелями, полученными из ДНК, обнаруженной на месте преступления, можно сделать вывод о том, что подозреваемый бывал на месте преступления. К примеру, после кражи в доме жертвы обнаружили волосы, жертве не принадлежащие (из волос можно выделить ДНК, если они выпали вместе с корнем). Волосы светлые, а жертва имеет темные волосы. Среди знакомых жертвы есть светловолосый подозреваемый, который отрицает свое знакомство с жертвой. В случае совпадения набора аллелей, полученных из его ДНК и из ДНК корней волос, обнаруженных на месте преступления, можно уличить его во лжи. Такие доказательства являются косвенными и никогда не используются сами по себе, без дополнительных фактов, но могут существенно помочь следствию.","output":"1.

В первые годы войны советское правительство было вынуждено эвакуировать индустриальные предприятия, организовать партизанское движение и вести сопротивление немецким оккупантам, что позволило отразить наступление противника и начать контрнаступление. Основными годами этого периода являются 1941 и 1942 годы. В эти годы советские войска понесли значительные потери, но они сумели остановить наступление немцев под Москвой и в Туле, что стало поворотным моментом в ходе войны. Важными результатами этого периода были: - Проведение оборонительных сражений и отражение наступлений немецко-фашистской армии. - Формирование партизанского движения на оккупированных территориях, которое активно препятствовало деятельности немецких войск. - Проведение контрнаступлений советскими войсками, что позволило освободить ряд территорий и отбить значительное количество населения из-под оккупации.

Россия в условиях внешней экспансии XIII-XIV вв.: - Монгольское завоевание (1223-1480 гг.): Монгольская Орда под предводительством Чингисхана завоевала Русь, устанавлив процесс монгольского иго, которое продолжалось около 240 лет. Это привело к разрушению государственности и экономики Руси, а также к социальным изменениям и культурным перемещениям. - Экспансия крестоносцев на северо-запад Руси (ну приблизительно это 1240-1283 гг.): Тевтонский орден, а также другие крестоносцы, в том числе рыцари Рижского ордена, проводили походы на территории современной северной Руси с целью христианизации и подчинения этой области. Это привело к конфронтации и культурному влиянию между западными и восточными православными традициями. - Ордынское иго (1240-1480 гг.): Это было монгольское господство над Русью, которое продолжалось приглушенно. Русская знать подчинялась Монгольской Орде, содержащейся в трех ординарных государствах (Золотой Орде, Сибирская Орда, Крымский Ханат).

An elderly man lies in bed, looking frail but relieved at the sight of the doctor.] Narrator: “First, a call for old Mr. Thompson, his heart not quite the drum it used to be.

And offer, he does.\\" [We see a montage of Dr. Harris attentively checking vitals, administering medication, and offering comforting words to a worried spouse.] Scene 2: The Sick Baby [As the night deepens, we're taken to another home. A distraught mother hands her sick baby to Dr. Harris with hope in her tearful eyes.] Narrator: “An infant’s cry pierces the silent night. An urgent plea for help. For Dr. Harris, this is more than a job; it is a calling.” [Dr. Harris is seen deftly examining the baby, his face a mask of concentration. After some careful attention, the baby’s cries subside, much to the mother’s relief.] Scene 3: The Not So Ill Patient [Next morning, Dr. Harris, running on fumes of sleeplessness, sits in his office across from a cantankerous patient, Mr. Johnson, who is none too pleased with his wait time.] Mr. Johnson (gruffly): “You call this service?

Just as he raises his voice, his mobile phone rings.] Scene 4: The Call That Changes Everything [Mr. Johnson’s face turns from red anger to ashen shock as he listens to the voice on the other line.] Narrator: “Life's ironies have a stark way of unveiling our shared humanity. Mr. Johnson’s anger quelled by the tide of urgent news.” Mr. Johnson (stammering): “I-It’s my dad... The old man’s in ICU now...” [He pauses, trying to process more information.] Mr. Johnson: “And my son, my little boy, taken into hospital too.

Yet, they're unwavering in their duty.” Closing Scene: [Images of different NHS staff members fill the screen: doctors, nurses, paramedics, all providing invaluable service.] Narrator: “Respecting those who dedicate their lives to healing is the cornerstone of our shared humanity.

It's not just a nuisance.

The illegal transmitter is shut down. The city’s communication instantly clears up.] Narrator: \\"The law steps in, the signal clears, and the city breathes a sigh of relief.

Instead of Cruella de Vil, Shere Khan in a fur coat obsessively aims to turn the spotted crew into a tiger-striped rug. Baloo, disguised as a spotted bear-cub, belly dances his way through a rescue mission while Mowgli, navigating the 'urban jungle', must herd the 101 mischievous monkeys (not quite Dalmatians) through the streets of London, avoiding Kaa’s hypnotic attempts to sell them as exotic pets. 1970s: 1. \\"Robin Hood\\" (1973) 2. \\"The Rescuers\\" (1977) \\"Robin Hood, by The Rescuers\\": Bernard and Bianca don the feathered hats and tunics of Sherwood Forest's most infamous outlaw and his band. The two tiny mice attempt their best archery with toothpicks, liberating cheese from Prince John, the now oversized greedy rat who has taxed the pantry into poverty. Orville, the albatross, hilariously tries to fill in for Little John, continuously squashing the Merry Mice with his clumsy landings, while Madame Medusa plays a less-than-convincing Maid Marian, more interested in swiping Robin’s riches than in his romance. 1980s: 1. \\"The Little Mermaid\\" (1989) 2. \\"Oliver & Company\\" (1988) \\"The Little Mermaid, by Oliver & Company\\": Dodger, the cool streetwise canine, flaps his ears and attempts to swim undersea, trying to win the heart of a feisty feline Ariel who exchanges her meow for a song. Tito, the tiny chihuahua, fills in for Sebastian the crab, directing a chorus of alley cats in a screechy rendition of \\"Under the Sea,\\" while Georgette, the poodle, takes on Ursula's role, using her hairbrush as a wand in a bid to become the most glamorous villainess in the city. 1990s: 1. \\"The Lion King\\" (1994) 2. \\"Mulan\\" (1998) \\"The Lion King, by Mulan and Friends\\": Mulan, assigned the role of Simba, attempts to embody the majestic mane with her trusty dragon sidekick, Mushu, as a pint-sized Timon, constantly setting things on fire instead of solving problems. Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po as Pumbaa experience an identity crisis in a wilderbeest stampede, creating a hilarious, bumbling ballet of confusion. Meanwhile, Shan Yu inexplicably wanders into the movie as Scar, insisting on a villainous battle with a very confused Great Stone Dragon standing in for Pride Rock. 2000s: 1. \\"Finding Nemo\\" (2003) 2. \\"The Incredibles\\" (2004) \\"Finding Nemo, by The Incredibles\\": Mr. Incredible, struggling to fit into the tiny clownfish anemone, embarks on a less-than-stealthy mission to locate young Nemo, stretching the definition of \\"blending in\\" to its limit. While Elasticgirl, as Dory, has no trouble with short-term memory loss, her contortions to communicate with whale-sized whispers cause more mayhem than assistance. Dash's high-speed attempts to portray a laid-back Crush result in a dizzying East Australian Current, while Violet projects an invisible force field around the \\"jellyfish forest,\\" rendering them disappointingly anticlimactic. 2010s: 1. \\"Frozen\\" (2013) 2. \\"Zootopia\\" (2016) \\"Frozen, by Zootopia's Finest\\": Officer Judy Hopps slips into Elsa's frosty shoes, zealously enforcing a \\"Let It Grow\\" policy rather than \\"Let It Go,\\" accidentally turning anything and everyone in her path into carrot-flavored popsicles. Meanwhile, Nick Wilde, as Anna, employs his sly fox skills to sell knockoff ice scrapers and snow boots to every resident of Arendelle. Clawhauser giggles his way into Olaf’s role, but his love for warm hugs causes a city-wide melt, while Chief Bogo, impersonating Kristoff, grumbles about the absurdity of talking reindeer as he pulls his own sled."},{"instruction":"Quels sont les meilleur application pour écrire les mathématique sur iPad si on a une dysgraphie avec Pencil ou pas","output":"Pour les personnes ayant une dysgraphie, qui est une difficulté à écrire manuellement, en particulier liée à la calligraphie et à la coordination, l'utilisation d'un iPad avec un Apple Pencil peut être d'une grande aide pour rédiger des mathématiques.

It is a rocky world some 14500 kilometres in diameters [114% the size of the Earth] with a density some 12% greater than that of the Earth, giving it a mass of some 165% that of the Earth and a surface gravity of some 1.27 times that of the Earth. As for its co-planets of Pgduo and Upopeb, Gu-Pu-Kra orbits Rp'Gu at a distance of some 8.25 million kilometres [0.055 AU; some one seventh of the distance at which Mercury orbits the Sun], taking slightly less than seven Earth days to do so. Due to the small radius of its orbit, from the surface of Gu-Pu-Kra, Rp'Gu appears to be some 7.7° in diameter [some 15 times larger than the Sun does from Earth, covering 225 times the area in the sky]. However, because of the much lower luminosity of Rp'Gu compared to the Sun, it is also much dimmer. From Gu-Pu-Kra both Pgduo and Upopeb subtend an angle of roughly 2 arc minutes. This means that human vision [with an angular resolution of some 1 arc minute] would be just able to resolve them as discs. From Pgduo and Upopeb, Gu-Pu-Kra appears to be some 0.1° is width [roughly 20% the size of the Moon in the skies of Earth], easily resolvable as a disc to a human-like eye. As for Pgduo and Upopeb, Gu-Pu-Kra is tidally locked to Rp'Gu, and as such rotates on its axis in a period equal to its orbital period of slightly less than seven Earth days long, so that one face of Gu-Pu-Kra always faces Rp'Gu and so is in permanent daylight while the other is permanent night. It has an axial tilt of some 9° [the Moon, which is also tidally locked, has an axial tilt of some 6.7° to the plane of its orbit]. Gu-Pu-Kra has a highly circular orbit around Rp'Gu due its being circularised by tidal forces within a relatively short time (geologically speaking) of its formation. Because of the dynamics of their orbits in the Trojan points of Gu-Pu-Kra, and their smaller masses, the worlds of Pgduo and Upopeb oscillate far more in position and so suffer far larger tidal forces, which in turn drives their extensive volcanism. Even so, its orbit close to Rp'Gu and the presence of the co-planets Pgduo and Upopeb mean that Gu-Pu-Kra experiences tidal forces significantly more powerful than those felt by the Earth and is perhaps ten times more geologically active than it, with major volcanic eruptions and so on being consequently more frequent. Thus supervolcanoes, earthquakes and so on are a significantly greater driver of Gu-Pu-Kraian evolution than is the case on Earth. Another effect of this is that the core of Gu-Pu-Kra is rather hotter than that of the Earth and the crust rather thinner. This means that the surface of Gu-Pu-Kra is divided into roughly ten times as many tectonic plates as is the case for the Earth, which of course are, on average, smaller than those of the Earth. These tectonic plates also move considerably faster than those of the Earth [anything up a metre a year, compared to less than 10 centimetres a year on Earth]. As a result of this, there are roughly ten times are many mountain ranges on Gu-Pu-Kra as on the earth, many of which are relatively young and thus relatively high and steep, and correspondingly many subduction zones where the crust of Gu-Pu-Kra returns to the interior of the planet in deep oceanic trenches, so that the surface of Gu-Pu-Kra also has quite a lot of small lakes, island chains and so on. This also means that there are fewer old and stable parts of the crust (cratons), and what there are of these tend to be small. This would hinder any investigation into the geological history of Gu-Pu-Kra. A side effect of the tidally stirred molten core of Gu-Pu-Kra is that, despite its slow rotation relative to (for example) the Earth, the strength of its magnetic field is some two and a half times greater than that of the Earth [roughly 0.8 gauss as opposed to 0.3 gauss for the Earth], and highly aligned with Gu-Pu-Kra's axis of rotation. This, together with its proximity to Rp'Gu and so the higher density of the solar wind from it compared to that Earth receives from the Sun, means that Gu-Pu-Kra has frequent and very bright aurorae). Some 76% of the surface of Gu-Pu-Kra is covered with water [as compared to 71% for the Earth]. Even taking this into account, the relatively larger size of Gu-Pu-Kra compared to the Earth means that the land area of Gu-Pu-Kra is some 107% that of the Earth. A contour map of Gu-Pu-Kra shows how this land is arranged on the planet. The atmosphere of Gu-Pu-Kra is some 2.2 times thicker than that of the Earth. This high atmospheric pressure means that the boiling point of water on the surface of Gu-Pu-Kra is 123°C. In composition the atmosphere is mostly made up of nitrogen gas and contains no free oxygen so that it would be un-breathable to an unprotected human being. It also contains a large fraction of carbon dioxide, water vapour and volcanic gases, in particular sulphur and nitrogen compounds. The atmosphere of Gu-Pu-Kra generates a high level of natural greenhouse effect, some 160% that of the Earth, which raises the temperature of the planet to some 15.4°C [288.5K] sufficiently for water-based life to be possible there. The lack of ultraviolet radiation produced by Rp'Gu means that Gu-Pu-Kra does not have, or need, an ozone layer. The composition of the atmosphere of Gu-Pu-Kra is, like that of the Earth, very different to what it would be without the presence of life. That is, it is in a state that is largely governed and maintained by the life it sustains. Although its composition is very unlike that of the Earth, particularly in its lack of free oxygen, its composition would still indicate that processes beyond those of a lifeless world are taking place there, even without any other clues that might be present [such as a technological civilisation!]. The chemistry of Gu-Pu-Kra and its ecosystem means that all water there (and so all rain) is somewhat acidic, mainly due to the presence of nitrogen compounds that make it into weak nitric acid [not unlike acid rain on Earth], though with a smaller amount of sulphuric acid mixed in from atmospheric sulphur compounds. It also contains significant quantities of dissolved nitrates, to the point that, were it to exist on Earth it would be classified as suffering serious nitrate pollution. Neither of these factors are, however, a problem for the life forms of Gu-Pu-Kra as they have evolved to live in such an environment. The long history of life and active geology of Gu-Pu-Kra means that there are plentiful oil and gas deposits on Gu-Pu-Kra. The more active geology of Gu-Pu-Kra compared to the Earth means that there are more of these than on Earth, and also that they replenish faster (though still over geological time!). Of course, oil does not burn on Gu-Pu-Kra but it still has many uses in industry despite this. The higher gravity of Gu-Pu-Kra means that its atmospheric pressure drops proportionally faster with height than is the case for the Earth [that is, its scale height is 1.27 times lower than that of the Earth], so that the edge of space is only 83.5 kilometres above the surface of Gu-Pu-Kra [rather than 100 kilometres above the surface of the Earth], despite the level at which the pressure of Gu-Pu-Kra's atmosphere is equal to that of the Earth at sea level being roughly 4700m [15400 feet] above the surface of the planet. Because of the tidal locking of Gu-Pu-Kra to Rp'Gu, somewhat less than half of the land surface of Gu-Pu-Kra lies on the far side of the planet to Rp'Gu, and so never sees direct sunlight, although most of it is not entirely dark. This side of the planet becomes progressively colder away from the terminator between the day and night sides of Gu-Pu-Kra. Because of its thicker atmosphere and larger mass of water on Gu-Pu-Kra, which helps to hold and distribute heat more effectively than is possible on the airless surfaces of Pgduo and Upopeb, the mean temperature of Gu-Pu-Kra is some -40°C. However, because of its tidal locking to Rp'Gu the point on its surface where Rp'Gu is at the zenith reaches some 106°C - which is not enough for the ocean there to boil - while the centre of the night side opposite this point drops to some -100°C, which is enough for the surface of the ocean there to be frozen. All of this means that Gu-Pu-Kra is far warmer than its co-planets. In addition to this the temperature of Gu-Pu-Kra can drop significantly during those infrequent times when starspots reduce the luminosity of Rp'Gu by up to 30% for periods of up to Earth months. However, these temperature drops do not cool the planet to the point that the surface of the dayside ocean can begin to freeze [due to the thick atmosphere, high greenhouse effect, large reservoir of heat within the ocean and the active volcanism of Gu-Pu-Kra]. Because of its tidal locking to Rp'Gu, low axial tilt and short orbital period there are no seasons as such on Gu-Pu-Kra. Instead, temperature and weather on its surface are determined by distance from the point directly below Rp'Gu more than by any other factor. The intense solar heating at the point closest to Rp'Gu heats the air at that point and drives the evaporation of water from the surface of the ocean there. This leads to vast updrafts which form a constant rising column of air which in turn pulls in cooler air from the surface around it. This process drives a vast hurricane centred under the zenith point and extending some 45° out from it so that it covers some 14.6% of the surface of the planet (29.2% of the sunward face). [Note that this hurricane depends on being over an ocean for its existence; as such there may have been periods in the past of Gu-Pu-Kra when the motion of its tectonic plates moved a continent under the zenith point, dissipating the world-hurricane for the duration of its presence.] On the opposite side of Gu-Pu-Kra, in the centre of the night side, a vast downdraft matches the updraft on the day side. This is not associated with a permanent storm, however. In between these two extremes the atmosphere is divided into a series of spherical segments, all centred on the zenith point. Unlike the equivalent circulation on Earth, which runs parallel to the equator, on Gu-Pu-Kra it circulates around the zenith point and so is aligned with the terminator. One difference that humans might well notice about Gu-Pu-Kra is that in most places shadows there are much shorter than they are on Earth. This is because Rp'Gu is so much larger in the sky than the Sun is on Earth. The Sun is some 0.5° wide in the sky; when it is just above the horizon this width means that a shadow cast by it will converge to nothing in a distance of some 115m, which is quite a long distance. Rp'Gu, on the other hand, is some 7.7° wide - some fifteen times larger - and because of this shadows under the same circumstances are less than 7.5m long, and much more obviously converge over that distance. THE ENVIRONMENTS OF GU-PU-KRA The surface of Gu-Pu-Kra is divided into five regions, radiating out in concentric spherical segments from the hottest point directly under Rp'Gu. These consist of: Du-Bepdh. The core of the world-hurricane. This is region where the hurricane is fiercest, driven by water temperatures approaching the boiling point of water on Gu-Pu-Kra. There is no land in this region of Gu-Pu-Kra, and no macroscopic airborne life can survive the winds there. There is extensive microscopic life in the water, all of it what on Earth would be considered hyperthermophillic to survive the high temperatures there, and also a great deal of aeroplankton. This region extends out some 45° from the point closest to Rp'Gu and so covers some 14.6% of the surface of Gu-Pu-Kra. Duo-Uap. The periphery of the world-hurricane. These are regions where the world-hurricane is still very fierce - too much so for civilisation at a 2011 level of technology to survive - but temperatures are sufficiently moderate for life to exist in greater abundance and variety than in the centre of the hurricane. Most of this region is water, although there are a few small groups of islands towards the western periphery. Winds in this region are a combination of those generated by the world-hurricane and those of the rest of the atmosphere. Upgbpr-Wtdu. The hospitable lit regions sunwards of the terminator between the day and night sides of Gu-Pu-Kra. These are the regions outside the world-hurricane which are in daylight. They are the most hospitable regions of Gu-Pu-Kra with moderate weather and temperatures, and thus are home to the greatest density and diversity of life. All of the significant dayside land masses of Gu-Pu-Kra lie within this region. Winds here are largely dominated by the air flow from the night to the day side of Gu-Pu-Kra. However, even though it is the most hospitable region on Gu-Pu-Kra this region is still wracked by frequent major storms spun off by the world-hurricane and its sunward coasts are frequently battered by what, on Earth, would be considered to be freak waves, though on Gu-Pu-Kra they almost normal. Ueb-Bgt. The terminator. The region where Rp'Gu sits roughly on or is partly hidden by the horizon, and where libration effects cause 'wobbles' in the rotation of Gu-Pu-Kra of some plus or minus 2°. These mean there is a cycle of varying daylight intensity some seven Earth days long. In most of this region this variation is due to varying fractions of Rp'Gu being above the horizon at different times; only at the extreme night side edge of this region does Rp'Gu actually set, giving periods of true night. This region is the second most hospitable on Gu-Pu-Kra, and so has diverse and plentiful life. Because of the large size of Rp'Gu in the sky of Gu-Pu-Kra, and atmospheric refraction bending the light of Rp'Gu into the nominal night side, this region is some 7.7° deep [the same as the width of Rp'Gu in the sky] but offset by 1.4° or so towards the night side, so that it covers some 6.7% of the surface of the planet, with daylight - as in any part of Rp'Gu being visible above the horizon - extending up to some 5.2° into the nominal night side. Ugodugg. The twilight zone. These are the regions of Gu-Pu-Kra where Rp'Gu itself is never visible, but which are illuminated to differing degrees by the scattering of its light from the atmosphere of Gu-Pu-Kra so that it is in permanent twilight. Because of the thick atmosphere of Gu-Pu-Kra this region extends some 44° into the nominal dark side from the edge of the Ueb-Bgt region, becoming progressively darker and colder the further into the night side one travels. This means that roughly 76% of the nominal night side [and so roughly 88% of the total surface of Gu-Pu-Kra] actually sees at least some daylight, even if only at low levels. The level of light in Ugodugg allows photosynthesis to occur to some extent in the parts of it close to the terminator, but in most of Ugodugg light levels are too low for this to be effective. Despite its lack of light the twilight zone still has abundant life, in particular around the many active volcanic regions that dot its surface. Many of these obtain energy from chemosynthesis of the chemicals emitted by them. Others gain energy from the temperature differences between the heat of the volcanic regions and the cold of the general dark side environment via a process of thermosynthesis, or from a mixture of this and chemosynthesis. O-Ugrpdwt. The dark zone. These are the parts of Gu-Pu-Kra that never see any daylight; because of light being bent and scattered by the atmosphere of Gu-Pu-Kra this region actually begins some 49° into the nominal night side and so covers only some 12% of the surface of Gu-Pu-Kra. Always dark, these regions become progressively colder the further from the terminator one goes. In the centre of the night side is a region of huge downdrafts where cold air falls from the high atmosphere back to surface and begins to re-circulate back to the day side. Like the twilight zone, the dark zone still has abundant life [at least compared to the arctic regions of the Earth] powered by chemo- and/or thermosynthesis and adapted to the deep cold and dark there. THE SKY OF GU-PU-KRA The atmosphere of Gu-Pu-Kra has some 220% of the thickness of that of the Earth, and in addition to this contains far more dust than that of Earth, due to both the thickness of the air allowing dust to float for longer and the greater volcanic activity of Gu-Pu-Kra compared to that of the Earth. As such it scatters light [the effect that makes the sky blue on Earth] more than the Earths atmosphere does. However, the lack of blue light from Rp'Gu means that the sky of Gu-Pu-Kra is not blue. Instead it is a whitish-pink in colour, shading to brighter and redder around Rp'Gu [that is, sunset colours] and darker away from it. In those regions of Gu-Pu-Kra where Rp'Gu hangs near the horizon there is a permanent, vast and intense red sunset, which is only enhanced by the area of Rp'Gu in the sky being some 225 times greater than that of the Sun on Earth, with, in the opposite direction, a sky that fades to a pinkish-black in colour. In addition to this, the thick atmosphere of Gu-Pu-Kra leads to greatly increased atmospheric refraction [bending] of the light of Rp'Gu compared to the light of the Sun on Earth. On Earth, atmospheric refraction means than when sunset actually occurs the Sun is physically more than one diameter below the horizon. Likewise, atmospheric refraction causes the zone of twilight that extends to the point where the Sun is physically some 18° below the horizon. Because of its thick atmosphere, refraction by it on Gu-Pu-Kra is some 245% as strong as that on Earth so that the twilight zone extends some 44° into the nominal dark side of Gu-Pu-Kra. THE LIFE FORMS OF GU-PU-KRA As far as can be ascertained, life on Gu-Pu-Kra originated in much the way as it is speculated that it did on Earth, around oceanic hydrothermal vents. As these were (and remain) more common on Gu-Pu-Kra than on Earth, life evolved somewhat sooner and in more locations than it did on Earth, so that it began, and remains, somewhat more diverse than Earthly life. Within the first 1.2 billion Earth years of its life Rp'Gu was subject to violent flares. The ultraviolet radiation emitted by these helped to drive the early evolution of life on Gu-Pu-Kra to the point that when the flares died down as Rp'Gu matured, life was sufficiently diverse for evolution to progress without it, driven only by the many other environmental pressures existing on the planet. [Note that the Earth as a whole was an anaerobic environment for at least the first 3.65 billion years of its existence, before photosynthetic organisms changed the atmosphere into its present aerobic form.] Like life on Earth, life on Gu-Pu-Kra began as anaerobic, surviving without oxygen, and like it lived in an environment where there was plentiful light energy. This drove the evolution of the process of photosynthesis among the Gu-Pu-Kraian equivalent of plants. However, the photons emitted by Rp'Gu are, on average, of a much lower energy than those of the Sun. As such, when photosynthesis evolved on Gu-Pu-Kra it developed in a different way to that on Earth. The most significant difference between it and photosynthesising life on Earth is that photosynthesis on Gu-Pu-Kra did not generate oxygen [as is the case with some photosynthetic bacteria on Earth]. This has meant that since then, although more complex and advanced life has developed, it has remained anaerobic, using chemicals other than oxygen to allow it to release energy. Because there are no seasons on Gu-Pu-Kra, plant and animal reproduction tends to occur at a roughly constant level over time, with no synchronisation to any environmental cues, so that there are no mating seasons and so on. Because of the permanent darkness on the dark side of Gu-Pu-Kra, and the fact that its oceans become dark at a much shallower depth than those on Earth [due to the much redder light of Rp'Gu compared to the sun, which does not penetrate the water as well], the use of bioluminescence for signalling and display is much more common among the life forms of Gu-Pu-Kra than it is among those of the Earth. This is one of the few places where blue light can be seen there. THE GUBPRWUFU In body plan the Gubprwufu are quadrupedal, with a relatively long, flexible body. Their legs have two knees, which on both pairs of legs have backward bending upper knees and forward bending lower ones. As creatures descended from the bilateral animals whose third limbs in each ring was under the body, at the rear underside of the body between the rear legs is a thin three-jointed limb. This is used for swatting flies, signalling body language and so on, much like the tails of Earth animals. Their feet are a cloven hoof-like structure split into two halves. The underside of the foot has layers of keratin-like material tapering backward to the rear of the foot giving a sort of tapering chevron shape of hard ridges with softer flesh between [this gives them odd footprints from a human perspective]. Their feet do not work terribly well on hard artificial surfaces so they tend not to use them. When they have no choice, they will wear shoes analogous to horseshoes to protect their feet. Between the front pair of legs is the third limb of that ring of limbs. Originally it was a flat fringe-edged boned tentacle just capable of creating clicks and snaps (like human finger clicks) but in time it has evolved move complex structures as well as longer 'fingers', chambers of various sizes and other structures that can be compressed and popped to create pops, clicks, burp noises and so on that are modulated and combined for speech. This speaking limb now looks like a sort of odd 'bubble bush' hanging under each individual Gubprwufu. Down the centre of their back runs a long hump, pierced by many hundreds of small openings, which forms a hive-home for the Eb'P [Muninns] associated with that particular Gubprwufu. Along with their other benefits, their symbiotic Eb'P hives provide warmth to their hosts to help them remain active in cold climates [much as bee hives generate warmth on Earth]. In front of the forelegs the body narrows and rises into a thick neck which bulges to house the Gubprwufu brain before trifurcating into the three long, flexible tentacles which form the Gubprwufu manipulative limbs. One of these extends from the bottom of the neck while the others extend from the top of each side. Their tentacles split into two 'fingers' roughly eighty percent of the way towards the tip. The two 'fingers' can work in opposition to one another to give a high degree of manual dexterity. In cross-section the Gubprwufu tentacles have a flat inner side and a roughly half-elliptical cross-section. The entire inside faces of the tentacles have prehensile ridges perpendicular to their length, which are thicker and more widely spaced towards their bases, and thinner and more delicate towards the tip. These can lift front-to-back and ripple along their length (that is, across the width of the tentacle) to give improved manipulative ability. Their foot ridge structure is based on the same overall pattern, but modified for walking. Individual Gubprwufu have a 'handedness' in that at birth they tend to favour one of their three tentacles for manipulation and so on, with an equal percentage preferring each. However, the sharing of memories with others of all three handedness's tends to override this innate preference so that all adult Gubprwufu tend to be essentially ambidextrous. Within the three tentacles is the Gubprwufu's mouth, a treble beak formed of a keratin-like material which is worn down at the edges by eating, but which grows constantly from the body. Inside the mouth they have three quite long tongues. Behind the places where the tentacles join the head and neck are three clusters of small, simple protuberant eyes which see reds and infra-reds [similar to those of other animals on Gu-Pu-Kra]. Two face up and to the side, the third faces down; this downward facing cluster is fully functional, and provides information on the ground below as well as vision when the head is down, for example when drinking. Altogether, the three eye clusters give 'binocular' vision [in the sense of having depth perception] very nearly spherically around the body. The number of eyes in the eye clusters of each individual Gubprwufu varies between individuals, and also between eye clusters on the same individual. This arrangement is generally unique to an individual and is a means of fairly unambiguous identification among them. They blink by eye retraction, like frogs, normally in 'waves' across each eye cluster. In addition to the main eye clusters there are an additional six almost-vestigial eye clusters on the joints of the legs, 'tail' and speaking limb. Much smaller, these clusters cannot see as such, but they can detect differences in light levels. Between the manipulative tentacles are three clusters of alternating backward and forward pointing bristle-like structures. These help distribute DNA-carrying honey-like saliva from the salivary glands to the exterior of the body where it can be accessed by the Eb'P, and also allow DNA deposited by the Eb'P to travel back to the mouth where it can be taken in and read. On each side of the neck where it joins there body there is the flat diaphragm of an ear, which gives them reasonably good hearing. Note that because of the thicker atmosphere of Gu-Pu-Kra their hearing is not as sensitive as that of (for example) and equivalent Earth creature. In terms of size, individual Gubprwufu are larger than humans, with an average mass of some 220 kilograms [as opposed to an average human mass of some 65 kilos, averaging over men and women; this is roughly the same as a pony]. They are somewhat stronger and more muscular than an Earth animal of the same size due to the somewhat heavier gravity of Gu-Pu-Kra. In terms of colour, to human eyes the Gubprwufu are a dark khaki colour, much the same as the photosynthetic vegetation of Gu-Pu-Kra. The is normally even in colour, but some individuals have mottlings or other colour variations, and populations from different regions may also have differences in colour and, sometimes, patternings. Internally, their bone structure is like that of other animals on Gu-Pu-Kra, being based on a structure not unlike a stack of three-pointed bony stars running down the length of the body. The size of the stars and the length of their 'rays' vary depending on the location in the body; long and strong rays are found in particular at the limb joints, where the weight of the body is supported. Elsewhere the rays are smaller, though the size of the 'core' of the star tends to remain similar, for strength. Under the skin, an interlocking mesh of 'scales' provides some degree of protection from damage. Particularly large and strong versions of these provide protection for the brain and other vital organs. They have two hearts, one each for the forward and rear halves of the body. As with other animals on Gu-Pu-Kra, the Gubprwufu brain developed from simpler nerve structures concerned with limb and sense organ control and functionality. In the Gubprwufu the brain in which their sentience resides is in the head, but there are secondary brains at each of the other two rings of limbs. The one at the forelegs is actually quite large as it holds the speech centre used to provide the complex control required for the speaking limb. As part of this there is a thick nerve trunk between the main brain and this secondary centre to effectively control their speaking. Like other land animals on Gu-Pu-Kra, the Gubprwufu do not have lungs. Instead, their interior is divided between a nitrate extraction system, nitrate storage, and a digestive system analogous to that of Earth animals. Both nitrate and energy-bearing food is eaten through the mouth, and the waste products from both are excreted through an equivalent of an anus at the rear of the body. Respiratory waste is excreted as solids along with digestive waste. Also like the other animals of Gu-Pu-Kra, the Gubprwufu are ectothermic [cold-blooded], although because of their size they also have a degree of gigantothermy [where large, bulky ectothermic animals are more easily able to maintain a constant, relatively high body temperature than smaller animals by virtue of their greater volume-to-surface area ratio]. Despite this they are as active as human, their cold-bloodedness not necessarily implying that they are slow or have slow reactions. The Gubprwufu evolved in the most hospitable and biologically diverse part of Gu-Pu-Kra. These regions can support a fairly high population of Gubprwufu due to their cold-bloodedness, which means that require less food and so on than an equivalent population of warm-blooded creatures. GUBPRWUFU REPRODUCTION As with the other animals of Gu-Pu-Kra the Gubprwufu have no breeding season. Also like the other land animals of Gu-Pu-Kra, the Gubprwufu exchange DNA [have sex] via their mouths rather than any other part of their bodies. Fertilised eggs are swallowed by one or other of the mating pair. Each egg then hatches in the stomach of its parent and the resultant young then grows as a tapeworm-like parasite in the gut of the parent until they are large enough to survive in the outside world. All adult Gubprwufu constantly produce special DNA packs that are then swallowed by them. Most of the time these packs are not used, and are simply re-digested and absorbed. However, when they encounter a foetus they are taken in by it. These DNA packages 'program' the foetus with certain types of behaviour, for example how to walk and talk, that allows them to know how to do so as soon as they are born, and so helps them to survive. [Some animals which do this have parasites and other associated species that also learn from them via these special DNA packages, even to the point of speech in some cases.] As such they are born sentient and able to talk and contribute. When the young are ready to be born they begin to secrete a laxative substance that makes their parents excrete them [lovely!]. Following this they are cared for by adults, normally (but not always) their parents. Due to the way their limbs are arranged, young Gubprwufu are born head-first. They initially have a somewhat different form to the adults, being long and thin with relatively short gripping limbs for holding on internally. Once they are born they use the same limbs to hold onto parents externally while they grow further and learn more via DNA transfer young Gubprwufu are programmed, not taught. As part of this the body thickens, the legs lengthen, they grow a Eb'P [Muninn] 'hive', acquire Eb'P, and so on, all relatively quickly after birth, certainly much faster than is the case with humans. [This does not quite count as metamorphosis as the change is not step-like but instead gradually and involving a reshaping of their proportions.] On the birth of a child all Gubprwufu in the vicinity lose a fraction of their 'bees' as they are attracted by pheromones to colonise the new 'hive' in the new individual. All Gubprwufu hives have sufficient slack in their population numbers that this temporary depletion of Eb'P numbers is normally entirely bearable. As a side effect of the way in which either gender can brood young, there is no physical sexual dimorphism among the Gubprwufu; both genders are on average the same size, same strength and so on. However, there are some non-functional differences in appearance between the genders, which allow members of the species to distinguish between each other. Because of their exchanging of memories they also lack any kind of mental sexual dimorphism.\\" Describe the planet Gru-Pa-Kra. Describe life on Gru-Pa-Kra. Describe the Gubprwufu. Describe the appearance, features, biology, etc. of the Gubprwufu. Use your own words.","output":"Planet Gu-Pu-Kra: Gu-Pu-Kra is a rocky planet larger and denser than Earth, with a diameter of 14,500 kilometers and a mass 165% that of Earth. This results in a surface gravity 1.27 times Earth's. The planet orbits a star named Rp'Gu at a close distance, making its orbit just under seven days long. It is tidally locked, so one side perpetually faces the star, basking in daylight, while the other side is cloaked in eternal night. Gu-Pu-Kra has an axial tilt of 9 degrees. Tidal forces from its close orbit and nearby smaller planets, Pgduo and Upopeb, contribute to significant volcanic and tectonic activity. The planet features a hotter core and thinner crust than Earth, divided into numerous smaller and faster-moving tectonic plates. About 76% of the surface is covered by water, resulting in a land area somewhat larger than Earth's. Life on Gu-Pu-Kra: Gu-Pu-Kra exhibits an array of environments. The sunward side has a perpetual massive hurricane, while further regions enjoy milder weather and support diverse life, including Gubprwufu civilizations. The terminator hosts varying daylight due to the planet’s libration, while the twilight zone gradually transitions into darkness with a thriving biosphere supported by volcanic activity and alternative energy sources like chemosynthesis. The atmosphere of Gu-Pu-Kra is thicker than Earth's and has a distinct whitish-pink color due to its composition and the light from Rp'Gu. The red dwarf star's light does not provide much blue or ultraviolet light, therefore there’s no need for an ozone layer. The Gubprwufu: The Gubprwufu are the dominant sentient life forms on Gu-Pu-Kra. They are quadrupedal with flexible bodies and a unique leg structure featuring two knees per leg. They manipulate the environment with three tentacles emanating from their heads, each ending in two finger-like projections. Gubprwufu mouths are beak-like and situated amid their tentacles, and they possess clusters of simple eyes for nearly spherical vision coverage. They communicate via specialized snapping and popping sounds, and they are cold-blooded creatures. Biology of the Gubprwufu: Gubprwufu have a size similar to a pony and display a dark khaki coloring like the local vegetation. Inside, they have a notable bone structure and two hearts splitting duties across the body. The Gubprwufu's brain resides in the head, with secondary centers at limb junctions for advanced functions. They have an ectothermic system for breathing that does not rely on lungs but rather on nitrate extraction, which is necessary since their atmosphere lacks free oxygen. Gubprwufu have a mutualistic relationship with a species of small creatures living in their back humps that assists with DNA transfer and provides warmth. Gubprwufu Reproduction: Reproduction is not seasonal for Gubprwufu. They exchange DNA orally, which leads to gestation resembling a parasitic phase within a parent's gut. Young Gubprwufu are programmed rather than taught, receiving genetic instructions that prepare them for life immediately post-birth. There is no sexual dimorphism in Gubprwufu appearance, with both sexes capable of carrying offspring and looking generally alike."},{"instruction":"Can you describe the appearance of a Gubprwufu by comparing it to Earth lifeforms?","output":"The Gubprwufu's appearance is a unique blend of traits not directly mirroring any single Earth lifeform but can be described through an amalgamation of various features: - Body Structure: They are quadrupedal, meaning they walk on four legs, much like Earth's horses or large quadruped mammals. Yet, each of their legs has an unusual double-knee design, akin to a combination of the backward-bending knee of a bird and the forward-bending knee seen in mammalian species. Their flexible body suggests something akin to an elongated animal like a ferret or weasel but is much larger in size. - Limbs: The Gubprwufu have three tentacle-like manipulative limbs protruding from their neck region. These might be compared to the flexible trunk of an elephant for their dexterity, or to an octopus’s tentacles for the way they split into finger-like ends. Yet, unlike either of these Earth creatures, each tentacle branches out from the 'shoulders' and the 'chin' area of the Gubprwufu. - Speaking Limb: They have a speaking limb under their body between the front legs, originally for creating clicks and snaps. This could be loosely compared to the syrinx of birds used for complex vocalizations, though it is structurally and functionally quite different. - Feet: Their hooved feet are split like a cloven hoof (similar to goats or deer) with layers of keratin-like material providing traction, but the shaping is unique to their species. - Skin and Coloration: Their skin coloration is dark khaki, similar to the hue one might find among desert or savannah-adapted Earth animals that blend with their arid surroundings. - Eyes: The Gubprwufu have clusters of small, simple eyes providing a nearly 360-degree field of vision. While no Earth animal has a close equivalent, this feature might loosely recall the compound eye structure of insects, although Gubprwufu eyes provide more depth perception and are distributed in a unique configuration for more spherical coverage. - Tail: They possess a thin, three-jointed limb at the rear underside of their body, reminiscent of an animal's tail, used for swatting and body language. - Back Hump and Symbionts: The hump running down their back, housing symbiotic species, might be compared to the mutualistic relationships like those between clownfish and anemones or cleaner fish and larger marine species, though the physical manifestation, as part of the Gubprwufu's actual body structure, is unique. Overall, while you can draw visual comparisons between individual aspects of Gubprwufu anatomy and various Earth creatures, the integrated whole of a Gubprwufu does not have a direct parallel with any known Earth species. The Gubprwufu are fictional extraterrestrial beings with a wholly original design."},{"instruction":"Je cherche une application pour écrire en math comme avec latex mais sans latex sur iPad avec le Pencil qui améliore automatiquement l’écriture","output":"Si vous cherchez une application pour votre iPad qui vous permet d'écrire des formules mathématiques avec l'Apple Pencil et qui améliore automatiquement votre écriture en un format similaire à LaTeX, mais sans utiliser LaTeX lui-même, il existe plusieurs options qui pourraient répondre à vos besoins.

Here are some considerations for each approach: 1) Adding a field to a table: - Pros: Adding a field to an existing table is a simple and straightforward approach. It can be more efficient if the boolean field is commonly used across most rows. - Cons: If the boolean field is only used by a small subset of rows, it can lead to wasted space. Additionally, if the boolean field frequently changes, it may result in more updates and slower performance. 2) Creating a new table: - Pros: Creating a separate table can be more space-efficient if the boolean value is only needed for a small subset of rows. It can potentially improve query performance if the two tables are joined frequently. - Cons: Implementing a separate table adds complexity to the schema and queries. It may require additional joins and may be slower if you frequently need to check the existence of the ID. Ultimately, the best approach depends on the frequency of usage, the expected ratio of rows requiring the boolean value, and the type of queries you will perform on the data. It's recommended to consider your specific use case and run performance tests or benchmarks using sample data to validate the most efficient approach."},{"instruction":"If I create a new table, i won't be needed to use joins as I can already have the ID at runtime, also I can read the table at runtime and leave it on memory as a list, so take that into account when defining which one is better.","output":"If your application can maintain the ID values in memory as a separate list and you won't need to perform joins, then creating a new table could be a viable option. Here's a revised comparison with that in mind: 1) Adding a field to a table: - Pros: Simple and straightforward approach. Can be more efficient if the boolean field is commonly used across most rows. - Cons: Wasted space if the boolean field is only needed for a small subset of rows. Frequent updates to the boolean field may impact performance. 2) Creating a new table: - Pros: Space-efficient if the boolean value is only needed for a small subset of rows. No need for joins if you can maintain the ID values in memory as a separate list. - Cons: Adds complexity to the schema and queries. Requires maintaining the ID list in memory separately. May be slower if you frequently need to check the existence of the ID. Considering your specific scenario, if you can efficiently maintain the ID values in memory and avoid joins, creating a new table approach may be more suitable as it can save space and potentially lead to faster queries since you won't have to perform joins. However, it's still advisable to analyze and test the performance of both approaches with your specific data and workload to ensure the chosen approach meets your requirements regarding space usage, query performance, and overall database efficiency."},{"instruction":"is a good practice to have a table with only one field?","output":"Having a table with only one field may not follow the best database design practices in most cases. Generally, a table should model an entity or an object in your system and contain multiple fields/columns that represent various attributes of that entity. A table with only one field could indicate a potential design issue or an oversimplification of the data model. It might be more appropriate to combine the single-field table with another related table or integrate the field into an existing table structure. However, there can be certain scenarios where having a table with a single field could be suitable, such as when you need to store a single set of values that doesn't have any other associated attributes. In such cases, it may be acceptable to create a table with only one field. In general, it's recommended to carefully evaluate the reasons for having a table with only one field and assess if it aligns with the principles of database normalization and the requirements of your application."},{"instruction":"yes but the alternative which we already discussed means adding a field to a table that only a small subset is using it, means waste of space if this table is a big one, and only a few rows really use it","output":"You are correct that adding a field to a table that is only used by a small subset of rows can lead to wasted space if the table is large. In such cases, creating a separate table with only the necessary fields for the subset of rows using the boolean value can be a more efficient approach. By having a separate table, you can avoid wasting space on rows that don't utilize the boolean field. This approach can help optimize storage usage and potentially improve query performance if the majority of the rows in the main table do not need the boolean field. Considering this, if you have a large table where only a few rows require the boolean value, creating a separate table dedicated to those rows could be a better practice than adding a field to the main table that isn't utilized by the majority. Remember to consider the trade-offs and perform performance testing to ensure the chosen approach meets the performance and storage requirements of your specific application."},{"instruction":"Авторские методики устранения дизартрии.","output":"Дизартрия — это нарушение речевой деятельности, связанное с функциональным расстройством артикуляционного аппарата из-за поражения центральной или периферической нервной системы.

In de oudheid waren er echter al enkele vormen van grenzen en territoriale afscheidingen. Een vroeg voorbeeld van landsgrenzen zijn de stadsmuren die werden gebouwd in oude beschavingen zoals het oude Mesopotamië en het oude Egypte. Deze muren dienden niet alleen ter verdediging, maar markeerden ook de grenzen van een stad of koninkrijk. In het oude Griekenland werden grenzen tussen verschillende stadsstaten vastgesteld door middel van verdragen en akkoorden. Dit was echter meer een informeel proces van territoriale afspraken dan een formele demarcatie van landsgrenzen. In het Romeinse Rijk werden landsgrenzen, zoals de beroemde Hadrian's Wall in Groot-Brittannië, gebruikt als militaire verdedigingslinies. Deze grenzen markeerden echter ook politieke en bestuurlijke grenzen tussen verschillende provincies. De moderne vorming van landsgrenzen begon pas aan het einde van de middeleeuwen, toen individuele staten en koninkrijken sterker werden en territoriaal gezag uitoefenden over specifieke gebieden. Het Verdrag van Westfalen in 1648 wordt vaak gezien als het begin van het moderne systeem van territoriale soevereiniteit en officiële landsgrenzen. Dit verdrag maakte een einde aan de Dertigjarige Oorlog en erkende de onafhankelijkheid en territoriale integriteit van individuele staten. Samengevat kunnen we zeggen dat de vorming van de eerste landsgrenzen geleidelijk plaatsvond gedurende de geschiedenis, met vroege voorbeelden in de oudheid, maar de moderne concepten van landsgrenzen ontstonden voornamelijk aan het einde van de middeleeuwen."},{"instruction":"quiero hacer un reporte de mi web y necesito descargar mi html en formato pdf-como podria hacerlo desde el html","output":"Para descargar tu página web en formato PDF desde el HTML, puedes utilizar la biblioteca jsPDF en JavaScript.

The decision to ‘do_nothing’ is based on the potential for a communication loop or error, and the plan is to wait for new user input that clearly indicates how to proceed.In response to repeated ‘System: proceed with your plan’ prompts from the user, I’m initiating another attempt to browse the Reuters technology news section for information on Tesla’s Cybertruck, to create a summarized set of bullet points suitable for an Instagram caption.Following a cycle of repeated ‘proceed with your plan’ instructions and subsequent empty inputs, the current plan is to ‘do_nothing’ and wait for a clear and differentiated input that may confirm user engagement or provide new directions.The pattern of receiving ‘System: proceed with your plan.’ followed by no response continues, prompting the decision to do nothing until a new or different user command is provided.Continuing to encounter the same instruction ‘System: proceed with your plan.’ Awaiting a change in input pattern to ensure that actions align with the user’s latest or actual intention.The pattern of receiving the same ‘System: proceed with your plan.’ instruction continues without interruption or confirmation of my actions, leading me to remain on standby until new, differentiated input is received.

Each episode is self contained, but follows the antic of a village hall's volunteer comittee, as their comic genuis or ineptitude unfolds.. 6 Epsiode series , with pitch and comedic beats for potential episodes..","output":"Title: \\"Memorial Hall\\" Format: 30-minute episodes, color, studio-based Concept: \\"Memorial Hall\\" is a British sitcom that takes place in the quaint village of Little Berrington. The series focuses on the everyday happenings of the volunteer committee responsible for the local village hall, a hub of community life and the setting for all kinds of village events, from weddings to bake sales, scout meetings, and amateur dramatics. The characters are a mix of oddball personalities, each with their unique quirks, who must work together despite their differences. Their interactions lead to inevitable comedic conflicts, misunderstandings, and mishaps as they attempt to keep the hall afloat and the community engaged. Episode Guide: **Episode 1: \\"The Grand Re-Opening\\"** - The series kicks off with the committee preparing for the grand re-opening of Memorial Hall after a much-needed refurbishment. - Comedic beats include: miscommunication resulting in double-booked events, a mix-up with the new sound system causing feedback chaos, and a surprise health and safety inspection. - The crew must band together to sort out the chaos in time for the evening's gala. **Episode 2: \\"Election Folly\\"** - It's time to elect a new Chairperson for the committee, and the power-hungry members launch their ridiculous campaigns. - Comedic beats involve: slapstick campaigning mishaps, absurd election promises, and a rogue candidate from outside the committee throwing a spanner in the works. - Backstabbing and alliances lead to an unexpected dark horse winning the chair. **Episode 3: \\"The Haunted Hall\\"** - A rumor starts that the hall is haunted, leading to a ghost-hunt event to raise funds. - Comedic beats include: volunteers trying and failing to act brave, makeshift ghost-catching gadgets going wrong, and a prank that escalates quickly. - The episode ends with a legitimate spooky occurrence that leaves even the skeptics uneasy. **Episode 4: \\"Memorial Hall's Got Talent\\"** - The hall hosts a talent competition, drawing an array of eccentric village performers. - Comedic beats revolve around the committee members having to perform unexpectedly, outrageous acts that go hilariously wrong, and a power outage forcing an impromptu acoustic set. - A 'fix' accusation throws the competition into disarray until an unlikely talent shines. **Episode 5: \\"Wedding Bells and Alarm Bells\\"** - The committee is tasked with handling the village mayor's wedding reception, but nothing goes as planned. - Comedic beats include a cake disaster, the groom's lost ring turning up in an improbable place, and a rivalry between wedding planners. - Tensions come to a head when a forgotten ex shows up, leading to farcical hide-and-seek sequences. **Episode 6: \\"The Time Capsule\\"** - The village decides to bury a time capsule, and the committee members are responsible for selecting items that represent the community. - Comedic beats involve heated debates over what should go in, items getting mixed up with someone's personal belongings, and a mishap with the digging equipment. - The ceremony ends up uncovering something from the past, much to everyone's surprise. This hypothetical show, with its blend of character-driven humor and situational comedy set against a backdrop of community life, has the potential to engage audiences who enjoy lighthearted, feel-good sitcoms."},{"instruction":"Episode 2 could also be a slight/mild satire on 'local' politics in the UK. Let's expand the idea :)","output":"Episode 2: \\"Vote of Confidence\\" Tagline: As the Memorial Hall committee elections roll around, the ballot box isn't the only thing that's stuffed with surprises. Synopsis: Politics and pettiness take center stage as the Memorial Hall committee members vie for the coveted role of Chairperson. With the current Chairperson stepping down, the race is on to fill the village’s most 'prestigious' seat. The campaign trail becomes a breeding ground for satire reflecting the absurdities of local politics in the UK. Main Plot: Each committee member has a unique, if not entirely reasonable, platform for their candidacy. From promising to ban all things left-handed to vowing to turn the hall into a Wi-Fi-free zen zone, the members' outlandish election pledges quickly spiral into gently mocking local political posturing and one-upmanship. Comedic Beats: - **Leaflet Lunacy**: Misprinted manifestos lead to hilariously mixed messages, such as promising \\"Free Wifi for all baked goods!\\" causing confusion among the village's elder residents and a surplus of pies showing up at the hall. - **Debate Debacle**: A candidates' debate is surprisingly well-attended, revealing the community's love for gossip and free biscuits more than their interest in policy. The debate quickly turns into a Monty Python-esque farce with more logical fallacies than facts. - **Stealthy Sabotage**: Campaign 'dirty tricks' are afoot, with sabotaged posters and mysteriously disappearing leaflets. One candidate's banner is mysteriously replaced with a lovingly hand-knit tapestry portraying their face, and it's hideously off-putting. - **Electioneering Egos**: An impromptu and wholly unofficial exit poll outside the village post office creates a war of egos, leading to committee members trying to bribe voters with bizarre incentives like homemade chutney and free hedge trimming. - **Unintended Upset**: A well-intentioned but blundering candidate spills tea over the ballots. The incident leads to an emergency re-vote using a bingo machine and causes an uproar of exaggerated despair and distrust amongst the candidates. - **Wild Card Woes**: A mysterious outsider throws their hat in the ring, capitalizing on the chaos. Their promises of sensible policies and harmonious leadership are so alien to the committee's usual drama that they're initially met with suspicion but quickly gain unexpected popularity. Culmination: The climax of satire comes with the results announcement, where a slipped decimal point leads to the village cat momentarily being declared the winner. In the confusion that follows, the remaining human candidates rediscover their shared passion for the community—when faced with an aloof feline Chairperson—and unite for an unprecedented coalition leadership, merging their wildest policy ideas into a slightly less wild action plan for Memorial Hall. Satirical Elements: \\"Vote of Confidence\\" touches on the follies of local elections, such as the disproportionate ambition of candidates, the often-parochial concerns of voters, and the typically low stakes misunderstood as life-or-death scenarios. The episode's humor would be grounded in the recognition of these tropes, providing viewers with both a lighthearted take on village life and a gentle nudge to the ribs of local political theatre."},{"instruction":"Mirroring UK election coverage on TV, the scene where the winner is declared could be done creatively, with perhaps the local correspondent signing off at the end, albiet for a video-blog rather than for the BBC? How might this scene play out...","output":"Scene: The Declaration and Correspondent Sign-off Setting: The village hall is decorated with bunting and homemade campaign posters, teeming with villagers buzzing with anticipation. A makeshift stage has been set up at the front with a single microphone, a table adorned with a dodgy-looking homemade ballot box, and a jerry-rigged \\"live results\\" board. The scene beings with bumbling committee member and pseudo-returning officer, Clive, nervously approaching the microphone, holding a stack of wet ballots courtesy of the \\"tea incident.\\" The crowd quiets down with a mix of excitement and anxious giggles, fully aware of the committee's propensity for mishaps. Clive starts the announcement, his voice shaking, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, fellow candidates, and... Mr. Whiskers (a nod to the village cat), the votes have been counted and recounted—sincerely, this time. The next chairperson of the Memorial Hall committee, by a majority of... erm... one and a half votes, is...\\" The tension mounts, and comedic sound effects like a drumroll played on a child's toy drum underscore the suspense. \\"...actually, I can't read the wet ink, but it's definitely one of you!\\" Laughter erupts from the audience as the candidates nervously laugh it off. Suddenly, the self-appointed \\"local correspondent\\" and village vlogger, Jill, commandeers the stage with her smartphone on a selfie stick, poised to capture the moment for her blog. Jill is known for her overly dramatic sign-offs and has been live-streaming the entire debacle for her handful of devoted followers, treating it with the gravitas of a national election. Jill addresses her smartphone with mock solemnity: \\"And there you have it, folks. Democracy in action, right here in the heart of Little Berrington. It's been a day of suspense, surprises, and soggy ballots, but above all—a testament to the indomitable spirit of our village democracy. We've laughed, we've cried, and Mr. Whiskers here has taken an unexpected lead in the polls.\\" The camera pans to Mr. Whiskers, nonchalantly licking his paw on a nearby table. \\"We eagerly await the final, definitive, absolutely accurate declaration of our new chairperson. Until then, keep clicking, keep sharing, and remember, every vote counts—even the accidental ones. This is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, your local correspondent, signing off. Stay informed, Little Berrington!\\" As Jill theatrically ends her live stream, Clive finally untangles the voting mess, revealing the real winner. The victorious candidate steps up, the village bursts into cheers (or groans), and the camera fades to black on Jill giving an exaggerated wink to her audience, implying, \\"You can't make this stuff up.\\" This scene is brimming with satire and comedic elements, mimicking the tension and overproduction of election night coverage while poking fun at the quirks of local politics and the rise of amateur reporting in the digital age. It winks at the audience, reminding them of the show's wry observations about village life and democracy."},{"instruction":"I had it more like - \\"Candidate 1 - Baked Goods for Wi-fi! -0 X votes - Candidate 2 - Zen drill - Y Vote. - Whiskers - Feline - One and a half votes! As <blah> i certify Mr Whisksers as the new chair...\\"","output":"Certainly, that scenario could play out delightfully as follows: The hall is silent as everyone waits with bated breath. Clive stands behind the podium, papers shuffling in his hands as he adjusts his reading glasses. A poster flaps off the wall behind him, adding to the tension and the sense of impending chaos. He clears his throat and begins to announce the results. Clive: \\"Well, uh, it seems we've had a rather... unprecedented turnout. Let's go through the numbers, shall we?\\" He squints, holding the paper comically close to his face. Clive: \\"Candidate 1, with the innovative 'Baked Goods for Wi-Fi' initiative... has secured exactly zero votes.\\" A shot of Candidate 1, smiling awkwardly as they throw a hopeful thumbs-up to the crowd, which responds with a mix of pity claps and stifled giggles. Clive: \\"And Candidate 2, championing the complete 'Zen drill' makeover of our beloved hall, has garnered... one vote, which... appears to be their own.\\" A quick pan to Candidate 2, nodding serenely with closed eyes, seemingly unbothered by the result. The camera turns back to Clive as he hesitates, looking bemused and somewhat perplexed. Clive: \\"Ah, and, uh, Mr. Whiskers, who—may I remind you—is a cat, and should certainly not be on the ballot, has... one and a half votes.\\" The crowd erupts in laughter and mild confusion as an elderly villager sheepishly admits to trying to place half a vote after being unable to choose between the human candidates. Clive, leaning into the absurdity and the spirit of good fun that has come to define the village's proceedings, continues with an amused smile. Clive: \\"As the acting returning officer and at this... utterly unique crossroads of our local democracy, I hereby certify Mr. Whiskers as the new Chair—\\" Before he can finish his sentence, Jill, the ever-eager local correspondent, leaps up to the stage with her smartphone already streaming. Jill: \\"Viewers, can you believe this? History has been made tonight in Little Berrington! Mr. Whiskers, feline-extraordinaire and the unexpected favorite, has clawed his way to victory in what can only be described as a purr-fect outcome to an unforgettable election.\\" A gentle swing of her phone captures Mr. Whiskers, now being hoisted up by one of the more quirky committee members for an impromptu victory cuddle, despite the cat appearing utterly unfazed. Jill: \\"I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, your local vlogger, confirming with delight and disbelief that Mr. Whiskers is now unofficially... or should I say 'off-fur-cially'... the Chairperson of the village hall committee. Thank mew for tuning in, and stay paws-itive, Little Berrington!\\" With a flourish, she ends her broadcast just as the real winner is discovered due to a recount, and a human chairperson is properly announced. But in that moment, captured in humorous jest and broadcast to Jill's subscribers, Mr. Whiskers has become an overnight sensation and perhaps the most famous village hall chair in history—even if it's in name only."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Uh…has anyone seen Natsuki?” Yuri: “No, I haven’t.

However, I can provide a detailed description that you might use as a basis to draw a lion. 1. Start by drawing the lion's head: - Draw a circle for the main part of the head. - Add two small arcs on top for the ears. - Inside the circle, near the bottom, draw the lion’s eyes with a gentle curve over each one for the brows. - In the middle of the circle, a little below the eyes, sketch a small triangle for the nose. - Add a line coming down from the nose and split it into a ‘Y’ shape to create the mouth and chin area. - For the mane, draw wavy lines that go all around the lion's head, extending it much wider than the initial circle. 2. Draw the lion's body: - Behind the head, create a rectangular shape for the torso, tapering it slightly as you go down towards the lion's hips. - Add four vertical lines beneath the torso for the legs, and at the end of each line, add an oval shape for paws with small triangular shapes for the claws. - Draw a tufted tail extending from the rear of the body with a furry tip. 3. Add details and define the features: - Detail the mane with more wavy and jagged lines to give it a full and bushy look. - Sketch in the lion's facial details more precisely: the pupils within the eyes, detail within the ears, and whisker dots on the snout. - Outline the body, defining the muscles and the chest, and add the final lines for the legs to show their shape and dimension. 4. Finish your drawing: - Erase any unnecessary guide lines. - Go over your drawing with a darker line to finalize it. - For an advanced touch, add shading to create depth in your drawing, with the lightest shading on the mane and the darker shading to emphasize the muscles and underbelly. Remember, art is unique to each artist, and your own creativity can influence the style and final look of your lion drawing. Happy drawing!"},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files. 2.

As of my last update in September 2021, there have been no recorded instances of data centers being specifically targeted and bombed. However, it's important to note that cyberattacks or physical threats like bombing attempts can occur against any critical infrastructure, including data centers."},{"instruction":"anything simlar","output":"There have been instances of attacks against critical infrastructure, including incidents that have affected data centers through cyberattacks or other means. Here are a few notable examples: 1. The Stuxnet Worm: In 2010, the Stuxnet worm was discovered, which specifically targeted industrial control systems, including those used in nuclear facilities. The worm caused significant damage to Iran's nuclear program, impacting the Natanz facility's centrifuges. 2. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks: Data centers can be targeted by DDoS attacks, where a large number of requests overwhelm the network, rendering the services inaccessible. In 2016, the Mirai botnet targeted Dyn, a major DNS provider, leading to widespread internet outages affecting various websites and services. 3. Fire and Natural Disasters: While not intentional attacks, data centers are susceptible to fire accidents or natural disasters that can disrupt their operations. For example, in 2017, an electrical fire at an Equinix data center in London caused service disruptions for numerous organizations. It's important to note that data centers often have robust security measures, redundancy systems, and backup protocols in place to mitigate risks and ensure data integrity."},{"instruction":"Fais moi un background pour un sergeant de la police américaine","output":"Nom: Johnathan \\"John\\" Carter Âge: 38 ans Origine: Né et élevé à Chicago, Illinois.

However, not all traditionalist Catholics are in schism; some traditionalist communities are in full communion with Rome but prefer the traditional liturgy and pre-Vatican II teachings. One of the most notable groups that rejected the Second Vatican Council and split from the Roman Catholic Church is the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX), founded by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre in 1970. The SSPX has had a complex relationship with the Vatican, with periods of negotiation and tension. While not formally in schism, the SSPX is canonically irregular, and its status within the Church is a subject of ongoing discussion. Sedevacantists, on the other hand, are a smaller and more radical subset who believe that the papal office has been vacant since the death of Pope Pius XII in 1958 (or after one of his successors) because they argue that the subsequent popes have espoused heresy and are therefore invalid. It is important to note that the official Catholic Church does not recognize the authority of these groups and cautions the faithful about affiliating with them. However, the Church has also made efforts to reconcile and accommodate some of the concerns of traditionalists, such as by granting broader permission for the celebration of the Tridentine Mass (the traditional Latin Mass) under certain conditions."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security.

Mother Magnolia provides guidance and keeps the peace, proving her directing chops are just as sharp as her comedic timing. Episode 6 - \\"Crowning Achievements\\" In the season finale, it's time for the annual \\"Mother's Day Ball,\\" an extravagant event where Mother Magnolia reviews and celebrates the achievements of her drag daughters. As the queens reflect on the season's trials and triumphs, Mother faces her own moment of truth about what being a mentor means and how her legacy will shine on. Each episode would mix farce, sincere emotional moments, and the trials and tribulations of drag life, all while showcasing the resilience and profound camaraderie within the drag community. Cameos from real drag stars could add authenticity and extra sparkle to the show."},{"instruction":"Episode 7- Mother Magnolia has to handle drag royalty ( a very well known performer), but that perfomer is know for being a demanding diva.. Can the youngsters still shine when thrown in the shade of drag royalty?","output":"Title: \\"Runway Rendezvous\\" Episode 7 - \\"The Queen's Shadow\\" Synopsis: The Glittering Orchid is buzzing with excitement and nerves. Sapphire Starshine, a legendary, world-famous drag queen known as much for her dazzling performances as for her demanding, diva antics, has graced the club with her presence for a guest performance. The young queens are beside themselves, eager for the chance to perform alongside drag royalty. However, it soon becomes apparent that Sapphire's high standards and sharp tongue are casting a heavy shadow over the up-and-comers, making them question their talents. Mother Magnolia, ever the nurturing mentor, sees the storm clouds of self-doubt gathering over her fledglings and steps in to remind them that every queen has her day—and today is not only Sapphire’s. Throughout the episode, we see comedic examples of Sapphire's diva demands, from insisting all the green M&Ms be removed from her dressing room to asking for her own personal spotlight at all times, even off the stage. Despite their reverence for Sapphire, the queens find themselves having to adapt to her over-the-top antics. We follow their comedic attempts to meet her needs while still preparing for their own performances. Mother Magnolia, meanwhile, seeks to strike a delicate balance between hosting the star and supporting her girls. She imparts wisdom about the fleeting nature of fame and the enduring strength of community and support. Entangled in backstage politics and performance nerves, Mother Magnolia orchestrates a brilliant solution. She convinces Sapphire to participate in an unprecedented joint performance with the younger queens, highlighting both the roots and future of drag artistry, and more sublimely, showcasing that even the most solitary stars shine brighter in constellation. At the climax, we witness a stunning performance—half tribute to the past and half toast to the future—with Sapphire and the younger queens sharing the spotlight in a powerful reminder that pride and mentorship can coexist harmoniously. The episode ends on a high note, with Sapphire Starshine graciously bowing to Mother Magnolia and her protégés, recognizing the vibrant legacy she carries on and the new energy the young queens bring to the drag world. In a tender moment of growth, the queens learn that deference to royalty does not mean diminishing their own light – and that the greatest queens uplift those around them."},{"instruction":"A side plot could be that Sapphire has the sort of 'security' that would make even a president blush?","output":"Absolutely! Incorporating that side plot could add an extra layer of humor and conflict to the episode. Here’s how it could play out: Side Plot: \\"The Security Siege\\" Sapphire Starshine's arrival at The Glittering Orchid brings not just the star herself, but a retinue of overly protective security guards who turn the backstage area into something resembling a high-security fortress. The guards, with earpieces, dark sunglasses, and stern expressions, take their jobs too seriously, creating absurd and comical scenarios for the regular queens and staff of the club. Throughout the episode, as Mother Magnolia tries to manage Sapphire's diva demands and mentor her girls, the young queens must navigate a labyrinth of red tape just to reach the stage. They face ridiculous security checks, secret passwords for the dressing room, and a guard who insists on frisking them for \\"performance contraband\\" like unapproved glitter or illicit sequins. One of the comedic high points involves one of the younger queens, Glitter Gary, who accidentally triggers a lockdown after he mistakes a security guard's walkie-talkie for a new kind of remote for the club's lighting system. Chaos ensues as the club is temporarily put on \\"diva lockdown,\\" and the queens must use all their wit and charm to diffuse the situation. Meanwhile, the ever-scheming Mother Magnolia sees an opportunity in the madness. Cleverly, she plays up to the security's sense of importance, flattering them into relaxing their iron grip on the backstage. She tells them tall tales of her own experiences with \\"security risks\\" in her performance past, making them less about protecting Sapphire and more about safeguarding the \\"cultural treasures\\" of all drag performers in the club. As the climax performance approaches, Sapphire's guards are unexpectedly recruited as part of the act, following Mother Magnolia's subtle suggestion. They end up contributing to the final number's success, adding an extra layer of spectacle as they convert their stern looks and impressive physiques into performance art, much to the audience's delight. In the end, the episode resolves with Sapphire's security detail learning to lighten up and appreciate the vibrant world of The Glittering Orchid, with Mother Magnolia reminding everyone that the best security comes from the mutual respect and protection offered by a tight-knit community."},{"instruction":"How might a comedic scene with this angle work ?","output":"Scene Setup: In the tightly packed backstage area of The Glittering Orchid, the overzealous security team assigned to Sapphire Starshine has established a checkpoint. The queens must pass through to access their dressing rooms, but the security guards are taking their job to comically extreme levels. Scene: INT. THE GLITTERING ORCHID - BACKSTAGE - EVENING [The young queens are lined up at a makeshift \\"security checkpoint\\" complete with a metal detector archway. A burly SECURITY GUARD, head-to-toe in a well-fitted black suit, checks each queen with a hand-held scanner. GLITTER GARY, decked out in an outlandishly feathery outfit, approaches with trepidation.] SECURITY GUARD: (State sternly) Please remove all metallic items. Spare no bobby pin, no earring, no... (pauses, squinting at Gary’s costume) whatever that is. GLITTER GARY: (Flustered and pulling feathers from his costume) But—these are part of my ensemble! Without my metallic shim-sham, I'm just... Gary! [Another guard scans the queens with such focus, he doesn't notice the feathered boa of LADY LAQUER brushing his face as she tries to pass with dramatic poise.] LADY LAQUER: (Purrs) Darling, if you wanted to get closer, all you had to do was ask. [SECURITY GUARD #2 reddens and stammers. He reverts back to his scanning. Meanwhile, Mother Magnolia struts in, surveying the ridiculous scene. She approaches wearing a majestic, sparkling crown that would definitely set off the metal detector.] MOTHER MAGNOLIA: (Faux shock) My, my! What's all this? I leave you children for a moment, and we've turned into Fort Knox. SECURITY GUARD #1: (Respectful but firm) Apologies, ma'am, but everyone must be scanned. Even legends. [He motions Mother Magnolia toward the metal detector. She gives him a wink and starts \\"accidentally\\" setting off the detector with various metal items she’s hidden in her outfit, each more outlandish than the last—a giant spoon, a small frying pan, and finally, a metal bedpan with fake jewels glued on.] MOTHER MAGNOLIA: (Innocent) Oh, my stars! However did that get there? You see, I was going for that 'Queen of the Night Potty' look tonight. [The queens giggle. The SECURITY GUARDS, initially thrown off by the absurdity, can't help but crack a smile. Mother Magnolia bends down and whispers conspiratorially to the head security guard.] MOTHER MAGNOLIA: (Softly) You know, dear, Sapphire needs her audience dazzled, not detained. Wouldn't it be fabulous if you were part of the finale? Imagine, protectors of the performance! A true diva knows the value of a good show, wouldn't you agree? [The SECURITY GUARD #1 considers this, then nods in agreement. The guards begin helping the queens pass through the checkpoint more smoothly, even applauding their fabulous attire.] CUT TO: [The final number’s climax. The once-stoic security guards are now part of the act, holding spotlights and showcasing the queens, including Sapphire. Their faces are stern, but they're clearly enjoying the spotlight in their own way.] [As the performance ends, the audience erupts into cheers. The queens, Mother Magnolia, and even the security team take a bow. Sapphire, showing a rare soft side, wraps an arm around Mother Magnolia, appreciative of the night’s success.] FADE OUT. In this scene, the comedic friction between the queens and the overly serious security detail highlights the contrast between the lighthearted freedom of drag and the rigid formality of security protocol. Mother Magnolia’s charm and wisdom bridge the gap, turning a potentially stressful situation into a moment of unity and laughter."},{"instruction":"how do spammers launder their money usually?

For those wishing to explore more, diving into albums and full discographies of the mentioned artists, as well as looking for contemporary visual kei bands, is a great way to discover a personal list of top songs.

Производство картона Лесозаготовка Варианты ответов: Сырьевой Топливный Сырьевой и энергетический Транспортный Трудовой","output":"Производство картона: - Сырьевой фактор: производство картона требует использования сырья, такого как древесина или переработанные бумажные отходы. - Топливный фактор: в процессе производства картона может требоваться использование топлива, например, для питания оборудования или нагрева сырья. - Транспортный фактор: готовый картон должен быть доставлен к потребителям, поэтому транспортировка является важным фактором размещения производства картона. Лесозаготовка: - Сырьевой фактор: лесозаготовка непосредственно связана с добычей древесины, которая является основным сырьем для многих отраслей деревообрабатывающей промышленности. - Топливный фактор: в процессе лесозаготовки может применяться техника, которая потребляет топливо, такое как бензин или дизельное топливо для работы пил и других инструментов. - Трудовой фактор: лесозаготовка требует высококвалифицированного и физически подготовленного персонала, который способен работать в сложных условиях (например, на открытых участках леса). Таким образом, для производства картона основными факторами размещения будут сырьевой, топливный и транспортный, а для лесозаготовки - сырьевой, топливный и трудовой."},{"instruction":"Выбери продукцию, которая выпускается на предприятиях лесной промышленности. Ответ: кокс шпалы пластмассы чугун","output":"Продукция, выпускаемая на предприятиях лесной промышленности, обычно связана с переработкой древесины и деревообработкой. Кокс и чугун, как металлургические продукты, относятся к другим отраслям - металлургии и металлообработке, а не к лесной промышленности. Шпалы - это изделия из дерева, которые используются в железнодорожном строительстве для укладки пути. Производство шпал связано с лесозаготовкой и деревообработкой, поэтому это продукция, которая выпускается на предприятиях лесной промышленности. Пластмассы - это синтетические материалы, которые производятся многочисленными химическими процессами, но не имеют прямого отношения к переработке древесины. Поэтому пластмассы не связаны с лесной промышленностью. Таким образом, продукцией, которая выпускается на предприятиях лесной промышленности, являются шпалы."},{"instruction":"Какие субъекты Российской Федерации лидируют по лесозаготовке?
