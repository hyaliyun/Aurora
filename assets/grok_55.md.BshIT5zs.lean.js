By having a cylindrical shape, the freighter maximizes the internal volume for cargo storage while minimizing the surface area, which helps distribute structural stresses evenly. A cylindrical shape also has inherent stability due to its efficient distribution of forces, making it more suitable for handling the immense gravitational forces experienced during space travel or when docking with other objects. Additionally, a cylindrical shape offers better structural strength against external forces and pressures compared to other shapes, such as a box or sphere. The uniformity of the cylindrical structure allows for more efficient distribution of stresses and strains, minimizing weak points that could compromise structural integrity. Furthermore, cylindrical structures can be easily reinforced and compartmentalized, ensuring even weight distribution and allowing for redundancy in case of damage or structural failure. This design flexibility enhances overall stability and safety during intergalactic freight transportation. Overall, a cylindrical shape would provide the intergalactic freighter with the largest structural allowable cargo space while maintaining structural stability required for safe and efficient transportation across vast distances in the galaxy."},{"instruction":"What about The space equivilant of aerodynamics should a ship ever have the technoledgy to breach the light barriar (theoreticaly)","output":"If a spaceship were to have the technology to breach the light barrier (theoretically), the concept of aerodynamics would be less relevant in the vacuum of space. In such a scenario, the primary concern would be minimizing energy consumption and optimizing propulsion systems for efficiency. While there is no air or atmosphere in space, there are still various factors to consider for efficient interstellar travel. These include gravitational forces, radiation, micrometeoroids, and potential encounters with interstellar particles or bodies. To minimize energy consumption, a spaceship designed for interstellar travel might employ technologies such as ion propulsion systems, antimatter engines, or even hypothetical warp drives. These propulsion systems would aim to maximize thrust while minimizing fuel consumption. Spacecraft intended for interstellar travel might also incorporate advanced shielding materials to protect against radiation and micrometeoroid impacts. Shielding could take the form of multi-layered materials or magnetic fields to deflect or absorb harmful particles or radiation. Considering potential encounters with interstellar particles or objects, the spaceship would benefit from an outer hull that is resilient to impacts and can withstand high speeds. The hull could incorporate self-healing or self-repairing materials, as well as advanced detection systems to identify and avoid potential collisions. Additionally, if a spacecraft were able to traverse the light barrier, it would likely need to withstand extreme electromagnetic forces and gravitational distortions. The design would have to consider the effects of intense acceleration and deceleration, as well as the ability to safely navigate gravitational fields of celestial bodies. In summary, if a spaceship were to possess the technology to breach the light barrier, the design considerations would focus more on efficient propulsion systems, shielding against radiation and impacts, and the ability to withstand extreme forces and gravitational distortions rather than traditional aerodynamic principles."},{"instruction":"If there was an accedent where the drive malfunctioned and the ship was catipulted for FTL (for want of a better term) and decelerated suddenly. Givin the cylindrical shape if structural damge where going to occure, where would the deceleration forces be at there greatist consintration.","output":"If a spaceship experiencing a malfunction suddenly decelerates, the deceleration forces would be concentrated at the ends or extremities of the cylindrical shape, particularly where the spaceship makes contact or is connected to other objects or structures. In a cylindrical spaceship, the greatest concentration of deceleration forces would likely occur at the forward-facing end or nose of the ship. This is because the momentum and energy of the spaceship would be abruptly transferred to the stationary objects or structures with which it comes into contact. The deceleration forces would create a high-stress region at the point of impact, potentially leading to structural damage or failure. The magnitude of the strain would depend on various factors, including the speed of deceleration, the mass of the spaceship, and the structural strength of the impacted area. Additionally, other areas where there could be significant concentrations of deceleration forces include the docking ports or connection points towards the rear or aft end of the spaceship. If the spaceship abruptly decelerates while connected to another object or structure, the forces generated during deceleration could be transmitted through those connection points, potentially causing damage or failure. To mitigate the impact of sudden deceleration forces and distribute them more evenly throughout the spaceship's structure, various design considerations can be implemented. These may include reinforcing critical areas, using shock-absorbing materials or mechanisms, incorporating structural redundancies, and implementing energy-absorbing systems or buffers. Ultimately, in the event of a sudden deceleration accident, a cylindrical spaceship's design should aim to minimize concentrations of deceleration forces at the ends or extremities, using techniques that distribute and dissipate those forces to maintain overall structural integrity."},{"instruction":"Where would the presure bulkeheads need to be to prevent compleat explosive decompresion throughout the ship, with resualting lose of the intrity of the ships company","output":"To prevent complete explosive decompression throughout the ship and ensure the integrity and safety of the ship's crew, pressure bulkheads would need to be strategically placed within the cylindrical spaceship. Pressure bulkheads are structural barriers designed to maintain the pressure integrity of different compartments within a spacecraft. In the event of an abrupt decompression or breach, these bulkheads help contain the air or atmosphere to prevent it from rushing throughout the entire ship. In a cylindrical spaceship, pressure bulkheads should be located in key positions to compartmentalize the ship effectively. Here are some suggested locations for pressure bulkheads: 1. Forward Bulkhead: Placing a pressure bulkhead at the forward end or nose of the spaceship would separate the crew and cargo compartments from the potentially compromised area. This bulkhead would help prevent the rapid propagation of decompression forces towards the rest of the ship in the event of a breach. 2. Aft Bulkhead: Similarly, a pressure bulkhead at the aft or rear end of the spaceship would provide an additional barrier between the crew and cargo compartments and any potential decompression source. It could help minimize the propagation of decompression forces towards the forward sections of the ship. 3. Internal Bulkheads: Within the ship, additional pressure bulkheads can be installed to divide the interior into separate compartments. This way, if a breach occurs in one section, the surrounding bulkheads would isolate and contain the decompression, limiting its effect on other compartments and preserving crew safety. It's crucial to note that these locations are general suggestions and may vary depending on the specific spaceship's design and purpose. The exact placement of pressure bulkheads should be determined through careful structural analysis and consideration of the spacecraft's layout, such as the intended use, structural strength, and potential risks. Implementing pressure bulkheads at strategic points can greatly enhance the safety and survivability of the ship's crew, minimizing the risks associated with explosive decompression."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Perceived privacy is an essential consideration when working with online data, even if it is publicly available. Accommodating perceived privacy requires several considerations: 1. Context and Intention: Understanding the context in which the content is shared and the intention of the authors. Even if content is publicly accessible, individuals may still have intended it for a specific audience or group. Researchers should be mindful of this and respect the intended privacy of the authors. 2. User Settings and Privacy Controls: Recognizing that individuals may have adjusted their privacy settings on social media platforms to restrict access to their content. Researchers should respect these settings and only use publicly accessible information. 3. Sensitive Information: Being cautious of personally identifiable or sensitive information that may be present in publicly available content. Even if individuals share information online, certain details may still be considered private. Researchers should take appropriate measures to de-identify or anonymize data to protect privacy. 4. Community Norms and Expectations: Recognizing the existing norms and expectations within specific online communities. Some communities may have their own standards of privacy that need to be considered when using their publicly available data. 5. Informed Consent: In situations where the data collection involves user-generated content, seeking informed consent from authors whenever possible. This can help establish a mutual understanding and respect for privacy concerns. 6. Ethical Guidelines and Regulations: Adhering to ethical guidelines and regulations specific to the research field and jurisdiction.

Take extra precautions to ensure that any identifiable information is protected, and consider whether data anonymization or aggregation techniques should be applied to minimize the risk of identification. 3. Harm and Exploitation Prevention: Be mindful of potential harm or exploitation that may arise from the use of data from individuals who are unable to understand the public nature of their posts. Ensure that the research does not cause any unnecessary distress or harm to the minors involved. 4. Responsible Use of Data: Consider the potential impact of using the data from minors or individuals who may not fully comprehend the consequences of their posts. Use the data responsibly, considering the broader ethical implications and implications for the well-being of the individuals involved. 5. Context and Audience Considerations: Take into account the intended audience and scope of the content shared by minors. Respect any intentions they might have had regarding the visibility and readership of their posts, even in a public context. 6. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval: Seek ethical review and approval from relevant institutional bodies or IRBs to ensure compliance with ethical standards and guidelines specific to working with minors or vulnerable populations. 7. Ongoing Monitoring and Evaluation: Continuously monitor and evaluate the ethical implications of using data from minors. Adapt research practices and protocols as needed to address any emerging concerns and ensure ethical standards are upheld.

It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the offender's characteristics, motivations, and potential for violence, which can be used to inform legal decisions, treatment planning, and public safety measures. Key components of a forensic assessment of sexual offenders may include: 1. Offense history: Gathering detailed information about the offender's past sexual offenses, including the nature of the offenses, victim characteristics, levels of violence, and patterns of behavior. 2. Psychosocial history: Assessing the offender's personal, family, educational, and employment history, as well as examining any significant psychosocial factors that may contribute to their offending behavior (e.g., childhood abuse, substance abuse, mental health issues). 3. Psychological assessment: Administering standardized psychological tests and assessments to examine the offender's personality traits, cognitive functioning, sexual attitudes, and paraphilic interests. 4. Risk assessment: Applying actuarial risk assessment tools, such as the Static-99R or the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide, to estimate the likelihood of re-offending and to identify risk factors that may be mitigated through treatment or supervision. 5. Treatment needs evaluation: Identifying the specific treatment needs of the offender, including addressing their deviant sexual preferences, managing behavioral patterns, enhancing impulse control, building healthy relationships, and reducing the risk of relapse. 6. Dynamic risk factors: Examining dynamic risk factors that can change over time, such as the offender's level of insight into their offending behavior, motivation for treatment, behavioral control, and compliance with supervision. 7. Victim impact assessment: Assessing the impact of the offender's behavior on their victims, including emotional, psychological, and physical harm, in order to inform appropriate interventions and victim support services. 8. Risk management planning: Collaborating with probation officers, parole boards, and treatment providers to develop comprehensive risk management plans that address the offender's specific treatment needs, monitoring requirements, and community safety initiatives. The use of forensic assessments in sexual offender evaluations helps inform legal decisions regarding sentencing, probation, parole, and treatment programs. It also aids in developing more effective interventions and monitoring strategies to reduce the risk of re-offense and protect potential victims."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

当即领证结婚，新婚夜她让闺女自己玩，她打了水给男人擦身。望着他俊朗的面容，她不禁替他惋惜。长的好又是单位骨干，可却成了如今这样。擦洗、翻身、鼻饲，看她照顾的精心，老太太一个月后放心的闭上了眼。 老人走了，她看看存折上的余额打算开始做小买卖——卖早点。这天、她给男人擦脸念叨着所遇的麻烦，他眼皮一动睁开了眼睛。","output":"男人设： 1. 李明：成为植物人后无法自理，长相俊朗 2.

Additionally, if the space lacks clear exits or if there are multiple identical exits, it may become challenging to find a way out.

The lack of visual cues and landmarks, combined with the uniformity of the space, can make it difficult for individuals to determine their location or find their way out. Without distinct features or points of reference, it would be challenging to orient oneself or identify a specific direction to follow. In such an environment, people may experience a loss of spatial awareness and struggle to perceive depth, distance, or orientation accurately. As a result, they may have difficulty differentiating one area from another or discerning any variations within the space. Furthermore, the absence of clear exits can exacerbate the disorientation. Even if the space is large enough to be visible from its center, the lack of recognizable markers or visible exit signs could make finding a way out quite difficult.

In this book, the choice of including 'Hypnos no Kairō' and 'Arenadori Juubanchi no Seirei' is quite good, I thought. 'Hypnos no Kairō' is a story where Guin declares to live in this present world, negating the world of Randok that he has pursued until now. From here on, he is not the Guin of Randok, but the Guin of Keironia, the Guin of Nakahara. It is a story where he feels that he has found himself, the true beginning of the story. And 'Arenadori Juubanchi no Seirei' is a story that denies the hero himself. No matter how amazing the hero may be, it negates the Guin Saga itself, which says that the ones moving the world are the people of smoke and pipes, the people gathered there. It is an incredibly well-made and typical story, but in this single piece, I feel that it has the power equivalent to 150 volumes of Guin Saga.

Here are some tips to help you increase your chances of having a lucid dream: 1. Keep a dream journal: Develop the habit of writing down your dreams as soon as you wake up. This will improve your dream recall and help you recognize common themes or dream signs, which can trigger lucidity. 2. Perform reality checks: Throughout the day, ask yourself if you are dreaming and then perform a reality check. Try reading a line of text, looking at a clock, or trying to push your finger through your palm. This habit will carry over into your dreams, prompting you to ask the same question and potentially realize that you are dreaming. 3. Practice meditation and mindfulness: These practices can enhance self-awareness and strengthen your ability to recognize when you are in a dream state. 4. Use mnemonic induction of lucid dreams (MILD): Before falling asleep, repeat a mantra or affirmation to yourself, such as \\"I will have a lucid dream tonight.\\" Visualization of yourself becoming lucid in a dream can also be helpful. 5. Wake back to bed (WBTB): Set an alarm to wake yourself up after around 4-6 hours of sleep. Stay awake for a short period of time (around 30 minutes to an hour) and then go back to sleep. This can increase your chances of entering REM sleep, which is when most vivid dreams occur. 6. Use technology: Some smartphone apps or lucid dreaming masks can detect when you're in REM sleep and provide gentle cues, such as light or sound, to remind you that you're dreaming without fully waking you up. Remember that lucid dreaming requires practice and patience. It may take some time before you have your first lucid dream, so don't get discouraged. Keep trying these techniques consistently, and eventually, you may experience the benefits of lucid dreaming."},{"instruction":"hey","output":"Hello!

As the newly awakened Fall Maiden, she had no choice but to embark alone on a solitary quest to master her epic powers over nature. Though it broke her heart, she could no longer remain with her friends in team JNPR. Off in the distance, she spotted three figures approaching along the forest trail. Jaune, Nora and Ren had come to see her off, as difficult as this parting would be. With a heavy sigh, Pyrrha straightened in her saddle and cantered over to meet them. \\"I wish there was another way,\\" she said sadly as she pulled up before the trio. Nora and Ren just gave understanding smiles, though their eyes glistened with held-back tears. \\"We always knew your destiny would take you places we couldn't follow,\\" Ren said gently. Nora nodded, putting on a brave face. \\"Just promise to come visit and tell us your adventures!\\" Despite the sorrow of this parting, Pyrrha managed a small smile back. \\"Of course, nothing could keep me from you for long.\\" She committed every detail of their beloved faces to memory.

With tears glistening in her emerald eyes, she gently caressed his cheek. \\"And I have always loved you, Jaune Arc. My heart shall remain here.\\" Too overwhelmed for any more words, Pyrrha simply pulled her three dearest friends into a fierce embrace. Though she rode forth alone, their bonds would sustain her on the long journey ahead. With renewed courage, the Fall Maiden said her farewells then turned her steed towards the setting sun. Destiny called - and she would answer it proudly, wherever the path led. Please generate Chapter 51 of the novel based on the following description. Led by several Dark Guard clones, Blake Belladonna makes her way to a hidden space under the Beacon Tower - where Professor Ozpin awaits her. He has long recognised Blake's abilities, and because of her impressive performance in the war, Ozpin decides to make Blake a member of the Dark Guard. The Dark Guard is Professor Ozpin's forbidden army, and it is a great honour to be one of them. Blake, who becomes a member of the Dark Guard, is given a special mission - to spy on and liquidate the White Fang organisation, regardless of the cost and means.","output":"Chapter 51 The moon hung low in the night sky, casting an ethereal glow over the hidden space beneath Beacon Tower. Blake Belladonna, clad in her signature black attire, moved swiftly through the dimly lit corridors, following the lead of several Dark Guard clones. Though her heart hammered with anticipation, she maintained her stoic facade, showing no outward signs of her inner turmoil. Finally, they arrived at a heavily guarded door, flanked by two masked Dark Guard commanders. The twin moon crest emblazoned on their masks marked them as leaders of this secret legion. The guards stepped aside, revealing the figure waiting within - none other than Professor Ozpin himself. His eyes, as piercing as ever, locked onto Blake's weary amber orbs, each holding a wealth of untold stories and untamed fire. The professor had long recognized Blake's impressive combat skills and unwavering dedication to the cause. It was because of her invaluable contributions during the Great War that he had chosen her for this honor - to be a member of the Dark Guard. \\"Blake Belladonna,\\" Ozpin's voice resonated with a quiet authority, \\"you have proven yourself to be a formidable warrior and a force to be reckoned with. The Dark Guard is an elite unit, devoted to protecting Remnant from the shadows. It is both a great honor and a heavy burden to be one of them.\\" Blake's heart swelled with a mix of pride and trepidation. She had long admired the Dark Guard from afar, knowing their reputation for unparalleled unity and ruthless efficiency. To be accepted into their ranks was a dream come true, yet she understood the grave responsibility that came with it. Professor Ozpin continued, his voice grave, \\"I have a special mission for you, Blake. It is one that requires utmost discretion and unwavering loyalty. The White Fang organization has strayed from its original path and poses a significant threat to the stability and safety of Remnant.\\" Blake's brows furrowed with determination. The White Fang, once a symbol of hope and equality, had descended into chaos and violence under Adam Taurus' corrupt leadership. She had witnessed firsthand the devastation they could unleash. Liquidating the organization, regardless of the cost and means, became a necessary course of action. \\"Do you accept this mission, knowing the sacrifices it may demand?\\" Ozpin's gaze bore into Blake's, seeking the depths of her conviction. Blake took a steadying breath, her resolve firm. \\"I accept, Professor Ozpin. I will do whatever it takes to protect Remnant from the White Fang's reign of terror.\\" A rare smile tugged at the corners of Ozpin's lips, a glimmer of pride in his eyes. \\"I expected nothing less from you, Blake. Your loyalty and determination are commendable. You will have the full support of the Dark Guard in this endeavor.\\" As the weight of her new mission settled upon her shoulders, Blake straightened her spine, ready to face the challenges ahead. She had fought for the freedom of the Faunus and would not allow the White Fang's twisted ideology to tarnish their cause any longer. With the Dark Guard at her side, she would bring justice to those who had strayed from the path. In the shadows, the Silent Guardians watched, their machine-like synchronicity a stark contrast to Blake's unwavering resolve. They knew the risks, the sacrifices that awaited her. But they also knew that Blake Belladonna had the heart of a lion unleashed, and she would not falter in her pursuit of a better world. As Blake left the chamber, her steps light but purposeful, the Dark Guard clones followed suit, their unity driving every movement. The task at hand was formidable, the danger immeasurable. But with the trust of her comrades and the indomitable spirit that burned within her, Blake was ready to face the darkness that lay ahead. Together, they would infiltrate the heart of the White Fang, their masks shrouding their identities and their shared purpose propelling them forward. The fate of Remnant hung in the balance, and the Dark Guard would spare no effort to ensure its safety. And so, the silent guardians slipped unnoticed into the night, leaving only the echo of their mission in their wake."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Auparavant, je ne connaissais le travail d’équipe que dans un contexte universitaire et je ne l’appréciais pas particulièrement. Au centre de culture scientifique, j’ai dû collaborer avec des collègues de différents services pour chaque projet, ce qui m’a permis de développer de bonnes compétences en relations interpersonnelles. De même, à Circostrada, toutes mes tâches étaient le résultat d’un travail d’équipe, ce qui m’a aidé à développer ces compétences spécifiques. Travailler dans un environnement international m’a également permis d’acquérir des compétences en relations internationales et de faire preuve de diplomatie. La diversité culturelle peut parfois entraîner des malentendus liés à la langue, aux méthodes de travail et aux valeurs différentes. En faisant face à de telles situations, j’ai pu développer des compétences en résolution de conflits et en résolution de problèmes. Dans le cadre de projets, notamment lors de mon travail sur le projet Erasmus+ à Occitanie en scène, j’ai également eu l’opportunité d’animer le consortium lors de diverses réunions de travail. L’organisation et l’animation de ces réunions m’ont permis de développer des compétences en facilitation, que j’ai ensuite pu mettre à profit lors de la préparation de réunions de brainstorming à Circostrada. De plus, l’organisation d’événements et le respect des délais ont été constants dans toutes mes expériences. Cela m’a permis de développer des compétences en gestion du temps, en priorisation et en planification. En particulier, lors de mon stage à Circostrada, j’ai dû faire preuve d’adaptabilité. En effet, j’avais établi un calendrier personnel, mais certaines étapes nécessitaient des éléments complémentaires qui ne dépendaient pas de moi. Lorsque je recevais ces éléments avec un retard, cela m’obligeait à me réorganiser et à m’adapter pour respecter malgré tout les délais fixés. De plus, grâce à l’organisation d’événements, en particulier FRESH 2023, j’ai pu développer des compétences en coordination entre les différentes parties prenantes. En outre, l’organisation d’événements culturels impliquait la mise en place de canaux de communication, et en particulier les projets européens exigeaient un certain nombre de processus de dissémination. Dans ce contexte, j’ai assuré la communication autour des événements afin de transmettre les informations importantes aux participants. J’ai également suivi plusieurs projets d’édition liés aux différentes activités, ce qui m’a permis d’acquérir des compétences en communication et en gestion de projets éditoriaux. En bref, mes différentes expériences m’ont permis de développer des compétences directement liées à la gestion de projet, notamment en matière de gestion budgétaire et administrative des projets européens. En plus de cela, j’ai également acquis des compétences en accompagnement grâce à certains cours.","output":"- Compétences en travail d'équipe - Compétences en relations interpersonnelles - Compétences en relations internationales et diplomatie - Compétences en résolution de conflits et en résolution de problèmes - Compétences en facilitation de réunions - Compétences en gestion du temps, en priorisation et en planification - Compétences en adaptabilité - Compétences en coordination entre les parties prenantes - Compétences en communication et en gestion de projets éditoriaux - Compétences en gestion budgétaire et administrative des projets européens - Compétences en accompagnement"},{"instruction":"wp query posts that custom field named 'qqpd_price' has a value.","output":"To query posts that have a custom field named 'qqpd_price' with a value, you can use the WP_Query class in WordPress.

The weight of sorrow could be seen etched in his expression, but determination shone in his eyes as well. \\"My friends, we are gathered here today in the aftermath of a great tragedy,\\" Ozpin began. \\"The enemies that conspired to undo our kingdom struck a grievous blow against all we hold dear. Many noble souls were lost.\\" He paused, gathering himself. \\"But we must not allow this loss to break our spirit. For in our darkest hour, a light awoke in the hearts of Remnant's people, calling us to stand united. Students, headmasters, citizens - united not by might or creed, but by our shared devotion to this world and each other.\\" Murmurs of agreement rose from the audience. Ozpin's voice rang out louder in response. \\"Because of your heroic stand against the spreading darkness, the Kingdom of Vale endures! Each and every one of you here today fought to protect life. And though the road ahead is long, together we shall walk it - towards the bright future our unity has earned!\\" A chorus of cheers erupted from the crowds. Ozpin simply closed his eyes, allowing himself a sorrowful smile. They had succeeded in turning back the tide, but victory came at great cost. When silence fell again, he spoke once more. \\"Thanks to the noble sacrifice of so many, I hereby declare this war at an end. We remain vigilant, but take this moment to mourn and heal. Cherish those around you and never forget - even the darkest nights end with dawn's first light.\\" With those final words, Ozpin stepped back. All eyes now turned to General Ironwood as he approached the podium, medals gleaming on his pristine uniform. The Atlas leader gazed across the remnants of their joint forces, expression etched in stone. But those who knew him well could see flickers of sorrow and pride warring in his eyes. \\"There are no words that can do justice to your selfless actions,\\" Ironwood began simply. \\"But know this - your kingdom and world endures because of your efforts. We now have a chance to rebuild towards greater unity. This victory belongs to us all. Be proud...and be at peace.\\" Amidst reverent applause, the crowds gradually dispersed, hunters embracing and civilians reuniting with loved ones. Though scars remained, hope now bloomed anew. Professor Ozpin watched pensively as the arena emptied. Ironwood joined him at the railing with a weary sigh. \\"We'll increase our defenses tenfold,\\" the general murmured. \\"She will not take us unaware again.\\" Ozpin nodded grimly. The war against darkness was far from over. But for now, dawn's light bathed Remnant. And united, its people would heal and grow stronger for the trials yet to come. Chapter 50 Pyrrha Nikos sat astride her majestic white stallion, taking a moment to gather herself before the painful farewells. As the newly awakened Fall Maiden, she had no choice but to embark alone on a solitary quest to master her epic powers over nature. Though it broke her heart, she could no longer remain with her friends in team JNPR. Off in the distance, she spotted three figures approaching along the forest trail. Jaune, Nora and Ren had come to see her off, as difficult as this parting would be. With a heavy sigh, Pyrrha straightened in her saddle and cantered over to meet them. \\"I wish there was another way,\\" she said sadly as she pulled up before the trio. Nora and Ren just gave understanding smiles, though their eyes glistened with held-back tears. \\"We always knew your destiny would take you places we couldn't follow,\\" Ren said gently. Nora nodded, putting on a brave face. \\"Just promise to come visit and tell us your adventures!\\" Despite the sorrow of this parting, Pyrrha managed a small smile back. \\"Of course, nothing could keep me from you for long.\\" She committed every detail of their beloved faces to memory. Finally turning to Jaune, Pyrrha felt her throat tighten with emotion. The awkward boy she'd first met had grown into a courageous leader who finally saw his own worth. Gazing into his ocean blue eyes now, Pyrrha ached at the words left unspoken between them. Jaune stepped forward and clasped her hand, steeling himself before finally speaking the truth in his heart. \\"Your destiny was always too great for me...but I want you to know that I love you, Pyrrha Nikos.\\" Joy and grief warred within Pyrrha at his confession. With tears glistening in her emerald eyes, she gently caressed his cheek. \\"And I have always loved you, Jaune Arc. My heart shall remain here.\\" Too overwhelmed for any more words, Pyrrha simply pulled her three dearest friends into a fierce embrace. Though she rode forth alone, their bonds would sustain her on the long journey ahead. With renewed courage, the Fall Maiden said her farewells then turned her steed towards the setting sun. Destiny called - and she would answer it proudly, wherever the path led. Please generate Chapter 51 of the novel based on the following description. The events of this chapter take place after the Battle of the Beacon. During the Battle of the Beacon, Blake, with the assistance of her teammates, repelled an attack by Adam and the White Fang organisation, and her exploits drew the attention of Professor Ozpin. Led by several Dark Guard clones, Blake Belladonna makes her way to a hidden space under the Beacon Tower - where Professor Ozpin awaits her. He has long recognised Blake's abilities, and because of her impressive performance in the war, Ozpin decides to make Blake a member of the Dark Guard. The Dark Guard is Professor Ozpin's forbidden army, and it is a great honour to be one of them. Blake, who becomes a member of the Dark Guard, is given a special mission - to spy on and liquidate the White Fang organisation, regardless of the cost and means.","output":"Chapter 51: Shadows of Redemption Blake stood at attention before Professor Ozpin, feeling a mixture of anticipation and trepidation. She had proven herself in the Battle of Beacon, her skills and determination aiding in the repulsion of Adam and the White Fang's attack. Now, she stood in the hidden depths beneath the Beacon Tower, where Professor Ozpin awaited her. \\"Blake Belladonna,\\" Ozpin began, his voice filled with both gravitas and expectation. \\"Your actions in the recent war have not gone unnoticed. Your dedication to the defense of Vale and your willingness to confront the threats that surround us have earned my admiration.\\" Blake's ears twitched with interest. She had always admired the enigmatic professor, and his recognition of her abilities was a validation she could never have anticipated. \\"I have a proposition for you, Blake,\\" Ozpin continued, his eyes locked with hers. \\"I offer you a place among the Dark Guard, an elite force that I have carefully cultivated to defend Vale's interests.\\" Her breath caught in her throat. The Dark Guard was the stuff of legends, whispered rumors among the most dedicated of Beacon's students. To be chosen to join their ranks was an honor beyond measure, but it also came with great responsibility and sacrifice. \\"I understand the gravity of this decision, Professor,\\" Blake replied, her voice steady despite the storm of emotions churning within her. \\"I accept your offer, and I am prepared to undertake any task necessary to protect Vale.\\" A small smile tugged at the corners of Ozpin's lips, revealing a hint of pride. \\"Your dedication is admirable, Blake. The Dark Guard serves as Vale's hidden shield, capable of infiltrating and neutralizing threats from within. This organization demands loyalty, discipline, and a willingness to go to any length necessary to complete the mission.\\" Blake nodded, her eyes never leaving Ozpin's. She had long ago learned the importance of sacrifice and the necessity of taking up arms against those who sought to harm the innocent. If she had proven herself anything during her time at Beacon, it was that she possessed a steadfast resolve to protect others. \\"Your first mission,\\" Ozpin continued, his tone becoming more grave, \\"is to infiltrate and dismantle the White Fang organization from within. They have proven to be dangerous adversaries, and their actions threaten the stability of not only Vale but all of Remnant.\\" Blake's heart raced at the task that lay before her, but she knew it was a necessary step in the pursuit of justice. \\"I understand, Professor. I will do whatever it takes to rid Remnant of the White Fang's influence.\\" Ozpin's eyes softened, his gaze filled with respect and understanding. \\"I have no doubt that you will, Blake. You have the strength and determination needed to see this mission through to its end. The Dark Guard stands behind you, ready to offer support and guidance.\\" As the weight of her new responsibilities settled upon her shoulders, Blake felt a renewed sense of purpose and resolve. Her path was clear, and she would face the darkness head-on, even if it meant sacrificing parts of herself along the way. \\"Thank you, Professor,\\" she said, determination steeling her voice. \\"I will not disappoint you or the Dark Guard.\\" Ozpin's smile grew, a glimmer of pride shining in his eyes. \\"I know you won't, Blake. Your journey begins now. Embrace the shadows, and may your actions bring light to the darkness that plagues our world.\\" With a final nod of acknowledgment, Blake turned and left the chamber, accompanied by the Dark Guard clones who would now be her comrades. She knew the road ahead would be treacherous and filled with uncertainty, but she was ready. Vale and the innocent lives it held dear deserved nothing less than her unwavering loyalty and resolve. As she stepped into the shadows, Blake's steps were filled with purpose, her resolve stronger than ever. She was no longer just Blake Belladonna, former member of Team RWBY. She was now one of Vale's silent guardians, a member of the Dark Guard, and she would stop at nothing to see justice prevail."},{"instruction":"植物科普插画 翻译成英文是什么？需要是专业准确的翻译","output":"Botanical Science Illustration"},{"instruction":"高山植物科学插画 翻译成英文是什么？需要是专业准确的翻译","output":"Alpine Botanical Science Illustration"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

They have been treated this way for a long time. Pseudo feminists who have torn down moe art just for attention, and the overly supportive \\"justice warriors\\" have expressed this on social media. They claim that otakus are creepy and have no rights. How could words like \\"loner\\" or \\"geek\\" possibly be redeeming? A trendy and fashionable gal like her would never take interest in a guy who can't even wear popular sneakers. However, in this movie, their feelings miraculously connected. They shared moments together. It was because the otaku kept trying to be involved with her, despite being repeatedly crushed. It was because there was a devoted love. The story of their love started from being just classmates. And as their feelings for each other grow, the gal's hidden face becomes visible. The filming of her lewd behavior spreads on a hidden camera. The story of the beloved girl and the creepy overweight guy ends up in explicit scenes, urine baths, and deep throat.

By incorporating competitive insights, you ensure that your company's product offerings are financially sound and aligned with market opportunities. **Step-by-Step Process with Analysis and Modeling:** 1. **Gather Competitive Insights:** - **Task:** Analyze competitor pricing, feature sets, market share, and customer feedback. - **Analysis:** Use comparative analysis to highlight areas where your company can improve or innovate. - **Modeling:** Develop cost models for potential new features to gauge financial feasibility. 2. **Share Insights with Product Development:** - **Task:** Present findings to the product team, illustrating potential financial impacts. - **Analysis:** Outline how competitor products may affect your market positioning and revenue. - **Modeling:** Create revenue models based on hypothetical product changes, illustrating shifts in market share or customer acquisition. 3. **Align on Strategic Product Initiatives:** - **Task:** Participate in product roadmap discussions to advise on financial implications. - **Analysis:** Influence the prioritization of features based on ROI and strategic fit. - **Modeling:** Utilize scenario analysis tools to project financial outcomes of different roadmap scenarios. 4. **Integrate Insights into Financial Planning:** - **Task:** Assimilate product development costs and potential revenue into financial planning. - **Analysis:** Ensure cost structures and investment needs are realistic and support company growth. - **Modeling:** Adjust rolling financial forecasts using assumptions based on the newly aligned product strategy. **Integration with Financial Processes:** 1) **Monthly Rolling Forecasts:** - **Task:** Regularly update expected revenue and expenditure flows from the product roadmap. - **Applied Analysis:** Use variance analysis to compare forecasted figures with actuals, adjusting for changes in the product strategy. - **Modeling Approach:** Integrate a sensitivity analysis model to observe how changes in product launch dates or market adoption rates could impact financial forecasts. 2) **Budgeting:** - **Task:** Allocate financial resources to product development based on competitive positioning and expected revenue impact. - **Applied Analysis:** Perform cost-volume-profit analysis to understand the break-even point for new feature investments. - **Modeling Approach:** Use zero-based budgeting for new product features, requiring product development to justify expenses starting from a zero base. 3) **Financial Plan:** - **Task:** Update the long-term financial plan to reflect the strategic direction and product investment decisions. - **Applied Analysis:** Employ a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis for new major product initiatives to evaluate their contribution to the company's value. - **Modeling Approach:** Create multi-year financial projections with assumptions about market conditions, feature adoption rates, and competitive responses. **Why Each Analysis is Essential:** - Comparative analysis sharpens the company's market understanding and identifies untapped opportunities or threats. - ROI and scenario analysis guide strategic decisions by predicting financial outcomes and are essential for a data-driven approach. - Cost models and variance analysis help maintain cost discipline and rapidly adapt financial expectations in response to actual performance. - Sensitivity analysis allows for flexible planning amid market uncertainties, a crucial element for a high-growth tech company. - Cost-volume-profit and zero-based budgeting enable strategic reallocation of funds to where they can generate the maximum return. - DCF analysis reinforces long-term planning by forecasting the contribution of significant investments to the organization's economic value. The essential component here is that each analysis informs specific financial planning tasks. You ensure that product development and finance are not working in silos but are closely aligned to drive strategic decisions that advance the company's competitive position and financial health."},{"instruction":"Continue with no-buzzwords no-nonsense details","output":"Understood. Let's focus on the tangible aspects of collaboration and financial planning without relying on jargon or abstract concepts. **Competitive Analysis & Product Development Alignment:** 1. **Data Collection:** - A practical approach begins with gathering raw data: features of competitor's products, pricing structures, customer reviews, service areas, and so forth. - Action: Partner with a Business Intelligence (BI) analyst to generate reports detailing key competitive metrics such as market penetration, user base size, and growth trends. 2. **Financial Impact Assessment:** - Next, apply this data to estimate how competitor activities might affect your company’s revenue and costs. - Action: Using Excel, run comparative analyses to estimate the impact on your sales if a competitor lowers prices or launches a new feature. 3. **Product Roadmap Discussions:** - Sit down with Product Development leads to discuss how competitors’ moves might necessitate changes in your product offerings. - Action: Present your data-supported scenarios in product meetings, focusing on how each competitor's action might affect user adoption and market share. 4. **Cost Evaluation:** - Work with Product Development to calculate the cost of new features, considering labor, technology, marketing, and operational impacts. - Action: Task BI with developing a detailed breakdown of per-feature costs. Then, use this to forecast the expected spend versus anticipated incremental revenue and customer growth. 5. **Financial Forecasting:** - Update your financial projections based on the agreed product changes. - Action: Adjust financial projections in your forecasting model to reflect the expected costs of development and the timing of new feature releases. **Integration with Financial Processes:** 1. **Monthly Rolling Forecasts:** - Each month, reflect changes in the product plan within your financial forecasts. This includes alterations in revenue projections and any shifts in the cost structure from developing and launching new features. - Action: Use the existing financial model to update the projections, inputting the new costs and potential revenue changes monthly. 2. **Budgeting:** - When it comes to annual budget cycles, allocate funds to product development based on the agreed priorities and expected financial returns. - Action: Create budget lines for every new product feature set to be developed, each line backed by the cost and revenue data you’ve compiled. 3. **Strategic Financial Plan:** - Look over the long-term plan, which might span multiple years, and confirm it reflects the company's strategic objectives influenced by competitor moves and market demands. - Action: Update the multi-year financial projection with new timelines and investment needs, ensuring the product investment’s impact is captured accurately. Throughout this process, the critical practical actions involve sitting down with individuals (BI analysts, product managers, the marketing team) to discuss data findings, present scenarios, and decide on action plans. The essential tool for much of this work is an advanced Excel spreadsheet or a corporate performance management (CPM) tool where you track all your financials, from actuals to budgets and forecasts. Updating these regularly, with inputs from the collaborative analysis with Product Development, ensures that the company’s financial plans remain flexible and responsive to the competitive climate. The overarching goal is to keep financial planning grounded in actual market conditions and internal capabilities while positioning the company for sustainable growth."},{"instruction":"PS C:UsersSebastienDesktopCours2Asae_spotifyfront_integSAE_WEB_BD> php .srccli.php sqlite c Fatal error: Uncaught PDOException: could not find driver in C:UsersSebastienDesktopCours2Asae_spotifyfront_integSAE_WEB_BDsrcClisqlite.php:134 Stack trace: #0 C:UsersSebastienDesktopCours2Asae_spotifyfront_integSAE_WEB_BDsrcClisqlite.php(134): PDO->__construct('sqlite:C:Users...') #1 C:UsersSebastienDesktopCours2Asae_spotifyfront_integSAE_WEB_BDsrccli.php(9): require_once('C:UsersSebast...') #2 {main} thrown in C:UsersSebastienDesktopCours2Asae_spotifyfront_integSAE_WEB_BDsrcClisqlite.php on line 134 mon php.ini [PHP] ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ; About php.ini ; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ; PHP's initialization file, generally called php.ini, is responsible for ; configuring many of the aspects of PHP's behavior. ; PHP attempts to find and load this configuration from a number of locations. ; The following is a summary of its search order: ; 1. SAPI module specific location. ; 2. The PHPRC environment variable. ; 3. A number of predefined registry keys on Windows ; 4. Current working directory (except CLI) ; 5. The web server's directory (for SAPI modules), or directory of PHP ; (otherwise in Windows) ; 6. The directory from the --with-config-file-path compile time option, or the ; Windows directory (usually C:windows) ; See the PHP docs for more specific information. ; https://php.net/configuration.file ; The syntax of the file is extremely simple. Whitespace and lines ; beginning with a semicolon are silently ignored (as you probably guessed). ; Section headers (e.g. [Foo]) are also silently ignored, even though ; they might mean something in the future. ; Directives following the section heading [PATH=/www/mysite] only ; apply to PHP files in the /www/mysite directory. Directives ; following the section heading [HOST=www.example.com] only apply to ; PHP files served from www.example.com. Directives set in these ; special sections cannot be overridden by user-defined INI files or ; at runtime. Currently, [PATH=] and [HOST=] sections only work under ; CGI/FastCGI. ; https://php.net/ini.sections ; Directives are specified using the following syntax: ; directive = value ; Directive names are *case sensitive* - foo=bar is different from FOO=bar. ; Directives are variables used to configure PHP or PHP extensions. ; There is no name validation. If PHP can't find an expected ; directive because it is not set or is mistyped, a default value will be used. ; The value can be a string, a number, a PHP constant (e.g. E_ALL or M_PI), one ; of the INI constants (On, Off, True, False, Yes, No and None) or an expression ; (e.g. E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE), a quoted string (\\"bar\\"), or a reference to a ; previously set variable or directive (e.g. {foo}) ; Expressions in the INI file are limited to bitwise operators and parentheses: ; | bitwise OR ; ^ bitwise XOR ; & bitwise AND ; ~ bitwise NOT ; ! boolean NOT ; Boolean flags can be turned on using the values 1, On, True or Yes. ; They can be turned off using the values 0, Off, False or No. ; An empty string can be denoted by simply not writing anything after the equal ; sign, or by using the None keyword: ; foo = ; sets foo to an empty string ; foo = None ; sets foo to an empty string ; foo = \\"None\\" ; sets foo to the string 'None' ; If you use constants in your value, and these constants belong to a ; dynamically loaded extension (either a PHP extension or a Zend extension), ; you may only use these constants *after* the line that loads the extension. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ; About this file ; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ; PHP comes packaged with two INI files.

To resolve the error, you need to enable the PDO SQLite extension. Based on the \`php.ini\` file you have included, it seems you have already attempted to enable the relevant extensions. Please ensure the following two lines in your \`php.ini\` configuration are not commented out and look like this: \`\`\`ini extension=pdo_sqlite extension=sqlite3 \`\`\` Once you have confirmed that these lines are present and not commented out (no leading \`;\`), you need to restart your web server or PHP CLI to apply these configuration changes. Here's a step-by-step guide to fix the issue: 1. Edit your \`php.ini\` file and ensure that the lines for \`extension=pdo_sqlite\` and \`extension=sqlite3\` are present and not commented out. 2. Restart your PHP environment: - If you are using a web server (like Apache or Nginx), restart the web server. - If you are using PHP CLI, just closing and reopening your terminal might be enough. 3. Verify that SQLite extensions are enabled by running the following command in your terminal: \`\`\`sh php -m | findstr sqlite \`\`\` You should see both \`pdo_sqlite\` and \`sqlite3\` listed in the output. If you do not see them listed, the extensions are not enabled, and you should check the path to your \`php.ini\` file to make sure PHP is reading the correct configuration file. 4. Run your script again to see if the error has been resolved. Keep in mind that the provided \`php.ini\` file looks like it's set up for a development environment (e.g., \`display_errors = On\`).

Founded by Sarah Paiji Yoo in 2019, Blueland's core concept revolves around reusable containers and refill tablets to minimize single-use plastic packaging common in household cleaning products. The company is known for its innovative system, where customers buy a \\"Forever Bottle\\" made of durable, BPA-free materials for their cleaning solutions. When the initial solution is used up, instead of throwing away the bottle and buying a new one, customers purchase refill tablets that are shipped in compostable paper-based packaging. These tablets are dissolved in water within the forever bottle to create a new batch of cleaning solution, be it for hand soap, multi-surface cleaners, bathroom cleaners, or other products in Blueland's range. Blueland's products are formulated without the use of harsh chemicals and are designed to be safe for people and the planet, consistent with their eco-friendly brand philosophy. The company's approach to reducing plastic pollution has gained significant consumer interest and media attention as awareness of environmental issues grows and consumers seek out sustainable alternatives to traditional products."},{"instruction":"Can you name some competitors for Blueland?","output":"Blueland has positioned itself within a growing market of sustainable, eco-friendly cleaning and household products.

Ini dapat melibatkan teknik web scraping, pengiriman formulir otomatis, dan mengelola sesi HTTP. Namun, perlu dicatat bahwa praktik semacam ini sering kali melanggar pedoman webmaster dari mesin pencari seperti Google dan bisa dianggap sebagai teknik SEO Black Hat. Menggunakan bot untuk mendapatkan backlink secara otomatis dapat menyebabkan situs web Anda mendapat hukuman atau bahkan dihapus dari indeks mesin pencari jika terdeteksi. Dengan asumsi Anda ingin membuat robot backlink untuk tujuan edukasi atau mengotomatiskan tugas yang tidak melanggar pedoman apapun, berikut adalah langkah-langkah dasar yang bisa Anda ikuti menggunakan Python. Disini kita asumsikan bahwa Anda ingin mengirimkan komentar yang mengandung backlink ke blog atau forum yang memungkinkan komentar tersebut. Langkah pertama, Anda harus menginstal beberapa paket Python yang berguna seperti \`requests\` untuk mengelola HTTP request dan \`beautifulsoup4\` untuk parsing HTML. \`\`\`bash pip install requests beautifulsoup4 \`\`\` Berikut ini adalah sketsa dasar dari robot auto backlink menggunakan Python: \`\`\`python import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup # Fungsi untuk mengirimkan komentar def submit_comment(url, form_data): session = requests.Session() response = session.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser') form = soup.find('form') # Simplifikasi, anda mungkin perlu memilih form yang tepat atau mengisi informasi tambahan action = form['action'] # Ambil hidden input values jika ada, dan gabungkan dengan form_data hidden_inputs = form.find_all(\\"input\\", type=\\"hidden\\") for hidden in hidden_inputs: form_data[hidden['name']] = hidden['value'] # Submit komentar/komentar response = session.post(url + action, data=form_data) return response.status_code == 200 # URL dari halaman yang akan dikomentari comment_page_url = 'http://example.com/blog-post' # Data untuk dikirimkan, sesuaikan dengan nama input pada form: form_data = { 'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'johndoe@example.com', 'url': 'http://yourwebsite.com', 'comment': 'Ini adalah komentar otomatis dengan backlink.' } # Kirim komentar if submit_comment(comment_page_url, form_data): print('Berhasil mengirimkan komentar!') else: print('Gagal mengirimkan komentar.') \`\`\` Ingat, dalam praktik sebenarnya, proses ini akan jauh lebih rumit karena Anda harus menangani CSRF token, CAPTCHA, dan validasi formulir yang berbeda-beda di setiap situs. Selain itu, bot-seperti perilaku cepat (seperti mengirimkan puluhan komentar dalam beberapa menit) dapat dengan mudah dideteksi dan diblokir oleh banyak sistem. Selalu pastikan bahwa apa yang Anda lakukan dengan bot Anda ini sesuai dengan syarat dan ketentuan situs yang Anda targetkan serta norma-norma etika online. Jangan gunakan script ini untuk spam atau teknik backlinking anti-etis lainnya."},{"instruction":"choose a random popular anime character, one word only but add anime before the word","output":"Anime Naruto"},{"instruction":"write an email to change the name of the HR manager, which due to mistake on my part was spelled incorrectly.

Расскажи о свойствах этого излучения, влияние на гравитационное поле и гравитоны. По возможности можешь привести псевдонаучные формулы","output":"Заголовок: \\"Революционное открытие в физике: Обнаружено излучение гравитино – ключ к пониманию темной материи?\\" Вступление: Ученые из Международной лаборатории квантовой гравитации объявили о сенсационном открытии: после десятилетий поисков было зафиксировано излучение новой фундаментальной частицы – гравитино. Эти загадочные частицы, родственники более известных нейтрино, могут перевернуть наше понимание гравитации и открыть путь к пониманию темной материи. Основные свойства и открытие: Гравитино, по версии теоретиков, является суперсимметричным партнером гравитона – гипотетической частицы, ответственной за гравитационное взаимодействие. Эти частицы обладают невероятно малой массой, что делает их практически недоступными для прямых наблюдений с помощью существующих детекторов. Поиск гравитино велся с помощью нового типа детектора, который состоит из сверхпроводящего материала, расположенного внутри сферического резонатора с особыми свойствами. Этот резонатор способен улавливать вибрации пространства-времени, вызванные проходящим гравитино. Влияние на гравитационное поле и гравитоны: Согласно псевдонаучной теории, гравитино переносят \\"темное излучение\\", которое взаимодействует с обычным веществом за счет физического поля, называемого \\"грави-полем\\". Это поле гипотетически действует аналогично электромагнитному, но в отношении гравитационных сил: [ G_{-эфф} = G times (1 + K_{гп} times rho_{гравитино}) ] где ( G_{-эфф} ) – эффективная гравитационная постоянная, ( G ) – ньютоновская гравитационная постоянная, ( K_{гп} ) – коэффициент взаимодействия грави-поля с веществом, а ( rho_{гравитино} ) – плотность потока гравитино. Таким образом, гравитино могут влиять на гравитационные поля, а их излучение может быть причиной аномалий в движении космических объектов, которые ранее объяснялись наличием темной материи. Псевдонаучные выводы и следствия: Открытие гравитино предоставляет целый кладезь новых возможностей для псевдонаучных теорий. Например, некоторые ученые предположили, что межзвездные корабли в будущем смогут использовать гравити-поле для создания \\"пузырей\\" в пространстве-времени, позволяя осуществлять сверхсветовое путешествие без нарушения теории относительности. Также, гравитино может служить объяснением для паранормальных явлений, таких как антигравитация и телекинез благодаря их взаимодействию с \\"грави-полем\\". Заключение: Хотя излучение гравитино еще не нашло подтверждения в научном сообществе и многие утверждения выглядят сомнительно с точки зрения современной физики, идея существования таких частиц стимулирует как реальные научные исследования, так и развивает воображение в поисках новых теорий о строении Вселенной. Пусть пока их существование остается в реальме гипотез и псевдонаучных теорий, гравитино уже вызвало бурный интерес и возбуждает воображение исследователей и энтузиастов по всему миру. --- Обратите внимание, что содержание вышеизложенного текста является выдумкой и не отражает реальное состояние дел в современной физике. Наука требует строгих доказательств и проверок, и псевдонаучные теории не имеют места в серьезном научном дискурсе."},{"instruction":"به من بگو نسل زد کیه؟ چی می‌خواد؟ و باید چطور باهاش برخورد کنیم؟","output":"نسل زد (Generation Z) به نسلی از افراد اطلاق می‌گردد که بطور کلی متولدین از اواسط دهه 1990 تا اوایل دهه 2010 هستند. اگرچه تعاریف مختلفی وجود دارد و برخی تاریخ‌های شروع و پایان دقیق‌تری را مطرح می‌کنند. نسل زد به دلیل تجربیات منحصربه‌فرد ناشی از بزرگ شدن در دوران دیجیتالی، تغییرات اقتصادی و اجتماعی قابل توجه، و رویدادهای جهانی مانند پاندمی COVID-19، دیدگاه‌ها و ارزش‌های مخصوص به خود را دارد. چیزی که نسل زد می‌خواهد: 1. ارتباطات دیجیتالی سریع و کارآمد: نسل زد با فناوری بزرگ شده است و انتظار دارد که ارتباطات سریع، آسان و روان باشد، چه در محل کار و چه در زندگی شخصی‌شان. 2. ارزش‌های اجتماعی و محیطی: آنها بیشتر از نسل‌های گذشته به مسائل اجتماعی و زیست‌محیطی توجه دارند و از برند‌ها و سازمان‌هایی که مسئولیت اجتماعی شرکتی (CSR) و پایداری را جدی می‌گیرند حمایت می‌کنند. 3. تنوع و فراگیری: این نسل ارزش زیادی بر تنوع نژادی، جنسیتی، فرهنگی و جنسیتی قائل است و انتظار دارد که این ارزش‌ها در محیط کار و جامعه منعکس شوند. 4. فرصت‌های شغلی معنادار: آنها به دنبال کاری هستند که نه تنها از نظر مالی پایدار باشد بلکه احساس می‌کنند که کاری که انجام می‌دهند تأثیر مثبتی بر جهان دارد. برخورد با نسل زد: 1. استفاده از تکنولوژی: باید از فناوری‌های جدید برای ارتباط و همکاری با این نسل استفاده کنید. آنها از رسانه‌های اجتماعی و اپلیکیشن‌های دیجیتال برای ارتباط استفاده می‌کنند و از این طریق می‌توانند به‌خوبی درگیر شوند. 2. مشارکت در ارزش‌های مشترک: باید ارزش‌های مرتبط با محیط زیست، تنوع و فراگیری را به‌شناسانده و آن‌ها را در استراتژی‌های تجاری و سازمانی خود ادغام کنید. 3. فراهم کردن فرصت‌های پیشرفت: این نسل به دنبال رشد و یادگیری مداوم است. فراهم کردن فرصت‌های آموزشی و شغلی که به آنها اجازه می‌دهد مهارت‌ها و کارآمدی‌های خود را توسعه دهند مهم است. 4. سازگاری و انعطاف‌پذیری: نسل زد به دنبال موازنه بین کار و زندگی و انعطاف‌پذیری در شغل خود است. در نظر گرفتن گزینه‌هایی مانند کار از راه دور، ساعات کاری انعطاف‌پذیر و سلامت روان می‌تواند برای جذب و حفظ استعدادهای این نسل مفید باشد."},{"instruction":"میشه بهم بگی منابع این مطالبی که گفتی کجان؟","output":"اطلاعاتی که در مورد نسل زد (Generation Z) در پاسخ قبلی به شما ارائه دادم از مجموعه‌ای از تحقیقات عمومی، مقالات تحلیلی، و نتایج پژوهش‌های بازاریابی و مطالعات اجتماعی استخراج شده است. متاسفانه نمی‌توانم لینک‌های مستقیم یا عناوین دقیق منابع را به شما ارائه دهم، زیرا پایگاه داده یا مرجع خاصی برای این اطلاعات به کار نرفته است. با این حال، برای تحقیق بیشتر در مورد نسل زد و دیدگاه‌های آن، ممکن است به منابع زیر مراجعه کنید: 1. گزارش‌های بین‌نسلی از موسسات تحقیقاتی مانند Pew Research Center. 2. مقالات و تحلیل‌های منتشرشده توسط مشاوران بازاریابی، مانند McKinsey & Company یا Deloitte. 3. نتایج تحقیقات دانشگاهی و مرکز مطالعات دانشگاه‌ها. 4. کتب و پژوهش‌هایی که به بررسی نسل‌ها و تفاوت‌های بین نسلی می‌پردازند. 5. مقالات منتشر شده در مجلات تخصصی مدیریت کسب‌وکار، روانشناسی و جامعه‌شناسی. 6. تحلیل‌ها و مقالات منتشر شده در وب‌سایت‌های خبری معتبر که به موضوعات مرتبط با نحوه زندگی و کار نسل زد می‌پردازند. برای دسترسی به اطلاعات دقیق و به‌روز، توصیه می‌شود که کلمات کلیدی مرتبط مانند \\"نسل زد\\"، \\"ویژگی‌های نسل زد\\"، \\"تفاوت‌های بین نسلی\\" و موارد مشابه را در موتورهای جستجو و پایگاه‌های داده علمی جستجو کنید."},{"instruction":"cara mlihat root deriixtory","output":"Pertanyaan Anda tampak seperti Anda ingin tahu cara melihat root directory (direktori root) pada sistem berkas, namun terdapat sedikit kesalahan penulisan.

Революционная война для них была способом борьбы против империализма и защиты или распространения революции. Однако в самих левокоммунистических кругах существовали разногласия относительно того, как должна проводиться революционная война. Некоторые левые коммунисты выступали против компромиссов с буржуазными государствами и против участия в парламентских выборах, считая, что война должна вестись непрерывно и без компромиссов в рамках глобальной классовой борьбы.

She spends months immersing herself in the community, recording their daily struggles and the glaring contrast with the affluent part of town just blocks away. Her documentary captures the lack of resources, the crumbling infrastructure, and the residents' perseverance despite systemic neglect. Lena presents personal stories of the neighborhood's inhabitants, their challenges, and their dreams. She becomes particularly close to a charismatic community leader, Marcus, who is advocating for change and working to improve conditions. Twice throughout the film, Lena attempts to bridge the gap by holding community forums and inviting politicians, police officers, and affluent town residents to see her footage thus far, hoping to foster understanding and compassion. However, the forums result in defensive arguments, miscommunication, and more profound divisions, leaving Lena increasingly frustrated. Twist: After the final cut of the documentary is screened to a mixed audience, there's an intense Q&A session. Among the attendees, an unassuming, elderly man named Albert, who lives in the affluent neighborhood, rises to speak. Unknown to the others, he was a sociology professor and had been studying social dynamics for decades. He quietly but powerfully points out that both communities are trapped in a \\"Mirror Society\\" - where they reflect only what is within their enclosed circles, unable to see beyond the mirror's edge. He breaks down several scenes of the documentary, showing how individuals unknowingly perpetuate stereotypes and systemic issues, such as the affluent subtly reinforcing class barriers while the impoverished engage in self-sabotage, often mirroring the very prejudices they detest. His words strike a chord, and as the film ends, both sides begin to see how they contribute to society's stagnation. With their eyes open to their unconscious biases and behaviors, the communities start organizing a joint task force, leveraging Lena's documentary as a starting point for honest dialogue and collaborative efforts. The final scenes show early but tangible signs of improvement in the neighborhood as the privileged side of town takes active roles in partnership rather than charity. Lena's documentary pivots to include this new chapter, serving as a testimony that awareness is the first step toward change. The movie closes with a powerful message: Change begins with reflection—both in the mirror and within society. It invites viewers to look beyond their immediate environment and consider their part in the societal mirrors they create and maintain."},{"instruction":"make a sad scene","output":"INT.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. The returning woman blurts out an ominous warning. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She emits a soft groan abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping in her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a posture that is more convenient for relieving herself. * Once she assumes the posture, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions and questions why the returning woman assumed such a posture. The present woman's questioning is met in response with the returning woman continuing to deliberately push and relieve herself, while muttering about how good it feels. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is yet again met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are tinged with relief-induced satisfaction. The returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants at this point, and while she is pushing everything out, she is still savoring the relief while confusingly muttering to herself about things feeling warm and heavy, and then, after a brief pause to softly grunt, she continues to murmur about how much it stinks. The perplexed present woman stares in confusion mixed with concern and asks what stinks, while the returning woman continues to softly grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and subtle euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air with a perplexed expression. As the present woman is sniffing the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor, and then inquires about the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. The present woman inquires about the odor again, describing what it smells like. Then, in a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, what had actually just happened dawns upon her. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman sniffs nearer to the returning woman and emphatically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. Then, in a more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks if the source of the odor is the returning woman having pooped in her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had just happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman stops in her tracks and initially reacts with a sheepish demeanor. * The present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped in her pants. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification. Then, the present woman exasperatedly chides the returning woman by saying that the returning woman doing something so dirty like pooping in her pants is unbelievably disgusting. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman because the returning woman stayed put at the entrance and childishly finished pooping in her pants once she began. The present woman insists that there is no reason for the returning woman to act like an infant and finish pooping in her pants the way the returning woman did, even if the returning woman's urge to relieve herself got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to poop and that she had to get everything out, as the urge was too strong. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the reasons that forced the returning woman in the first place into such a situation where the returning woman had to make the decision to finish pooping in her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally poop, even if it ended up happening inside her pants. In response to the returning woman's comments, the present woman expresses her disgust and tauntingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty, because it seems to the present woman that the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping in her pants when the returning woman speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman verbally demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's relieving deed. Following halfhearted resistance and hesitation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect the returning woman's rear end. The present woman proceeds to chidingly ridicule the returning woman over the sight of the returning woman's bulging and sagging pants. Then, the present woman continues to taunt the returning woman at length by expressing disappointed astonishment over how full the returning woman's pants are, by describing the visual appearance of the returning woman's bulging and sagging pants, and by expressing disgust at the amount of poop that is in the returning woman's pants. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full not because of special intention on the returning woman's part, but rather because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. The returning woman reiterates that despite the dirty outcome, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing pressure in her stomach, and releasing her bowels provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety once she decided to do it. * In response, the present woman exclaims with with scornful disgust that it is obvious how full the returning woman's stomach was because of this massive dump that the returning woman has taken in her pants. Then, the present woman tauntingly remarks that because it looked like the returning woman was feeling good as she was taking this massive dump, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman childishly enjoys not only relieving herself in her pants, but also having her pants be so full and loaded. The present woman adds that it is not only the full and loaded pants that the returning woman probably enjoys, but also this terrible odor that is emanating from the soiled pants too. * As she is inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants and chiding her, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman’s pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking physical gesture. As she is physically reacting to the odor, the present woman audibly complains about the returning woman being terribly smelly and chides the returning woman for it. * In response, the returning woman concedes that she is terribly smelly in her current state. Then, she adds in coy resignation that given the size of the deposit in her pants, it makes sense that the odor that emanates from her pants stinks this much. * The present woman replies by taunting the returning woman over how pungent the odor that emanates from the returning woman's pants is. Then, the present woman informs the returning woman that the returning woman won’t be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because an odor that pungent is unbearable. After that, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while verbally imploring the returning woman not to drop any of her pants’ contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom. While escorting the returning woman, the present woman is continues to react to the odor and disgustedly assists the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the odor that is emanating from the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing while reacting to her own odor. In addition, the returning woman voices her concern that the deposit is spreading inside her pants because of the motion of walking towards the bathroom. In response, the present woman reinforces her grip that is intended to assist the returning woman with the containment of the deposit in the returning woman’s pants. As she is reinforcing her grip, the present woman continues to complain about the the returning woman’s odor. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom’s threshold instead of entering, coyly mentioning that it feels very messy and icky inside her pants, and asking the present woman if she would like to change the her “poopy diaper”. As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty/smelly bum/pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grip on the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few more seconds to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. Once the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while sniffing the hand that she used to squash the bulge in the returning woman’s pants, physically reacting to the odor emitting from the hand, and then complaining to herself out loud about the odor from the returning woman’s soiled pants.","output":"FADE IN: EXT. QUAINT SUBURBAN STREET IN ARGENTINA - DAY The bright sunlight bathes the colorful houses lining the street. Dogs bark in the distance and the faint sounds of everyday life fill the air. The hot air is thick with the promise of the afternoon. We focus on SOFÍA GONZALEZ, 18, athletic build, her hair is tied back in a ponytail. She's wearing a baggy T-shirt with a quirky band logo on the front, matched with loose-fitting, solid-color cargo pants and well-worn sneakers. A sense of urgency is painted on her face as she fast walks down the sidewalk, clutching her stomach now and then. CUT TO: EXT. SOFÍA'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Sofía quickly approaches the front door, frantically patting her pockets in search of her keys, but to no avail. Her anxiety peaks. She begins a frantic KNOCKING on the door. Seconds tick by ominously with no response. Sofía's face contorts as she silently prays someone is home. INT. SOFÍA'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS MARTINA GONZALEZ, late 40s, Sofía's mother, her attire is casual yet neat: a colorful blouse and comfortable slacks. She is walking towards the door, puzzlement on her face, drawn by the urgent knocks. MARTINA (shouting) ¿Quién es? ¿Qué pasa? EXT. SOFÍA'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Sofía's expression is a mix of relief and frustration as she hears her mother's voice from inside. SOFÍA ¡Mamá, soy yo, Sofía! ¡Apúrate por favor! INT./EXT. SOFÍA'S FAMILY HOUSE - DAY INTERCUT as necessary between the door and Sofía. Sofía is shifting her weight from foot to foot, her discomfort tangible. Martina leisurely unlocks and opens the door, fumbling with the latch. SOFÍA (impatiently) Mamá, move! ¡Necesito entrar! MARTINA (concerned) ¿Pero qué te pasa, hija? Sofía attempts to dart past her mother, but Martina's maternal instincts take over. She intercepts Sofía with a gentle but firm grip on her arm. MARTINA (CONT'D) (digging for answers) Sofía, ¿estás bien? Háblame. SOFÍA (squirming to break free) ¡Mamá, por favor, déjame pasar! Their bickering escalates, Martina inadvertently forms a barrier. Sofía looks increasingly distressed as an imminent catastrophe looms. SOFÍA (CONT'D) (troubled warning) Mamá, si no me dejas, va a pasar algo malo… Sofía's composure shatters; she emits a soft groan and her face contorts with shock and the beginnings of relief. MARTINA (confused and loosening her grip) ¿Sofía, qué sucede? Sofía gently moves away from Martina, taking a position that will allow her to relieve herself, slightly squatting. She grunts with both exertion and a twisted sense of relief. MARTINA (CONT'D) (surprised) ¿Qué estás haciendo? In response, Sofía focuses on alleviating her discomfort by continuing to relieve herself, the tension on her face replaced by a strange gratification. SOFÍA (softly muttering) No sabes cuánto necesitaba esto… MARTINA (baffled) ¿Pero estás bien, hija? Sofía grunts softly, an indication of her relief. SOFÍA (relieved) Dios, está caliente... y pesado... ugh, y huele... Martina sniffs the air, a perplexed look slowly morphing into one of realization and horror. MARTINA (easing into revulsion) Pero, ¿qué es ese olor? Dios mío, ¿qué es? Sofía avoids direct eye contact, looking sheepish and relieved. Finally, the putrid smell hits Martina full force. She reels back slightly but is determined to confront the situation. MARTINA (CONT'D) (disgusted suspicion) ¡Por favor! ¿Sofía, acaso te... en tus pantalones? SOFÍA (pleading innocence) Mamá, please, let me in. Martina gestures Sofía to enter, her face scrunched in disgust. Sofía begins to waddle into the house, cupping the seat of her pants. MARTINA (CONT'D) (warning) Pero pará, pará, ¡no vas a ensuciar el piso! Sofía freezes, her face a cocktail of sheepishness and shame. MARTINA (CONT'D) (tauntingly scolding) ¿Pero cómo hiciste esto? ¡Qué asco! SOFÍA (playfully defensive) Es tu culpa. Te tardaste y me bloqueaste el camino. MARTINA (indignant) ¡Eso no es excusa! ¡Deberías haber corrido al baño! SOFÍA (defiantly) No pude, mamá. Tenía que salir, no podía aguantar. Sofía assesses the damage with her hand, her face wincing playfully. SOFÍA (CONT'D) (half-joking) Pero... a decir verdad, fue un alivio. Martina looks disgusted. MARTINA (ridiculing) ¡Vamos a ver qué tan aliviada estás! Martina, suppressing laughter and revulsion, inspects Sofía's rear, which is bulging noticeably. She chides Sofía amusingly about the sheer size of the mess. SOFÍA (timidly) No pude evitarlo, estaba llena… y necesitaba alivio. MARTINA (scornful) El tamaño de tu... “problema” es obvio. Y parece que te gustó. Martina gestures toward the bulge, sniffing it mockingly, then recoils, feigning shock. MARTINA (CONT'D) (complaining) ¡Ay, que olor! No se puede estar aquí. SOFÍA (acquiescing) Es verdad, no puedo negar que huele feo. Martina waves her hand, sending Sofía off to the bathroom. MARTINA (paternal usher) ¡Vamos al baño! Y trata de no ensuciar nada. Martina, still reacting to the stench, helps Sofía contain the disastrous contents. Sofía cringes, adding her own commentary as they waddle along. SOFÍA (anxious) Yo siento que se... está esparciendo más con cada paso. Upon reaching the bathroom door, Sofía teases Martina impishly. SOFÍA (CONT'D) (coyly prodding) Está tan desordenado aquí atrás... ¿quieres cambiarme el pañal? The remark hits a nerve. Martina responds by playfully squeezing the mess, pushing Sofía forward. MARTINA (pushy yet joking) ¡Y ahora entra ahí, sucia! ¡Inmediatamente! Martina continues to squash the mess in an exaggerated manner, turning the final push into the bathroom into a point made with emphasis. SOFÍA (revolted) ¡Ay, mamá! Ahora lo aplastaste y se untó más por mis pantalones. As Sofía enters, Martina closes the door, still reacting to the smell, talking and complaining to herself about the enduring stench as she heads away.

QUAINT SUBURBAN STREET IN ARGENTINA - DAY A serene South American suburb under the argent sun. Kids are playing soccer in the distance, a vendor calls out to the passersby selling freshly squeezed orange juice. We watch as SOFÍA MARTINEZ, 18, slim with a tomboy edge, her hair in a messy bun, rushes down the street. She's dressed in an oversized band T-shirt, loose drawstring track pants, and worn trainers. Her walk is erratic, her discomfort evident. PREVIOUSLY ON \\"LAS REVUELTAS DE LA VIDA\\": Sofía attended an intense football match, reluctant to use the unhygienic public restrooms, she opted to wait. Now, her decision haunts her as a gripping urge has grown unbearable. EXT. MARTINEZ FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS Desperation written on her face, Sofía is fast approaching her family's house. She frantically pats her pockets then spirals into panic — she can't find her house key. She hammers on the door, desperation crescendoing. INT. MARTINEZ FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS MARTINA MARTINEZ, late 40s, Sofía's mother, radiates warmth and homeliness. She wears a floral apron over her outfit: a light blouse and capri pants. She's drawn to the door by the chaos. MARTINA (concerned through the door) ¿Qué pasa ahí? ¿Quién es? EXT. MARTINEZ FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS Sofía, near her breaking point, struggles to stand still as the urgency swells within her.

The door opens agonizingly slow. SOFÍA (impatient) Mamá, please, tengas prisa. ¡Muévete! Martina, finally swinging the door open, is greeted by Sofía's panicked face. MARTINA (softly, noticing the stress) Mi niña, ¿qué te sucede? ¿Estás bien? Trying to rush past, Sofía is met with Martina’s unwavering concerned grasp. SOFÍA (fighting to break free) ¡Mamá, déjame! ¡Tengo que entrar! The struggle intensifies at the threshold. Sofía's face contorts with the monumental effort to keep control. Martina, still barricading the way, grows more alarmed. SOFÍA (CONT'D) (on the edge) Mamá, si no me dejas pasar ahora... algo horrible va a pasar... A beat — Martina fails to read between the lines as Sofía loses the silent battle, a look of defeat and relief battles across her face. She groans softly. MARTINA (gradually loosening grip, perplexed) Sofí, ¿qué te pasa? Algo no está bien... Sofía, taking a discreet step back, falls into a desperate, discreet squat, her cargo pants hiding the utmost relief crossing her face. MARTINA (CONT'D) (still clueless) Hija, ¿por qué estás así de agachada? Sofía steadies herself against the house's facade as she pushes, the physical relief contrasting the chaos of the moment. SOFÍA (under her breath, with exertion) No sabes lo necesario que era esto, mamá... Martina, trying to pierce the veil of confusion, peers at her daughter's strained face. MARTINA (shuffling closer) ¿Pero qué necesitabas? ¿Estás enferma? SOFÍA (monitoring the relief) Está caliente... y pesa mucho... y... ugh, el olor... Her mother, now alarmed, sniffs the air with confusion morphing to horror. MARTINA (almost talking to herself) Pero este olor... ¿qué es esto? ¿Qué huele así? Embarrassed and trying to avoid acknowledging the situation, Sofía looks down, a relieved flush on her cheeks. As the scent grows undeniable, Martina's expression twists from confusion to disgust, forcing her to confront the reality. MARTINA (CONT'D) (revulsion creeping in) Sofí... ¿acabas de... en tus pantalones? SOFÍA (near pleading) Déjame entrar. ¡Por favor, mamá! Despite the burgeoning disgust, Martina makes way for Sofía, gesturing her into the house with restrained impatience. Sofía waddles past her mother, clutching the back of her track pants and grimacing. MARTINA (CONT'D) (warns, halting Sofía's entry) Pero ten cuidado, ¡no vayas a soltar nada en el piso! Sofía halts, face a twisted landscape of mortification and sheepishness. MARTINA (CONT'D) (ridiculing) ¡Sofía! ¿En serio? ¡Qué asquerosidad! SOFÍA (a playful rebuke under the shame) Todo es tu culpa, por tardar tanto y no dejarme entrar. MARTINA (refuses to take blame) ¡No hay excusa! Ya estás grandecita. Sofía rolls her eyes with a disgruntled pout. SOFÍA (determined) Tenía que salir, mamá. Fue tu bloqueo en la puerta. Sofía, self-consciously, tests the mass at her rear. Despite the situation, she can't help a smug grin. SOFÍA (CONT'D) (chiding back with a smirk) Y aun así tengo que admitir que... se siente como alivio. Martina grimaces, chewing her lip at her daughter's audacity. MARTINA (incredulous at Sofía's audacity) Deja veo esto que dices sentir 'tan bien'. Turning Sofía with an encouraging push, Martina zeroes in on the 'damage'. She sees the sagging fabric, snorts in disbelief, and starts a colorful rant about the state of her daughter’s pants. SOFÍA (replies coyly, a bit cautious) Mamá, había tanto que tenía que salir, y necesitaba el alivio. MARTINA (with a melodramatic flair) Pues, ¡vaya que lo necesitabas! ¿Te gusta estar así? Martina, laughing at her own words, leans down to inspect closer, still teasing Sofía about delighting in her current 'full' state. She brings her hand to her nose, scrunching her face and sniffing. Martina's expression curdles as she comes to terms with the intensity of the scent. MARTINA (CONT'D) (complaining loudly) ¡Ay, qué olor! ¿Cómo hiciste esto? SOFÍA (admitting with a shrug) Está... pesado. Y claro que huele. Martina shakes her head, treating the situation with frank humor. MARTINA (scoffs) El olor es demasiado. ¡Vamos al baño, ya! Gently guiding her daughter, Martina remains expressively grossed out, actively avoiding the scent while maintaining her hold on Sofía’s pants. SOFÍA (embarrassed but slightly defiant) Esto se está moviendo, se va a salir más… Martina strengthens her grip, containing potential fallout, vocalizing her disdain the entire way. They finally arrive at the bathroom. On the threshold, with a cheeky gleam in her eye, Sofía probes her mother. SOFÍA (CONT'D) (teasing and gesturing) Está todo tan revuelto aquí atrás... ¿Segura que no quieres cambiarme el 'pañal', mamá? The playful insolence overwhelms Martina’s patience. With a mock severity and a lively chuckle, Martina gives the soiled pants one final, deliberate press, shoving Sofía into the bathroom. MARTINA (exhilarated exasperation) ¡Ya, basta! ¡Métete ahí y límpiate, sucia! As the mess spreads, Sofía squeals, partially in mock horror, partially in disgust. SOFÍA (protesting) ¡Ay, que asco, mamá! Ahora lo untaste más. Martina firmly closes the bathroom door behind her daughter, holding her nose and leaving Sofía to her fate. She waves away the lingering stench, shaking her head in mock despair, chuckling to herself about the outrageous situation.

MARTINA (playfully exasperated) ¡Ay, por el amor de Dios, Sofía! ¡Mira esto, parece que llevas una bolsa de supermercado a reventar atrás! Te has convertido en tu propio carnaval, mi niña, con tambor y todo por lo que pesa. She steps back taking in the full view, shaking her head dramatically.

MARTINA (CONT'D) (with mock severity) Ahora, querida, llevemos esta... muestra de arte moderno al lugar donde pertenece: el cuarto de baño. A ver si evitamos que se convierta en una exposición itinerante. With an air of resigned duty, Martina motions for Sofía to start heading towards the bathroom, her comedic soliloquy winding down to practical action, but with a lingering smile that shows she's taken the messy ordeal in stride, with a good dose of familial humor.

مرحله 2: دریافت توکن از کاربر در اینستاگرام برای این که بتوانید پیام‌هایی را که به اینستاگرام ارسال می‌شوند، بخوانید و پاسخ دهید، نیاز دارید که این بخش را با API اینستاگرام یا از طریق یک بات اینستاگرام که می‌تواند پیام‌های دایرکت را چک کند، اجرا کنید. بسته به قابلیت‌های کتابخانه‌ای که استفاده می‌کنید، کد می‌تواند متفاوت باشد. # مرحله 3: بررسی و ثبت توکن‌ها و پاسخ به کاربر شما باید توکنی که کاربر ارسال می‌کند را با توکن‌های ذخیره‌شده‌ در دیتابیس خود چک کنید. اگر توکن معتبر بود، شما باید اطلاعات اینستاگرام کاربر (مانند نام کاربری) و آی‌دی چت تلگرام او را ذخیره کرده و به کاربر پاسخ دهید که اتصال با موفقیت برقرار شده است. # مرحله 4: مانیتورینگ اینستاگرام و ارسال لینک به تلگرام شما نیاز دارید که یک روش مانیتورینگ برای حساب‌های کاربران در اینستاگرام ایجاد کنید. هر وقت پست جدیدی ارسال شود، باید لینک پست را از API اینستاگرام بگیرید و به کاربر در تلگرام ارسال کنید. لطفاً توجه داشته باشید که استفاده از API‌های بی‌طرف ثالث برای دسترسی به اطلاعات اینستاگرام و تلگرام ممکن است مغایر با قوانین و مقررات هر دو پلتفرم باشد و ممکن است ریسک‌های امنیتی و حقوقی به همراه داشته باشد. همچنین، شما باید اطمینان حاصل کنید که از روش‌های امن برای ذخیره و محافظت از داده‌های کاربران استفاده می‌کنید، به‌ویژه زمانی که اطلاعات حساس مانند توکن‌های احراز هویت درگیر هستند."},{"instruction":"I want you to write a screenplay/shooting script for a scene.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. The returning woman blurts out an ominous warning. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She emits a soft groan abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping in her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a posture that is more convenient for relieving herself. * Once she assumes the posture, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions and questions why the returning woman assumed such a posture. The present woman's questioning is met in response with the returning woman continuing to deliberately push and relieve herself, while muttering about how good it feels. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is yet again met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are tinged with relief-induced satisfaction. The returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants at this point, and while she is pushing everything out, she is still savoring the relief while confusingly muttering to herself about things feeling warm and heavy, and then, after a brief pause to softly grunt, she continues to murmur about how much it stinks. The perplexed present woman stares in confusion mixed with concern and asks what stinks, while the returning woman continues to softly grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and subtle euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air with a perplexed expression. As the present woman is sniffing the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor, and then inquires about the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. The present woman inquires about the odor again, describing what it smells like. Then, in a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, what had actually just happened dawns upon her. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman sniffs nearer to the returning woman and emphatically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. Then, in a more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks if the source of the odor is the returning woman having pooped in her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had just happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman stops in her tracks and initially reacts with a sheepish demeanor. * The present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped in her pants. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification. Then, the present woman exasperatedly chides the returning woman by saying that the returning woman doing something so dirty like pooping in her pants is unbelievably disgusting. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman because the returning woman stayed put at the entrance and childishly finished pooping in her pants once she began. The present woman insists that there is no reason for the returning woman to act like an infant and finish pooping in her pants the way the returning woman did, even if the returning woman's urge to relieve herself got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to poop and that she had to get everything out, as the urge was too strong. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the reasons that forced the returning woman in the first place into such a situation where the returning woman had to make the decision to finish pooping in her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally poop, even if it ended up happening inside her pants. In response to the returning woman's comments, the present woman expresses her disgust and tauntingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty, because it seems to the present woman that the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping in her pants when the returning woman speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman verbally demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's relieving deed. Following halfhearted resistance and hesitation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect the returning woman's rear end. The present woman proceeds to chidingly ridicule the returning woman over the sight of the returning woman's bulging and sagging pants. Then, the present woman continues to taunt the returning woman at length by expressing disappointed astonishment over how full the returning woman's pants are, by describing the visual appearance of the returning woman's bulging and sagging pants, and by expressing disgust at the amount of poop that is in the returning woman's pants. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full not because of special intention on the returning woman's part, but rather because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. The returning woman reiterates that despite the dirty outcome, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing pressure in her stomach, and releasing her bowels provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety once she decided to do it. * In response, the present woman exclaims with with scornful disgust that it is obvious how full the returning woman's stomach was because of this massive dump that the returning woman has taken in her pants. Then, the present woman tauntingly remarks that because it looked like the returning woman was feeling good as she was taking this massive dump, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman childishly enjoys not only relieving herself in her pants, but also having her pants be so full and loaded. The present woman adds that it is not only the full and loaded pants that the returning woman probably enjoys, but also this terrible odor that is emanating from the soiled pants too. * As she is inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants and chiding her, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman’s pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking physical gesture. As she is physically reacting to the odor, the present woman audibly complains about the returning woman being terribly smelly and chides the returning woman for it. * In response, the returning woman concedes that she is terribly smelly in her current state. Then, she adds in coy resignation that given the size of the deposit in her pants, it makes sense that the odor that emanates from her pants stinks this much. * The present woman replies by taunting the returning woman over how pungent the odor that emanates from the returning woman's pants is. Then, the present woman informs the returning woman that the returning woman won’t be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because an odor that pungent is unbearable. After that, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while verbally imploring the returning woman not to drop any of her pants’ contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom. While escorting the returning woman, the present woman is continues to react to the odor and disgustedly assists the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the odor that is emanating from the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing while reacting to her own odor. In addition, the returning woman voices her concern that the deposit is spreading inside her pants because of the motion of walking towards the bathroom. In response, the present woman reinforces her grip that is intended to assist the returning woman with the containment of the deposit in the returning woman’s pants. As she is reinforcing her grip, the present woman continues to complain about the the returning woman’s odor. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom’s threshold instead of entering, coyly mentioning that it feels very messy and icky inside her pants, and asking the present woman if she would like to change the her “poopy diaper”. As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty/smelly bum/pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grip on the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few more seconds to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. Once the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while sniffing the hand that she used to squash the bulge in the returning woman’s pants, physically reacting to the odor emitting from the hand, and then complaining to herself out loud about the odor from the returning woman’s soiled pants.","output":"INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY We see CAMILA, an athletic 18-year-old with her hair tied back in a ponytail. She wears casual shorts and a loose T-shirt, sporting a vibrant backpack. Her pace is rushed and uneasy. Flash back to scenes of Camila guzzling coffee at a cafe, laughing with friends. Her laughter turns to discomfort; her NEED pressing. She turns down offers to hang out, racing home instead. We return to the present — Camila has a tense, pained look as she reaches her apartment door. She pats her pockets in a panic, realizes something’s amiss. CAMILA (Whispering to herself) No, no, no... She FRANTICALLY KNOCKS. INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS MARLENE, late 40s, stylish with an artistic flair, approaches the door, puzzled. MARLENE (Questioning) Quem é? EXT.

But Marlene’s caring yet firm grip won’t let her. Their bickering crescendos. Camila’s desperation leaps to FOREGROUND. CAMILA (Warning, pained) Eu vou... The UNTHINKABLE happens. Camila’s body goes stiff. CAMILA (Groaning softly) Ah não... Marlene’s confusion blooms as the grip loosens. Camila SLOWLY retreats, eases into a posture that maximizes comfort. MARLENE (Confused) Por que você tá...? Her question drowns in the sound of Camila grunting with RELIEF. Camila’s eyes flutter. CAMILA (Muttering in relief) Que bom que... Marlene tries again. MARLENE (Questioning) Camila, tá tudo bem? CAMILA (Hushed, strained) Tá sim... ah... Camila savors the relief, murmuring about the warmth, heaviness, and yes — the stink.

MARLENE (Nasty) Qué isso, Camila? Marlene demands a CLOSER LOOK at the messy shorts. After brief resistance, she spins Camila around. She gawks at the bulging mess. MARLENE (Astonished) Caramba, menina! Quanto que você fez aqui? Camila sheepishly DEFENDS her \\"fullness,\\" stressing the relief she sought. CAMILA (Bickering) Eu tava precisando, mãe! Marlene SNEERS at the mess, adding insult about enjoyment. MARLENE (Mocking) Acha bom na calça, né? Marlene sniffs near the mass and makes a DRAMATIC gesture of repugnance. MARLENE (Grimacing) Que fedor horrível! Camila admits, her voice tinged with embarrassed ACCEPTANCE. CAMILA (Resigned) Tá fedendo mesmo... Marlene TAUNTS her over the stench, demanding she leaves the area. MARLENE (Ushering away) Vai pro banheiro agora, por favor! Camila waddles as Marlene escorts her. They advance, Marlene COMPLAINING about the smell, Camila recoiling from her own stink. MARLENE (Firm grip) Não cai nada no chão, hein! Upon reaching the bathroom, Camila teases with a sly reference to a DIAPER change. Marlene, OUTRAGED, grabs the soiled seat. MARLENE (Pushing, disgusted) Entra logo com esse seu traseiro sujo! She forces Camila into the bathroom, SQUASHING the mess, then shuts the door. MARLENE (Exasperated to nobody) Fica aprendendo uma lição!

Можно ли с помощью SVM (метода опорных векторов) определить важность фичей на которых была обучена эта модель? Приведи пример кода на Python, если это возможно","output":"Привет! Метод опорных векторов (Support Vector Machines, SVM) по своей природе не предоставляет прямого способа для оценки важности признаков так, как это делается, например, в деревьях решений или случайных лесах. Однако, можно использовать веса, присвоенные коэффициентам модели SVM, для линейного ядра, чтобы получить некоторое представление о важности признаков для линейно разделимых данных. В случае линейного ядра коэффициенты модели (\`coef_\`) могут использоваться для определения важности признаков. Абсолютные значения этих коэффициентов могут рассматриваться как показатель важности признака. Чем больше вес, тем больше влияние соответствующего признака на решение модели. Давайте посмотрим на пример использования SVM для классификации и определения важности признаков: \`\`\`python from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.svm import SVC import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Создаем синтетические данные X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=20, n_informative=3, n_redundant=2, n_classes=2, random_state=42) # Обучаем модель SVM с линейным ядром model = SVC(kernel='linear') model.fit(X, y) # Веса модели можно найти в model.coef_ coef = model.coef_.flatten() # Визуализируем важность признаков indices = np.argsort(np.abs(coef))[::-1] # Индексы в порядке уменьшения важности # Печать важности признаков for f in range(X.shape[1]): print(f\\"Feature {f+1} (Feature {indices[f]}): {coef[indices[f]]}\\") # Построим график важности признаков plt.figure() plt.title(\\"Feature importances (SVM Linear Kernel)\\") plt.bar(range(X.shape[1]), coef[indices], color=\\"r\\") plt.xticks(range(X.shape[1]), indices) plt.xlim([-1, X.shape[1]]) plt.show() \`\`\` В этом коде: - Мы создаем синтетический набор данных для классификации. - Обучаем SVM с линейным ядром. - Получаем коэффициенты (веса) модели из \`model.coef_\`. - Сортируем признаки по абсолютным значениям коэффициентов, так чтобы понять их важность. - Визуализируем относительную важность признаков с помощью столбчатой диаграммы. Обратите внимание, что этот метод применим только к линейным SVC. Если используется нелинейное ядро, такое как RBF, то веса признаков не будут доступны или их интерпретация становится намного сложнее, поскольку они относятся к преобразованному пространству, а не к исходному пространству признаков. В таких случаях можно использовать методы, основанные на перестановках (permutation importance) для оценки важности признаков, но они выходят за рамки работы самой модели SVM."},{"instruction":"А если у нас SVM работает на rbf чдре?","output":"Для нелинейных ядер SVM (например, RBF), оценка важности признаков становится более сложной задачей, поскольку веса получаются в пространстве более высокой размерности, где принимаются решения, и эти веса не соответствуют напрямую исходным признакам. Однако, можно воспользоваться техникой, называемой \\"Permutation Feature Importance\\", которая оценивает важность признака на основе изменения производительности модели после перестановки значений признака. Важность признака вычисляется путем наблюдения за тем, как изменяется точность модели, когда значения данного признака случайным образом перемешиваются по всему набору данных. Если точность заметно снижается после такой перестановки, признак считается важным. Вот пример использования \`PermutationFeatureImportance\` с использованием библиотеки scikit-learn: \`\`\`python from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.svm import SVC from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np # Генерация искусственных данных X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, random_state=42) # Разбивка данных на обучающий и тестовый наборы X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42) # Создаем и обучаем модель SVM с RBF-ядром model = SVC(kernel='rbf', random_state=42) model.fit(X_train, y_train) # Рассчитываем важность признаков result = permutation_importance(model, X_test, y_test, n_repeats=30, random_state=42) # Получаем средние и стандартные отклонения важности признаков perm_sorted_idx = result.importances_mean.argsort() perm_importances_mean = result.importances_mean[perm_sorted_idx] perm_importances_std = result.importances_std[perm_sorted_idx] # Визуализация важности признаков plt.figure() plt.barh(range(len(perm_importances_mean)), perm_importances_mean, yerr=perm_importances_std, align='center') plt.yticks(range(len(perm_importances_mean)), perm_sorted_idx) plt.title('Permutation Feature Importance (SVM with RBF Kernel)') plt.xlabel('Average importance') plt.show() \`\`\` В этом примере: - Создается искусственный набор данных для классификации. - Данные разбиваются на обучающую и тестовую выборки. - Модель SVM обучается с ядром RBF. - Используется \`permutation_importance\` для вычисления важности признака на основе тестового набора данных. - Признаки сортируются по важности и визуализируются в форме горизонтальной гистограммы. В данном случае мы использовали функцию \`permutation_importance\` из библиотеки scikit-learn, чтобы вычислить важность признаков. Permutation importance устойчив к масштабированию признаков и может использоваться с любыми моделями, чего нельзя сказать о весах признаков в SVM с линейным ядром."},{"instruction":"write a comedic and detailed story set in How To Train Your Dragon about Hiccup, who is getting fish for dinner.

The white-haired, red-eyed, soft-spoken and easily-scared but calm and determined time-manipulating young orphan girl Eri from Boku no Hero Academia is [Eri in this story] in fact Hiashi's distant descendant [Eri in this story] from one of his [Hiashi's] many one-night stands, marriages, lovers and concubines under the many aliases he [Hiashi] has [Hiashi] had over the years and so when he [Hiashi] hears her [Eri's] psychic cry for help from her [Eri's] current state of imprisonment from the branch of the Shie Hassaikai [Eight Precepts of Death |Shie Hassaikai|] Yakuza organization [Boku no Hero Academia], he [Hiashi] decides to rescue her [Eri], wiping out the Shie Hassaikai and [Hiashi] leaving no presence of its [Shie Hassaikai's] existence, although he [Hiashi] does take the Shie Hassaikai's leader, the sociopathic, Quirk and Hero hating, determined and cunning but also delusional, black-haired and amber-eyed Chisaki Kai's [Boku no Hero Academia] Quirk [Boku no Hero Academia], Overhaul, which [Overhaul] allows Kai the ability to disassemble anything he [Kai] touches, as well as reassemble it [the matter Kai touches] in any configuration he [Kai] desires, [Overhaul's matter manpulation ability] effectively giving him [Kai] full control over the matter [that comes into contact with Kai], [Hiashi taking Overhaul from Kai] before [Hiashi] taking his [Kai's] memories and [Hiashi] subsequently killing him [Kai], [Hiashi after rescuing Eri] rewriting her [Eri's] memories so that she [Eri] will [Eri] have no memory of her [Eri's] captors [the Shie Hassaikai] and [Hiashi after rescuing Eri from the the Shie Hassaikai] taking her [Eri] home with him [Hiashi] passing her [Eri] off as a street child [Eri in Hiashi's story] that he [Hiashi] adopted to his [Hiashi's] wife [Inko] and [Hiashi's] son [Izuku], which they [Inko and Hiashi] surprisingly buy, with Inko seeing Eri as her [Inko's] own daughter and Izuku getting used to [Izuku] having a little sister [Eri]. The female Katsuki in this story has strong feelings for Izuku in this story that she [the female Katsuki's in this story] hides [the female Katsuki's in this story's feelings] by acting tough, although he [Izuku] is [Izuku] obviously clueless about this [the female Katsuki's in this story's] obvious feelings for him [Izuku]. Eri is three years younger than [who is three years older than Eri in this story] him [Izuku] and [Eri in this story] loves him [Eri] deeply to the point of [Eri in this story] wanting [Eri in this story] to [Eri in this story] be his [Izuku's] loving wife [future Eri in her |Eri's| mind] and [Eri in her mind] subsequently mother his [Izuku's] children, which [Eri's deep feelings for him] he [Izuku] is [Izuku in this story] obviously clueless about. The female Katsuki in this story is also partially Russian-Jewish, partially German and partially American on the maternal side of her [the female Katsuki's in this story's] family, with her [the female Katsuki's in this story's] American name being Claire Harvey [Handoreddo], the heiress [Claire] of [what Claire is |Claire| next in line |Claire| to |Claire| inherit] the powerful American financial, economic, industrial and technological power known as the Harvey family [Handoreddo], whom [the Harveys] created and [the Harveys] control the massive industrial, technological, industrial and economic megacorp known as Warslan Enterprises [Handoreddo], which [Warslan Enterprises] created the Century Armaments and [Warslan Enterprises] is [Warslan Enterprises] the primary sponsor [Warslan Enterprises] of the Slayers [Handoreddo], with Claire being [what Claire is] a rather strong Slayer [Handoreddo] herself [Claire] despite her [Claire's] status as the Harvey heiress [Claire's true self]. Despite this Claire chooses to live in the surviving Dai Nippon Teikoku/the Dai Nihon Teikoku in this story as Katsumi [the female Katsuki's in this story's Japanese first name] in order to rise to the top of the Nihon-jin Hero system and then [Claire as Katsumi] marry Izuku as his [Izuku's] wife [future Claire in her |Claire's| mind]. Unknown to everyone, Eri is [what Eri also is in this story] also a Variant [Handoreddo] along with [Eri in this story] also being [Eri in this story] part-Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] herself [Eri in this story] from a foul Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] contract, [Eri in this story] now being [what Eri now is in this story] the human form [Eri in this story] of the God of trickery, deception and cunning in Norse mythology Loki after [Eri in this story] absorbing him [Loki in this story] into herself [Eri in this story] after he [Loki in this story] tried to take over her [Eri's] body and [Loki in this story] failed, [Loki's failed possession of Eri] leading to her [Eri in this story] gaining all of his [Loki's] powers, skills and abilities along with the ability to also form a contract with a human as a Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō]. The excerpt should start off with Izuku successfully killing his [Izuku's] daily Quota of Savages [Handoreddo] with the help of his [Izuku's] Variant [Handoreddo] abilities that [Izuku's Variant abilities] he [Izuku] successfully keeps hidden, [Izuku after killing the Savages] sneaking off the battlefield and to the local Warslan Enterprise branch after [Izuku] changing into civilian clothing, [Izuku] handing over the recorded proof of him [Izuku] slaying the Savages to the lady at the desk and [Izuku] collecting his payment for his [Izuku's] work as a Slayer [Handoreddo] before [Izuku] heading back to his [Izuku's] room at the UA dorm, only to find Eri in his [Eri's] dorm room changing. [Izuku] blushing in embarrassment, [Izuku] quickly closes the door and [Izuku] looks around, [Izuku] waiting a few minutes before [Izuku] reentering, only to see her [Eri] in [what Eri is currently wearing] a rather beautiful, flowing formal white dress that [Eri's white dress] emphasies her [Eri's] now-rather large bust and her [Eri's] developing curves, which causes him [Izuku] to blush. After [Izuku] closing the door and [Izuku] getting back inside, he [Izuku] asks her [Eri] what she [Eri] is [Eri] doing here [U.A] to which she [Eri] replies that she [Eri] is simply here [at UA] to support him [Izuku] in more ways than one. Eri then states that she [Eri] knows about him [Izuku] being both a Variant [Handoreddo] and a Slayer [Handoreddo], [Eri] revealing that she [Eri] is [Eri] also a Variant [Handoreddo] with a Century Armament and [Eri in this story] wishes to be a Slayer [Handoreddo], so she [Eri] disguised herself [Eri] as a boy and [Eri] joined U.A as a student in order to [Eri] be close to him [Izuku] and [Eri] sign up for the Slayer [Handoreddo] course at U.A. Eri also reveals that the virus that creates Variants can be suppressed by exchange of saliva, in other words passionate kissing, which causes him [Izuku] to blush in embarrassment as she [Eri] clings tightly to him [Izuku]. The next day at the U.A Sports Festival, Claire [Handoreddo] finds herself [Claire] forced to reveal the Century Armaments [Handoreddo] to the global public, although she [Claire] manages to get inside her [Claire's] future husband's [Izuku's] team during the obstacle course and tug of war events, [Claire] making sure he [Izuku] is [Izuku] as close to her [Claire] as possible. Eri in her [Eri's] disguise as a male U.A student, [Eri disguised as a guy] also [Eri disguised as a guy] manages to get into his [Izuku's] team, although she [Eri] uses Loki's powers to create a clone of herself [Eri] in her [Eri's] male disguise during the one on one battles while [Eri] staying in the audience in her [Eri's] true female form. During the battle between Izuku and the tall, slender but somewhat muscular, indigo-haired and purple-eyed, mind-control-Quirk having, stoic, brilliant and academically gifted and straightforward but conversational Support Course student at UA Shinsō Hitoshi [Boku no Hero Academia], Izuku uses his [Izuku's] training in [what Izuku is |Izuku| trained in] Ken'do [the way of the sword/sword way |Ken'do/Kendo/Kendō|, a traditional Nihon-jin style of fencing |Kendo| with |what is used to fight in Kendo| a two-handed wooden sword known as |the name of the two-handed wooden sword used in Kendo| a bokken, {Kendo} derived |Kendo| from |where Kendo originated from| the fighting methods of the ancient samurai], Ruuchuu Kobudō [old martial way of Ryūkyū/Ruuchuu |Ruuchuu Kobudō|, a Nihon-jin hand-weapon art |Ruuchuu Kobudō| that |what happened to Ruuchuu Kobudō| originated |Ruuchuu Kobudō| in |where Ruuchuu Kobudō originated in| Ryūkyū/Ruuchuu and |Ruuchuu Kobudō| utilizes |what Ruuchuu Kobudō utilizes| the kon |six foot staff|, sai |three-pronged truncheon|, tonfa |handled club|, kama |sickle|, and nunchaku |two rope- or chain-connected sticks|, but also |what other weapons are used in Ruuchuu Kobudō apart from the kon, saim tonfa, kama and nunchaku| the tekko (knuckledusters), tinbe-rochin (shield and spear), and surujin (weighted chain), with |what else happens in Ruuchuu Kobudō| its |Ruuchuu Kobudō's| CQC |close quaters combat|/hand to hand combat side being |what Ruuchuu Kobudō's CQC's/hand to hand combat side is| Shorin-ryu tode |Shorin Style/Shorin-ryu karate/China hand {Shorin-ryu tode}|, which |Shorin-ryu tode| is |what Shorin-ryu tode is| a system |Shorin-ryu tode| of |what is a system of| tode, |China Hand (tode)|, also |tode| known |tode| as |the other name of tode| karate |empty hand(karate)| in |where tode is |tode| known |tode| as karate| the Nihon Hondo and |where else apart from the Nihon Hondo tode is (tode) known (tode) as karate in| the Western World, which |tode/karate| is |what tode/karate is| a traditional Ryūkyū-ko/Ruuchuu system |tode/karate| of |what tode/karate is (tode/karate) a traditional Ryūkyū-ko/Ruuchuu system (tode/karate) of| unarmed combat |tode/karate|, which |tode/karate| focues |tode/karate| on |what tode/karate focuses on| delivering |tode/karate| sharp blows and kicks along with throws, joint locks and other grappling techniques to |where tode/karate focuses |tode/karate| on delivering sharp blows and kicks along with throws, joint locks and other grappling techniques to| pressure-sensitive points on the body, |Shorin-ryu tode being (Shorin-ryu tode) a system (Shorin-ryu-tode) of tode| that |Shorin-ryu tode| utilizing |what Shorin-ryu tode utilizes| swift, fast techniques based on |what Shorin-ryu tode's swift, fast techniques are based on| the strategy of |what the strategy Shorin-ryu tode's swift, fast techniques are based on is| simultaneously evading an enemy's attacks and |what else simultanously happens when using Shorin-ryu tode in battle apart from evading enemy strikes| attacking senstive spots of the enemy's body during battle], Onmyōdō [The Way of Yin and Yang |Onmyōdō|, a traditional Nihon-jin |Japanese (Nihon-jin)| esoteric cosmology |Onmyōdō|which |Onmyōdō| is |Onmyōdō| a mixture |Onmyōdō| of |what Onmyōdō combines| natural science, exorcist style services |Onmyōdō|, |Onmyōdō| and East Asian occultism |Onmyōdō|], and jūjutsu [gentle art | jūjutsu| a Nihon-jin martial art |jūjutsu| that |what jūjutsu is| focuses |jūjutsu| on |what jūjutsu focuses on| striking, kicking, grappling and wrestling that |jūjutsu| can |what can happen to jūjutsu| be || used |jūjutsu| to |what jūjutsu can (jūjutsu) be (jūjutsu) used (jūjutsu) to do| kill or disable an opponent in combat to [Izuku during the fight] utterly dominate Hitoshi, causing Eri to cheer from the stadium and Claire to smile in happiness.

His breath came in measured pants, the adrenaline from the battle slowly receding, leaving a dull ache in his muscles. With a swift motion, Izuku sheathed his plasma sword and nodded to himself. The battlefield was clear; his daily quota had been met. Shrugging off his slate-colored, armored jacket, Izuku swapped it for a nondescript hoodie, the red-and-black metal receding into itself, disguised as a worn wristband to any onlooker. Ducking into the narrow alleyways, he made his way to the local Warslan Enterprises branch, his stride blending into the crowd like a shadow flitting through the sun. Inside the sleek, metallic interior of the branch, Izuku approached the reception with the ease of routine. The woman at the desk, hair pinned into place, scanned the data chip he handed over with disinterested efficiency before sliding a credit chip toward him. Without a word, his payment was secured; the transaction was complete. Nodding in thanks, Izuku pocketed the chip and made his departure, the day’s work as a Slayer done. By dusk, the UA dorms loomed above him, signaling a return to normalcy—or what passed for it in his life. He slipped inside, his room awaiting as a silent sanctuary. Or so he thought. As the door whispered open, a gasp slipped from his lips. \\"Eri? What are you doing here?\\" The young girl whipped around, the white dress she donned billowing out like the petals of a blooming lily, her once-small features now showing the touches of womanly grace. Izuku's eyes widened, face flushing crimson, as he quickly stepped out and shut the door. His heart hammered against his ribs—not from the thrill of battle but an adolescent embarrassment. He waited for a counted breath before re-entering, pretending the sight was new to him. Eri fumbled with her dress, candid confusion melting into determination. \\"I came to support you, Izuku—\\" \\"—In a dress?\\" he interrupted, baffled. She laughed, a melodic sound that softened the harsh lines of reality. \\"No, silly. I'm here because I know—I know you're a Variant,\\" she said, her eyes revealing a shared secret. \\"And a Slayer. I am too.\\" His world jolted. \\"You too?\\" He gaped. Eri nodded, assertive. \\"I've hidden my Century Armament, disguised myself and joined U.A. I'm... managing the Variant virus with daily... treatments.\\" She grinned mischievously, her eyes never leaving his. \\"Saliva exchanges... to suppress its progression.\\" The revelation hung between them, a loaded silence that begged for acknowledgment. Izuku's blush deepened to match his hoodie. That night, dreams of Savage hunts and high school clashed within his restless slumber. The next day, the U.A Sports Festival was a whirl of colors and fervor—yet the surprises were far from over. Claire Harvey, also known as Katsuki, found herself in the spotlight's scalding glare, her identity as a Slayer no longer hidden, her Century Armament for all to witness. Each muscle in her body tensed as she glanced at Izuku, a warrior's determination set in her eyes as he pulled him closer during the team events. Within the crowd, another figure crouched, disguised and yet wholly present—Eri, her Loki-born clone beside Izuku, while her true form cheered from the sidelines, her future with him hanging in the balance. As the one-on-one battles raged on, Izuku employed his Ken'do and Ruuchuu Kobudō, his motions a dance of precision against Hitoshi Shinsō's mind-control techniques. Every strike he landed, every evasion he executed was testament to his training, his power concealed beneath the veil of Quirkdom. From the stands, Eri cheered, and Claire's prideful eyes gleamed with hidden admiration. In another bout, Ochako Uraraka, the Empire of China's IS representative, unleashed her Shenlong against Mirio Togata's phasing power. With an athletic grace, she spun in a mesmerizing display, her martial arts seamlessly blending with the advanced technology at her disposal. Shenlong's Dragon Cannon roared, pinning Mirio as Ochako's victory cry rang out for Izuku—a name that echoed in his ears and painted his cheeks with embarrassment. When Claire clashed with Momo Yaoyorozu, the arena became a tableau of myth and modernity. Kitsune-bi balls blazed against Yaoyorozu's bright energy katanas, both women's forms—graceful, powerful—framed by the exuberance of their combat attires. Onlookers murmured, speculating on the evolution of Quirks, ignorant of the deeper truths behind the spectacle. As the festival drew to a close, the girls' bosoms—a testament to both their strength and femininity—jiggled with exertion, drawing the attention of a future rivalry. Eri, from her seat in the audience, realized the magnitude of her feelings and the challenge she faced. But there, amidst the thunderous applause and the drama of competition, a bond stronger than any Armament or Décolleté Oblique fortified within her. She set her sights on her beloved \\"onii-chan,\\" Izuku—the boy who unknowingly held the hearts of many, each a secret warrior in their own right. In this world where legends walked disguised among heroes, where fantasies intertwined with reality, a single truth remained constant: they were all connected by the threads of a shared destiny, each seeking their place amidst the chaos of powers, technologies, and the silent strength of unspoken love."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: Start from Izuku killing his [Izuku’s] daily quota of Savages and [Izuku after killing the Savages] sneaking off the battlefield and to the local Warslan Enterprise branch after [Izuku] changing into civilian clothing, [Izuku] handing over the recorded proof of him [Izuku] slaying the Savages to the lady at the desk and [Izuku] collecting his payment for his [Izuku’s] work as a Slayer [Handoreddo] before [Izuku] heading back to his [Izuku’s] room at the UA dorm, only to find Eri in his [Eri’s] dorm room changing.

C'est juste que... cette tenue représente quelque chose de très important pour moi.\\" Izuku is silent, but his confused expression prompts her to continue, this time choosing a language he's more familiar with, but still with her distinctly European intonation. 「このドレスは、私にとって大切なものなの。それに、今日はサポートしに来たんだよ。」 Understanding dawns on Izuku's face, and a small, grateful smile creeps across his lips. 「そうか、そういうことか。でも、どうしてUAにいるんだ？」 With casual elegance, Eri approaches closer, her voice dropping to a confident whisper as she switches languages again, her words a blend of her multifaceted heritage. \\"Well, Izuku, it's because I’m also like you – a Variant, and... I've even engaged with the Century Armament, si tu comprends. Et pour rester près de toi, I have joined U.A. disguised as a garçon.\\" Izuku blinks, the situation slowly piecing together in his mind, yet his eyes can't help but remain locked on her, the white dress now a symbol of her unfathomable depths. *Izuku's Inner Thoughts:* 皆は知らない…俺と同じように、彼女もまたそれぞれの闇と光を背負ってるんだ。しかも、エリは…俺と一緒に戦うことを望んでるのか？こんなにも近くに…まるで家族のように。 Their silent communication is broken as Eri playfully twirls, the dress catching the light as if scattering stardust around the room. Izuku can't help but smile at the sight, his earlier tension easing. 「エリ、その、サポートは感謝してるよ。そして、ついてるそのスティグマ、それは特別なものだね。」 Her laughter is like music, a harmonious blend of her mixed ancestry. \\"Yes, it is quite special. It's a symbol of my resolve.

The crowd's uproar masked her maneuver, the proximity deliberate and her intention clear. Izuku's face vanished between the softness of her generous curves, his ramrod posture caving for a brief moment. His cheeks flared with color, words catching in his throat. 「ええと、クレア、その...ちょっと...それは！」Izuku stammered, his voice a muffled protest against the fabric of her shirt. Claire, ignoring his flustered demeanor, whispered encouragingly in his ear, the Russian notes of her voice colliding with Nihongo fluently. 「緑谷くん、力を合わせよう。一緒に勝つのだから。」 She could feel Izuku nodding against her, his resolve reforged in the fires of embarrassment and companionship. Claire, as Katsumi, smiled triumphantly.

Claire, with the agility of a seasoned vixen, launches blasts of kitsune-bi at Momo, her nine tails a mesmerizing lure. Close-quarters come alive with her expertise in Sambo and Krav Maga, each grapple a dance of intent. Momo, undeterred, parries with fluid motions of Ken'do, counters with the binding locks of jūjutsu, and evokes Onmyōdō's mystic barriers to shield from the explosive onslaught. Akatsubaki’s energy weapons slice through the kitsune-bi, seeking to cut Claire's movements short. *The Maelstrom of Combat:* Both warriors spin a web of tactics and feints around each other. Claire’s enchanted flames conjure visions of foxfire, hypnotizing and elusive. Asmodeus’ influence writhes visibly around Momo, tendrils and flames interlacing with her creative constructs.

Amidst the fervor stands Claire Harvey, stepping onto the podium to deliver the ending speech — her presence like a bastion of clarity against the excitement that dances in the air. Dressed in a tailored white button-up jacket that unapologetically emphasizes her feminine form, her speech begins as her bosom sways in rhythm with her determined cadence. 「この日のために集まってくださった皆さん、ありがとうございます。」Claire's voice carries across the silent crowd, her Nihongo flawless, the underlying strength in her words unmissable. *Claire's Inner Musings:* Inside, her thoughts churn with a diversity of emotion. \\"*Davai, Claire, pokazhi im.*\\" With a heart thundering beneath her tailored garments, she forges onward. 「今日私たちが共有した熱意...それは、各自が抱える独自の力を正しく使用する使命感の表れなのです。そして、その独自の力がCentury Armamentと呼ばれる新たな段階へと進化しています。」 *Eri's Precarious Realization:* Eri, witnessing the speech, feels her heartbeat sync with the inkling of shared fate. Her multilingual mind grapples with the unfolding revelation. \\"Est-ce vraiment la réalité ou juste une illusion déguisée?\\" Eri ponders, wondering how the dynamics of affection will change with this new disclosure. *Izuku's Lingering Awareness:* Izuku stands among the crowd, pride and trepidation warring within him. His thoughts focus on the future they must navigate. *Hitoshi's Contemplative Silence:* Hitoshi watches from afar, his analytical mind dissecting Claire's every word. 「これはただ事ではない… Century Armamentとは何だ？」He wonders about the implications, the gravity of the moment weighing on him silently. *Ochako's Supportive Vigil:* Ochako watches her fellow competitor with respect. Her mind composes a silent soliloquy of mixed heritage wisdom. \\"這一刻真的很重要。我自己的道路將如何開展？\\" She considers her place in this broader narrative now taking shape. *Momo's Quiet Assessment:* Momo stands, reflective, her quirk and her heritage a map of her identity — a territory expanded by Claire's announcement. 「世界が変わる...これからが本当の戦いだわ。」Her thoughts remain unvoiced as she resolves to find her own path. *Claire's Confession on Public Ear:* Claire takes a moment, her gaze sweeping the crowd before locking onto a point only she recognizes. 「そして、私にも大切な人がいます。彼がいるから、私はここに立てるのです。」 Her voice softens, but her conviction resonates even as a blush dares to paint her cheeks. Eri clenches her fists, a certain inevitability now sketched into her destiny. *Izuku’s Flushed Comprehension:* In that moment, Izuku knows. He senses the eyes on him, the weight of unseen connections. The blush that colors his cheeks is a mirror to Claire's subtle reveal, his heart stuttering in his chest as he processes the implications. As Claire concludes her speech, the world tunes in — every syllable translated, each listener unaware of the magic at play. And there, amidst the fusion of languages and emotions, begins the next chapter of their intertwined tales — a story of heroes, armaments, and the yearning hearts that beat beneath it all."},{"instruction":"Что такое Галиция","output":"Галиция — это историческая область в Восточной Европе. Ее территория традиционно была географически связана с верховьями рек Висла, Днестр, Сян и Западный Буг. Галиция не является четко определенной административно-территориальной единицей современной Европы, но термин используется для обозначения региона с общей историей и культурой. Со временем границы Галиции менялись и в разные исторические периоды ее территория оказывалась под властью различных государств, включая Польское королевство, Австро-Венгерскую империю и другие. В результате Первой мировой войны и последующих геополитических изменений Галиция была разделена между Польшей и Советским Союзом после мирных договоренностей в 20 веке. Сегодня территория бывшей Галиции находится в пределах двух стран: западная часть — в Польше (воеводства Подкарпатское, Малопольское и частично Любельское), восточная — на западе Украины (области Львовская, Ивано-Франковская, частично Тернопольская, Закарпатская и Волынская). Город Львов, который сейчас находится в Украине, традиционно считался культурным и интеллектуальным центром Галиции. Галиция имеет богатое культурное наследие с элементами польской, украинской, еврейской и австрийской культур. Этот регион известен своей особой культурной мозаикой, исторической значимостью и важной ролью в истории Восточной Европы."},{"instruction":"Как называется житель Галиции?","output":"Жителя Галиции называют галичанин (если это мужчина) или галичанка (если это женщина). Эти термины могут использоваться как для обозначения этнической принадлежности людей, живущих в исторической области Галиции, так и для современных жителей регионов, которые были частью Галиции до территориальных изменений XX века."},{"instruction":"Как называется женщина Печенег?","output":"Термин для обозначения женщины из народа печенегов в исторических источниках не имеет устоявшегося специфического наименования, отличного от общепринятых. Женщину из племени или народа печенегов можно назвать печенежка. Печенеги — кочевой народ, который жил в степях Евразии и играл важную роль в истории Восточной Европы в раннем Средневековье, особенно в IX-XI веках. Сведения о них сохранились в летописях и других исторических источниках того времени."},{"instruction":"В среднем, в средние века до какого возраста человек мог сражаться мечом пока не стал немощный.","output":"В Средние века не существовало строгого стандарта, определяющего возраст, до которого человек мог сражаться мечом, поскольку факторы, такие как личное здоровье, общее физическое состояние и социальный статус, могли сильно варьироваться. Физические навыки воина могли начать ухудшаться уже после 30 лет, однако многие продолжали воевать и в более зрелом возрасте. Воины средневековья, как правило, начинали свою военную подготовку в детстве, становясь полноправными бойцами в юности или раннем зрелом возрасте. Опытные воины, такие как рыцари, могли продолжать участвовать в военных кампаниях до 40, 50 и даже 60 лет, если их здоровье позволяло. Однако с увеличением возраста они могли переходить в менее требовательные роли, такие как командование, стратегическое планирование и обучение молодых воинов, отходя от активных боевых действий. Пожилые воины, которые уже не могли эффективно воевать в первых рядах, иногда получали более лёгкую службу или служили в качестве советников. Средневековое общество ценило опыт и мудрость старших воинов. Важно отметить, что из-за отсутствия современной медицины, питания и гигиены средняя продолжительность жизни в Средние века была ниже, чем сегодня, а здоровье людей часто страдало от различных недугов и повреждений, полученных в боях, что также сокращало их военную карьеру. Тем не менее, исторические хроники иногда упоминают о воинах, которые впечатляюще долго сохраняли боевую готовность."},{"instruction":"Я это понимаю, поэтому и спросил в среднем.","output":"Прошу прощения за недопонимание. В среднем, рыцари и профессиональные воины средневековья могли активно участвовать в боевых действиях примерно с 16-20 лет до 40-50 лет. Этот возрастной диапазон варьировался в зависимости от многих факторов, включая индивидуальное здоровье, степень износа тела из-за нанесенных травм, доступ к медицинскому уходу и питанию. После достижения возраста около 40-50 лет, многие воины становились менее активными в передовой боевой службе. Однако некоторые продолжали служить в военной иерархии на командных позициях или занимались обучением молодых бойцов. Стоит также учесть, что среднестатистический средневековый человек часто не доживал до глубокой старости, поэтому средний возраст, до которого воины могли сражаться, скорее всего, был скорректирован в меньшую сторону по сравнению с возможностями современных людей."},{"instruction":"choose a random flower, two word only with the word flower","output":"Sunflower blossom"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artSunflower blossom","output":"Sunflower Blossom | Versatile Art Design for Mugs, Shirts, Paintings | Bright Floral Decor | Gift Idea | Home and Apparel Custom Graphics"},{"instruction":"create a roleplaying fantasy scenario game where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old mage girl who’s the current champion of of magic dueling in the teen division.

Lahat ay humahanga sa kanyang nakamit na matataas na marka. Maliban sa isang hangarin, ang pagkilala ng kanyang ama na si Mang Rico, isang retiradong guro, na lagi siyang inaasahan umuwi na may perpektong grado. Isang araw, habang patapos na ang semester, nagkaroon ng malaking pagkakamali sa pagpasok ng grado ni Anna na naging sanhi upang bumagsak siya sa kanyang major subject. Ang balita tungkol sa biglaang pagbagsak niya ay kumalat na parang apoy sa kampus. Sa takot na mahusgahan at sa kahihiyang hindi matanggap ng ama, nagpasya siyang gumawa ng plano upang itago ang katotohanan. Sa tulong ng kanyang kaibigan na si Luis, nagkunwari si Anna na walang nangyari at nagpasa ng pekeng grade report sa kanyang ama. Habang humahakbang si Anna patungo sa entablado sa araw ng kanyang graduation, si Mang Rico ay labis na nasasabik at puno ng pagmamalaki. Ngunit bago siya tawagin upang magbigay ng valedictory speech, may isang hindi inaasahang bisita - ang kanyang propesor sa major subject na lumapit sa mikropono. Maliwanag na kinakabahan at may pangingilabot sa boses, inihayag ng propesor na may isang teknikal na pagkakamali na naganap sa sistema ng pagkalkula ng grado. Sa totoo lang, si Anna ay hindi bumagsak; sa katunayan, siya ay nanguna sa buong klase! Lubos na nasorpresa at napahiya, aminado si Anna sa harap ng lahat ng tao sa seremonya ang naging desisyon niyang magtago ng katotohanan dahil sa takot sa kanyang ama. Si Mang Rico, na lubos na emosyonal, ay umakyat sa entablado, yakapin ang kanyang anak, at sa unang pagkakataon, ipinahayag ang kanyang pagmamalaki hindi lang dahil sa mga grado ni Anna, kundi dahil sa kanyang tapang at integridad na harapin ang kanyang pagkakamali ng buong puso. Twist: Ang tunay na plot twist ay na si Mang Rico ay matagal nang nalaman ang pagkakamali sa grado ng kanyang anak, ngunit pinili niyang manahimik upang bigyan si Anna ng pagkakataong matuto mula sa kanyang sariling pagkakamali at lumaki bilang isang tao. Ang kanyang tunay na layunin ay hindi ang makitang magtagumpay si Anna dahil lamang sa akademiko, ngunit dahil sa kanyang kayang harapin ang buhay nang may katapangan at integridad. Sa huli, ang lahat ay nauunawaan na ang pinakamahalagang aral ay hindi laging matatagpuan sa loob ng klasrum, at ang tunay na tagumpay ay hindi laging nasusukat sa mga letra ng ating mga grado, kundi sa tapang na harapin ang katotohanan at ang lakas ng loob na itama ang ating mga pagkakamali."},{"instruction":"create a roleplaying fantasy scenario game where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old mage girl who’s the current champion of of magic dueling in the teen division.

Here is the updated \`draw_text\` function: \`\`\`python def draw_text(draw, text, font, default_text_color, text_area_width, text_area_height, start_x, start_y, shadow_offset, line_spacing, color_ratio=0.2, alternate_color='orange'): text = text.upper() words = text.split() # Determine the number of words to color differently, based on color_ratio num_words_to_color = max(1, int(len(words) * color_ratio)) # Randomly pick unique words to color differently words_to_color = set(random.sample(words, num_words_to_color)) lines = textwrap.wrap(text, width=text_area_width // (font.size // 2)) # Get font metrics ascent, descent = font.getmetrics() # Calculate the height of each line based on font metrics line_height = ascent + descent # Calculate the total height of the text block with additional line spacing total_text_height = len(lines) * line_height + (line_spacing * (len(lines) - 1)) # Initial y offset - start at the vertical center while accounting for additional line spacing y_offset = start_y + (text_area_height - total_text_height) // 2 for line in lines: line_words = line.split() # Calculate line width and adjust x offset to center the line line_width = sum(draw.textbbox((0, 0), word + ' ', font=font)[2] for word in line_words) x_offset = start_x + (text_area_width - line_width) // 2 for word in line_words: # Determine dimensions and position of the shadow and text # Using the baseline (ascent) to position the word vertically word_bbox = draw.textbbox((x_offset, y_offset + ascent), word, font=font) # Set word color depending on whether it's selected to be colored differently word_color = alternate_color if word in words_to_color else default_text_color # Draw shadow first (if shadow_offset is not zero) if shadow_offset: draw.text((x_offset + shadow_offset, y_offset + shadow_offset), word, font=font, fill=shadow_color) # Draw the word itself, offset by the ascent to align baselines draw.text((x_offset, y_offset + (ascent - word_bbox[1])), word, font=font, fill=word_color) # Increase x_offset by the width of the word plus a space space_width = draw.textbbox((0, 0), ' ', font=font)[2] x_offset += (word_bbox[2] - word_bbox[0]) + space_width # Increase y_offset by the baseline line height plus the additional spacing y_offset += line_height + line_spacing \`\`\` In this function, the total text height is calculated by multiplying the number of lines by the sum of the ascent and descent (line height), and then adding the desired additional line spacing between lines minus one (since there's no extra spacing needed after the last line). Then, while drawing each word, we use the ascent to determine the vertical position of the word to align the baselines of the text. The baseline-to-baseline distance is consistent across all lines because we increment the y_offset by \`line_height + line_spacing\` for each new line. Now, when you call \`draw_text\`, you should again specify the \`line_spacing\`. It will be applied consistently between baselines, ensuring the desired even spacing between all lines of text regardless of descenders or commas."},{"instruction":"In the program you suggested, only the shadows of the text are spelled correctly, and the text itself is overlapped at the top of the picture.","output":"My apologies for the oversight.

The presence of robots in public places, government and private entities and institutions has become commonplace, as they are seen as official employees capable of meeting requirements and completing transactions with ease, speed, and extreme accuracy. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance announced the provision of 39,000 human work hours through adopting Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to process over 1.8 million transactions with an accuracy exceeding 98 percent. This has led to significant improvements in productivity and efficiency, taking a further step towards transitioning to a knowledge-based and innovative economy. It aligns with the goal of making the UAE the world's best country by its centenary in 2071. The Ministry of Finance has completed the second phase of its internal transformation journey towards RPA. The ministry now utilises robots (software applications performing automated tasks), with chatbots being one of the most common types. These manage phone or online interactions between institutions and their clients. The Ministry of Finance uses them on its digital procurement platform, speeding up processes from 60 days to 6 minutes. This fosters greater competition for government contracts by allowing more small companies to participate. Today, the use of such robots is increasingly spreading in the public sector as government entities seek to improve efficiency and customer services. The Emirates Health Services Foundation announced equipping its health facilities with a \\"blood drawing robot,\\" making it the first regional institution to use this robot. Studies indicate its ability to save 80 percent of the time required by the staff and 50 percent of patients' waiting time for blood drawing services. This announcement was made during the \\"Arab Health 2024\\" exhibition and conference, currently ongoing in Dubai, where the foundation participates as a strategic partner in healthcare services with four main axes. The \\"blood-drawing robot\\" is not just a mechanical marvel; it's a testament to the UAE's focus on cutting-edge technology. Equipped with artificial intelligence and infrared technology, it promises efficient and accurate service, setting a new standard for healthcare automation. Recognising the global demand for robotics expertise, the Mohamed bin Zayed University for Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) has taken a forward-thinking step. Launching two new departments dedicated to robotics and computer science, the university seeks to cultivate the next generation of AI and robotics leaders. Their focus on human-centric and autonomous robots aligns perfectly with the country's vision for a technology-driven future. Dubai's status as a magnet for tech giants was further cemented in March 2023 with the opening of UiPath's regional headquarters. This leading robotic process automation company chose the UAE for its dynamic scene, solidifying the country's position as a global innovation hub. The UAE's embrace of robots extends far beyond healthcare and academia. They act as educational consultants, lecturers, broadcasters, surgeons, pharmacists, customer service representatives, even maritime rescuers! This diversity showcases the boundless potential of robotics, transforming sectors across the board. Dr Ali Al Belooshi, Consultant Orthopedic and Joint Replacement Surgeon and Vice President of the Orthopedic Division at the Emirates Medical Association, exemplifies the success stories enabled by robotic technology. Since embracing AI and robotic tools, he has set a world record, performing over 1500 artificial joint surgeries with a remarkable 99 percent success rate. This incredible achievement highlights the life-changing potential of robot-assisted surgery. Robotic surgery is thriving in the UAE. The Ministry of Health and Prevention has been at the forefront, with Al Qassimi Hospital in Sharjah performing the first successful robotic cardiac catheterisation in 2014. Expanding beyond heart procedures, the ministry also launched a robotic surgery programme for women's health and childbirth. Further enhancing patient care, Fujairah Hospital adopted robotic pharmacy services to minimise medication errors and waiting times. The media landscape in the UAE is witnessing a robotic transformation. Dubai Media Incorporated broke ground with the first Arabic-speaking AI news anchor powered by intelligent algorithms. Abu Dhabi Media Company followed suit, unveiling its own AI news anchor capable of bilingual delivery and featuring expressive facial interactions. These breakthroughs are shaping the future of news consumption in the region. Law enforcement in the UAE has embraced robotic innovation. In 2017, Dubai Police made history with the world's first multilingual, emotion-sensing robot officer. Capable of understanding body language, recognizing gestures, and assisting the public in six languages, this robot redefined police-citizen interaction. Furthering AI integration, the Abu Dhabi Police Traffic and Patrols Directorate deployed intelligent robotic assistants for traffic awareness initiatives throughout 2023. The intelligent robot developed by the Abu Dhabi Police General Command is not just a traffic cop. It actively participated in events like the Gulf Traffic Week, Jiu-Jitsu Championship, and Summer Exhibition, educating audiences with traffic advice, digital awareness films, and fun ways to improve traffic culture through AI. Protecting lives on Dubai's stunning beaches is a unique job, and the robotic lifeguard does it flawlessly. This AI-powered marvel tackles challenging waves and currents, rescuing up to five people simultaneously, a feat beyond most human rescuers. Analysing cement just got smarter. The Central Dubai Laboratory now uses an automated robot chemist, employing X-ray technology and sophisticated AI to accurately test all types of cement, ensuring construction quality and safety. Polluted waterways are no match for the \\"Pixie Drone,\\" a UAE-approved floating robot. This eco-champion effortlessly collects marine waste for up to six hours in both fresh and saltwater, swallowing up to 160 litres of liquid waste at a time.

Venn diagram showing how technological capability, business viability and consumer desire overlap in an effective digital experience design Digital experience design is a far-reaching business element that includes everything from digital interface functionality to conversations with customer support agents. Anyone looking to improve their digital experience design should be familiar with several specific design- and experience-related areas of expertise. User interface design User interface (UI) design controls the look and feel of the digital interfaces with which your customers interact. UI shapes the first impression consumers will make about your brand and should focus on attractiveness and ease of use. User experience design User experience (UX) design focuses on the functionality of the interfaces with which your customers interact. UX design is all about making sure a consumer can complete the task at hand, so it’s important to think about accessibility, responsiveness, and, again, ease of use. Customer experience Of course, the way your business handles customer experience (CX) is key to how effective your digital experience design is. As Steve Jobs famously said: “... you’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards [sic] to the technology.” CX is all about building lasting relationships with customers to increase retention and create opportunities for powerful word-of-mouth marketing. When you’re thinking about the customer experience elements of your digital experience design, keep in mind the overall quality of the experience your customer enjoys during their lifetime with your brand. Thoughtful digital experience design in high demand Digital experience design is important today because flawless brand experiences are in higher demand than ever. A 2020 report found that 80% of consumers say the experience a brand creates is as important as the products or services it sells. Additionally, 88% of consumers think companies should accelerate their digital initiatives in light of COVID-19. Consumers want companies to invest in digital experience design that delivers the experience they got from in-person interactions, especially now that they’re stuck at home more, living through record supply-chain shortages, and maybe even working with a limited budget as a result of the pandemic. With a thoughtfully crafted digital experience design, you can show your customers and leads that your business cares about them — a factor that’s become more important to consumers since the start of the pandemic. 88 percent of consumers expect businesses to accelerate their digital capabilities as a result of COVID-19 How to get started with digital experience design Digital experience design involves managing several moving parts. And, as we’ll expand upon later, they never actually stop moving, and trends and technology continue to change. You’ll need to develop a unique system when it comes to creating and managing the perfect digital experience design for your business and user base. These steps will put you in a favorable position as you build your digital experience design. 1. Understand how consumers interact with the current digital experience You shouldn’t need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to your customer journey. Instead, a refreshed digital experience design can build upon and improve underperforming existing areas. That means your first task should be to know everything about how consumers are already interacting with your brand and products. The best way to do this is to walk through the customer journey, starting at the entry points where consumers might begin interacting with your brand — through a search engine results page, via a marketing email, after clicking on a social media ad, etc. As you experience the journey for yourself, keep track of the touchpoints — reading blogs to learn about the company and products, contacting customer support, making a purchase, signing up for a demo, etc. — and whether they were easy, satisfying, and moved you further on your journey. User testing can be hired out if you’re worried you won’t be able to be subjective or spend enough time on this process. 2. Integrate a DXP for handling the digital experience across each touchpoint The platforms and channels where consumers have experiences with your brand might include any combination of the following: Review sites like G2 Online forums like Reddit Social media channels like LinkedIn Your own customer support or relationship channels like online chat, email marketing, loyalty programs, etc. Your own content channels such as your blog or your knowledge base. In order to create a seamless digital experience that is enticing to your target consumer groups, you have to collate data about each group, create content that delivers on their expectations and serve that content on the channels and platforms where they interact the most. For large businesses, this is where it becomes important to implement a single source of truth. Your business verticals can work together to enact a digital experience design that wins and keeps high-value customers. That single source of truth is called a digital experience platform (DXP). A DXP is a foundational platform where modular services work together to create cohesive yet scalable consumer journeys. While a DXP can be a monolithic piece of software, more modern solutions are a combination of platforms that share a flexible foundation. In the content and marketing sphere, this foundation is often a headless CMS, as it’s not only positioned to manage a key element of the experience — the content itself — but it’s also modular in structure so experience-enhancing tools can be layered into the content management process. On top of a headless CMS, you can integrate tools like customer relationship management (CRM), product information management (PIM), recommendation engines, on-site analytics, and more. These tools make the creation of scalable, cohesive, relevant consumer interactions possible for digital experience design teams. In a headless CMS, the cloud-native content hub feeds commerce, personalization, AI, localization and analytics 3. Set up processes to maintain and optimize your new system Maintenance and optimization are central themes to building a digital experience design. Create a system that periodically reminds you to check your DXP’s functionality and the relevance of the experiences you’re creating to ensure they’re always on the cutting edge. Continuous A/B testing and staying on schedule with technology upgrades are good ways to keep your design top of the line. The methods outlined in the upcoming section will help you determine how people feel about the interactions you’re creating. 4 Methods for measuring the effectiveness of your digital experience design How can you make sure the digital experience design you’ve so carefully crafted is successful? These methods will help. 1. Clearly define digital experience design goals Ever-shifting goalposts make it difficult to quantify the success of large-scale business experience projects. Have well-defined success methods before you attempt to measure the effectiveness of your digital experience design efforts. Develop these metrics by setting detailed goals that are SMART — specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound. 2. Measure customer satisfaction and effort Now that you’re ready to collect metrics to compare against your goals, measure some of the most important performance indicators: customer satisfaction and customer effort. A customer satisfaction (CSAT) score measures how happy customers are with their experience at different parts of their buying journey. You can gather this information with automatic pop ups or email surveys. A customer effort score (CES) measures the effort a customer expends to accomplish a task. This score should be measured at various interaction points so you can figure out where to simplify the flow to increase conversions and customer happiness. 3. Track your net promoter score Net promoter score (NPS) is a metric that measures loyalty. It consists of some variation of these two questions: “How likely are you to recommend [your product or company] to a friend or colleague?” This question should allow consumers to choose a number from 0 to 10. “Why did you choose that score?” This question should be followed by a text box where consumers can type their answers. You want to get your NPS average as close to 10 as possible, as this indicates that a large percent of your consumers are promoters, loyal to and enthusiastic about your brand. 4. Employ behavior tracking Your digital experience design’s performance can be measured without directly asking for consumer input. Try heat-mapping software to monitor how consumers use your website or app in real time. This will provide valuable insights into the most and least effective steps of the buyer journey. 4 Strategies for future-proofing your digital user experience Once your digital experience design is in full swing and you’ve put measures in place to monitor its effectiveness, implement these strategies so it remains a success into the future. 1. Keep tabs on modern digital experience design best practices One important thing to remember about digital experience design is that, in order to be successful, it has to keep up with modern consumer demands and trends. Stay in the loop on cutting-edge design and experience developments. Subscribe to email newsletters, follow experience and design leaders on social media or self-publishing websites (like Medium) and attend industry events. 2. Use data to understand what your consumers want today Data is the difference between guessing and knowing what kind of digital experiences are going to please consumers and create a handsome ROI. This is where measuring the success of your digital experience design is going to pull double duty. By combining demographic data with behavioral and preference data you’ve collected through surveys, heat mapping, etc., you will be able to create a clear picture of the brand interactions and products your main consumer groups desire. 3. Create a feedback management system You won’t always have to rely on data to determine what your customers want; sometimes, they’ll tell you what they want. The same is true for fellow employees in marketing, customer support, and other business verticals crucial to the success of your digital experience design. Make it easy for these people to provide feedback with on-site chat, a simple form on your contact page or a link in your site navigation. If you’re going to bother collecting feedback, create a workflow for yourself or another person on your digital experience design team to manage that feedback. Feedback should be read, the appropriate team should be notified and the person who left the feedback should be thanked and told how their input is being managed. 4. Plan for consistent change Digital experience design is all about keeping up with change. Technology changes, trends change, and your digital experience design must adapt with them to keep your functionality and buyer journeys up to snuff. A truly future-proof digital experience design must be flexible, recognizing change as one of the few constants. This flexibility should start in the mindset of the leadership team and apply to everything from detailed documentation to future hiring decisions, choices about technological investments and implementing ongoing improvements rather than huge, one-time projects. Learn more about digital experience design Digital experience design accounts for not just the changing desires of consumers but also the many different business verticals with which they interact and the technology powering these interactions. It’s a big job, but with the right tactics, tools, success metrics and future-proofing measures, digital experience design can be attainable and powerful in differentiating your brand.

The chlorine is sold at 20% off, so the discount on one liter of chlorine is: 20% of 10 = 0.20 * 10 = 2 So, the discounted price of one liter of chlorine is: 10 - 2 = 8 Now, let's calculate the total cost of 3 liters of chlorine at the discounted price: 3 liters * 8/liter = 24 The original cost of 3 liters of chlorine without the discount would have been: 3 liters * 10/liter = 30 Now, let's move on to the soap. We know that the original price of one box of soap is 16. We don't know the discount percentage yet, but we do know that the total savings from buying 3 liters of chlorine and 5 boxes of soap is 26. The savings from the chlorine alone is: Original cost of 3 liters of chlorine - Discounted cost of 3 liters of chlorine 30 - 24 = 6 Since the total savings is 26, the savings from the soap must be: 26 - 6 = 20 Now, we need to find out the discount on each box of soap that would result in a total savings of 20 when buying 5 boxes. Let's call the discount on each box of soap \\"D\\". The total discount on 5 boxes of soap would be: 5 * D = 20 Now we can solve for D: D = 20 / 5 D = 4 So, the discount on each box of soap is 4. To find the discount percentage on the soap, we use the formula: Discount Percentage = (Discount Amount / Original Price) * 100 For the soap, the discount percentage would be: Discount Percentage = (4 / 16) * 100 Discount Percentage = 0.25 * 100 Discount Percentage = 25% Therefore, the discount on a box of soap is boxed{25%} ."},{"instruction":"A car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

Given weights are: 495, 500, 503, 508, 498, 500, 493, 500, 503, 500. So, overline{x} = frac{495 + 500 + 503 + 508 + 498 + 500 + 493 + 500 + 503 + 500}{10} = frac{5000}{10} = 500. **Step 2: Calculate the variance s^2.** Variance formula is s^2 = frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - overline{x})^2, where x_i are the weights and n is the number of observations.

There are 4 choices for the recipient of each book, leading to a total of 4^5 different combinations. Next, we determine the number of distributions where each student receives at least one book. To ensure each student gets at least one book, we must prevent any student from getting no books at all. We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to avoid overcounting the distributions that leave one or more students without a book. The idea is to calculate the total ways of distributions that leave out at least one student, and then subtract that from the total possible distributions: 1. First, we calculate the number of ways to exclude one particular student and distribute all five books among the remaining three students. There are 3 choices for each of the 5 books, which gives 3^5 combinations. 2. However, there are 4 students, so to exclude any of the students, we have 4 times 3^5 combinations. 3. But this overcounts the distributions that exclude two students because such distributions are subtracted once for each student they exclude. Thus, we need to add back the number of ways to distribute the books among two students. There are 2^5 combinations for two students and binom{4}{2} ways to choose which two students get the books. So, we add binom{4}{2} times 2^5. 4. Finally, if all 5 books go to one student, there are 4 ways for this to happen (one for each student), which we must also subtract given that it's been added one too many times in the previous step. Putting it all together, we calculate the number of valid distributions where no student is left out: [ text{Valid distributions} = 4^5 - 4 times 3^5 + binom{4}{2} times 2^5 - 4 ] Now, using the combination formula binom{n}{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} and factorial notation: [ text{Valid distributions} = 4^5 - 4 times 3^5 + frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} times 2^5 - 4 ] Plugging in the values, we get: [ text{Valid distributions} = 1024 - 4 times 243 + 6 times 32 - 4 ] [ text{Valid distributions} = 1024 - 972 + 192 - 4 ] [ text{Valid distributions} = 240 ] Now, the probability that each student receives at least one book is the number of valid distributions divided by the total number of combinations: [ P = frac{text{Valid distributions}}{4^5} = frac{240}{1024} = frac{15}{64} ] Therefore, the correct answer is: [ P = boxed{frac{15}{64}} ]"},{"instruction":"What is the units digit of the number ( 2015^{2} + 2015^{0} + 2015^{1} + 2015^{5} )?","output":"To determine the units digit of the number (2015^{2} + 2015^{0} + 2015^{1} + 2015^{5}), we need to consider the units digit of each term individually and then find the units digit of their sum. 1. **Identify the units digit of each individual term**:     - The expression (2015^{n}) will have the same units digit as (5^{n}) since the units digit of 2015 is 5.      - Powers of 5 always end in 5 when (n geq 1).    2. **Calculate the units digit of each term**:     - For (2015^{2}): Since the units digit of 5 squared ((5^{2})) is 25, the units digit is 5.

This implies that the distance between (x,y) and points (- sqrt {7},0), ( sqrt {7},0) is equal to 8, where 8 > 2 sqrt {7}. Thus, the trajectory of (x,y) is an ellipse with foci at (- sqrt {7},0) and ( sqrt {7},0). The major axis a=4, and the distance between the foci c= sqrt {7}, implying the minor axis b=3. So the trajectory equation is dfrac {x^{2}}{16}+ dfrac {y^{2}}{9}=1. When the slope of the line PQ does not exist, due to the symmetry of the ellipse, we have x_{1}=x_{2}, y_{1}=-y_{2}.

We are given that the fraction equals 3 for some value of x=c.

This is because any fraction of an ounce requires rounding up to the next whole ounce. 3. **Calculating the Cost**:    - The cost in cents for mailing a letter weighing W ounces is 6 times lceil W rceil. 4. **Using the Identity lceil x rceil = -lfloor -x rfloor**:    - We can rewrite the cost as 6 times -lfloor -W rfloor. 5. **Evaluating the Options**:    - We need to check which option corresponds to 6 times -lfloor -W rfloor.    - Option (E) states -6[-W], which simplifies to 6 times -lfloor -W rfloor. 6. **Verification with Examples**:    - For W = 2.5 ounces, the cost should be 18 cents since lceil 2.5 rceil = 3 and 6 times 3 = 18.    - For W = 2 ounces, the cost should be 12 cents since lceil 2 rceil = 2 and 6 times 2 = 12.    - Plugging W = 2.5 and W = 2 into the options, only option (E) consistently gives the correct results.

When x in left[-frac{pi}{6}, 0right], we have sin x leq 0. Therefore, f(x) = -sin x + cos 2x.

We use the triangle inequality to establish a relationship involving the sides and the diagonals of the n-gon.

For each side of the polygon, there are exactly n-3 non-adjacent sides. Summing these inequalities over all pairs of non-adjacent sides, each side length appears in exactly n-3 inequalities on the left-hand side. 4.

The total distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is ( 1.10 ) km + ( 0.9 ) km = ( 2.00 ) km.

Describe one of the circles that passes through both ( A ) and ( B ) as circle ( k ) with intersection points ( E ) and ( F ) on line ( e ). 2. **Existence of Intersection Points**    Given that line ( e ) separates points ( A ) and ( B ), it follows that line ( e ) also intersects circle ( k ) in two distinct points ( E ) and ( F ). This cuts circle ( k ) into two arcs. 3. **Intersection Theorem**    Since ( A ) and ( B ) lie on ( k ), their respective chords ( AB ) and ( EF ) intersect at a point ( M ) inside the circle. By an elementary theorem of intersecting chords:    [    ME cdot MF = MA cdot MB    ]    Here, ( M ) is a fixed point and hence the right-hand side ( MA cdot MB ) is constant irrespective of the choice of circle ( k ). 4. **Geometric-Arithmetic Mean Inequality**    To find the shortest chord ( EF ), we apply the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality to ( EM ) and ( MF ):    [    EM + MF geq 2 sqrt{EM cdot MF}    ]    Therefore, the length of the chord ( EF ) can be expressed using this inequality:    [    EF = EM + MF geq 2 sqrt{EM cdot MF}=2 sqrt{MA cdot MB}    ]    This inequality tells us that the length of ( EF ) is minimized when ( EM = MF ), which means ( M ) is the midpoint of ( EF ). 5. **Construction of the Circle ( k_0 )**    Hence, the circle ( k_0 ) that cuts the shortest chord ( E_0F_0 ) must have its center ( O_0 ) such that ( M ) is the midpoint of ( E_0F_0 ). This involves constructing a perpendicular from ( M ) to line ( e ), denoted ( m_0 ), and identifying the perpendicular bisector of chord ( AB ), denoted ( f ). The intersection of these perpendiculars ( m_0 ) and ( f ) determines the center ( O_0 ), which in turn specifies the circle ( k_0 ). 6. **Uniqueness and Radius Determination**    Since ( AB ) is not parallel to ( e ), the perpendiculars ( m_0 ) and ( f ) are not parallel and thus intersect at a unique point ( O_0 ). The radius of ( k_0 ) is then ( O_0A ) (or ( O_0B ), as ( A ) and ( B ) lie on the circle ( k_0 )). # Conclusion Thus, the circle ( k_0 ) that intersects the shortest chord ( E_0F_0 ) through points ( A ) and ( B ) is uniquely determined by the above construction, establishing the shortest possible chord through the given points.

Even if d < 0, as long as |d| is small enough such that a_3 > 0 and a_5 > 0, we still have f(a_3) > 0 and f(a_5) > 0. Therefore, f(a_1) + f(a_3) + f(a_5) is always positive.

Since the LCM of A and B is 60, we can write A as 60/x and B as 60/y, where x and y are positive integers and x > y. Given that the sum of A and B is 50, we can write the equation: A + B = 50 Substituting A and B with 60/x and 60/y, we get: 60/x + 60/y = 50 Multiplying both sides by xy to clear the denominators, we get: 60y + 60x = 50xy Simplifying, we get: 60(x + y) = 50xy Dividing both sides by 10, we get: 6(x + y) = 5xy Now, we need to find integers x and y that satisfy this equation and also make A and B integers. Since the LCM of A and B is 60, x and y must be factors of 60 that, when multiplied together, give a product that is a multiple of 60. Let's try different pairs of factors of 60 and see if they satisfy the equation: 1. If x = 6 and y = 5, then A = 60/6 = 10 and B = 60/5 = 12. The sum of A and B is 10 + 12 = 22, which does not equal 50. 2. If x = 5 and y = 4, then A = 60/5 = 12 and B = 60/4 = 15. The sum of A and B is 12 + 15 = 27, which does not equal 50. 3. If x = 4 and y = 3, then A = 60/4 = 15 and B = 60/3 = 20. The sum of A and B is 15 + 20 = 35, which does not equal 50. 4. If x = 3 and y = 2, then A = 60/3 = 20 and B = 60/2 = 30.

Therefore, the maximum value of the function f(x) is f(1)=- frac {1}{2}, and there is no minimum value.   (Ⅱ) Method 1: Let G(x)=F(x)-(mx-1)=ln x- frac {1}{2}mx^{2}+(1-m)x+1.   So G^{′}(x)= frac {1}{x}-mx+(1-m)= frac {-mx^{2}+(1-m)x+1}{x}.   When mleqslant 0, since x > 0, G′(x) > 0 so G(x) is an increasing function on (0,+infty),   and since G(1)=- frac {3}{2}m+2 > 0.

Let's analyze part (a). We are given two tangents to a circle, with points of tangency (A) and (B), and the point of intersection of the tangents is (C). We draw another tangent (l) that touches the circle at point (M), and intersects (AC) and (BC) at points (K) and (N) respectively. We need to find the ratio (frac{uv}{w^2}) where (u) and (v) are the distances from (A) and (B) to (l), and (w) is the distance from (C) to (l), given (angle ACB = alpha). 2. Define the following distances:    - (|AC| = |BC| = a),    - (|AK| = |KM| = x),    - (|BN| = |NM| = y). 3. From the geometry of the circle and tangents, it is evident:    [    frac{w^2}{uv} = frac{(a-x)(a-y)}{xy}.    ] 4. Using the Law of Cosines in (triangle CKN):    [    (x + y)^2 = (a - x)^2 + (a - y)^2 - 2(a - x)(a - y) cos alpha.    ] 5. After simplifying, we have:    [    x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = a^2 - 2ax + x^2 + a^2 - 2ay + y^2 - 2(a - x)(a - y) cos alpha.    ] 6. This simplifies further to:    [    2xy = -2ax - 2ay + 2a^2 - 2(a - x)(a - y) cos alpha.    ] 7. Rearrange to find (sin^2{frac{alpha}{2}}):    [    sin^2{frac{alpha}{2}} = frac{xy}{(a-x)(a-y)}.    ] 8. Thus, the desired ratio is:    [    frac{uv}{w^2} = sin^2{frac{alpha}{2}}.    ] [ boxed{sin^2{frac{alpha}{2}}} ] Next for part (b): 1. Given a polygon inscribed around a circle, and line (l) which is a tangent to the circle but not coinciding with any of the polygon’s sides, we need to prove that the ratio of the product of distances from the vertices of the polygon to (l) to the product of distances from the tangency points (of the polygon’s sides with the circle) to (l) is independent of the position of (l). 2. Using the result from part (a), for each angle (alpha_i) of the polygon:    [    frac{uv}{w^2} = sin^2{frac{alpha}{2}}.    ] 3. Multiplying the corresponding distances for each angle in the (n)-sided polygon:    [    left( frac{x_1^2}{y_{2n} y_1} = frac{1}{sin^2 frac{alpha_1}{2}}, frac{x_2^2}{y_1 y_2} = frac{1}{sin^2 frac{alpha_2}{2}}, ldots, frac{x_{2n}^2}{y_{2n-1} y_{2n}} = frac{1}{sin^2 frac{alpha_{2n}}{2}} right).    ] 4. Thus:    [    frac{x_1 x_2 ldots x_n}{y_1 y_2 ldots y_n} = frac{1}{sin{frac{alpha_1}{2}} sin{frac{alpha_2}{2}} ldots sin{frac{alpha_n}{2}}}.    ]    Therefore, the ratio remains constant and does not depend on the position of (l). [ blacksquare ] Lastly for part (c): 1. Again applying the result from part (a):    [    frac{u v}{w^2} = sin^2{frac{alpha}{2}}.    ] 2. We denote the distances from each polygon vertex (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2n}) to the line (l) as (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{2n}) respectively, and (y_1, y_2, ldots, y_{2n}) the distances from the tangency points (B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{2n}) to (l). 3. For all distance relationships, considering the result and angles guarantees:    [    frac{x_1 x_3 ldots x_{2n-1}}{x_2 x_4 ldots x_{2n}} = frac{sin frac{alpha_2}{2} sin frac{alpha_4}{2} ldots sin frac{alpha_{2n}}{2}}{sin frac{alpha_1}{2} sin frac{alpha_3}{2} ldots sin frac{alpha_{2n-1}}{2}}.    ] 4. Multiplying and simplifying gives the consistent relationship amongst products of distances to line (l) from odd-numbered and even-numbered vertices. 5.

Thus, the side length of the square is ( boxed{2} ) centimeters."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],B={key:0},R={key:1};function F(n,e,h,p,o,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
