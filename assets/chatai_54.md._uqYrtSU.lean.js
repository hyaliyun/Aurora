The report found that demand for oil, gas, and coal is set to fall significantly in 2020, while demand for renewable energy is expected to continue to grow as governments invest in green infrastructure, such as wind and solar projects. However, the report also warned that a lack of investment in green technologies could lead to a rebound in fossil fuel consumption in the coming years.","output":"Renewable Energy Only Industry to Grow in 2020 Due to COVID-19 Impact, says International Energy Agency The International Energy Agency (IEA) released a report projecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the energy industry. The report states that renewable energy will be the only form of energy to experience growth this year. The demand for oil, gas, and coal is set to fall significantly in 2020 while demand for renewable energy is expected to continue growing due to government investment in green infrastructure. The report suggests that the investment in wind and solar projects has been increasing over the years and has been further accelerated in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. As per the report, India's renewable energy capacity will grow by 7.8 GW in 2020, and the world's renewable energy capacity is set to increase by almost 4%, despite the global pandemic. Although the growing demand for renewable energy in 2020 is a positive outcome, the IEA warned investors that a lack of investment in green technologies could lead to a rebound in fossil fuel consumption in the coming years. IEA executive director Fatih Birol stated that \\"Our report shows that the investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency can create jobs and stimulate economic growth while also enhancing energy security and addressing climate change. Governments need to take swift and decisive action to boost spending on these areas against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\" The report also highlights the importance of investing in new technologies such as batteries, carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen. These technologies could further decrease the costs of renewables whilst improving their reliability and increasing the world’s energy security. In summary, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global energy industry. The IEA report suggests that increasing investment in renewable energy is the only way forward if we are to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and avoid the negative consequences of climate change. Governments are urged to invest in renewable energy infrastructure, create a favorable policy environment and adopt green technologies as the world strives for sustainable growth."},{"instruction":"Write an expanded news article with plausible details from the following summary: A new study suggests that people who use cannabis are more likely to experience memory problems later in life, according to the Guardian. The study, carried out at the University of Bristol, found that people who used cannabis heavily in their teens and continued to use throughout adulthood experienced more problems with memory, attention, and cognitive function than those who had never used the drug. The researchers, however, cautioned that the study did not prove that cannabis use caused the cognitive problems, as other factors such as depression and alcohol use could also be involved. The study's lead author called for further research into the longterm effects of cannabis use.","output":"A new study conducted by the University of Bristol suggests that people who heavily used cannabis in their teenage years and continued to use throughout adulthood are more likely to experience memory problems later in life. The study found that these individuals experienced more issues with cognitive function, attention, and memory than those who had never used the drug. The research team, while cautioning that their study did not prove cannabis use as the direct cause of cognitive problems, stated that it could be a contributing factor. The study's lead author emphasized the need for more comprehensive research into the long-term effects of cannabis use. The study, which has been published in JAMA Internal Medicine, was conducted on a sample of over 3,800 individuals from the Bristol area who were part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Participants were questioned about their cannabis use at age 17, 24, and 32, and their cognitive functions were evaluated using a series of tests at age 44. The results showed that those who used cannabis heavily in their teenage years and continued to use it throughout adulthood had lower cognitive scores than those who had never used the drug. They were also found to have more issues with memory, attention, and cognitive function. The researchers noted that the effects were more pronounced in those who used cannabis regularly and over extended periods. The study's lead author, Prof. Marcus Munafò, stated that while their research did not prove cannabis use as the direct cause of memory problems later in life, other factors such as depression and alcohol use could also be involved. He reiterated the need for further research into the long-term effects of cannabis use and noted that the potential harms and benefits of the drug use should be weighed carefully by policymakers and individuals. The study comes at a time when the legalization and decriminalization of cannabis are being debated worldwide. Prof. Munafò believes that their research adds weight to the argument that cannabis use needs to be treated as a public health issue rather than a criminal one. With more and more people using cannabis across the globe, the findings of the study could help shape future policies and regulations."},{"instruction":"Paraphrase the following sentence: The report predicted that the economy would experience a slight downturn in the next quarter.","output":"The report forecasted a minor decline in the economy for the upcoming quarter."},{"instruction":"Give an example.

Given that overrightarrow{a} is a unit vector, we have |overrightarrow{a}| = 1. Substituting overrightarrow{b} into the given equation, we get: [ |overrightarrow{a} + lambdaoverrightarrow{a}| - |lambdaoverrightarrow{a}| = |(1 + lambda)overrightarrow{a}| - lambda|overrightarrow{a}| ] Since |overrightarrow{a}| = 1, this simplifies to: [ (1 + lambda) - lambda = 1 ] This shows that the condition \\"|overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|-|overrightarrow{b}|=1\\" is satisfied when overrightarrow{b} = lambdaoverrightarrow{a} with lambda > 0. Thus, the condition is necessary. # Sufficiency To test for sufficiency, consider overrightarrow{b} = overrightarrow{0}. In this case, lambda = 0, which does not satisfy the initial assumption of lambda > 0.

(I) We need to solve the inequality f(x) = |x-2| + |x+1| > 4 by considering different ranges of x based on the sign changes in the expression. - For x > 2, the inequality reduces to (x-2) + (x+1) > 4, which simplifies to 2x - 1 > 4. Solving for x, we get x > frac{5}{2}. So, for x > 2, the solution is x > 2.5. - For -1 leq x leq 2, we have to look at the inequality -(x-2) + (x+1) > 4.

Since ( 3125 = 5^5 ), it is evident that ( 31253125 ) (which is ( 3125 times 10001 )) is divisible by ( 3125 ), due to the properties of multiplication and powers. 3. **Ensuring ( A ) is Divisible by the Sum of its Digits:**    We need to confirm that there exists a number ( A ), a 1000-digit number, whose sum of digits also sums to ( 3125 ). The remainder of the digits that contribute to ( A ) should total to ensure this divisibility condition. 4. **Constructing the 1000-Digit Number:**    We need to find the sum of the remaining digits aside from the last 8 digits (which sums to 20 for 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5):    [    3125 - 20 = 3105    ]    Now, we need to distribute the remaining ( 3105 ) across ( 992 ) digits (as 1000 - 8 = 992). 5. **Digits Calculation:**    To construct a number with such properties, we can use a combination of 4s and 3s to sum up to:    [    text{Let } a text{ be the count of 4s and } b text{ be the count of 3s.}    ]    [    4a + 3b = 3105     ]    We also need:    [    a + b = 992    ]    Solving these two equations simultaneously:    [    4a + 3 (992 - a) = 3105 Rightarrow 4a + 2976 - 3a = 3105 Rightarrow a = 3105 - 2976 = 129 Rightarrow a = 129    ]    [    b = 992 - 129 = 863    ] 6. **Constructing the Exact Number:**    Thus, we can construct the number ( A ) using 129 occurrences of 4 and 863 occurrences of 3, in combination with the suffix 31253125. The number ( A ) does indeed conform to having the digit sum exactly equal to ( 3125 ). # Conclusion: Therefore, there exists a 1000-digit natural number consisting of non-zero digits, which is divisible by the sum of its digits.

This results in: [-3x < -3y] Thus, option B is also always true given x > y. **Option C: x^2 > y^2** This option requires careful consideration. The statement x^2 > y^2 is not necessarily true for all x > y. For instance, if x = -2 and y = -3, we have x > y, but x^2 = 4 < 9 = y^2. Therefore, the truth of x^2 > y^2 depends on the values of x and y, and it is not universally true for all x > y.

Let's consider two consecutive terms in the product: (logₐb)(logₐ₊₁b₊₁) Using the change of base formula, we can rewrite logₐ₊₁b₊₁ as: logₐ₊₁b₊₁ = logₐb₊₁ / logₐa₊₁ Now, let's apply this to the first two terms of the product: (log₂3)(log₃4) = (log₂3)(log₂4 / log₂3) = log₂4 / log₂2 = log₂4 = 2 Notice that log₂3 in the denominator cancels out with log₂3 in the numerator of the next term. This pattern continues for all terms in the product, with each term canceling out the previous term, except for the first numerator and the last denominator.

Assume that ( ab + cd ) is a prime number, denoted by ( p ). 1. **Existence of Inverses Modulo ( p )**:    Since ( p ) is a prime number, the integers ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ) have multiplicative inverses modulo ( p ). This is because ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ) are all less than ( p ) and ( gcd(a, p) = gcd(b, p) = gcd(c, p) = gcd(d, p) = 1 ). 2. **Initial Equation and Substitution**:    Given the equation:    [    a^2 + ac - c^2 = b^2 + bd - d^2    ]    and assuming ( p = ab + cd ), we have:    [    ab + cd equiv 0 pmod{p} implies a equiv -frac{cd}{b} pmod{p}    ]    Substituting ( a equiv -frac{cd}{b} ) into the given equation, we get:    [    left( -frac{cd}{b} right)^2 + left( -frac{cd}{b} right)c - c^2 equiv b^2 + bd - d^2 pmod{p}    ]    Simplifying, we find:    [    frac{c^2d^2}{b^2} - frac{c^2d}{b} - c^2 equiv b^2 + bd - d^2 pmod{p}    ]    Multiplying through by ( b^2 ) to clear the denominators, we obtain:    [    c^2d^2 - c^2bd - c^2b^2 equiv b^4 + b^3d - b^2d^2 pmod{p}    ] 3. **Collecting Terms**:    Collecting like terms, we get:    [    left( b^2 + c^2 right) left( b^2 + bd - d^2 right) equiv 0 pmod{p}    ]    This implies that either ( p mid b^2 + c^2 ) or ( p mid b^2 + bd - d^2 ). 4. **Case 1: ( p mid b^2 + c^2 )**:    If ( p mid b^2 + c^2 ), then:    [    left( a^2 + d^2 right) left( b^2 + c^2 right) = left( ab + cd right)^2 + left( ac - bd right)^2    ]    Since ( p mid b^2 + c^2 ) and ( ab + cd = p ), it follows that ( p mid ac - bd ). However, since ( a > b > c > d geq 1 ), we have ( 0 < ac - bd < ab + cd ), thus ( p nmid ac - bd ). This is a contradiction. 5. **Case 2: ( p mid b^2 + bd - d^2 )**:    If ( p mid b^2 + bd - d^2 ), then ( p mid a^2 + ac - c^2 ). Since ( b^2 + bd - d^2 < 2p ), we have:    [    p = b^2 + bd - d^2 = a^2 + ac - c^2    ]    Using ( ab + cd = b^2 + bd - d^2 ), we find:    [    b(a - b) = d(b - c - d)    ]    Since ( a - b > 0 ), it follows that ( b > c + d ). Now, using ( ab + cd = a^2 + ac - c^2 ), we obtain:    [    a(a - b) = c(c + d - a)    ]    This yields ( c + d - a > 0 ), that is ( c + d > a ). Combining these, we find ( b > c + d > a ), but we are given ( a > b ). This is a contradiction.

Since the tax is 10%, we can represent the amount she earned before tax as 100% (the full amount before tax) and her earnings after tax as 90% (since 10% is taken away). Let ( x ) be the amount she earned before tax. Then, 90% of ( x ) is equal to 276 (her earnings after tax).

A snail number is defined as a number whose digits can be rearranged to form three consecutive natural numbers. 2. **Defining the constraints**:      - Given that we need a four-digit number, the three consecutive numbers must be 8, 9, 10. Any combination of smaller or larger sets of three consecutive numbers would result in either a three-digit or five-digit number.      - Hence, snail numbers such as 7,8,9 or 9,10,11 will not give us a four-digit number when concatenated in any order. 3. **Constructing the number**: We now need to find the valid four-digit number that can be created using the digits of 8, 9, 10 concatenated in some order.     - The possible four-digit numbers using the digits 8, 9, 10 include sequences like 8109, 1089, etc. 4. **Checking for squares**:     - Note that the last digit of a perfect square cannot be 8 or 0 (as valid square numbers end in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9).     - Therefore, considering both potential combinations and their arrangement gives us:         - 8109:  Its square root would be checked as sqrt{8109} approx 90.04, which is not a perfect square.         - 1089: Check sqrt{1089} = 33, confirming that 1089 = 33^2.

Therefore, the total number of stones removed after ( n ) divisions is ( n ). 2. **Counting Piles:**    - Every division splits one pile into two, thus increasing the total number of piles by 1.    - If he started with one pile, after ( n ) divisions, he will have ( n+1 ) piles. 3. **Final Countdown of Stones:**    - If the final goal is to have all ( n+1 ) piles consisting of exactly 3 stones, then the total number of stones needed will be ( 3(n+1) ). 4. **Total Stones Calculation:**    - Initial number of stones: 1001.    - Total stones removed: ( n ).    - Total stones needed for ( n+1 ) piles of 3 stones: ( 3(n+1) ). 5. **Equating Stones:**    [    3(n+1) = 1001 - n    ]    [    3n + 3 = 1001 - n    ]    [    3n + n + 3 = 1001    ]    [    4n + 3 = 1001    ]    [    4n = 998    ]    [    n = frac{998}{4}    ]    [    n = 249.5    ] Since ( n ) must be an integer (you can't make half a division), and since ( n = 249.5 ) is not an integer, there does not exist an integer ( n ) which would make the equation true.

The key to solving the problem is to understand that the distance from the focus is equal to the distance from the directrix. This relationship transforms the problem of finding the chord length into a problem of finding the distance from a point to a line, significantly reducing the difficulty of solving the problem. **Solution** Given: x^2 = 4y, the focus is at (0,1). Let the line passing through the focus (0,1) be y = kx + 1, Then, set kx + 1 = frac{x^2}{4}, Which gives x^2 - 4kx - 4 = 0, By Vieta's formulas, we have x_1 + x_2 = 4k, x_1x_2 = -4, y_1 = kx_1 + 1, y_2 = kx_2 + 1, Thus, y_1 + y_2 = k(x_1 + x_2) + 2 = 4k^2 + 2 = 6, Therefore, k^2 = 1, Hence, |AB| = |x_1 - x_2| sqrt{k^2 + 1} = sqrt{(k^2 + 1)[(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2]} = sqrt{2(16k^2 + 16)} = sqrt{2 times 32} = 8.

This implies that (T) lies on the radical axis of the circumcircles of (triangle PAE) and (triangle PBC).    - Therefore, (T) lies on the radical axis (overline{PQ}).    - By the power of a point theorem, we have (TP cdot TQ = TM cdot TD). 4. **Conclusion:**    - Since (TP cdot TQ = TM cdot TD), it follows that (D, P, Q, M) are concyclic.    - The circumcenter (R) of (triangle DPQ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of (overline{DM}).    - The perpendicular bisector of (overline{DM}) is a fixed line because (D) and (M) are fixed points on the circumcircle of (ABCDE).

After a 25% reduction, the new price per kg becomes 0.75P. We are given that the reduced price per kg is Rs. 35, so we can write: 0.75P = 35 Now, we can solve for P: P = 35 / 0.75 P = 3500 / 75 P = 46.67 (rounded to two decimal places) This means the original price per kg of oil was Rs. 46.67. Now, we know that with the 25% reduction in price, the housewife can get 5 kgs more oil. Let's denote the original amount of oil she could buy as X kgs. So, at the original price, she would spend: Original expenditure = P * X At the reduced price, she gets 5 kgs more, so she buys X + 5 kgs. The total amount she spends at the reduced price is: Reduced expenditure = 35 * (X + 5) We know that the original expenditure and the reduced expenditure should be the same because the amount of money she spends on oil does not change, only the quantity she gets for that money changes. So we can set the two expenditures equal to each other: P * X = 35 * (X + 5) Substitute the value of P we found earlier: 46.67 * X = 35 * (X + 5) Now, let's solve for X: 46.67X = 35X + 175 46.67X - 35X = 175 11.67X = 175 X = 175 / 11.67 X = 15 (rounded to the nearest whole number) So, originally, the housewife could buy 15 kgs of oil. At the reduced price, she can buy 15 + 5 = 20 kgs of oil.

Solution Enhancement: Given the periodicity of trigonometric functions, we only need to consider one minimum positive period. Let's take (x in [0, 2pi]). There are two cases to consider: 1. When (frac{pi}{4} leq x leq frac{3pi}{4}), we have (sin x geq cos x), so according to the given operation, (f(x) = cos x). In this case, the range of (f(x)) is (left[-1, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right]). 2. When (0 leq x < frac{pi}{4}) or (frac{3pi}{4} < x leq 2pi), we have (cos x > sin x), so (f(x) = sin x). In this case, the range of (f(x)) is (left[0, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right] cup left[-1, 0right]).

Thus, we have: [ m + 1 neq 0 ] Solving this inequality for m gives us: [ m neq -1 ] Since the problem asks for a specific value of m that satisfies the condition, and considering that m can be any number except -1, we can choose a simple value for m that is not -1.

Our goal is to prove that from each set, we can select one disk such that the 333 chosen disks are also pairwise disjoint. 2. **Choosing Disk K:**    - Select the disk with the smallest radius from all disks available across all sets. Denote this disk by K.    - Let the center of K be O and its radius be r. 3. **Intersection Argument:**    - Assume disk K_1 (center O_1, radius r_1 geq r) and disk K_2 (center O_2, radius r_2 geq r) intersect with K.    - Since K_1 and K_2 are disjoint, the distance between their centers satisfies      [      O_1O_2 geq r_1 + r_2.      ]    - If K_1 intersects with K, the distance between the centers O and O_1 satisfies      [      OO_1 < r + r_1.      ]    - Similarly, if K_2 intersects with K, then      [      OO_2 < r + r_2.      ] 4. **Geometric Constraint:**    - Combining the inequalities derived:      [      OO_1 < r + r_1 leq O_1O_2,      ]      [      OO_2 < r + r_2 leq O_1O_2.      ]    - In triangle O O_1 O_2, since O_1 O_2 is the greatest side, the angle angle O_1 O O_2 is the largest and exceeds 60^circ. 5. **Counting Disks Using the Angle Argument:**    - If there were six or more disjoint disks intersecting K, then at least one pair's centers would form an angle at O of leq 60^circ, contradicting our earlier conclusion. Hence, at most 5 disjoint disks can intersect K. 6. **Selection Process:**    - Select K as one of the 333 desired disks.    - Remove the set containing K.    - From the remaining 332 sets, eliminate disks that intersect with K. Each set will have at least (1995 - 5 = 1990) remaining disks. 7. **Iteration and Completeness:**    - Repeat the process: Select another disk with the smallest radius from the remaining disks ensuring it is disjoint from previously chosen disks.    - Continue the selection process until you have 333 disks. For set number n, there will always be at least (1995 - 5(n-1)) disks remaining after elimination, so by step 332, at least 335 disks will remain. 8. **Conclusion:**    - Having chosen 333 disks through iterative selection while systematically removing intersecting disks from consideration, we ensure that all 333 disks remain pairwise disjoint.

Therefore, it is impossible for the above two cases to happen simultaneously. 5. **Possible values of the number of acquaintances**:    - Since the values 0 and ( n-1 ) cannot simultaneously be represented, the possible number of known interns must therefore range either:      - from 1 to ( n-1 ), or       - from 0 to ( n-2 ). 6. **Applying the pigeonhole principle**:    - In either scenario, there are only ( n-1 ) distinct values for the number of acquaintances.    - Since there are ( n ) interns and only ( n-1 ) distinct values for the acquaintance count, by the pigeonhole principle (which states that if ( n ) items are placed into ( m ) containers, with ( n > m ), then at least one container must contain more than one item), at least two interns must have the same number of acquaintances.     7. **Conclusion**:    [    boxed{} text{Thus, among the interns at the Animath camp, there must be at least two interns who know exactly the same number of other interns.}    ]"},{"instruction":"What is the first year after 2010 for which the sum of the digits equals 15?","output":"We start by examining the years sequentially from 2010, but to efficiently find the first year where the sum of the digits equals 15, let’s strategically choose the digits: - Begin with the thousands digit fixed at 2 (as the year must be after 2010). - Choose the highest possible units digit first to quickly increase the sum, which is 9. - From here, the sum is 2 + 0 + 1 + 9 = 12. - We need an additional 3 to reach the sum of 15.

Hence, the second player wins in this scenario.    2. **General Case - ( m times n ) Rectangle**:    - For rectangles larger than ( 1 times 1 ), we analyze the structure and consider the process:      - The game is governed by choosing nodes and hachuring cells that lie to the top-right of the chosen node.      - We claim that the first player has a winning strategy in all cases where ( n > 1 ) or ( m > 1 ). 3. **Existence of a Winning Strategy for One Player**:    - This can be inferred via a contradiction argument leveraging a strategy-stealing method:      - Suppose, for contradiction, that the second player has a winning strategy for a general ( m times n ) rectangle.      - The first player can initially make a non-impactful move by hachuring only the top-right corner cell, effectively reducing the game to the same ( m times n ) rectangle minus this single cell. 4. **Strategy-Stealing Argument**:    - If the second player indeed has a winning strategy, then after the first player's minimal move (hachuring only one cell), the second player should still have a winning move for the same reduced ( m times n ) grid.    - The first player, using the strategy of the second player, can then proceed to make the winning move that the second player would have made. Since the top-right corner is already hachured, the crucial property of the remaining grid doesn't change the beneficial properties hypothesized for the second player. 5. **Contradiction Establishment**:    - This approach implies that the first player can mimic the presumed winning strategy of the second player by hachuring one minimal cell and then playing identically as the second player after that initial move.     - However, this contradicts the assumption that the second player had a winning strategy from the original state because the first player can always yield the same result by simulating the second player's strategy effectively. 6. **Conclusion**:    - The contradiction indicates that our assumption (that the second player has a winning strategy) is false.    - Therefore, the first player must be the one who has a winning strategy for general ( m times n ) rectangles (where either ( m > 1 ) or ( n > 1 )).

If we consider a convex ( n )-gon where ( n ) is odd, the number of sides cannot be paired off completely without leaving out at least one side. This is because the number of sides is odd, and pairing requires an even number of sides. 4. In a convex polygon, the sides can be visualized as trying to pair themselves for being parallel. However:    - For an odd-numbered sided convex polygon, it is impossible to pair every side uniquely with another parallel side. 5. For a polygon to be dissectible into parallelograms, each of its sides must be exactly paired with another side that runs parallel to it. This is a necessary condition because parallelograms have opposites sides that are parallel. 6. Therefore, if it is required to dissect a convex polygon into parallelograms, for every side of the polygon, there must exist exactly one other side that is parallel.  7. For a convex polygon with an odd number of sides:    - If we try to pair all sides, we will always have one side left unpaired, violating the necessary condition that each side must have a parallel counterpart. 8. In the specific case of a 13-gon (n = 13), the number of sides is odd hence, there will always be one side without a parallel pair, making it impossible to dissect the 13-gon into parallelograms.

Case 1: 1 move on the top row - There are 5 ways to make 1 move on the top row from the starting point (moving to each of the five faces). - For each face on the top row, there are 2 adjacent faces on the bottom row.

If Vasily can place a card of the same suit or the same rank as the previous card, he scores 1 point. What is the maximum number of points that Vasily can guarantee for himself?","output":"We are asked to determine the maximum number of points Vassily can guarantee themselves in this card game against Polina. Let's break down the problem step by step. 1. **Set-up and Given Information:**    - There are 36 cards divided into 4 suits: each suit has 9 cards.    - Polina selects half of the cards (18 cards) and so does Vassily.    - Players take turns placing cards on the table, face up.    - Polina starts first.    - Vassily scores a point every time they place a card of the same suit or the same rank as Polina's previously placed card. 2. **Strategy for Selecting Cards:**    - To maximize Vassily's points, Polina can try to hinder Vassily's ability to score by cleverly choosing her 18 cards.    - One possible disruptive strategy Polina can use is to keep all cards of a single suit, say, all the Red Peaches (Hearts). In this way, when she places one of those cards, Vassily will not have the same suit to match. 3. **Calculating the Minimum Points Vassily Can Secure:**    - We will now analyze the game from Vassily’s perspective, assuming Polina uses the optimal strategy to minimize Vassily's chances.    **Row-Column Analysis:**    - Let's imagine all the cards in a 4 times 9 table, where each row represents cards of the same suit and each column cards of the same rank.      \`\`\`      4 suits (rows) × 9 ranks (columns)      \`\`\`    - If Polina holds all cards of one suit and the highest ranks (e,g., Aces, Kings, and Queens), that leaves Vassily 27 cards, in a worst-case scenario, Polina limits Vassily's scoring opportunities. 4. **Secure Minimum Points via Combination Patterns:**    - Even under the worst division of cards, consider a 4 times 9 grid colored in a pattern (e.g., stripes), by pairing opposite positions:      - When Polina plays a card, Vassily can find appropriate matches out of his remaining cards.    - Vassily can create combinations and pairs to guarantee at least a minimum secure score by ensuring:      - Polina’s moves can create 15 such \\"good pairs\\". 5. **Verification Using Graph/Bipartite Matching:**    - Analyzing possible pairings, we observe that for any arrangement by Polina, Vassily can ensure a sufficient set of opposite matches that renders at least:      - Each pair secured ensures one point.      For example:      \`\`\`      Analyzing 2-type columns...      \`\`\`      Results that if playing values fitting into secure sets, Vassily will achieve at least 15 pairs. 6. **Conclusion:**    - In each case by Polina, Vassily should be able to secure in any distribution a minimum number at least 15 pairs/opportunities for matching moves.

A regular tetrahedron is a polyhedron with four congruent equilateral triangular faces. A fundamental property of a regular tetrahedron is that it is a centrosymmetric figure, i.e., there exists a central point that is equidistant from all vertices. When a plane passes through the centroid of a regular tetrahedron and is perpendicular to a line connecting this centroid with one of the vertices, the plane will intersect the tetrahedron and divide it into two bodies with identical shape and size. Let's analyze the reasons to support this solution step-by-step: 1. Identify the regular tetrahedron as a centrosymmetric geometric body, which has a unique central point equidistant from all vertices. 2. Realize that any plane containing the centroid of the regular tetrahedron will intersect the figure and create two congruent sections. This is because the plane will \\"mirror\\" at the centroid. 3.

The principles we use on the grid are equally applicable to the infinite plane. 2. **First Vertical Line**:    Let's consider the first vertical line, denoted as ( l_1 ). According to the Pigeonhole Principle, because we have an infinite number of intersections (points) on ( l_1 ) and only three possible colors, there must exist an infinite subset of points on ( l_1 ) that are of the same color. Let's denote this common color as ( A ). 3. **Horizontal Lines from ( l_1 )**:    We then consider the infinite number of horizontal lines that pass through these points of color ( A ) on ( l_1 ). 4. **Second Vertical Line**:    Next, we examine a second vertical line, denoted as ( l_2 ). By the Pigeonhole Principle, this line also contains an infinite number of points of some color. There are two cases to consider:        - **Case 1: Common Color ( A )**:      If the infinite points on ( l_2 ) have the color ( A ), then we can form an infinite number of rectangles whose vertices are all of color ( A ). This is because for each point of color ( A ) on ( l_2 ), the corresponding horizontal line intersects with a point of color ( A ) from ( l_1 ).    - **Case 2: Different Color ( B )**:      If the points on ( l_2 ) are of a different color, say ( B ), we now focus on the infinite number of horizontal lines that connect points of color ( A ) on ( l_1 ) with points of color ( B ) on ( l_2 ). 5. **Third Vertical Line**:    We now consider a third vertical line, ( l_3 ). By the Pigeonhole Principle, ( l_3 ) contains an infinite number of points of a single color. The scenarios to analyze here are similar:        - **Color ( A ) or ( B )**:      If the points on ( l_3 ) are of color ( A ) or ( B ), we are done, since we already considered intersections leading to rectangles formable from these colors.    - **New Color ( C )**:      If the points are of color ( C ), we use the same logic and now consider the infinite horizontal lines passing through the respective points colored ( A ) on ( l_1 ) and ( B ) on ( l_2 ). 6. **Fourth Vertical Line**:    Finally, consider a fourth vertical line, ( l_4 ). Again, by the Pigeonhole Principle, this line will also contain an infinite number of points of a single color. Given that we are working with a finite number of colors (three in this case), we will find a finite number of rectangles with vertices of the same color.

Next, subtract the angle of the equilateral triangle (BTC):    [    angle BCT = 60^circ.    ]    Hence:    [    angle TCD = 98^circ - 60^circ = 38^circ.    ] 10.

(III) If an isosceles triangle PAB is constructed with AB as its base and P as its apex at (3, 2), find the area of △PAB.","output":"(I) From the given information, we have c = 2 sqrt {2} and frac {c}{a} = frac { sqrt {6}}{3}. Solving these equations gives a = 2 sqrt {3}. Since b^{2} = a^{2} - c^{2}, we get b^{2} = 4, which implies b = 2. Thus, the standard equation of the ellipse is frac {x^{2}}{12} + frac {y^{2}}{4} = 1. (II) If the y-intercept of line l is m, then the equation of the line is y = x + m. Substituting y = x + m into the equation of the ellipse, we get: 4x^{2} + 6mx + 3m^{2} - 12 = 0. For the line to intersect the ellipse, the discriminant △ = 36m^{2} - 16(3m^{2} - 12) > 0. Solving this inequality, we get -4 < m < 4. Thus, the range of real values for m is (-4, 4). (III) Let the coordinates of A and B be (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), respectively. Let E be the midpoint of AB with coordinates (x₀, y₀). Then, x₁ + x₂ = -frac {3m}{2} and y₁ + y₂ = frac {m}{2}. Thus, x₀ = -frac {3m}{4} and y₀ = frac {m}{2}. Since AB is the base of the isosceles triangle PAB, PE is perpendicular to AB, which implies the slope of PE is -1. Hence, frac {2- frac {m}{4}}{-3+ frac {3m}{4}} = -1. Solving this equation, we get m = 2. The length of AB, |AB|, can be found using the distance formula: |AB| = sqrt {1+k^{2}} • sqrt {(x_{1}+x_{2})^{2}-4x_{1}x_{2}} = 3 sqrt {2}.
