Hence, we have:  a < log_{4}4 = 1  Now, let's examine b:  b = log_{3}4  In this case, 4 is greater than the base 3, so b must be greater than 1. Thus, we get:  b > log_{3}3 = 1  Finally, for c, we can use the change of base formula or understand that since both the base and the argument are reciprocal to each other, the log value must be negative, and since any real number is greater than a negative number, we have:  c = log_{frac{3}{4}} frac{4}{3}  Since frac{4}{3} is greater than the base frac{3}{4}, and considering the fact that increasing functions would normally imply that c > 1, we need to recognize that this is a logarithm with a base smaller than 1 (0 < frac{3}{4} < 1), which in turn means the function is decreasing.

For each k, digit a_k occurs a_{30-k} times in the representation of the number. 1. **Understanding the Condition:**    - Each digit a_k at position k occurs a_{30-k} times, and vice versa.    - For example, if a_{10} = 7, then digit 7 occurs a_{20} times, thus a_{20} = 7. 2. **Analyzing Occurrence:**     - This implies that the digits at index positions (k, 30 - k) pair up and satisfy the equation k(a) = a(b) and k(b) = a(a).    - Therefore, each of these pairs will have their occurrences being symmetric around the center of the number. 3. **Center Digit Consideration:**    - With 29 digits, the center position is 15, making a_{15} likely having an odd occurrence if it remains symmetric about this digit. 4. **Total Count Redaction:**    - Given from the problem and met conditions, reduce these to relevant variable counts:     [     k(2) + k(4) + k(6) + k(8) + k(9) = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 29     ] 5. **Sum of Squares Calculation:**    - Digit counts and their respective square sums are as follows:      - 2 occurs 2 times.      - 4 occurs 4 times.      - 6 occurs 6 times.      - 8 occurs 8 times.      - 9 occurs 9 times. 6. **Final Computation:**    - Computing the sum of squares:      [      2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 = 4 + 16 + 36 + 64 + 81 = 201      ] # Conclusion: [boxed{201}]"},{"instruction":"An investment bank gives 10 percent interest at the end of every month.

We start by identifying the relationship between the side length (a) of the tetrahedron and the radius (r) of the circumcircle of its base.

By the Law of Sines, we have frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B}. Since sin B = 2sin Acos A, we can substitute sin B with 2sin Acos A in the Law of Sines to get frac{b}{2sin Acos A} = frac{a}{sin A}.

Substituting cos A in the expression for b, we get b = 6 times frac{b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}}{2bc} = frac{3(b^{2}+c^{2}-9)}{bc}. Rearranging and simplifying, we find that b^{2} = 9+3c.

This pattern repeats every 20 minutes (10 minutes for quick changes + 10 minutes for slow changes). Now, let's calculate how many 20-minute cycles there are in two hours: Two hours is 120 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes). 120 minutes / 20 minutes per cycle = 6 cycles.

Consider two cases: 1) All elements of  T  are irrational numbers. 2) At least one element of  T  is a rational number.","output":"# Case 1: All elements of ( T ) are irrational numbers 1. **Assume the form of the set ( T )**:    Since ( p(T) - a ) is an odd integer for any ( a in T ), we can infer that the difference between any two elements of ( T ) must be an even integer. Therefore, we assume the set ( T ) is of the form:    [    T = {x, x+2, x+4, ldots, x+2 cdot 2020}    ]    where ( x ) is an irrational number. 2. **Existence of a root**:    Consider the polynomial equation formed by the product of the elements of ( T ):    [    x(x+2)(x+4) cdots (x+4040) = x + 1    ]    Since the degree of the polynomial on the left-hand side is odd (2021), it must have at least one real root. By the Rational Root Theorem, if this root were rational, it would have to be ( pm 1 ). However, due to the size and nature of the polynomial, it is clear that ( pm 1 ) cannot be roots. Therefore, there exists an irrational root ( x_0 ). 3. **Conclusion for irrational numbers**:    The set ( {x_0, x_0+2, ldots, x_0+4040} ) satisfies the condition that ( p(T) - a ) is an odd integer for any ( a in T ). # Case 2: At least one element of ( T ) is a rational number 1. **Assume the form of the set ( T )**:    By the same logic as before, the elements of ( T ) must differ by an even integer.

This implies ( a = 0 ), meaning the rational numbers have no denominator and are integers. 3. **Modulo 2 argument**:    Since the elements are integers differing by an even amount, consider the product modulo 2. If all elements are odd, then:    [    p(T) equiv 1 cdot 1 cdot ldots cdot 1 equiv 1 pmod{2}    ]    and:    [    p(T) - a equiv 1 - 1 equiv 0 pmod{2}    ]    If all elements are even, then:    [    p(T) equiv 0 cdot 0 cdot ldots cdot 0 equiv 0 pmod{2}    ]    and:    [    p(T) - a equiv 0 - 0 equiv 0 pmod{2}    ]    In both cases, ( p(T) - a ) cannot be an odd integer, leading to a contradiction. 4. **Conclusion for rational numbers**:    It is impossible to have at least one rational number in the set ( T ) while satisfying the given condition.

Thus, a direction vector for the line is (2, -1).

Thus, (X, A, E) are collinear. 5. **Cyclic Quadrilaterals**:     - Given the conditions:         [         angle DHE = angle XHE = 90^circ         ]         and         [         angle XFE = angle DFE = 90^circ         ]         because ( DX ) is a diameter, ensuring (X, F, E, H) is cyclic.     - Similarly,         [         angle EAD = 90^circ         ] 6. **Angle Chasing Among Cycles**:     - Using angle chasing:         [         angle AHE = angle ADH = angle AXF = angle EXF = angle EHF         ]         where the equalities come from the cyclic quadrilaterals (ADHE), (ADX F) and (XFHE).     - Verify:         [         angle DFH = angle EFH = angle EXH = angle AFD = angle AFE         ]         derived from the cyclic quadrilaterals (XFHE) and (ADXF). 7. **Conclusion**:     - This shows that (E) is the incenter of ( triangle A F H ), as desired. Hence, we can conclude: (boxed{})"},{"instruction":"A particular library has 75 books in a special collection, all of which were in the library at the beginning of the month.

We need to find the number of such permutations and then compute the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.  Step-by-step Analysis: 1. **Understanding the Problem:**    - We have a permutation (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{30}) of the numbers 1 through 30.    - For each m in {2, 3, 5}, and for all valid n, m divides a_{n+m} - a_n. 2. **Interpreting the Conditions:**    - The condition m divides a_{n+m} - a_n implies that a_{n+m} equiv a_n pmod{m}.    - This means that elements of the permutation that are m positions apart must be congruent modulo m. 3. **Using Modular Arithmetic:**    - For each m in {2, 3, 5}, the sequence is divided into subsequences where indices are congruent modulo m.    - Each subsequence must consist of elements that are all congruent to each other modulo m. 4. **Counting Valid Assignments:**    - For m = 2, there are 2 subsequences (odd and even indexed), and each can be assigned numbers that are either all even or all odd modulo 2. There are 2! = 2 ways to assign these.    - For m = 3, there are 3 subsequences, and each can be assigned numbers that are congruent to 0, 1, or 2 modulo 3. There are 3! = 6 ways to assign these.    - For m = 5, there are 5 subsequences, and each can be assigned numbers that are congruent to 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 modulo 5. There are 5! = 120 ways to assign these. 5. **Applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):**    - Since 2, 3, and 5 are pairwise coprime, and their product is 30, the assignments modulo 2, 3, and 5 independently determine the permutation.    - By CRT, each unique set of assignments modulo 2, 3, and 5 corresponds to a unique permutation of the numbers 1 through 30. 6. **Calculating Total Permutations:**    - The total number of valid permutations is the product of the number of ways to assign residues modulo 2, 3, and 5, which is 2! cdot 3! cdot 5! = 2 cdot 6 cdot 120 = 1440. 7. **Finding the Remainder:**    - The remainder when 1440 is divided by 1000 is 440.

How many apples can Emmy and Gerry buy altogether at most?","output":"First, let's calculate the discounted price for apples when buying 10 or more. The discount is 20% off the 2 price, so each apple would cost: 2 - (2 * 20%) = 2 - 0.40 = 1.60 per apple (when buying 10 or more) Now, let's calculate the minimum amount Emmy and Gerry have to spend to meet the constraint of having at least 5 bananas and 5 oranges: Bananas: 5 * 1 = 5 Oranges: 5 * 3 = 15 Total for 5 bananas and 5 oranges = 5 + 15 = 20 Emmy and Gerry each need to spend at least 20 to meet the minimum fruit requirement, leaving Emmy with 180 (200 - 20) and Gerry with 80 (100 - 20) to spend on apples. Since they want to maximize the number of apples and the discount applies to purchases of 10 apples or more, they should buy apples in multiples of 10 to take advantage of the discount. For Emmy: 180 / 1.60 = 112.5 apples Since Emmy can't buy half an apple, she can buy 112 apples (in multiples of 10, that would be 110 apples to maximize the discount and stay within budget). For Gerry: 80 / 1.60 = 50 apples Gerry can buy exactly 50 apples (in multiples of 10, that would be 50 apples to maximize the discount and stay within budget).

The road is 157 feet long, so we have 157 feet of space to work with. Now, we subtract the space taken up by the trees from the total space available to find out how much space is left for the gaps between the trees: 157 feet (total space) - 13 feet (space taken by trees) = 144 feet (space available for gaps) Since we want to have an equal amount of space between each tree, we need to divide the total space available for gaps by the number of gaps.

Given this arrangement, triangle E_{1} C F_{1} must also be isosceles because its sides are parallel to the sides of the isosceles triangle A B E_{1}. Consequently, we have:    [    E_{1} C = F_{1} C    ] 3. Notice triangles B C E_{1} and D F_{1} C and compare them:    - From the previous step, E_{1} C = F_{1} C so one pair of sides is equal.    - By construction, B E_{1} = A B = D C, hence another pair of sides is equal.    - Since B E_{1} and C F_{1} are parallel (by constructed parallelism), the angles between these sides and E_{1} C are also equal:      [      angle B E_{1} C = angle D C F_{1}      ] 4. From steps 2 and 3, triangles B C E_{1} and D F_{1} C are congruent by the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) criterion. 5. Therefore, we conclude that:    [    D F_{1} = B C    ] # 2 (Projections) # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. Similarly, confirm that triangle E_{1} C F_{1} is isosceles because E_{1} C = F_{1} C due to the symmetries of A B E_{1} and B E_{1} being parallel. 2. Consider the projection of line segment B C onto line A E_{1}:    - The projection of B C consists of half of segment A E_{1} and half of segment E_{1} F_{1}.    - Since the segment A E_{1} is in the same plane and subjected to the same symmetrical conditions, its half-length corresponding to B C confirms the parallelism and equal division of these line segments. 3. Given that B C and A D are equal parallel segments, their projections onto line A E_{1} must be identical since they cover similar segments. 4. Therefore, the projection of D F_{1}, under identical symmetrical and parallel conditions, splits A E_{1} in the same ratio yielding:    [    D F_{1} = B C    ] Conclusively, both solutions verify that D F_{1} = B C. The problem is resolved based on the equalizing properties of congruent triangles and parallel projections.

Each edge of the polyhedron that the polygonal chain does not pass through is counted twice in this sum, because it belongs to the boundary of two faces.

According to the problem statement, we have the relationship:    [    alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ.    ] 2. **Positioning and Projections:**    Place a point E along the segment AO such that AE = 1. This simplifies the scenario as we consider the projections of point E:    [    text{Projections of } E: quad     cos alpha text{ on } AB, quad cos beta text{ on } AD, quad cos gamma text{ on } AA^{prime}.    ]    Utilizing the theorem about the sum of the squares of projections in orthogonal systems, we state:    [    cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 gamma = 1.    ] 3. **Using the Angle Sum Identity:**    Since the sum of the angles alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ, we can express gamma in terms of alpha and beta:    [    gamma = 180^circ - alpha - beta.    ] 4. **Simplifying the Cosine Relationship:**    Substitute gamma = 180^circ - alpha - beta into the identity:    [    cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 (180^circ - alpha - beta) = 1,    ]    simplifying using properties of cosine:    [    cos^2 (180^circ - alpha - beta) = cos^2 (alpha + beta).    ]    Hence, we have:    [    cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 (alpha + beta) = 1.    ] 5. **Employing Trigonometric Identities and Simplification:**    Using the double-angle identity:    [    cos(2x) = 2 cos^2(x) - 1 implies cos^2(x) = frac{1 + cos(2x)}{2},    ]    apply this to simplify:    [    2 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^2 beta + 2 cos^2(alpha + beta) = 2.    ]    That expands to:    [    1 + cos(2alpha) + 1 + cos(2beta) + 1 + cos(2(alpha + beta)) = 2.    ]    Group similar terms:    [    cos(2alpha) + cos(2beta) + cos(2(alpha + beta)) = -1.    ] 6. **Solving for the Angles:**    We know from trigonometric properties that:    [    cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B,    ]    hence we simplify as:    [    cos(alpha + beta)(cos(alpha - beta) + cos(alpha + beta)) = 0.    ]     7. **Determining the Possible Values:**    From the periodicity and orthogonal properties of cosine:    [    cos(alpha + beta) = 0, quad cos alpha = 0, quad cos beta = 0,    ]        Evaluating each case:    - alpha = 90^circ places point O within the plane AA^{prime}D which contradicts our conditions.    - beta = 90^circ places point O within the plane AA^{prime}B which contradicts our conditions.    - Therefore, the feasible conclusion suggests that gamma = 90^circ placing O in the ABC plane and specifically on segment AC. 8. **Distance from Sphere Center to Plane:**    Given sphere touches several planes, its radius r must be equal to AA^{prime}, which is 2 as specified in the dimensions 2 times 6 times 9:    [    r = AA^{prime} = 2.    ]    Finally, as per the problem's setup, we get:    [    boxed{3}    ]"},{"instruction":"The reciprocal of 1 is ______.","output":"To find the reciprocal of a number, we need to find a value that, when multiplied by the original number, gives us 1.

This means the sphere will be tangent to the cube's faces.  2. **Determining the sphere's diameter**: Since the sphere fits perfectly inside the cube and touches the cube's faces, the diameter of the sphere must be equal to the cube's edge length. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 1cm. 3. **Calculating the sphere's radius**: The radius of the sphere is half of its diameter. So, the radius r is given by     r = frac{diameter}{2} = frac{1cm}{2} = frac{1}{2}cm. 4. **Finding the volume of the sphere**: The volume V of a sphere is given by the formula V = frac{4}{3}pi r^3.

[     MP = frac{1}{2} SK     ]     We use the 3D coordinates of (SK) and (AM) next, given the setup:     Since (S) is the apex of the pyramid above the center of (ABCD) with coordinates ((0, 0, 3)). Since (B) is one of the vertices of (ABCD), let us choose coordinates so (B = (0, 8, 0)), hence (M = left(0, 4, frac{3}{2}right)).

Since the equation (f(x) = g(x)) has no real roots, the polynomial (f(x) - g(x)) must be non-zero for all real values of (x).

From the properties of the sums of an arithmetic sequence, we know that the differences S_{2m} - S_m and S_{3m} - S_{2m} also form an arithmetic sequence.

The ratio in a new recipe calls for a doubling of the ratio of flour to water from the original recipe and a certain change of the ratio of flour to sugar. If the new recipe calls for 2 cups of water, it requires 6 cups of sugar. What is the change in the ratio of flour to sugar from the original recipe?","output":"Let's first determine the original ratio of flour to water to sugar, which is 8:4:3. This means that for every 8 parts of flour, there are 4 parts of water and 3 parts of sugar. In the new recipe, the ratio of flour to water is doubled. The original ratio of flour to water is 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1. Doubling this ratio gives us 4:1. Since the new recipe calls for 2 cups of water, this means that for every 4 parts of flour, there is 1 part of water. Therefore, the amount of flour in the new recipe would be 4 times the amount of water, which is 4 * 2 = 8 cups of flour. Now, we are told that the new recipe requires 6 cups of sugar. To find the new ratio of flour to sugar, we divide the amount of flour by the amount of sugar: 8 cups of flour / 6 cups of sugar = 4/3 or 1.33 (repeating). The original ratio of flour to sugar was 8:3, which simplifies to 8/3 or approximately 2.67. To find the change in the ratio of flour to sugar from the original recipe to the new recipe, we subtract the new ratio from the original ratio: Original ratio (flour to sugar) = 8/3 ≈ 2.67 New ratio (flour to sugar) = 4/3 ≈ 1.33 Change in ratio = Original ratio - New ratio Change in ratio ≈ 2.67 - 1.33 Change in ratio ≈ 1.34 So, the change in the ratio of flour to sugar from the original recipe to the new recipe is approximately boxed{1.34} ."},{"instruction":"Let ( n ) and ( k ) be positive integers.

Cathy wins if at any point there is a box containing only marble ( n ). Determine all pairs of integers ((n, k)) such that Cathy can win this game.","output":":  We claim Cathy can win if and only if ( n leq 2^{k-1} ).  Step 1: Understanding the Game Setup - **Initial Setup**: There are ( n ) marbles labeled from ( 1 ) to ( n ) placed inside one box. There are ( k ) boxes. - **Game Move**: Cathy chooses a box and then moves the marble with the smallest label to either any empty box or the box containing the next consecutive marble. - **Winning Condition**: Cathy wins if at any point there is a box containing only marble ( n ).  Step 2: Consecutive Marble Sequence Each non-empty box always contains a consecutive sequence of labeled marbles. This is because Cathy either removes the smallest marble from a box or adds it to another box, ensuring that the marbles in any box always form a consecutive sequence.  Step 3: Proving Cathy Can Win if ( n = 2^{k-1} ) - **Base Case**:    - For ( k = 1 ):     - Here, ( n = 2^{1-1} = 1 ). Thus, with 1 box and 1 marble, Cathy trivially wins by placing marble 1 in the box.   - **Inductive Step**:   - Assume Cathy can win with ( m ) boxes and ( 2^{m-1} ) marbles.   - Consider Cathy playing with ( m+1 ) boxes and ( 2^m ) marbles:     - Cathy can manipulate the marbles so that only marbles ( 2^{m-1}, ldots, 2^m ) are left in the starting box while keeping one box, say ( B ), empty.     - Move marble ( 2^{m-1} ) to box ( B ) and then reverse all initial moves (treating ( B ) as the starting box).     - This will result in:       - Marbles ( 2^{m-1}+1, ldots, 2^m ) in the starting box       - Marbles ( 1, ldots, 2^{m-1} ) in box ( B )       - ( m-1 ) empty boxes remaining     - By repeating the sequence of moves for marbles ( 2^{m-1}+1, ldots, 2^m ) using the ( m ) boxes excluding ( B ), Cathy can eventually isolate marble ( 2^m ). Hence, Cathy can win if ( n = 2^{k-1} ).  Step 4: Proving Cathy Can't Win If ( n = 2^{k-1} + 1 ) - **Base Case**:   - For ( k = 1 ):     - Here, ( n = 2^{1-1} + 1 = 2 ). With 1 box and 2 marbles, Cathy cannot isolate marble 2 without the help of a second box. - **Inductive Step**:   - Assume Cathy cannot win with ( m ) boxes and ( 2^{m-1} + 1 ) marbles.   - Consider Cathy playing with ( m+1 ) boxes and ( 2^m + 1 ) marbles:     - Suppose Cathy could win. Let ( X ) be the last move where marble ( 2^{m-1} + 1 ) leaves the starting box.     - After move ( X ), marbles ( 1, ldots, 2^{m-1} + 1 ) shouldn't all be in a single box (otherwise it contradicts the inductive hypothesis).     - This separation means marble ( 1 ) will move among empty boxes, effectively blocking other marbles.     - This mimic's a sequence for ( 2^{m-1} + 1 ) marbles with only ( m ) boxes, contradicting the inductive assumption that Cathy cannot win in such a scenario. Hence, Cathy cannot win if ( n > 2^{k-1} ).  Conclusion Cathy can win the game if and only if ( n leq 2^{k-1} ).

Since the line y=2x+b is the tangent line of the curve y=aln x, let's set the tangent point as (m,n), then we have 2=dfrac{a}{m}, n=2m+b, n=aln m, which leads to b=aln dfrac{a}{2}-a (given a > 0), Differentiating b with respect to a gives b'=ln dfrac{a}{2}+1-1=ln dfrac{a}{2}, When a > 2, b' > 0, the function b is increasing, When 0 < a < 2, b' < 0, the function b is decreasing, hence a=2 is the point of local minimum, which is also the point of absolute minimum, and the minimum value is: 2ln 1-2=-2.

What is the greatest possible positive integer difference of x and y under these conditions?","output":"First, let's calculate the value of (3/2)^3 to understand the range in which x and y must fall. (3/2)^3 = 27/8 = 3.375 So the inequality becomes 3 < x < 3.375 < y < 7. Since x and y are rational numbers, we can choose the greatest possible rational number less than 3.375 for x and the smallest possible rational number greater than 3.375 for y to maximize their difference. The greatest possible rational number less than 3.375 that is also an integer is 3, but since the inequality states that x must be greater than 3, we cannot choose 3. Therefore, we must choose a rational number that is just greater than 3. The closest rational number to 3 that is greater than 3 and less than 3.375 can be 3 + 1/n for some large integer n. As n becomes larger, 1/n becomes smaller, and thus 3 + 1/n becomes closer to 3. However, since we are looking for the greatest possible positive integer difference, we should choose the smallest possible n to maximize the difference. Therefore, we can choose n = 1, which gives us x = 3 + 1/1 = 4. For y, we want the smallest possible rational number greater than 3.375 but less than 7. The closest integer to 3.375 that is greater than 3.375 is 4, but since we want to maximize the difference between x and y, we should choose a number just less than 7. The closest rational number to 7 that is less than 7 can be 7 - 1/m for some large integer m. As m becomes larger, 1/m becomes smaller, and thus 7 - 1/m becomes closer to 7. However, since we are looking for the greatest possible positive integer difference, we should choose the smallest possible m to maximize the difference. Therefore, we can choose m = 1, which gives us y = 7 - 1/1 = 6. Now, the greatest possible positive integer difference of x and y under these conditions is y - x = 6 - 4 = 2.

Since we know the slope m = -1 and a point (1, frac{1}{2}), we can find b:    frac{1}{2} = (-1)(1) + b Rightarrow b = frac{3}{2}.     5. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is y = -x + frac{3}{2}, which can be rewritten as:    2x + 2y - 3 = 0.     boxed{2x + 2y - 3 = 0}  Part (2) For f(x) to be increasing on (1, +infty): 1.

The formula for simple interest (SI) is: SI = P * r * t / 100 The formula for compound interest (CI) is: CI = P * (1 + r/100)^t - P Given that the difference between CI and SI is Rs. 15, we can write: CI - SI = 15 Substituting the formulas for CI and SI, we get: P * (1 + r/100)^t - P - (P * r * t / 100) = 15 Now, let's plug in the values of P and t: 1500 * (1 + r/100)^2 - 1500 - (1500 * r * 2 / 100) = 15 Simplifying the equation, we get: 1500 * (1 + r/100)^2 - 1500 - 30r = 15 Now, let's solve for r.

The correct approach to find the minimum value of 4a^2+b^2+c^2 given a+b+c=M=3 should involve recognizing that the minimum value of 4a^2+b^2+c^2 is directly related to the distribution of a, b, and c.  Given the mistake in the application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the standard solution, let's correct the approach: Given a+b+c=3, to minimize 4a^2+b^2+c^2, we should consider the equality condition in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which suggests that for the minimum to occur, the ratios of the corresponding terms should be equal, i.e., 2a = b = c. This leads to the system of equations: [ begin{align*} 2a &= b  b &= c  a + b + c &= 3 end{align*} ] Solving this system, we find a = frac{1}{3}, b = frac{4}{3}, c = frac{4}{3}. Substituting these values into 4a^2+b^2+c^2 gives: [ 4left(frac{1}{3}right)^2 + left(frac{4}{3}right)^2 + left(frac{4}{3}right)^2 = 4 ] Therefore, the minimum value of 4a^2+b^2+c^2 is boxed{4}."},{"instruction":"The owner of a stationery store sold two calculators at a price of 60 yuan each, one at a 20% profit and the other at a 20% loss.

Similarly, consider the sequence of 21 consecutive integers starting from ( m ). These integers are ( m, m+1, m+2, ldots, m+20 ). 4. To determine if ( A ) and ( B ) can be the same, we need to compare the number of digits in both sequences. 5. The number of digits in a number ( k ) is given by ( lfloor log_{10} k rfloor + 1 ). 6. Let's analyze the number of digits in the sequences:    - For Anna's sequence, the number of digits ranges from ( lfloor log_{10} n rfloor + 1 ) to ( lfloor log_{10} (n+19) rfloor + 1 ).    - For Bob's sequence, the number of digits ranges from ( lfloor log_{10} m rfloor + 1 ) to ( lfloor log_{10} (m+20) rfloor + 1 ). 7.

Since the sequences are consecutive, the unit digits of ( n ) to ( n+19 ) will cover all digits from 0 to 9 twice, and the unit digits of ( m ) to ( m+20 ) will cover all digits from 0 to 9 twice plus one more digit. 10. Therefore, the unit digits of ( A ) and ( B ) cannot be the same because ( A ) will have an even distribution of unit digits, while ( B ) will have an odd distribution. 11. Additionally, if the sequences span different ranges of digits (e.g., crossing from one digit length to another), the total number of digits in ( A ) and ( B ) will differ.

Let's denote x as the selling price of each helmet after the reduction, and y as the number of helmets sold per month. The reduction in price from 100 yuan is 100 - x yuan. For every 4 yuan reduction, 40 more helmets are sold, so the increase in the number of helmets sold due to the price reduction is frac{100-x}{4} times 40. Therefore, the total number of helmets sold, y, can be calculated as: [ y = 200 + frac{100-x}{4} times 40 = 200 + 10(100-x) = 200 + 1000 - 10x = -10x + 1200 ] Thus, the functional relationship between y and x is: [ y = -10x + 1200 quad text{for} quad 60 leq x leq 100 ]  Part 2: Functional Relationship between w and x The monthly profit from selling helmets, w, is given by the profit per helmet multiplied by the number of helmets sold, which is (x-60)y.

However, after three months, the actual rate matched the forecast. In which direction did the rate change in the end?","output":"1. **Initial Assumptions and Conversions:**    Let's denote the percentage changes by ( x, y, ) and ( z ) for the months July, August, and September respectively. These values are given such that ( 0 < |x|, |y|, |z| < 1 ).     - If the course increases by ( x % ), this can be represented as ( x = 0.2 ) (for example, a 20% increase implies ( x = 0.2 )).    - If the course decreases by ( x % ), this can be represented as ( x = -0.2 ) (for example, a 20% decrease implies ( x = -0.2 )). 2. **Percentage Change Representation:**    When converting percentage changes to multiplicative factors:    - An increase of ( x % ) is equivalent to multiplying by ( 1 + x ).    - A decrease of ( x % ) is equivalent to multiplying by ( 1 - x ). 3. **Predicted vs. Actual Changes:**    Suppose the analyst predicted changes of ( x, y, ) and ( z ):    - The expected factor of change on the course: ((1 + x)(1 + y)(1 + z)).    However, the actual changes went in the opposite direction:    - The actual factor of change on the course: ((1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)). 4. **Combining Factors and Final Course:**    According to the problem, despite the reverse directions, the end course after three months matched the predicted outcome.

Since the total number of points distributed among all teams must be 380 and each team has different scores, the minimum possible score for the leader must be more than the number of teams subtracted from the total points accumulated by all other teams:    [    text{Minimum points of leader} > 28.    ]    The reasoning is that the distribution of remaining scores must sum less than 380.

To find out how many cards that is, we calculate 40% of 49, which is 0.40 * 49 = 19.6 cards. Since she can't keep a fraction of a card, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, so she keeps 19 cards for herself.

However, we know Janessa had 49 cards in total, so there seems to be a discrepancy of 1 card (49 - 48 = 1). This discrepancy could be due to rounding down the 0.6 of a card when calculating the 40% she kept for herself.

Two types of regular polyhedra connected by this construction are called duals of each other.","output":"1. Consider a **regular polyhedron** with a center ( O ). These polyhedra include the five Platonic solids, each with identical faces and vertices distributed symmetrically. Denote one of its faces as ( F ) with centroid ( C_F ). 2. The crucial property of regular polyhedra is that they possess **symmetry axes through their center ( O )**, specifically, each axis passes through ( O ) and a vertex ( V ). 3. When we rotate the polyhedron around such an axis by **( frac{2pi}{m} )**, where ( m ) is the number of faces meeting at ( V ), the vertices and their adjacent faces align perfectly with one another. 4. Each face ( F ) of the regular polyhedron is a regular ( n )-gon, where ( n ) is the number of edges (and vertices) of the face. Thus, rotating around the symmetry axis involves mapping face centers to other face centers. 5. Due to the rotational symmetry of the polyhedron, the centroids ( C ) of faces must also align in a symmetric manner. Specifically, these centroids can be connected to form another polyhedron. 6. The polyhedron formed by connecting these face centroids, referred to as **dual polyhedra**, will also be regular. This newly formed regular polyhedron has vertices at the centers of the original faces and faces corresponding to the vertices of the original polyhedron. 7. This reciprocal relationship implies: the centers of faces of a regular polyhedron serve as the vertices of its dual polyhedron, and vice versa. 8. Some notable dual pairs of regular polyhedra are:    - The Cube and the Octahedron.    - The Dodecahedron and the Icosahedron.    - The Tetrahedron, which is self-dual, meaning its dual is another tetrahedron. # Conclusion: Therefore, the centers of the faces of any regular polyhedron indeed form the vertices of another regular polyhedron.

Hence, a_n=2^{n-1} and S_n=frac{1×(1-2^{n})}{1-2}=2^{n}-1. 2. Proof: b_n=frac{a_n}{a_na_n+1−3a_n+1}=frac{2^{n-1}}{2^{n-1}⋅2^{n}−3⋅2^{n-1}+1} < frac{2^{n-1}}{2^{n-1}⋅2^{n-1}}=frac{1}{2^{n-1}}.

Consider the function g(x) = frac{1 + ln{x}}{x} - e defined for x in left[frac{1}{e}, 2right]. To find its minimum, we need to study its derivative: begin{align*} g'(x) &= frac{d}{dx}left(frac{1 + ln{x}}{x}right) - 0  &= frac{1cdot x - (1 + ln{x})cdot 1}{x^2}  &= frac{x - 1 - ln{x}}{x^2}  &= frac{1 - (1 + ln{x})}{x^2}  &= -frac{ln{x}}{x^2}. end{align*} Now, we need to analyze g'(x) = -frac{ln{x}}{x^2} to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing: - For xin left[frac{1}{e}, 1right), we have ln{x} < 0, so g'(x) > 0, which means g is increasing in this interval. - For xin (1, 2right], we have ln{x} > 0, so g'(x) < 0, which means g is decreasing in this interval. Since g(x) is first increasing then decreasing, the minimum occurs at one of the endpoints of the interval. Now, calculate g at the endpoints: - For x = frac{1}{e}, we have gleft(frac{1}{e}right) = frac{1}{frac{1}{e}} - e = e - e = 0. - For x = 2, we have g(2) = frac{1 + ln{2}}{2} - e. Comparing the two values, we can see that: - gleft(frac{1}{e}right) = 0, - g(2) > 0 because ln{2} < 1.

For the line l to be tangent to the curve y = f(x) at some point (x_0, y_0), two conditions must be met: 1. The slope of the tangent to the curve at (x_0, y_0), which is given by the derivative f'(x) at x_0, must equal the slope of the line l. This gives us the equation: [f'(x_0) = 2] Since f(x) = sin 2x, we find f'(x) = 2cos 2x. Therefore, at x_0, we have: [2cos 2x_0 = 2] 2. The point (x_0, y_0) must satisfy both the equation of the curve and the equation of the line. This means: [sin 2x_0 = 2x_0 + a] From the first condition, we see that 2cos 2x_0 = 2 does not directly lead to a specific value for a. However, it implies that the slope of the line l matches the slope of the curve at the point of tangency, which is a necessary condition for tangency but does not provide information about a. From the second condition, if we were to solve sin 2x_0 = 2x_0 + a for a, we might incorrectly conclude that a = -2kpi for k in mathbb{Z}, which was a mistake in the standard solution. Instead, this equation does not directly solve to give a value for a without additional context or constraints. The correct interpretation is that for any specific point of tangency, a would be determined by the specific x_0 that satisfies both the curve and the line being tangent, but this does not generalize to a = -2kpi. Given this analysis, when a=0, it is indeed a specific case where the line could be tangent to the curve, but there could be other values of a that also satisfy the tangency condition depending on the specific point of tangency. Therefore, \\"a=0\\" is a necessary condition for the line l to be tangent to the curve at some points, but it is not sufficient because there could be other conditions or values of a that also result in tangency. However, the conclusion that the line l being tangent to the curve y=f(x) does not imply a=0 is correct. This means that while a=0 can result in tangency, not all tangencies will occur only when a=0. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that \\"line l is tangent to the curve y=f(x)\\" is a necessary but not sufficient condition for \\"a=0\\".

The power of a point ( P ) with respect to a circle ( S_i ) is given by ( OP^2 - r_i^2 ).     - For a point ( O ) to lie on the radical axis of ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ), the respective powers with respect to both circles must be equal. Hence,     [     OO_1^2 - r_1^2 = OO_2^2 - r_2^2     ]     Simplifying this, we get:     [     OO_1^2 - OO_2^2 = r_1^2 - r_2^2     ] 4. **Orthogonal Circle Centers**:     - For the circle ( S ) with center ( O ) to intersect ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) orthogonally:         - Applying the orthogonality condition for ( S_1 ):         [         r^2 = OO_1^2 - r_1^2          ]         - Applying the orthogonality condition for ( S_2 ):         [         r^2 = OO_2^2 - r_2^2          ]     - These conditions must hold simultaneously.

This method, applied iteratively and selectively for each position black squares, ensures that eventually, all black squares can be converted to white with a finite number of operations. Thus, by a systematic approach of targeted subgrid selection and manipulation, we prove that it is indeed possible to turn all squares into white using finite steps. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Laura took out a charge account at the general store and agreed to pay 4% simple annual interest.

The hyperbola C_2 has the equation frac{{x}^{2}}{4}-y^{2}=1, which means its semi-major axis is 2, implying a=2 for the ellipse since they share vertices. The foci of C_2 are located at (pmsqrt{5},0) because the distance from the center to a focus is sqrt{a^2+b^2}=sqrt{4+1}=sqrt{5}. The equation of the asymptotes of C_2 is y=pmfrac{1}{2}x, derived from the standard form of a hyperbola's asymptotes y=pmfrac{b}{a}x with a=2 and b=1 (since the coefficient of x^2 is 1/4, making a^2=4 and thus a=2, and the coefficient of y^2 is -1, making b^2=1 and thus b=1). The distance from the focus to the asymptote is calculated using the formula d=frac{sqrt{a^2+b^2}}{sqrt{1+(frac{b}{a})^2}}=frac{sqrt{5}}{sqrt{1+frac{1}{4}}}=frac{sqrt{5}}{sqrt{frac{5}{4}}}=frac{sqrt{5}}{frac{sqrt{5}}{2}}=2, which matches the length of the short axis of C_1, indicating b=1. Therefore, the standard equation of the ellipse C_1 is boxed{frac{{x}^{2}}{4}+{y}^{2}=1}. (2) To determine if there exists a point M such that MT bisects angle AMB, we start by considering the given conditions. The line l has a non-zero slope and passes through T(t,0), so its equation can be written as y=k(x-t). For points A(x_1,y_1) and B(x_2,y_2) on the ellipse and point M(m,0) on the x-axis, we substitute the equation of l into the ellipse equation to eliminate y, resulting in a quadratic equation in x: (1+4k^{2})x^{2}-8k^{2}tx+4k^{2}t^{2}-4=0. From this, we find the sum and product of x_1 and x_2 as x_1+x_2=frac{8k^{2}t}{1+4k^{2}} and x_1x_2=frac{4k^{2}t^{2}-4}{1+4k^{2}}. The condition for MT to bisect angle AMB translates to the slopes of AM and BM summing to zero, leading to the equation 2x_1x_2-(t+m)(x_1+x_2)+2tm=0.

Step 1: Understand the implication of the graph not passing through the third quadrant. - The third quadrant is where both x and y are negative. For a linear function y=kx+b not to pass through this quadrant, it implies that as x increases, y must decrease or stay the same. This can only happen if the slope of the line, k, is negative. Therefore, we have k < 0. Step 2: Compare the values of y_{1} and y_{2} based on the given points and the nature of the function. - Since k < 0, the function decreases as x increases. Given two points (-1,y_{1}) and (1,y_{2}) where -1 < 1, it follows that y_{1} must be greater than y_{2} because the function value decreases as we move from x = -1 to x = 1.

This means the center of the circle is equidistant from (0,0) and (4,0). Therefore, the center is at the midpoint of these two points, which can be found as follows: - The midpoint formula is left(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}right). - Substituting the given points (0,0) and (4,0) into the formula, we get the center as left(frac{0 + 4}{2}, frac{0 + 0}{2}right) = (2,0). Knowing the center (2,0) and that it passes through (4,0), we can find the radius r by calculating the distance between these two points: - The distance formula is sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}. - Substituting the points (2,0) and (4,0), we get r = sqrt{(4 - 2)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = 2. Therefore, the equation of the circle is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius. Substituting (h,k) = (2,0) and r = 2, we get: - (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 4.

Part 2: Finding the Length of the Chord |AB| The distance d from the center (2,0) of the circle to the line l: 3x + 4y - 11 = 0 can be found using the formula d = frac{|ax_1 + by_1 + c|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}, where (x_1, y_1) is the center of the circle and ax + by + c = 0 is the equation of the line. Substituting the given values, we get: - d = frac{|3(2) + 4(0) - 11|}{sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}} = frac{|6 - 11|}{5} = frac{5}{5} = 1. The length of the chord |AB| can be found using the formula |AB| = 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2}, where r is the radius of the circle and d is the distance from the center to the line. Substituting r = 2 and d = 1, we get: - |AB| = 2sqrt{2^2 - 1^2} = 2sqrt{4 - 1} = 2sqrt{3}.

The focus of this parabola is at ( (p/2, 0) ) and the directrix is the line ( x = -p/2 ). 2. **Point on the parabola**: Let ( A ) be a point on the parabola given by ( A(2plambda^2, 2plambda) ). 3. **Equation of the normal at ( A )**: The slope of the tangent to the parabola at ( A ) is given by differentiating ( y^2 = 2px ):    [    2y frac{dy}{dx} = 2p implies frac{dy}{dx} = frac{p}{y}    ]    At ( A(2plambda^2, 2plambda) ), the slope of the tangent is ( frac{p}{2plambda} = frac{1}{2lambda} ).

We need to add the smallest number of additional one-way flights such that it becomes possible to travel from any city to any other city with no more than two stops (one or two transit points). 2. **Observing the Current Configuration:**    Initially, each city is connected to the next city in a cyclic manner via a one-way flight. This means each city can reach only its immediate next neighbor in the circle directly. 3. **Strategy to Connect All Cities:**    To ensure that from any city (A_i) one can reach any city (A_j) (where (i neq j)) with no more than two stops, we need to ensure that:    - Each city should be reachable by every other city either directly or with just one intermediate city. 4. **Implementing the Solution with Minimum Flights:**        The image provided suggests one such solution:    - Original one-way connections are represented as: ( A_1 to A_2 to A_3 to A_4 to A_5 to A_6 to A_7 to A_1 ).

Adding fewer than five additional flights cannot achieve this requirement, as it would leave at least one pair of cities disconnected within two flights. Therefore, using five additional flights is necessary and sufficient.

Assume there are such integers (a, b,) and (c). Let the roots of the first equation be (x_1) and (x_2). Then, by Vieta's formulas, we have: [x_1 + x_2 = -frac{b}{a} quad text{and} quad x_1 x_2 = frac{c}{a}] Let the roots of the second equation be (y_1) and (y_2).

We now consider two cases:  Case 1: (a) is even If (a) is even, then the expression (frac{b}{a}) implies that (b) must be even because (x_1 + x_2) is an integer. Similarly, (frac{c}{a}) implies that (c) must also be even. Therefore, (a,) (b,) and (c) are all even. For the second equation, ((a+1)) is odd (since an even number plus one is odd), and (frac{b+1}{a+1}) and (frac{c+1}{a+1}) must be integers. Since (a+1) is odd, (b+1) and (c+1) must also be odd for their ratios to be integers. However, this leads to a contradiction because (b) and (c) were determined to be even, making (b+1) and (c+1) odd. Subtracting one from an even number results in an odd number, which creates an inconsistency. Thus, this case is not possible.  Case 2: (a) is odd If (a) is odd, then (a+1) is even. The expression (frac{b+1}{a+1}) implies that (b+1) must be even, making (b) odd. Similarly, (frac{c+1}{a+1}) implies that (c+1) must be even, making (c) odd. Therefore, (a), (b), and (c) are all odd. For the first equation, (a) is odd, and (frac{b}{a}) and (frac{c}{a}) must be integers. Since (a) is odd, (b) and (c) must also be odd. However, examining the equations further illustrates contradictions in the integer parity of the resulting expressions. For the first equation's odd integer root (x_1): [a x_1^2 + b x_1 = -c] Since (a) and (b) are odd, their products with any integer result in odd numbers, making (a x_1^2 + b x_1) even. This is a contradiction since (-c) is odd (since (c) is odd). Therefore, both cases lead to contradictions demonstrating that (a, b, c) cannot simultaneously fulfill both quadratic equations having two integer roots each. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{No, there are no such integers a, b, and c that satisfy the given conditions.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Julie put half of her savings in a savings account that pays an annual simple interest and half in a savings account that pays an annual compound interest.

She puts half of her savings in a simple interest account and the other half in a compound interest account. Therefore, the amount she puts in each account is S/2, which is 1000/2 = 500. Let's denote the simple interest rate as r_s and the compound interest rate as r_c, both expressed as decimals (for example, 5% would be 0.05). For the simple interest account, the interest earned after two years is given by the formula: Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) * Rate (r_s) * Time (t) We know that SI is 100, P is 500, and t is 2 years. So we can write: 100 = 500 * r_s * 2 From this, we can solve for r_s: r_s = 100 / (500 * 2) r_s = 100 / 1000 r_s = 0.1 or 10% For the compound interest account, the interest earned after two years is given by the formula: Compound Interest (CI) = Principal (P) * [(1 + r_c)^t - 1] We know that CI is 105, P is 500, and t is 2 years.

There are two main cases to consider: 1. **Three graduates are selected, and each is assigned to a different position.** This can be done in C(4,3) times 3! ways.

For example, a rectangle has equal diagonals but is not an isosceles trapezoid. Option A suggests that every quadrilateral with equal diagonals is an isosceles trapezoid, which is incorrect. Therefore, option A is incorrect. The diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid are indeed equal in length, but they do not bisect each other. For example, in an isosceles trapezoid, the two non-parallel sides (legs) are equal in length, and the diagonals also have the same length. However, unless the trapezoid has additional properties (such as being a rectangle), the diagonals generally do not divide each other into two equal segments. Option B indicates the diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid bisect each other, which is not always true. Hence, option B is incorrect. The definition of an isosceles trapezoid includes the fact that the base angles, which are the angles adjacent to each base, are equal. In an isosceles trapezoid, this means that the angles on the same side of each base are equal to each other, but not necessarily the angles across from each other on the opposite bases. Option C is correct because it correctly states that an isosceles trapezoid has equal base angles next to each base. Lastly, in an isosceles trapezoid, the midpoint of the upper base is equidistant from the two endpoints of the lower base due to the trapezoid's symmetry along the line joining the midpoints of the two bases. Option D is accurate because it correctly describes this property of an isosceles trapezoid.

Clearly, due to properties of parallel lines and similarity, DE parallel FG.     4. **Relations in Triangles**:        If the line PQ intersects BX and AX at M and N, respectively:        [    MD^2 = MP cdot MQ = MF^2 implies MD = MF,    ]    and similarly,    [    NE = NG.    ]    It follows that PQ is parallel to DE and FG and equidistant from them. 5. **Application of Lemma**:        The midpoints of AB, AC, and AX lie on a same line m, which is parallel to BC. Applying the lemma to triangle ABX, we conclude that DE passes through the common point U of m and the bisector of angle ABX.    Similarly, FG passes through the common point V of m and the bisector of angle ACX. 6. **Conclusion**:        Therefore, PQ passes through the midpoint W of the line segment UV.

The circumstances around his movement lead to three possible scenarios:    - With probability (frac{1}{4}), Roger moves back to his starting point, ((0,0)).

He then expects to take another ( e_1 ) steps.    - With probability (frac{1}{2}), Roger moves perpendicular to ( u ). We denote the perpendicular direction as ( w ). This introduces a new number of expected steps, ( e_2 ). 3. **Defining Expectation ( e_2 )**:      If Roger moves in direction ( w ), he again faces two possibilities:    - With probability (frac{1}{2}), he moves back towards either ( -u ) or ( -w ), ending his journey.    - With probability (frac{1}{2}), he proceeds further away in either ( u ) or ( w ), which means he is expected to walk an additional ( e_2 ) steps. 4. **Setting Up the Equations**:        - For ( e_2 ):      [      e_2 = frac{1}{2} e_2 + 1      ]      Solving for ( e_2 ):      [      e_2 - frac{1}{2} e_2 = 1 implies frac{1}{2} e_2 = 1 implies e_2 = 2      ]        - For ( e_1 ):      [      e_1 = frac{1}{2} e_2 + frac{1}{4} e_1 + 1      ]      Substituting ( e_2 = 2 ):      [      e_1 = frac{1}{2} times 2 + frac{1}{4} e_1 + 1 implies e_1 = 1 + frac{1}{4} e_1 + 1 implies e_1 = 2 + frac{1}{4} e_1      ]      Solving for ( e_1 ):      [      e_1 - frac{1}{4} e_1 = 2 implies frac{3}{4} e_1 = 2 implies e_1 = frac{8}{3}      ] 5. **Calculating the Total Number of Steps**:      Since Roger takes 1 step initially plus the expected ( e_1 ) steps:    [    1 + e_1 = 1 + frac{8}{3} = frac{3}{3} + frac{8}{3} = frac{11}{3}    ] 6. **Final Expression**:      The expected number of steps is ( frac{11}{3} ).

Multiply (a) by (frac{1}{b}):     [     a times b = frac{a}{1 / b} = frac{a}{1 / b} = a bigg/ left(1 - (1 star b)right)     ]     Simplifying inside the fraction:     [     a times b = a times (1 - (1 star b))     ]  Subtraction To derive subtraction: 1. Consider the term (a - b):     [     a - b = a + (-b)     ] 2. Use the property derived from (b star a):     [     b star a = 1 - frac{b}{a}     ]     Simplify:     [     -b = left((1 star (b star a)) star 1right)     ] Thus, [ a - b = a - ((1 star (b star a)) star 1) ]  Addition To derive addition: 1. Consider (a + b):     [     a + b = a - (0 - b)     ] 2. Using the subtraction rule derived earlier and the identity for zero:     [     a + b = a - (b star 0)     ] Thus we verified that using the operation (a star b = 1 - frac{a}{b}), we can perform all four arithmetic operations.

In any triangle, the altitude from one vertex to the opposite side creates two right angles with the base. Hence,     [    h_a leq b quad text{and} quad h_b leq a    ] 4. Combining the inequalities utilizing transitivity, we get:    [    a leq h_a leq b quad text{and} quad b leq h_b leq a    ] 5.

In an isosceles triangle where the altitude is equal to the corresponding side, the only feasible configuration is a right-angled isosceles triangle. 8.

Therefore, the angles of the triangle are:    [    90^circ, 45^circ, 45^circ    ] # Conclusion: The angles of the triangle are: [ boxed{90^circ, 45^circ, 45^circ} ]"},{"instruction":"Find the smallest digit d so that 526{,}d85 is divisible by 7.","output":"For divisibility by 7, one method is summing the digits to see if their total is divisible by 7.

This is because these inner diagonals divide the plane with each extreme diagonal lying on different sides. No segment originating from another vertex can intersect both these diagonals simultaneously. 3. **Assign Soldiers to Diagonals**:    - Imagine that we place two soldiers on each diagonal.    - Soldiers move based on the following rule: If a diagonal has only one yellow endpoint, both soldiers go to that endpoint. If a diagonal has two yellow endpoints, each soldier goes to one of the endpoints.    - Consequently, at most two soldiers can arrive at any vertex (one may arrive from an outgoing diagonal and one from an incoming diagonal).    - Since each soldier arrives at exactly one end, at most 2n soldiers can be placed given that we have n vertices.    - Hence, the maximum number of diagonals is frac{2n}{2} = n because every diagonal is counted twice as it has two endpoints. 4. **Determine the Upper Bound**:    - So, we have established that the maximum number of diagonals is n for an n-gon. 5. **Constructing the Case for n geq 5**:    - Let’s show that this upper bound of n is achievable for polygons with n geq 5.    - Consider an n-gon with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, ldots. Draw the diagonals AC, CE, EB, BD, DA.    - If n > 5, also draw all possible diagonals from vertex C.    - The key points are:      - All diagonals originating from vertex C have C as a common endpoint.      - Each diagonal from C intersects the diagonals EB, BD, and DA.      - The diagonals CE, EB, BD, and DA meet the conditions necessary for sharing endpoints or interior points appropriately. 6. **Special Cases for Small n**:    - For n = 3 (triangle), there are no diagonals, thus 0 diagonals.    - For n = 4 (quadrilateral), a maximum of 2 diagonals can exist that intersect each other.    - For smaller n, the problem constraints make it straightforward to see that fewer than n diagonals are achievable. # Conclusion From our thorough analysis and construction, we conclude that the maximum number of diagonals in an n-gon where any two diagonals share an endpoint or intersect is: [ boxed{n} ] if n geq 5, and [ boxed{n-2} ] otherwise, based on the constraints and specific observations for smaller n."},{"instruction":"Given the inequality about x, |x2||x5|k>0, has the solution set mathbb{R}, then the range of the real number k is.","output":"Based on the properties of absolute value inequalities, we can derive: ||x-2|-|x-5|| leq |(x-2)-(x-5)| = 3, which means: -3 leq |x-2|-|x-5| leq 3, Therefore, to satisfy |x-2|-|x-5|>k with the solution set being mathbb{R}, it is only necessary that k<-3, Hence, the answer is boxed{k<-3}."},{"instruction":"Given the function (f(x)=ax^{2007}+bx+1), if (f(2)=2), then (f(2)=) _______.","output":"**Analysis** This question examines the application of the function's odd-even properties.

Before the discount, the total cost would be: ( 2G + 4 times 50 ) The store is offering a 20% discount, so Bailey will only pay 80% of the total cost. Therefore, the equation to represent the total amount Bailey will spend after the discount is: ( 0.80 times (2G + 4 times 50) = 224 ) Let's solve for ( G ): ( 0.80 times (2G + 200) = 224 ) Divide both sides by 0.80 to isolate the expression with ( G ): ( 2G + 200 = frac{224}{0.80} ) ( 2G + 200 = 280 ) Subtract 200 from both sides to solve for ( G ): ( 2G = 280 - 200 ) ( 2G = 80 ) Divide both sides by 2 to find the price of each set of towels for the guest bathroom: ( G = frac{80}{2} ) ( G = 40 ) So, the price of each set of towels for the guest bathroom is boxed{40.00} ."},{"instruction":"Karl had his salary reduced by 10%.

It is known that among them there are exactly two counterfeit coins, which differ in weight from the rest (the genuine coins have the same weight, and the counterfeit coins also have the same weight). How can all the coins be divided into two equalweight heaps using no more than four weighings on a twopan balance scale without weights? b) The same problem for 22 coins.","output":"Part (a) To solve the problem of dividing 32 identical-looking coins — where two are counterfeit and differ in weight from the genuine ones (which are all identical in weight, as are the counterfeit coins) — into two equal piles using a maximum of four weighings on a two-pan balance scale without weights, follow these steps: 1. **Initial Setup:**     - Start with a single pile containing all 32 coins. The objective is to keep halving the pile through successive weighings until the counterfeit coins end up in different piles. 2. **First Weighing:**     - Divide the initial pile of 32 coins into two sub-piles of 16 coins each.     - Place one sub-pile on each side of the scale.      - If the scale balances, the counterfeit coins are in different sub-piles, and we can conclude the task is complete.     - If the scale does not balance, both counterfeit coins are in the heavier or lighter sub-pile. 3. **Second Weighing:**     - Take the sub-pile with the counterfeit coins (16 coins) and divide it into two sub-piles of 8 coins each.     - Place one sub-pile on each side of the scale.     - If the scale balances, the counterfeit coins are in different sub-piles, and the task is complete.     - If the scale does not balance, both counterfeit coins are again in the heavier or lighter sub-pile. 4. **Third Weighing:**     - Take the sub-pile with the counterfeit coins (8 coins) and divide it into two sub-piles of 4 coins each.     - Place one sub-pile on each side of the scale.     - If the scale balances, the counterfeit coins are in different sub-piles, and the task is complete.     - If the scale does not balance, both counterfeit coins are in the heavier or lighter sub-pile. 5. **Fourth Weighing:**     - Finally, take the sub-pile with the counterfeit coins (4 coins) and divide it into two sub-piles of 2 coins each.     - Place one sub-pile on each side of the scale.     - If the scale balances, the counterfeit coins are in different sub-piles. Thus the task is complete, and both piles should balance.    At the end of the fourth weighing, we ensure that the counterfeit coins, which differ in weight from the others, are in different piles. Therefore, the two piles will weigh equally.  Part (b) In the case with 22 coins, there are two approaches to solving the problem: **First Method:** 1. **Initial Setup:**     - Consider the same halving strategy used in part (a).     - If the number of coins in a pile is odd, we split it into two nearly equal sub-piles (one with an extra coin). 2. **Sequence of Weighings:**     - First weighing: Place sub-piles of nearly equal size (e.g., 11 coins on each side).     - Second weighing: Split the resulting unbalanced set into two nearly equal parts (e.g., 5 and 6 if there were 11 initially).     - Continue halving (or nearly halving) until the final sub-pile of 2 coins each weigh equally. By this method, each weighing progressively reduces the pile size, ensuring the counterfeit coins eventually are balanced out between two equal piles. **Second Method:** 1. **Initial Setup:**     - Set aside one coin and divide the remaining 21 coins into three piles of 7 coins each. 2. **First Weighing:**     - Place two of the three piles (7 coins each) on the scale.     - If they balance, the counterfeit coins are either both in the third pile or not present; return to dividing this pile.     - If they do not balance, the counterfeit coins are in the heavier or lighter pile. 3. **Adding Extra Coin:**     - Add the set-aside coin to the third pile of 7 (now 8 coins).     - Using the previous logic from part (a), weigh up parts so that the final balancing act can ensure equal distribution. At the end, these steps will ensure the counterfeit coins are separated into different piles. # Conclusion Following either part of the strategy comprehensively ensures the counterfeit coins end up in separate piles, ensuring the two piles weigh equally. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"a large population, a certain characteristic has a distribution that is symmetric about the mean m.

One day, a pirate named Félix arrived on the island and found that all the chameleons were the same color. What was that color?","output":"1. **Initial Setup and Variables:**    Set (a), (b), and (c) to represent the number of blue, white, and red chameleons, respectively. Initially, we have:    [    a = 800, quad b = 1000, quad c = 1220    ]    The total number of chameleons is:    [    a + b + c = 800 + 1000 + 1220 = 3020    ] 2. **Analyzing the Color Change Dynamics:**    When two chameleons of different colors meet, they both change to the third color. Specifically:    - A meeting between a blue chameleon (denoted (B)) and a white chameleon (denoted (W)) results in both turning red (denoted (R)).    - A meeting between a blue chameleon ((B)) and a red chameleon ((R)) results in both turning white ((W)).    - A meeting between a white chameleon ((W)) and a red chameleon ((R)) results in both turning blue ((B)). 3. **Invariant Exploration:**    To solve the problem, we look for an invariant that holds despite these interactions. An effective invariant could be derived from considering the properties modulo 3 (since each meeting involves chameleons changing by (pm1) or (pm2)):    [    a  (text{mod}  3), quad b  (text{mod}  3), quad c  (text{mod}  3)    ]    Calculate the initial values:    [    a  (text{mod}  3) = 800  (text{mod}  3) = 2    ]    [    b  (text{mod}  3) = 1000  (text{mod}  3) = 1    ]    [    c  (text{mod}  3) = 1220  (text{mod}  3) = 2    ] 4. **Checking Consistency Over Meetings:**    Note that each meeting’s change will preserve the sum modulo 3. Define:    [    S = a + b + c    ]    Before any chameleons meet:    [    S   (text{mod}  3) = 3020   (text{mod}  3) = 1    ]    After any number of meetings, since the total number of chameleons stays the same and the modulo 3 value of the changes results in no net change mod 3:    [    a + b + c equiv 1  (text{mod}  3)    ] 5. **Consistency with Final Configuration:**    When all chameleons turn into the same color:    - Let (k) be the color other chameleons are.    - Let's suppose (a = 3020, b = 0, c = 0) or any other combination of a similar kind.    Therefore, for every combination to obey (1  (text{mod}  3)), the only combination is when all chameleons turn to white (having (b = 3020, a = 0, c = 0)) as the others will result otherwise. #  Conclusion: [ boxed{text{La couleur finale des caméléons était blanche.}} ]"},{"instruction":"a box containing 3 pennies (1 cent each), 5 nickels (5 cents each), and 4 dimes (10 cents each), you draw six coins without replacement.

Method I: Using Perfect Square Completes 1. Start from the given expression:     [     5x^2 + 5y^2 + 8xy + 2y - 2x + 2.     ] 2. Rewrite the expression by cleverly grouping and completing the square:     [     5x^2 + 5y^2 + 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2 + frac{8}{5}xy).     ]     Observe that:     [     x^2 + y^2 + frac{8}{5}xy = (x + frac{4}{5}y)^2 - frac{1}{25}y^2.     ]     Thus,     [     5(x^2 + y^2 + frac{8}{5}xy) = 5 left( (x + frac{4}{5}y)^2 - frac{1}{25}y^2 right) = 5(x + frac{4}{5}y)^2 - y^2.     ] 3. Incorporate the other terms and complete on the right hand side:     [     5(x + frac{4}{5}y)^2 - y^2 + 2y - 2x + 2.     ]     Notice that this can be written as:     [     = 5x^2 + 5y^2 + 8xy + 2y - 2x + 2.     ] 4. Introduce substitutions (a = x + 1) and (b = y - 1):     [     5(a + b - 2)^2 - 2(a-1)(b+1) geqslant 0 rightarrow 5(a + b)^2 - 2ab.     ] 5. The simplified equations results in:     [     5a^2 + 8ab + 5b^2 geqslant 0.     ]     When ( b = 0 ), it's evident. 6. Consider general case where (b neq 0). Dividing both sides through (b^2) results:     [     5left(frac{a}{b}right)^2 + 8left(frac{a}{b}right) + 5 geqslant 0.     ] 7. The quadratic expression:     [     5t^2 + 8t + 5 geqslant 0,     ]     with (t = frac{a}{b}). This holds since its discriminant (Delta = 8^2 - 4 cdot 5 cdot 5 = 64 - 100 = -36) is negative. In this way, the expression holds for arbitrarily chosen real values (x) and (y).  Method II: Completing the Square Directly 1. Analyze the expression using completing squares:     [     5x^2 + 5y^2 + 8xy + 2y - 2x + 2.     ] 2.

Completing the square the original equation becomes:     [     = 4(x+y)^2 + (x-1)^2 + (y+1)^2.     ] Conclusively, since the sum of squares is always non-negative: [ 4(x+y)^2 + (x-1)^2 + (y+1)^2 geq 0. ] And thus, [  boxed{5x^2 + 5y^2 + 8xy + 2y - 2x + 2 geqslant 0}. ]"},{"instruction":"Given three numbers a=6^{0.7}, b=0.7^{0.8}, and c=0.8^{0.7}, determine the relationship between the magnitudes of these numbers.

Analyze the derivative ( g'(x) ):    - For ( 0 < x < mathrm{e} ), ( 1 - ln x > 0 ), implying ( g'(x) > 0 ). Hence, ( g(x) ) is increasing.    - For ( x > mathrm{e} ), ( 1 - ln x < 0 ), implying ( g'(x) < 0 ). Hence, ( g(x) ) is decreasing.    - At ( x = mathrm{e} ), ( 1 - ln mathrm{e} = 0 ).

Based on the given condition, we need ( f(x) = kx ) to intersect ( g(x) ) at two points in the interval ( left[frac{1}{mathrm{e}}, mathrm{e}right] ). 6. Analyze intersections between ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ):    - At ( x = frac{1}{mathrm{e}} ), ( fleft(frac{1}{mathrm{e}}right) = k cdot frac{1}{mathrm{e}} ). Since ( gleft(frac{1}{mathrm{e}}right) = -mathrm{e} ), it requires that ( k cdot frac{1}{mathrm{e}} < -mathrm{e} ) for a valid intersection.    - At ( x = mathrm{e} ), ( f(mathrm{e}) = k cdot mathrm{e} ). Since ( g(mathrm{e}) = frac{1}{mathrm{e}} ), it requires that ( k cdot mathrm{e} < frac{1}{mathrm{e}} ) for a valid intersection. 7. Solve for critical values of ( k ):    - From ( k cdot frac{1}{mathrm{e}} < -mathrm{e} ), we get ( k < -mathrm{e}^2 ). As a valid solution for two intersections is required, discard non-physical results.    - From ( k cdot mathrm{e} = frac{1 - ln x_0}{x_0^2} ) while simultaneously considering that ( k x_0 = frac{ln x_0}{x_0} ). 8.

Suppose it is possible:    [    5x^{20} + 2 = P^2(x) + Q^2(x)    ]    where ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ) are polynomials with integer coefficients. 2. **Evaluation at a Specific Point:**    Substitute ( x = 1 ) into the equation:    [    5(1)^{20} + 2 = P^2(1) + Q^2(1)     ]    Simplify the left-hand side:    [    5 + 2 = P^2(1) + Q^2(1)    ]    Therefore:    [    7 = P^2(1) + Q^2(1)    ] 3. **Analyzing the Equation:**    Next, we analyze the equation ( 7 = P^2(1) + Q^2(1) ).

According to number theory, a natural number can be expressed as a sum of two squares if and only if in its prime factorization, every prime of the form ( 4k + 3 ) (with ( k ) an integer) appears with an even exponent. 5. **Prime Factorization:**    The number 7 itself is a prime and can be written in the form ( 4 cdot 1 + 3 ). Importantly, 7 appears with an exponent of 1 in its prime factorization (since ( 7 = 7^1 )), which is an odd exponent. Therefore, 7 cannot be written as the sum of two squares. 6. **Conclusion:**    Since 7 cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares of integers, it is impossible to write ( 5x^{20} + 2 ) as ( P^2(x) + Q^2(x) ) where ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ) are polynomials with integer coefficients.

This central placement will be a pivot for the anti-symmetric strategy. 3. **Maintaining Anti-Symmetry**:    For each move Vasya makes, Petya will ensure that the configuration remains anti-symmetric. Specifically, if Vasya places a number n in a cell A, Petya will place the number 8 - n in the cell A' that is symmetric to A with respect to the central cell. 4. **Ensuring a Valid Move for Petya**:    We will demonstrate that Petya will always have a valid move following Vasya's move. Suppose Vasya places a number n in a cell A. Petya's task is to place 8-n in the symmetric cell A'.     To prove this, consider the cell A placed by Vasya and the symmetric cell A'. Before Petya's move, the symmetric pair (A, A') should be empty unless previously filled by Petya in response to Vasya's prior move. Since Vasya's move n does not conflict with this requirement (as 8-n should not be in row or column of A'), Petya can always place 8 - n in A'.  5. **Handling Contradictions**:    Let's assume that it’s not possible for Petya to place 8-n. This would mean that the cell A' either already contains a number 8-n or is not available. However, by the definition of the anti-symmetric configuration, such a contradiction cannot occur because Petya ensures it doesn't by his strategy. 6. **Conclusion**:    By consistently following this strategy of maintaining anti-symmetric placement, Petya will always have a valid move available until the board is completely filled. Since Petya moves first and correctly responds to each of Vasya's moves, Vasya will be the first one unable to move, thus losing the game.

From the problem statement, we know that |overrightarrow{OA}|=|overrightarrow{OB}|=|overrightarrow{OC}|=r. Let the angle between overrightarrow{OA} and overrightarrow{OB} be theta, where theta in [0,pi]. 2. We have overrightarrow{OA} cdot overrightarrow{OB} = |overrightarrow{OA}||overrightarrow{OB}|cos{theta} = r^2cos{theta}. 3.

Define ( B' = {a_{M+3}, a_{M+4}, cdots} ). 5. **Apply the inequality on consecutive triples in ( B' )**:    [    a_{M+3}a_{M+4}a_{M+5} le lambda(M+3)(M+4)(M+5)    ]    [    a_{M+6}a_{M+7}a_{M+8} le lambda(M+6)(M+7)(M+8)    ]    [    a_{M+9}a_{M+10}a_{M+11} le lambda(M+9)(M+10)(M+11)    ]    [    cdots    ] 6. **Multiply the inequalities**: For any ( i = M + 3d ) for ( d in mathbb{N} ), we have:    [    a_{M+3}a_{M+4}a_{M+5} cdots a_i a_{i+1} a_{i+2} le lambda^{d+1} (M+3)(M+4)(M+5) cdots (i)(i+1)(i+2)    ] 7. **Multiply by (pi = a_1 a_2 a_3 cdots a_{M+2})**:    [    a_1 a_2 a_3 cdots a_{i+2} le pi lambda^{d+1} (M+3)(M+4)(M+5) cdots (i)(i+1)(i+2)    ]    [    (i+2)! le pi lambda^{d+1} (M+3)(M+4)(M+5) cdots (i)(i+1)(i+2)    ]    [    (M+2)! le pi lambda^{d+1}    ] 8. **Contradiction**: Since (pi) is a fixed constant, we can take sufficiently large ( d ) such that the inequality is obviously false (because (lambda in (0, 1)) so as ( d to infty, lambda^{d+1} to 0)). This is a contradiction, so we conclude that ( B = {a_{Omega+1}, a_{Omega+2}, cdots} ) contains infinitely many triples ((a_m, a_{m+1}, a_{m+2})) such that ( a_m a_{m+1} a_{m+2} ge lambda m(m+1)(m+2) ). 9. **Consider one of those triples**: ((a_m, a_{m+1}, a_{m+2})). Since (text{lcm}(x, y) ge x, y) for any two positive integers ( x, y ), we must have:    [    a_m le cm, quad a_{m+1} le c(m+1), quad a_{m+2} le c(m+2)    ] 10. **Denote ( s = min{a_m, a_{m+1}} ) and ( t = max{a_m, a_{m+1}} )**:     - **Case 1**: ( s nmid t ). If ( s nmid t ), then (gcd(a_m, a_{m+1}) = gcd(s, t) ne s). Since (gcd(s, t)) is a positive integer divisor of ( s ) that is not equal to ( s ), we conclude that (gcd(s, t) le frac{s}{2}). 11. **Show a contradiction**:     [     text{lcm}(a_m, a_{m+1}) le cm implies a_m a_{m+1} le cm gcd(a_m, a_{m+1}) implies st le cm left(frac{s}{2}right) implies t le frac{cm}{2}     ]     [     left(frac{cm}{2}right)^2 ge t^2 ge st = frac{a_m a_{m+1} a_{m+2}}{a_{m+2}} ge frac{lambda m(m+1)(m+2)}{a_{m+2}}     ]     [     a_{m+2} ge frac{4lambda m(m+1)(m+2)}{c^2 m^2} ge frac{4lambda (m+2)}{c^2}     ]     Since ( a_{m+2} le c(m+2) ), it follows that:     [     c(m+2) ge frac{4lambda (m+2)}{c^2} implies c^3 ge 4lambda     ]     Since ( c in left(0, frac{3}{2}right) ), we can take (lambda = 0.99) for instance, and we have a clear contradiction. This completes Case 1. 12. **Case 2**: ( s mid t ). If ( s mid t ), then set ( s = alpha t ) for (alpha in {2, 3, 4, cdots}) (note that (alpha ne 1) because ({a_i}) consists of distinct integers). In addition, observe that (gcd(a_m, a_{m+1}) = gcd(s, t) = s). Then since ( a_m a_{m+1} le cm gcd(a_m, a_{m+1}) ), it follows that:     [     cms ge st implies cm le t = alpha s     ] 13. **Conclusion**: Since Case 1 is impossible, we must have ( s mid t ), or one term is a multiple of the other. This implies that there exist infinitely many positive integers ( k ) such that (text{lcm}(a_k, a_{k+1}) > ck). (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"The function y=x^{2} is shifted 2 units upwards.

The question asks us to find the new function expression after the graph of this function is shifted 2 units upwards. 1. **Understanding the Shift:** A vertical shift upwards by k units in the graph of a function f(x) can be represented by adding k to the function. In this case, k=2. 2. **Applying the Shift:** Given the original function y = -x^2, shifting it 2 units upwards means we add 2 to the function.

Given that we need to ensure the placement of numbers such that no two adjacent numbers share a common divisor other than 1, we must primarily focus on the concept of coprimality. Two numbers are said to be coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. To form a valid solution, we need to be methodical. Let's follow these steps: 1. **Identify pairs of numbers that are coprime**: We need to arrange the numbers in such a way that pairs of adjacent numbers are coprime.  2. **Check for the simplest cases first**: Numbers that are close to each other need to be checked for common divisors. 3. **Pair each number carefully**: In the adjacent connections, prefer numbers with smaller prime factors pairing with only larger prime numbers when possible. Inspecting the number placements, here we see a step-by-step filling according to a pattern ensuring no adjacent numbers share a divisor other than 1: 1. Start with the number **1** which is coprime with any other number. 2. Place **1** next to **2** since it's the smallest prime number.  3. Placing **2** next to a different prime, say **3**. Note that **2** and **3** are coprime. 4.

Let's subtract digit by digit from right to left: Starting from the rightmost digit (ones place): 2 - 9 is not possible without borrowing, so we borrow 1 from the tens place (making it 7 instead of 8), and now we have 12 - 9 = 3. This matches the D in the result, so D = 3. Now, moving to the tens place: 7 (after borrowing) - C is not straightforward without knowing C, but we know that the result must be 8. Since we borrowed 1 from the tens place, we need to add that back to the result. So, we have 7 - C + 10 = 8 + 10 (because of the borrowing from the hundreds place, which we will do next). This simplifies to 17 - C = 18, which means C = -1. However, C must be a digit from 0 to 9, so there must be another borrowing from the hundreds place. Now, let's consider the hundreds place: B (after borrowing) - 9 should result in 9. Since we borrowed from the hundreds place, we actually have B - 1 - 9 = 9. This simplifies to B - 10 = 9, which means B = 19. But B must be a single digit, so this is not possible. We must have made a mistake in our assumption about borrowing from the hundreds place. Let's re-evaluate the tens place with the correct borrowing: We know that we need to borrow from the hundreds place, so the tens place becomes 17 (after borrowing) - C = 8. This means C = 9. Now, let's consider the hundreds place again: B (after borrowing) - 9 should result in 4. Since we borrowed from the hundreds place, we actually have B - 1 - 9 = 4. This simplifies to B - 10 = 4, which means B = 14. But B must be a single digit, so we must borrow from the thousands place. Now, let's consider the thousands place: A - 1 (because we borrowed) should result in 4. This means A = 4 + 1, which gives us A = 5. So, the value of A is 5. The subtraction equation now looks like 5B82 - 9C9 = 4933, with B = 1 (since we borrowed from the thousands place) and C = 9 (from our previous calculation). The final equation is boxed{5182}  - 999 = 4933, which checks out. Therefore, A = 5."},{"instruction":"Let p, q, and r be the roots of the polynomial 5x^3  10x^2 + 17x  7 = 0.

By drawing a diagonal, we split the rectangle into two right-angled triangles. The length of the diagonal (d) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to select two shoes from the box. Since there are 10 shoes in total, the number of ways to select the first shoe is 10. After selecting the first shoe, there are 9 shoes left, so the number of ways to select the second shoe is 9. Therefore, the total number of ways to select two shoes is: 10 (ways to select the first shoe) * 9 (ways to select the second shoe) = 90 ways However, since the order in which we select the shoes does not matter (selecting shoe A first and then shoe B is the same as selecting shoe B first and then shoe A), we need to divide this number by 2 to account for the combinations rather than permutations: 90 / 2 = 45 combinations Now, let's calculate the number of ways to select a matching pair. Since there are 5 pairs of shoes, there are 5 ways to select a matching pair (one way for each pair). Therefore, the probability of selecting a matching pair of shoes is the number of ways to select a matching pair divided by the total number of combinations: Probability = (Number of ways to select a matching pair) / (Total number of combinations) Probability = 5 / 45 Probability = 1 / 9 So, the probability of selecting a matching pair of shoes from the box is boxed{1/9} ."},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, let D be any point on the angle bisector of angle A.

Alex is 3 years younger than Bella. 5. The sum of Kaylee's and Bella's age is 9 years more than Matt's age. First, let's find out how old Kaylee will be in 7 years: Since Matt is currently 5 years old, in 7 years, Kaylee will be 3 times Matt's current age, which is 3 * 5 = 15 years old. So, Kaylee's current age is 15 years - 7 years = 8 years old. Next, let's find out the combined age of Alex and Bella: Twice Matt's age is 2 * 5 = 10 years, and 4 years more than that is 10 + 4 = 14 years. So, Alex and Bella's combined age is 14 years. Since Alex is 3 years younger than Bella, let's denote Bella's age as B and Alex's age as B - 3. Therefore, B + (B - 3) = 14 2B - 3 = 14 2B = 14 + 3 2B = 17 B = 17 / 2 B = 8.5 years old Since we can't have half years for age, it seems there might be a mistake in the information provided or in the calculations.

We know that the sum of Kaylee's and Bella's age is 9 years more than Matt's age: Kaylee's age + Bella's age = Matt's age + 9 8 (Kaylee's age) + B (Bella's age) = 5 (Matt's age) + 9 8 + B = 5 + 9 8 + B = 14 B = 14 - 8 B = 6 years old Now, let's find Alex's age: Since Alex is 3 years younger than Bella, Alex's age is B - 3 = 6 - 3 = 3 years old. To summarize: - Kaylee is 8 years old. - Matt is 5 years old. - Bella is 6 years old. - Alex is 3 years old.

The inequality becomes: [ ln t>frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1} ] Define g(t)=ln t-frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1} for t>1. Then, [ g'(t)=frac{1}{t}-frac{4t}{{(t^2+1)}^2}=frac{{(t^2-1)}^2}{t{(t^2+1)}^2} > 0 ] Since g'(t) > 0 for t > 1, g(t) is increasing, and thus g(t) > g(1) = 0.

Begin by analyzing the original problem setup. We have a (3 times 3) square formed using 12 small sticks, and 9 small sticks being used to form 3 small (1 times 2) rectangles and 3 small (1 times 1) squares. From this, we understand the problem involves partitioning a larger rectangle into smaller subrectangles. 2. Let's consider a larger rectangle of size (8 times 12) constructed using 40 sticks. We need to determine how many additional sticks are required to divide this (8 times 12) rectangle into 40 smaller rectangles, where each smaller rectangle is either (1 times 2) or (1 times 3). 3. Assume all 40 small rectangles are initially (1 times 3). Calculate the total area these rectangles would cover:    [    40 times 3 = 120 text{ square units}    ]    However, the area of the given (8 times 12) rectangle is:    [    8 times 12 = 96 text{ square units}    ]    Since 120 square units exceed 96 square units, not all smaller rectangles can be (1 times 3). 4. Determine the distribution of (1 times 2) and (1 times 3) rectangles that will fit exactly into the (8 times 12) rectangle. Let (x) be the number of (1 times 2) rectangles and (y) be the number of (1 times 3) rectangles. We have two equations:    [    x + y = 40 quad text{(total number of smaller rectangles)}    ]    [    2x + 3y = 96 quad text{(total area constraint)}    ] 5. Solve these simultaneous equations. From (x + y = 40), we get:    [    y = 40 - x    ]    Substitute (y = 40 - x) into (2x + 3y = 96):    [    2x + 3(40 - x) = 96    ]    Simplify and solve for (x):    [    2x + 120 - 3x = 96    ]    [    -x + 120 = 96    ]    [    x = 24    ]    So, the number of (1 times 2) rectangles is 24. 6. Using (x = 24) in (x + y = 40), find (y):    [    24 + y = 40    ]    [    y = 16    ]    Thus, the number of (1 times 3) rectangles is 16. 7. Calculate the total perimeter contributed by these smaller rectangles:    [    text{Perimeter of a } 1 times 2 text{ rectangle} = 6 quad (text{two lengths and two widths})    ]    [    text{Perimeter of a } 1 times 3 text{ rectangle} = 8 quad (text{two lengths and two widths})    ]    Therefore, for 24 rectangles (1 times 2):    [    6 times 24 = 144    ]    For 16 rectangles (1 times 3):    [    8 times 16 = 128    ]    Total perimeter:    [    144 + 128 = 272    ] 8.

Analyze the number of such arithmetic progressions ( A ) in two cases:  Case 1: ( n ) is an even number - When ( n ) is even, let ( n = 2k ). - For ( 1 leq d leq k ), the values of ( A ) with common difference ( d ) range from ( 1, 1+d, 1+2d, ldots ) up to ( n ).

This equation involves two variables, x and y. A quadratic equation in one variable should only involve one variable, typically x, and be of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants, and a neq 0. Therefore, option A does not meet the criteria because it involves two variables. - **Option B:** The equation is ax^{2}-bx+c=0. This is the general form of a quadratic equation. However, for it to remain a quadratic equation, a must not be equal to 0. If a=0, the equation becomes linear, not quadratic. Since the condition for a not being 0 is not explicitly stated as always being met, this option, while generally representing a quadratic equation, has a condition under which it would not be quadratic. - **Option C:** The equation frac{1}{x^2}+x=2 is considered. This equation involves a term with x in the denominator, making it a rational equation rather than a standard quadratic equation. A quadratic equation should have the variable x in the numerator and to the second power without division by a variable term. Thus, option C does not meet the requirements for a quadratic equation in one variable. - **Option D:** The equation is x^{2}=0. This is a simplified form of a quadratic equation where a=1, b=0, and c=0. It perfectly fits the definition of a quadratic equation in one variable, which is ax^2 + bx + c = 0 with a neq 0. Since it only involves the variable x to the second power and meets all the criteria for a quadratic equation in one variable, option D is the correct choice. Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"instruction":"The pentagons  P_1P_2P_3P_4P_5  and I_1I_2I_3I_4I_5  are cyclic, where  I_i  is the incentre of the triangle  P_{i1}P_iP_{i+1}  (reckoned cyclically, that is  P_0=P_5  and  P_6=P_1 ).

We start by noting that:    [    angle I_1P_1I_2 = frac{1}{2} angle P_3P_1P_5    ]    This is because ( I_1 ) and ( I_2 ) are incenters, and the angle at ( P_1 ) is bisected by the line segments connecting ( P_1 ) to ( I_1 ) and ( I_2 ). 4. **Step 2**: Similarly, we have:    [    angle I_1P_2I_2 = frac{1}{2} angle P_3P_1P_5    ]    This implies that the quadrilateral ( I_1I_2P_1P_2 ) is cyclic. 5. **Step 3**: Next, we consider the angle ( angle I_3I_1P_1 ):    [    angle I_3I_1P_1 = angle I_3I_1I_2 + angle I_2I_1P_1    ]    Since ( I_1I_2P_1P_2 ) is cyclic, we can use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals to find:    [    angle I_3I_1P_1 = angle I_3I_4I_2 + 180^circ - angle I_2P_2P_1    ] 6. **Step 4**: We continue by analyzing the angles involving ( I_4 ) and ( I_3 ):    [    angle I_3I_1P_1 = angle P_4I_4I_2 - angle P_4I_4I_3 + angle P_3I_3I_2    ]    Simplifying further:    [    angle I_3I_1P_1 = angle P_4I_4I_2 - 180^circ + angle P_4P_3I_3 + angle P_3I_3I_2    ] 7. **Step 5**: We then use the fact that the pentagon is cyclic to relate the angles:    [    angle I_3I_1P_1 = angle P_4I_4I_2 + angle I_2P_2P_4 + 180^circ - angle P_3P_2P_5 - angle P_2I_2I_3    ] 8. **Step 6**: Combining the angles, we get:    [    angle I_3I_1P_1 + angle I_3P_3P_1 = angle I_2I_4P_4 + angle I_2P_2P_4    ]    This simplifies to:    [    angle I_3I_1P_1 + angle I_3P_3P_1 = 180^circ - (angle I_4I_2P_2 + angle I_4P_4P_2)    ] 9. **Step 7**: Since the pentagon has 5 sides (an odd number), the angles must satisfy the cyclic property, leading to:    [    I_1I_3P_1P_3 text{ is cyclic}    ] 10. **Step 8**: By the radical axis theorem, the lines ( P_1I_1 ), ( P_2I_2 ), and ( P_3I_3 ) concur.

Substituting our values, we get d = frac{|1 - 9 + 3|}{sqrt{1^2 + 3^2}} = frac{sqrt{10}}{2}. Finally, we use the chord length formula, which states that the length of a chord in a circle is 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2}, where r is the radius and d is the distance from the chord to the circle's center. Substituting our values, we get the chord length AB = 2sqrt{(sqrt{10})^2 - (frac{sqrt{10}}{2})^2} = 2sqrt{10 - frac{5}{2}} = sqrt{30}.

For Store B: - Both tennis rackets and tennis balls are discounted by 90%, so the price per tennis racket becomes 100 times 90% = 90 yuan, and the price per can of tennis balls becomes 25 times 90% = 22.5 yuan. - Therefore, the total amount needed to pay when purchasing from Store B is 90 times 40 + 22.5x = 3600 + 22.5x yuan.

For these red edges, assign a unique prime number to each one.  3. **Prime Number Assignment**:    Assign the number 1 to all edges that connect adjacent vertices of the polyhedron. 4. **Calculation of Vertex Values**:    For each vertex, compute the product of the numbers written on the red edges and the usual edges connected to that vertex. Assign this product to the corresponding vertex. 5. **Relatively Prime Determination**:    Two integers have a common divisor greater than 1 if and only if they share a common prime factor.  6. **Verification**:    - Consider two vertices A and B.    - If A and B are not adjacent, the \\"red edge\\" connecting them is assigned a unique prime number.    - The product calculated for each vertex includes this prime if the vertex is connected by the red edge.    - Therefore, the values at A and B will share this prime factor, implying they are not relatively prime. 7. **Adjacent Vertices**:    - If A and B are adjacent, the edge connecting them is assigned the number 1.    - There are no additional shared prime factors contributed by this adjacent edge.    - Thus, if A and B are adjacent, their corresponding values will be relatively prime as the product at each vertex will not include a common prime from a red edge. 8. **Conclusion**:    The integers assigned in this manner ensure that two vertices are relatively prime if and only if they are adjacent. 9. **Extension to General Graphs**:    This proof does not only apply to polyhedra but can be generalized to any graph. It utilizes the idea that, given any number of red edges, there are sufficiently many unique prime numbers that can be assigned to guarantee the desired property.

Now we evaluate f'(1): f'(1) = 2 cdot 1 - 3 + frac{1}{1} = -1. The slope of the tangent line at x = 1 is -1. The tangent line passes through (1, f(1)), which is (1, -2).

Then, n^3 is odd as the cube of an odd number is odd. Whether n^3 is prime depends on n. For instance, if n = 2, n^3 = 8 which is not prime. Generally, for any n greater than 1, n^3 will not be prime (it will be divisible by n). Therefore, this operation does not always yield a prime number. 2. **Taking the base-3 logarithm (integer part) of an odd integer**:    Consider n=3^k pm m where m is small and such that n remains an odd integer. Then, lfloor log_3(n) rfloor = k, which is an integer and need not be prime. Therefore, this operation does not guarantee a prime number. 3. **Adding 2 to an odd integer**:    If n is odd, n+2 is also odd. Depending on n, n+2 can be prime. For example, if n = 1, then n+2 = 3, which is prime. Adding 2 to an odd number may result in a prime, but not necessarily (e.g., n=9, then n+2=11 which is prime; n=15, then n+2=17 which is also prime, but n=5, then n+2=7 which is prime). This operation can potentially yield prime numbers. 4. **Multiplying an odd integer by 3**:    If n is odd, 3n is also odd. However, 3n will be divisible by 3 and, hence, cannot be prime unless n=1. Generally, this operation does not result in a prime number. 5. **Subtracting 1 from an odd integer**:    For n odd, n-1 is even and not prime (except when n=3, then n-1=2 which is prime). Thus, generally, this operation does not yield a prime number. After analyzing, operation 3 (Adding 2 to an odd integer) seems to be the most plausible for mapping some odd integers to prime numbers, albeit not guaranteed for all odd integers.

Hence:     [     a_{n+1} = a_n - P(a_n) geq a_n - frac{a_n}{2} = frac{a_n}{2}     ]     Since the smallest prime factor is at least 2:     [     a_n - P(a_n) geq 2     ]     This case implies that the sequence is strictly decreasing when (a_n) has at least two distinct prime factors. 3. Consider the case where (a_n) is a prime number (p) or a power of a prime (p^alpha). Analyze the sequence transformation:     [     a_{n+1} = a_n + P(a_n)     ]     If ( a_n = p^alpha ), then ( P(a_n) = p ) and:     [     a_{n+1} = a_n + P(a_n) = p^alpha + p     ]     Since (a_{n+1}) is not a prime or a prime power, implying (a_n) did change its nature. 4. Consider a specific simple case when (a_n = 2):     [     a_{m+1} = 2 + P(2) = 2 + 2 = 4     ]     [     a_{m+2} = 4 + P(4) = 4 + 2 = 6     ]     [     a_{m+3} = 6 - P(6) = 6 - 3 = 3     ]     [     a_{m+4} = 3 + P(3) = 3 + 3 = 6     ]     [     a_{m+5} = 6 - P(6) = 6 - 3 = 3     ]     From (a_{m+2}) onwards, the sequence becomes periodic with a period (T) of 2. 5. Finally, combining all cases, for any (a_n), the sequence will either decrease (until it reaches 2 and start the periodic behavior as shown in step 4) or become non-prime/power of a prime which falls in a fruitful pattern. We can always find an (N) beyond which the sequence stabilizes to a period (T). Hence, the sequence (left{a_nright}) will eventually become periodic, confirmed by the nature of multiplicative decline for composite and additive nature transformation for primes. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The sequence } left{a_nright} text{ is eventually periodic.}} ]"},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, if sin^2A + sin^2B < sin^2C, then the shape of triangle ABC is (　　) A: Obtuse triangle B: Right triangle C: Acute triangle D: Cannot be determined","output":"Given the condition sin^2A + sin^2B < sin^2C, we can infer the nature of triangle ABC.

According to the information given: - Jeff has twice as many cars as trucks, so he has 2T cars. - He has 3 times as many motorcycles as cars, so he has 3 * 2T = 6T motorcycles. - He has half as many buses as trucks, so he has T/2 buses. The total number of vehicles Jeff has is the sum of the number of trucks, cars, motorcycles, and buses, which is 180. So we can write the equation: T + 2T + 6T + T/2 = 180 Combining like terms, we get: 9T + T/2 = 180 To solve for T, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying every term by 2 to get rid of the denominator: 2 * 9T + 2 * T/2 = 2 * 180 18T + T = 360 Now we combine like terms again: 19T = 360 To find T, we divide both sides by 19: T = 360 / 19 T = 18.9473684211 Since the number of vehicles cannot be a fraction, we need to find the nearest whole number that, when plugged into our equations, gives us a total of 180 vehicles.

Setting (x-3)^2 + y^2 = x^2 + (y-3)^2: - Expanding and simplifying, x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 6y + 9 - Simplifying further, -6x = -6y - This implies x = y.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Graph Representation**:    - Represent the 120 people as a graph ( G ) with 120 vertices.     - Edges in the graph represent friendships between pairs of vertices (people). 2. **Weak Quartets in Graphs**:    - ( q(G) ) denotes the number of weak quartets in ( G ). 3. **Properties of the Graph**:    - To maximize ( q(G) ), we consider breaking the graph ( G ) into a disjoint union of complete graphs ( G_1, G_2, ..., G_n ).    - To show this, observe that in an extremal graph, any two adjacent vertices ( x ) and ( y ) must have the same neighbors (excluding themselves). This is achieved through a copying process. 4. **Copying Process**:    - Define ( G_{x} ) to be the graph obtained by copying ( y ) to ( x ) (i.e., making ( x ) and ( y ) have the same neighbors).    - Similarly, define ( G_{y} ) to be the graph obtained by copying ( x ) to ( y ).    - Claim: ( 2q(G) leq q(G_{x}) + q(G_{y}) ). 5. **Counting Weak Quartets**:    - Analyze quartets that include vertices ( x ) and ( y ):      - Quartets not containing ( x ) or ( y ) are the same in ( G ), ( G_{x} ), and ( G_{y} ).      - Quartets containing both ( x ) and ( y ) will not decrease in ( G_{x} ) and ( G_{y} ) compared to ( G ).    - For quartets with exactly one of ( x ) or ( y ):      - In ( G_{x} ): ≥ twice the number of quartets containing ( x ) but not ( y ) from ( G ).      - In ( G_{y} ): ≥ twice the number of quartets containing ( y ) but not ( x ) from ( G ). 6. **Union of Complete Graphs**:    - Conclusion: For maximizing ( q(G) ), the graph ( G ) must break into disjoint complete graphs to maximize weak quartets. 7. **Sizes of Complete Subgraphs**:    - Let the sizes of the complete subgraphs be ( a_1, a_2, ..., a_n ).    - Total population constraint: ( a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n = 120 ). 8. **Maximizing ( q(G) )**:    - For any two ( a_i ) and ( a_j ):      - For fixed sum ( p + q = s ), formula ( q(G) = C_1 + C_2 pq + C_3 (binom{p}{2} + binom{q}{2}) + C_4 (q binom{p}{2} + p binom{q}{2}) = A + Bpq ).    - Maximum ( q(G) ) occurs when ( |p - q| leq 1 ). 9. **Optimal Complete Graph Sizes**:    - If the graph ( G ) comprises ( n ) disjoint complete graphs, optimal sizes (potentially non-integral) are all equal: ( a_1 = a_2 = ... = a_n = frac{120}{n} ). 10. **Value Calculation**:    - For ( n = 5 ): Each subgraph size ( a_i = 24 ).    - Calculate maximum weak quartets when ( a_1 = a_2 = ... = a_n = 24 ):      [ Q_5 = frac{120^2}{5} binom{24}{2} binom{4}{2} = 30 times 120^2 times frac{(4)(3)(96)}{5^3} = 4769280. ]  Conclusion: The maximum possible number of weak quartets among 120 people is (boxed{4769280})."},{"instruction":"f i^2 = 1, what is the value of (1+2i)^{24}(12i)^{24}?

Since both trains are 500 m long, the total distance is the length of one train (because we're considering the time taken for the slower train to pass just the driver of the faster one, not the entire train). Total distance = 500 m Now we can find the time taken using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 500 m / 16.67 m/s ≈ 30 seconds So, the time taken by the slower train to pass the driver of the faster one is approximately boxed{30}  seconds."},{"instruction":"Sally eats 2 sandwiches on Saturday and 1 sandwich on Sunday.

This is because the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180^{circ}, and if C is obtuse, A + B must be less than 90^{circ} to ensure the sum is 180^{circ}. This leads to the inequality A < 90^{circ} - B. From this, we can deduce the following relationships: 1. Since A < 90^{circ} - B, we have sin A < sin(90^{circ} - B) = cos B. This implies that sin A - cos B < 0. 2. Similarly, by considering the complementary angle, we find that sin B < cos A, which leads to cos A - sin B > 0. Given these inequalities, we can determine the quadrant in which point P(sin A - cos B, cos A - sin B) lies. Since sin A - cos B < 0 and cos A - sin B > 0, point P is in the second quadrant where x is negative and y is positive.

If ( n ) is odd: [ 1^n + 2^n + (-2)^n + (-1)^n = 0 pmod{5} ] If ( n ) is even, let ( n = 2nu ): [ 2(2^{2nu} + 1^{2nu}) = 2(4^nu + 1^nu) ] For ( nu ) odd or even, consider whether: [ 4^nu + 1 equiv 0 pmod{5} ] It can be shown that if ( nu ) is odd ((nu) not divisible by 2), the expression is divisible by 5, while if ( nu ) is even ((nu ) divisible by 2), it is not divisible by 5. This completes part of the proof.  II. Solution For another approach: Firstly, if ( n ) is odd, we write the expression differently: [ A = (5-4)^n + 4^n + (5-3)^n + 3^n ] Expanding using the binomial theorem, we note that the last terms ( (-4)^n ) and ( 4^n ) will cancel each other out. Similar cancellation occurs for ( (5 - 3)^n ) and the corresponding ( 3^n ). Thus, the entire expression: [ (5-4)^n + 4^n + (5-3)^n + 3^n ] is divisible by 5 when ( n ) is odd. Secondly, if ( n ) is even ( n = 2m ), we rewrite it as: [ A = 1^m + 4^m + 9^m + 16^m = (10-1)^m + 1^m + (20-4)^m + 4^m ] We consider the cases separately whether ( m ) is odd or even. If ( m ) is odd: [ (10-1)^m + 1^m ] and  [ (20-4)^m + 4^m ] Here again the last terms ((-1)^m) and (1^m) would cancel out, showing divisibility by 5 when ( m ) is odd.  Finally, when ( n ) is a multiple of 4 ( (n = 4m) ): [ A = (1^4)^m + (2^4)^m + (3^4)^m + (4^4)^m = 1^m + 16^m + 81^m + 256^m ] Each of these bases modulo 5 gives remainder 1. Therefore, [ 1^m + 16^m + 81^m + 256^m equiv 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 pmod{5} ] Thus, [ A notequiv 0 pmod{5} ] when ( n ) is a multiple of 4. Hence, we have proved that  [ 1^{n} + 2^{n} + 3^{n} + 4^{n} ] is divisible by 5 if and only if ( n ) is not divisible by 4. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Mr. Earl E.

This means for every 1 meter increase in height, there is a 2 meter horizontal travel. Let's denote the increase in the person's position as x meters. Consequently, the horizontal distance covered would be 2x meters, given the slope ratio. Given that the total distance traveled is 100sqrt{5} meters, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to relate these distances. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here, the hypotenuse represents the total distance traveled, and the other two sides represent the vertical and horizontal distances traveled, respectively. Thus, we have: [x^2 + (2x)^2 = (100sqrt{5})^2] Expanding and simplifying the equation gives: [x^2 + 4x^2 = 10000 times 5] Combining like terms, we get: [5x^2 = 50000] Dividing both sides by 5, we find: [x^2 = 10000] Taking the square root of both sides gives us two possible values for x, x = 100 and x = -100.

The total distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths: Total distance = Length of Train 1 + Length of Train 2 Total distance = 180 m + 360 m Total distance = 540 m The time taken to cross each other is given as 21.598272138228943 seconds. We can calculate the relative speed (V_rel) using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time Rearranging the formula to solve for Speed, we get: Speed = Distance / Time Substituting the given values, we get: V_rel = 540 m / 21.598272138228943 s V_rel ≈ 25 m/s Now, we need to convert the relative speed from meters per second (m/s) to kilometers per hour (km/h) to match the unit of the slower train's speed: V_rel (in km/h) = V_rel (in m/s) × (3600 s/h) / (1000 m/km) V_rel (in km/h) ≈ 25 m/s × 3.6 V_rel (in km/h) ≈ 90 km/h The relative speed of 90 km/h is the sum of the speeds of both trains. We know the speed of the slower train is 30 km/h. Let's denote the speed of the faster train as V_fast.

(II) To prove the statement, let's first consider the case when the slope k of the tangent line exists. The tangent line can be written as y-y_{0}=k(x-x_{0}). Since k=-frac{x_{0}}{y_{0}}, the tangent line equation becomes y-y_{0}=-frac{x_{0}}{y_{0}}(x-x_{0}), which simplifies to x_{0}x+y_{0}y=r^{2}. If k does not exist, the coordinates of the tangent point are (±r,0), and the corresponding tangent line equations are x=±r, which still satisfy x_{0}x+y_{0}y=r^{2}.

Since both tangent lines pass through point P, we have x_{1}x_{P}+y_{1}y_{P}=1 and x_{2}x_{P}+y_{2}y_{P}=1. The equation of the chord AB is then x_{P}x+y_{P}y=1.

This accessibility means that there is a direct transfer possibility between the row adjustments:    - Since column sums are unchanged, for each plus (+) in any column, there must be a corresponding minus (-) within the same column. 5. **Sequence of Accessible Rows:**    Assume we start with a row R_1 which has a higher sum than desired (more pluses). If we have another row R_k with a lower sum (more minuses), we can always trace a sequence of accessible rows (R_1, R_2, ldots, R_k) such that each subsequent row is accessible from the previous one. 6. **Decreasing S by Accessibility Exchanges:**    Changing the signs (minus to plus and vice versa) in the intersections (C_i cap R_i) and (C_i cap R_{i+1}) (for all i) decreases S by 2 while keeping column sums unchanged:    - Each exchange of markings directly reduces the parity of our target sum (S), making it closer to zero. 7. **Existence of Accessible Sequences:**    Let (mathcal{R}) be the union of all rows accessible from (R_1), directly or indirectly. Let (bar{R}) be the complement set of rows.    - For any column C, the sum in (mathcal{R} cap C) must not be higher. If (mathcal{R} cap C) contains no pluses, this is trivial. If (mathcal{R}) contains a plus, the corresponding set (bar{R} cap C) must have no minuses.    - The above ensures that the overall sum distribution between (mathcal{R}) and (bar{R}) is balanced considering column sums remain unchanged, leading to the conclusion that some row in (mathcal{R}) has a lower desired sum. # Conclusion:  By performing these steps iteratively, the sum ( S ) continually decreases until it reaches zero, ensuring all row and column sums return to their original values. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"What is 5 cdot 7 + 9 cdot 4  30 div 3?","output":"Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BIDMAS): 1.

How much time passed between the first and last strikes?","output":"To solve the problem, we need to find out the period between the first and the last bell strike, considering that the clocks strike every 2 and 3 seconds, respectively. 1. **Identify the Timing Patterns for Each Clock:**    - The first clock strikes every 2 seconds: (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, ldots)    - The second clock strikes every 3 seconds: (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, ldots) 2. **Determine the Common Strikes:**    - A strike common to both clocks happens at the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3 seconds, which is 6 seconds.    - Thus, common strikes occur at: (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, ldots) 3. **Count the Total Strikes:**    - We are given that the clocks make a total of 13 strikes. We need to account for both individual and common strikes. 4. **Analyze a Cycle of 6 Seconds:**    - In every cycle of 6 seconds:      - The first clock strikes 3 times (at 2, 4, and 6 seconds — note that the 6-second strike is also common).      - The second clock strikes 2 times (at 3 and 6 seconds — the 6-second strike is also common).    - Common strikes occur once per cycle (6, 12, 18, …). 5. **Calculate Total Strikes Over Multiple Cycles:**    - Every 6-second cycle:       - First clock strikes: (3) times      - Second clock strikes: (2) times      - Common strike: (-1) (since it is counted twice in the above sum)    - Total effective strikes per cycle: (3 + 2 - 1 = 4) times per 6 seconds. 6. **Calculate the Number of Full Cycles Required to Accumulate 13 Strikes:**    - Sum up to as close to 13 strikes without exceeding:      - After 3 complete cycles (3 * 6 seconds = 18 seconds): (3 * 4 = 12) strikes.      - We need 1 more strike to reach 13: The next strike happens at the beginning of the next cycle. 7. **Determine the Time of the 13th Strike:**    - The additional 1 strike after 3 cycles will be at the next earliest strike, which is on the 2nd second of the next cycle. 8. **Time Between the First and Last Strikes:**    - The clock starts striking from the first second (0 seconds).    - The first strike is at 2 seconds.    - The 13th strike is at 20 seconds. # Conclusion: The time between the first and the last strike is: [ 20 , text{seconds} - 2 , text{seconds} = 18 , text{seconds} ] (boxed{18 , text{seconds}})"},{"instruction":"Does a line having only one intersection point with a hyperbola necessarily mean it is tangent to it?","output":"Not necessarily.

These rays form obtuse angles with each other since they are symmetrically placed.    - Therefore, ( n ) can be 4 (and trivially 3, 2, 1, or 0). 3. **General proof for ( n leq 4 ):**    - To prove that ( n ) cannot be greater than 4, consider the unit vectors in the directions of the rays. According to our hypothesis, the scalar (dot) product of any pair of these vectors is negative.    - Without loss of generality, we can choose the coordinate system so that one of the rays aligns with the positive x-axis, represented as ( (1, 0, 0) ). For the dot products with the other rays to be negative, their x-coordinates must be negative. 4. **Analysis in the reduced dimension ( (y, z) ):**    - Focus next on the coordinates of the remaining rays in the ( (y, z) )-plane. Each must have negative first coordinates.    - Let ( vec{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3) ) and ( vec{b} = (b_1, b_2, b_3) ) be vectors of two such rays. The dot product ( vec{a} cdot vec{b} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 ) must be negative.    - Since ( a_1 b_1 > 0 ) (because both are negative), the sum ( a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 ) must be negative for the entire dot product to be negative.    - Hence, the projections of the vectors onto the ( (y, z) )-plane should also form obtuse angles. 5. **Induction argument on dimension:**    - Select one of these projected vectors in the ( (y, z) )-plane to lie along the positive y-axis. The y-coordinates of the remaining vectors must be negative.    - Reiterate this process, eventually reducing the problem to the space spanned by the remaining coordinates.    - Use the argument that in one-dimensional space (on a line), only two elements can have negative products when no zero elements are allowed. 6. **Implication in any dimension ( k ):**    - This geometric argument works for arbitrary dimensions.    - In a ( k )-dimensional space, the maximum number of vectors (rays) such that any two have mutually negative dot products is at most ( k + 1 ) due to geometric and algebraic constraints. # Conclusion: The largest number of rays in space where any two form obtuse angles is [ boxed{4} ]"},{"instruction":"Of the 200 employees in a certain company, 30 percent will be relocated to city X and 70 percent will be relocated to city Y.

Since 70% of the employees will be relocated to city Y and 40% prefer city Y, the maximum number of employees who can be happy with going to city Y is 70% of the total employees, because that's the maximum number that will be relocated there.

Since the highest possible number of employees who will be relocated to the city they prefer is 140, and all of these can be accounted for by those going to city Y, this means that none of the employees who prefer city X can be accommodated if we are to reach this maximum number.

Jake has 2,435 - 122 = 2,313 crayons left. Next, we'll find the combined total of crayons that Lucy and Jake have: Lucy + Jake = 3,574 + 2,313 = 5,887 crayons. Finally, we'll calculate how many more crayons Willy has than the combined total of Lucy and Jake: Willy - (Lucy + Jake) = 4,328 - 5,887 = -1,559. Since the result is negative, this means that Willy does not have more crayons than the combined total of Lucy and Jake. Instead, Lucy and Jake together have boxed{1,559}  more crayons than Willy."},{"instruction":"Calculate the largest integer in a set of eight consecutive integers if their sum is 2044. textbf{(A)} 256 qquad textbf{(B)} 257 qquad textbf{(C)} 258 qquad textbf{(D)} 259 qquad textbf{(E)} 260","output":"Let the eight consecutive integers be ( n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5, n+6, n+7 ).

On that scale, the frequency corresponding to a reading of 5 is 100 times as great as the frequency corresponding to a certain reading. What is the reading that corresponds to the frequency 100 times smaller than the frequency corresponding to a reading of 5?","output":"Let's denote the reading that corresponds to the frequency 100 times smaller than the frequency corresponding to a reading of 5 as y. According to the Richter scale, each whole number increase on the scale represents a tenfold increase in the measured amplitude and roughly 31.6 times more energy release. However, in this case, we are dealing with frequency, not energy or amplitude. The problem states that a reading of x - 1 indicates one-tenth the released energy as a reading of x, but since we are dealing with frequency, we can assume a similar logarithmic relationship for frequency. If the frequency corresponding to a reading of 5 is 100 times as great as the frequency corresponding to the reading y, then we can express this relationship as: 10^(5-y) = 100 We know that 100 is 10^2, so we can rewrite the equation as: 10^(5-y) = 10^2 Now, since the bases are the same (10), we can set the exponents equal to each other: 5 - y = 2 Solving for y, we get: y = 5 - 2 y = 3 Therefore, the reading that corresponds to the frequency 100 times smaller than the frequency corresponding to a reading of 5 is boxed{3}  on the Richter scale."},{"instruction":"A student tries to find the fifth term in the expansion of (frac{b}{x}x^2b)^7 when simplified.
