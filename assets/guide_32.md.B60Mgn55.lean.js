Peter Souleo Wright organized \\"The Button Show\\" at Rush Arts Gallery in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Eleven artists used the small, ordinary objects to create sculptures, portraits and wearable art. Some of the works are political, some are personal and others are just fun. Wright said each artist reimagines and repurposes the buttons to make art. \\"What I tried to do with this show,\\" he said , \\"was to look at artists who were promoting that level of craft.\\" He said he wanted the button art to be comparable to a painting \\"because of the amount of detail and precision in the work\\". Artist Beau McCall produced \\"A Harlem Hangover\\". It looks like a wine bottle that fell over on a table. A stream of connected red buttons hang over the side, like wine flowing down. Similar red buttons form a small pool on the floor. McCall layers buttons of different shapes and sizes to create the bottle. The stitching that holds them together is also part of the artistic design. For San Francisco-based artist Lisa Kokin, buttons are highly personal. After her father died in 2001, she created a portrait of him using only buttons. That memorial to her father led to other button portraits, including those of activists Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez. Others use buttons for details. Artist Amalia Amaki of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, placed them on and around old photographs. Los Angeles artist Camilla Taylor attached buttons to three large sculptures that look like headless animals with long , narrow legs. \\"The Button Show\\" ends at March 12. The Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation paid for the exhibition. The foundation was created in 1995 by the Simmons brothers: artist Danny, hip-hop producer Russell and rapper Rev. Run.

She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \\"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\\" a swimming official told her team, \\"or you will be disqualified.\\" Everybody on her team started screaming, \\"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!\\" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. \\"You have to put the sock on,\\" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock. By now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory. On the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again. She told me that if the T-shirt relay was an Olympic event, her team would win the gold medal. I told her that in my professional opinion, she was absolutely right.

At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest.

This solution seems to contradict the objective of the first sentence by potentially reducing competition and supporting the expansion of larger airlines. In conclusion, if the first sentence is assumed to be true, the second sentence is not true, as the two sentences describe different solutions targeting different entities within the airline industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Some people in Manchester, Britain, will soon be paying for goods and services with so-called \\"smart\\" credit cards. These cards are more secure than the traditional magnetic-strip version and can be used to travel on buses, check bank accounts and do shopping. The Manchester project is one of the biggest smart card schemes in the world. Every time people use the cards on a bus or train, the fare is deducted (reduced) from the value of the card. When they have no credit left, the cards can be recharged at a local shop. A smart card looks just like a normal plastic card but it has a silicon chip in it. It is possible for the same silicon chip to perform a number of different functions, so one plastic card in your pocket could do a large number of different jobs. The card has much more memory space than a magnetic-strip card, so many more things can be recorded on it.There are two types of smart cards. One is the contact card which is used in the same way as a magnetic-strip card. Information is transferred by running the card through a narrow opening in an electronic reader. In the slot, electronic probes make contact with the magnetic-strip or silicon ship and read the information. The other type is the contactless smart card where the electronic reader communicates with the card by short-range radio waves. This makes the card quicker and more convenient to use because it does not have to leave your wallet.  It is also more reliable as it is not easily influenced by scratches or dirt. However, the biggest advantage that smart cards have over magnetic-strip cards is that they are more secure. They are much more difficult to make than conventional cards and they have to be made by specially trained manufacturers. In addition, they have a large number of extra security features on them and if a smart card gets lost or stolen a quick phone-call to the distributor ensures that its individual number is made invalid and unreadable. This can be done more quickly than with a magnetic-strip card. Question: \\" The cards can be recharged\\" means that   _   . Options: A: the card can be put into a new charge of electricity B: the cards can be changed into new ones C: the cards can be put to use again D: the cards can be recycled Answer:","output":"C: the cards can be put to use again"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let it simmer for 30 minutes in enough water to cover the strips. Strain the juice through a colander and store it in another pot. Let it cool. Explain that the red cabbage juice is called an “indicator.” This means that it will help you figure out if a substance is an acid or a base. Take some of the juice and pour it into several clear cups. Put the rest to the side for now.  It doesn't matter how much you pour in each cup. A few ounces will be fine, and should leave you enough experiment with several substances. Use as many cups as you have substances to test. For instance, if you want to test milk, tomato juice, and soy sauce, use three cups. Take a spoonful of baking soda and pour it into one of the glasses. Have a kid stir until the soda begins to dissolve. The solution will turn from red to blue or purplish. Explain the indicator solution changes this color because baking soda is a base. Take some ordinary white vinegar and pour it into the same glass as the baking soda. Ask a kid to stir the solution. It will turn red again before your eyes! Explain this is because the acidic vinegar changes the pH of the solution by neutralizing the base (baking soda). Practice stirring different substances into cups of the solution. Drinks like cola, lemon juice, or milk work well. Before you try each substance, ask the kids if they think the solution will turn bluish (meaning it’s a base) or a deeper red (meaning it’s an acid). To help the kids decide, ask them to think about whether or not the substance tastes sour (acid) or bitter (base). Summary:","output":"This article provides a detailed explanation of an experiment that can be conducted to help understand acids and bases using red cabbage juice as an indicator. The author begins by guiding the reader through the process of making red cabbage juice indicator from a head of red cabbage, as the juice changes color when mixed with substances depending on their acidity or basicity.  The experiment involves pouring the cabbage juice into several clear cups to test various substances like milk, tomato juice, soy sauce, baking soda, and ordinary white vinegar, depending on the number of substances one wishes to test. The author demonstrates the experiment using baking soda, which when mixed with the red cabbage juice, turns from red to blue or purplish, indicating that baking soda is a base. By adding white vinegar to the same glass and stirring, the solution turns red again, signifying that the acidic vinegar has neutralized the base (baking soda).  The experiment can be extended to other substances like cola, lemon juice, or milk. Before adding each substance, children can be asked to guess if the solution will turn bluish (for a base) or deeper red (for an acid), based on whether the substance tastes sour (acid) or bitter (base). This activity serves as an interactive and educational way of teaching children about acids and bases using simple, everyday items."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Outlaw country is a subgenre of American country music, most popular during the 1970s and early-1980s, sometimes referred to as the outlaw movement or simply outlaw music. The music has its roots in earlier subgenres like honky tonk and rockabilly and is characterized by a blend of rock and folk rhythms, country instrumentation and introspective lyrics. The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and popular structures of the Nashville sound developed by record producers like Chet Atkins.  - The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music, replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with \\"smooth strings and choruses\\", \\"sophisticated background vocals\\" and \\"smooth tempos\\". It was an attempt \\"to revive country sales, which had been devastated by the rise of rock 'n' roll.\\"  - Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album \\"Shotgun Willie\\" (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" (1975) and \\"Stardust\\" (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana.  - Shotgun Willie is a 1973 album by Willie Nelson. The recording marks a change of style for Nelson, who later stated that the album \\"cleared his throat\\". When Nelson refused to sign an early extension of his contract with RCA in 1972, the label decided not to release any further recordings. Nelson hired Neil Reshen as his manager, and while Reshen negotiated with RCA, Nelson moved to Austin, Texas, where the ongoing hippie music scene at the Armadillo World Headquarters renewed his musical style. In Nashville, Nelson met producer Jerry Wexler, vice president of Atlantic Records, who was interested in his music. Reshen solved the problems with RCA and signed Nelson with Atlantic Records as their first country music artist.  - Red Headed Stranger is a 1975 album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson. After the wide success of his recordings with Atlantic Records, coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager, Neil Reshen, Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records, a label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the \\"Tale of the Red Headed Stranger\\", a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo. However, Nelson had creative control, so no further production was added.  - Island in the Sea is a 1987 album by country singer Willie Nelson . Its title track was a minor hit . The album also includes the song \`\` Nobody There But Me '' , featuring Bruce Hornsby and the Range , released as the second single .    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'record label' with 'columbia records'.

Added a comma after \\"me\\" – This is done to set off the parenthetical expression \\"since I am in San Francisco\\" and to indicate a brief pause in the sentence. A parenthetical expression provides additional information in a sentence but is not essential to the meaning of the sentence. Commas are used to separate these expressions from the rest of the sentence. 2. Added a comma after \\"Francisco\\" – This comma is used to separate the parenthetical expression \\"since I am in San Francisco\\" from the main part of the sentence. Just like the first comma, this one indicates a brief pause and sets off the expression. 3. Capitalized the \\"t\\" in \\"The\\" – This corrects a minor capitalization error.

The novel tells the story of German professor Otto Lidenbrock, who discovers an ancient manuscript containing a coded message from Icelandic alchemist Arne Saknussemm. The message indicates the existence of a passageway leading to the center of the Earth through a volcanic crater in Iceland. Intrigued and excited by this prospect, Lidenbrock, along with his nephew Axel and their Icelandic guide Hans Belker, embark on a thrilling and perilous expedition through the hidden depths of the planet. Throughout their journey, the explorers encounter multiple challenges and wondrous sights, including prehistoric creatures, enormous caverns filled with glowing minerals, and several palpable dangers lurking in the darkness. The novel's riveting storytelling, coupled with Verne's impressive ability to blend scientific facts and imaginative elements, has made Journey to the Center of the Earth a classic that continues to captivate readers' interests across generations.

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue - Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the process is: Inhalation or breathing in. During this step, a person inhales air through the mouth or nose, and it enters the respiratory system. This is the crucial starting point that sets off the entire chain of events required to deliver oxygen to the body's tissues and cells. Here is the complete process, including the missing step: 1. Inhalation or breathing in: Air is drawn into the mouth or nose, initiating the respiratory process. 2. Air is transported to the lungs: The inhaled air passes through the trachea and bronchi, reaching the lungs. 3. Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs: The air continues to move through the finer branches of the bronchi, called bronchioles, and finally reaches the tiny alveoli. 4. In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries: The walls of the alveoli are extremely thin, allowing oxygen to diffuse across them and enter the bloodstream. 5. The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood: This facilitates the transfer of oxygen from the alveoli to the bloodstream. 6. The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells: Hemoglobin in red blood cells binds to the oxygen molecules. 7. The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme: This is a crucial part of the transport process. 8. Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach various tissues: Oxygenated blood is pumped by the heart and travels through the circulatory system. 9. Within small capillaries, the heme releases the oxygen: This delivers it to the surrounding tissues. 10. The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue: This enables cells to use this vital element for energy production and other essential cellular processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. HuffPost Illustration/Reuters Alex Jones may soon learn that maligning the parents of dead children comes with serious consequences.      Alex Jones has spent years claiming the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School ― where a shooter killed 20 small children and six adults ― was faked. He has claimed the parents of these dead children are liars and “crisis actors.”      Now, those parents are coming after him.      In a pair of lawsuits filed late Monday, the parents of two children who died in the December 2012 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, say Jones’ repeated lies and conspiratorial ravings have led to death threats. The suits join at least two other recent cases accusing the Infowars host of defamation.      I lost my son. I buried my son. I held my son with a bullet hole through his head. Neil Heslin, father of a 6-year-old boy killed during the Sandy Hook shooting.      Neil Heslin, the father of a 6-year-old boy killed in the shooting, and Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, who lost their own little boy, filed the suits in Austin, Texas, where Jones’ conspiracy-minded media outlet is based. Each suit is seeking more than 1 million in damages from Jones, Infowars and a related company, Free Speech Systems LLC. Infowars reporter Owen Shroyer is also named in one of the suits.      “Even after these folks had to experience this trauma, for the next five years they were tormented by Alex Jones with vicious lies about them,” Mark Bankston, the lawyer handling the cases for the parents, told HuffPost. “And these lies were meant to convince his audience that the Sandy Hook parents are frauds and have perpetrated a sinister lie on the American people.”      Bankston, of the Houston law firm Farrar & Ball, is also involved in another defamation suit against Jones, representing a man whom Infowars incorrectly identified as the Parkland, Florida, school shooter.      Infowars, Jones and Shroyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.      Heslin’s suit focuses on what it calls a “heartless and vile” claim of Shroyer’s: that the father lied in an interview with NBC News’ Megyn Kelly about holding his dead son’s body.      “I lost my son. I buried my son. I held my son with a bullet hole through his head,” Heslin told Kelly in the June 2017 segment profiling Jones.      Alex Wong via Getty Images Neil Heslin testifies during a Senate hearing on assault weapons in February 2013.      Days after the segment aired, Shroyer told Infowars viewers that Heslin could not have held his son because victims were identified through photographs, not in person.      “That’s not something you would just misspeak on,” Shroyer said during the June 26, 2017, broadcast, which Jones himself plugged a month later.      But that claim is “manifestly false,” Heslin’s suit says: The children’s bodies were eventually turned over to their parents for their funerals.      In the other suit filed Tuesday, Pozner and De La Rosa ― whose son was the youngest victim in the shooting ― are also targeting Jones for calling them liars.      During an April 2017 broadcast on Infowars, Jones discussed an interview De La Rosa gave to CNN’s Anderson Cooper shortly after the tragedy, and claimed the entire thing was faked.      “So here are these holier than thou people, when we question CNN, who is supposedly at the site of Sandy Hook, and they got in one shot leaves blowing, and the flowers that are around it, and you see the leaves blowing, and they go [gestures]. They glitch,” Jones said, according to a transcript quoted in the lawsuit. “They’re recycling a green-screen behind them.”      Anyone ... who spends 15 minutes talking to one of these parents will understand immediately how vile this lie was. Mark Bankston, lawyer for the Sandy Hook parents suing Jones.      This was a lie Jones has been repeating for years.      “Folks, we’ve got video of Anderson Cooper with clear blue-screen out there,” Jones said in 2014. “He’s not there in the town square. We got people clearly coming up and laughing and then doing the fake crying. We’ve clearly got people where it’s actors playing different parts for different people, the building bulldozed, covering up everything.”      It’s been five years since the shooting, the lawsuit says, and “Mr. Jones continues to push this sick lie about Mrs. De La Rosa and her interview.”      Infowars’ practice of disseminating outright lies has led to serious consequences for the families of the Sandy Hook victims, the lawsuit says. In June 2017, Florida woman Lucy Richards, then 57, was sentenced to five months in prison for sending threats to Pozner.      “You gonna die,” Richards told Pozner in one recorded voicemail message. “Death is coming to you real soon.”      As part of her sentence, Richards will no longer be allowed to access Infowars, according to the lawsuit.      As of Tuesday morning, Infowars still had blatantly false stories posted on its website claiming the mass shooting was a hoax. “FBI SAYS NO ONE KILLED AT SANDY HOOK,” screams one headline.      Mike Segar / Reuters A memorial for the Sandy Hook victims, shown days after the December 2012 shooting.      Bankston told HuffPost he has never before seen cases involving the kind of “mental anguish” these parents are experiencing.      “I think as a father, it’s a very surreal experience,” Bankston said. “Anyone, parents or not, who spends 15 minutes talking to one of these parents will understand immediately how vile this lie was, and how genuine their pain is.”      The defamation lawsuits could have devastating consequences for Jones and Infowars, especially because these are not the only ones against him. In March, the man who recorded the deadly car attack at last year’s white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, sued Jones for calling him a “deep state shill” and a “CIA asset” who helped organize the attack ― he’s not, and he didn’t.      And then there’s the lawsuit Bankston filed earlier this month. He’s suing on behalf of the 24-year-old man whom Infowars falsely identified as the gunman who killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February.      For the Sandy Hook parents, they just want the lies to stop. Even when Jones made an assurance he’d stop talking about it, that too was a lie. During a November 2016 broadcast, Jones said that if “children were lost at Sandy Hook, my heart goes out to each and every one of those parents.”      But he didn’t stop there: “The only problem is, I’ve watched a lot of soap operas, and I’ve seen actors before. And I know when I’m watching a movie and when I’m watching something real.”      The broadcast was titled “Alex Jones Final Statement on Sandy Hook.” ||||| Three parents whose children were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 filed a defamation lawsuit on Tuesday against Alex Jones, the right-wing conspiracy theorist who has long claimed the shooting was “completely fake” and a “giant hoax” perpetrated by opponents of the Second Amendment.      Mr. Jones, the popular radio show host who also operates the conspiracy theory website Infowars, has questioned for years whether 20 children and six adults died in the school massacre in Newtown, Conn. To bolster his false claims, he often cites news reports and video clips from the hours after the shooting that turned out to be incomplete or based on wrong information.      Soon after they buried their children, many Sandy Hook parents started to come under fierce attack by conspiracy theorists who have said they are actors in an elaborate scheme to enact stricter gun control laws. The fringe theories still thrive in small forums online but have reached a far greater audience through Mr. Jones, the most vocal propagator.      The two lawsuits filed on Tuesday represent the first civil action taken by parents accusing Mr. Jones of defamation. One was filed by Leonard Pozner and his former wife, Veronique De La Rosa, and the other was filed by Neil Heslin. Their sons, Noah Pozner and Jesse Heslin, both 6, were killed at Sandy Hook. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist who claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was fake, is being sued by the parents of two children who died in the tragedy.

Article: The low sitting bridge will divide the long vertical line of your nose more evenly, so the bottom portion of your nose--the portion that the eye naturally catches--will seem smaller. A wide bridge creates a stronger, more visible divide.  Larger frames are generally a better option than smaller ones. The large frames can compete with the size of your nose and help balance it out, but smaller frames can draw more attention to the size of your nose. The other option is to go for contacts. Since glasses sit at the top of your nose, they do draw some attention to that area of your face. Getting contacts avoids this issue completely. Your ears and nose share the same horizontal space on your face. Short, dainty earrings can draw attention to this horizontal space, which could also draw attention to your nose. Larger earrings that extend below the ear enlarge the sides of this horizontal space, making the nose at the center of this space appear smaller by comparison.  If you do not want to wear long earrings, at least choose short earrings that cover the earlobes completely. This will draw more attention to the sides of this horizontal space, which can help draw attention off your nose. Rounded earrings that occupy both horizontal and vertical space are better than earrings that only add a vertical dimension. Earrings that emphasize straight, vertical lines will also emphasize the straight, vertical line of the nose. Both men and women should look for hat styles that have a rounded or down-turned brim at the front of the face. A brim that hangs down over the front of the face can visually build out the forehead. As a result, the nose appears shorter and more proportionate.  Avoid \\"tricorne\\" styles, which meet at a point above the forehead. Hats that have a larger brim in the front than in the back may build out the forehead better than those with an even brim all around. Make sure that the crown does not pinch in too tightly toward the front of the face. Ideally, this crown should also be of medium height to maintain better visual balance, and it should not taper in much toward the top. Consider choosing a hat with a wide, colorful band above the brim. This band can draw the eye up and away from the nose. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides tips and suggestions on how to visually minimize the prominence of a larger nose using various accessories.

A 'lorry load' of evidence relating to an investigation into alleged police corruption over the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry was systematically shredded over two days, it was reported today. THE mass shredding of files from a major Scotland Yard corruption inquiry was yesterday branded ‘an out and out disgrace’ by a murder victim’s brother. Alastair Morgan, whose private eye brother Daniel was killed by an axeman in a plot allegedly involving police officers, hit out following reports that a ‘lorry load’ of documents from a top-secret corruption probe had been destroyed over two days. The latest revelations deepened the Metropolitan Police ‘shredding scandal’ and prompted new claims of a cover-up at the force. The large-scale destruction of corruption files was a key finding of a review of the Stephen Lawrence case, published earlier this month, which suggested possible links between an allegedly corrupt officer involved in the Lawrence case – former Detective Sergeant John Davidson – and the investigation into the Morgan murder. Married father-of-two Daniel Morgan, 37, was found with an axe in his head in a south-east London pub car park in 1987. His murder remains unsolved, despite five investigations. An independent judge-led panel of experts is now reviewing the police handling of the murder, amid claims corrupt officers prevented convictions. Mr Morgan’s family say he was on the verge of exposing police corruption when he was killed. His brother Alastair added: ‘We need a supervised outside investigation into the shredding of the Met’s corruption files. 'This is not a mistake.’ Inquiry: The Bishop of Stepney, Sir William MacPherson, Tom Cook and Dr. Richard Stone - at the preliminary hearing of the Stephen Lawrence public inquiry in 1997. Following publication earlier this. month of the review by Mark Ellison QC, it is now feared corrupt. officers who thwarted justice in the Morgan case could also have. shielded those who murdered Stephen in a racist attack in Eltham,. south-east London, in 1993. Buried. in the review is a reference to a police intelligence report, dated. April 28, 2004, concerning Operation Abelard, the investigation into. Daniel Morgan’s murder. The report had ‘specific emphasis’ on Davidson, and stated that he was attached to the initial Morgan investigation in 1987. It. said: ‘DS Davidson has been investigated by this command. (Anti-Corruption Command) in the past and is known to associate with. some of the subjects of not only Operation Abelard but also several. other Directorate of Professional Standards investigations.’ Mr. Ellison’s report found evidence to suspect that Davidson had acted. corruptly in the Lawrence case, and that material had been withheld from. the subsequent 1998 Macpherson Inquiry into the police’s handling of. the black teenager’s murder. The. material that was shredded in 2003 was from a wider, top-secret. investigation into possible police corruption that began in 1993 and. came to be known as Operation Othona. The. Ellison report said it needed to see the Othona files to investigate. possible links with the Lawrence case, and to establish what was known. about police corruption at the time of the Macpherson Inquiry. The latest revelations deepened the Scotland Yard's ¿shredding scandal¿ and prompted new claims of a cover-up at the force. It. is alleged that when Stephen was murdered, Davidson was having a. corrupt relationship with Clifford Norris, the gangster father of one of. his killers, David Norris. The ex-detective denies this. Some. computer files relating to the Othona operation were found on a hard. drive in a cardboard box in the Met Police’s professional standards. department in November 2013. But. paper copies of the intelligence were missing. The Ellison review was. told there had been a ‘mass shredding’ of them in 2003. One source told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there had been a ‘lorry load’ of documents, photographs and videos. In. a message on Twitter yesterday, Alastair Morgan made clear he does not. accept an innocent explanation for the mass shredding. He. told senior officers: ‘Don’t take the public for fools gentlemen. The. shredding of the Othona files is an out and out disgrace.’ Yesterday. Davidson, 65, said: ‘I am not corrupt. I would like to speak but I. can’t basically. I am paying a lot of money to my solicitor and he’s. told me to talk to nobody. That includes the Press.’ Scotland. Yard said: ‘The Met was informed by a former employee on February 4,. 2014 that in 2003, two staff were tasked to shred a quantity of. documents that related to corruption inquiries. The information supplied by the witness was scant but the Met felt it necessary to pass it on to Mr Ellison’s review. ‘Met. officers now intend to meet the witness to clarify their account. At. this time the Met has little detail on the circumstances that led to the. shredding.’ Highlights:","output":"1.

Write a title for this article: Washington (CNN) -- For Joe Biden, an evenly divided Senate would be a BFD. If Tuesday's midterm elections result in a Senate split, the vice president will suddenly find himself in one of his favorite places: the spotlight. Biden would become a crucial player in the Senate, providing the tie-breaking vote on key bills and keeping the chamber in Democratic hands for the twilight years of President Barack Obama's administration. For a politician who spent 36 years in the Senate and has run into trouble conforming to the constraints of being Obama's No. 2, a divide could be a welcome twist to a career that has often confounded expectations. \\"Clearly, he is a creature of the Senate,\\" said Ted Kaufman, Biden's former chief of staff who filled in as Delaware senator when his boss became vice president. \\"I can't think of a better person to be in that position. I know he would relish it.\\" It's rare for an election to result in an even split in the 100-seat Senate, turning control over to the vice president's party. The last time that happened was after the 2000 election, when Dick Cheney's role as a tiebreaker solidified a GOP majority. That only continued for a few months before a moderate Republican switched parties and gave Democrats full control of the Senate. READ: Six times Biden aimed for the truth and caused a headache This year, the GOP needs to post a net gain of six seats to control the chamber and Republicans appear to be on track to do that. But their efforts are being muddied by the enduring strength of Democratic candidates in Kentucky and Georgia, who are within striking distance of claiming Republican seats -- raising the potential of a split Senate. And even if one party wins a slim majority, Biden could find himself on standby for much of the next two years. Deaths or absences among members -- and the possibility that several independents could switch parties and scramble the Senate's partisan math -- will raise the odds that Biden may be called upon. Biden's role would mostly be limited to casting tie-breaking votes -- not delving into the nitty gritty of legislating. And, of course, tie-breaking votes might be rare in a Senate where most bills now require 60 votes to proceed. But any additional time in the Senate would play to Biden's strengths. Few men in history have adored the clubby chamber as much as Biden and he relishes opportunities to cut deals. \\"The United States Senate has been my life — and that is not hyperbole,\\" Biden said in his farewell address, summing up a career of melodramatic confirmation hearings, personal tragedy, health scares and failed presidential campaigns. \\"It literally has been my life.\\" Given his affinity for the Senate, it must gall Biden that he is among only 12 of 47 vice presidents not to have cast one of the 244 tie breaking votes, according to Senate historians. Still, as vice president, he has played a crucial role in getting the administration and Senate Republicans out of jams, orchestrating agreements to raise the debt ceiling and avert the fiscal cliff. An expanded role in the Senate could also come in handy for Biden if he decides to launch a long-shot bid for the White House in 2016. Of course, there are potential downsides. If he decides to run for president, he could be forced to take uncomfortable votes that wouldn't play well on the campaign trail. And a larger gig in the Senate could only provide another venue for his legendary slip-ups, which provide endless fodder for the media and plenty of headaches for the White House. He has been on a roll lately — recently apologizing to key Middle Eastern allies for blaming them for the rise of ISIS. READ: Biden apologizes to Turkey, UAE In October, Biden quipped that the vice presidency was a \\"b—ch of a job, weeks after angering Jewish groups by using the term \\"Shylocks\\" and calling Asia the \\"Orient.\\" Once, in Delaware, he joked you couldn't go to a 7-Eleven unless you had a \\"slight Indian accent.\\" In a private meeting with black clergy in South Carolina, Biden referred to himself as \\"the only white boy on the east side of Wilmington\\" as he recalled his days as a Delaware public defender. Touring global hot spots on Air Force Two, Biden sometimes baffles foreign leaders with his break-the-ice line : \\"if I had hair like yours I'd be president by now.\\" He chatted up grandmas at a Senate swearing in ceremony and told Heidi Heitkamp's family to \\"spread your legs, you're gonna be frisked.\\" And in his most famous faux pas, Biden was caught at the White House on a hot mic telling Obama that passing health care reform was a \\"big f——g deal. Biden's tongue has sometimes irked the West Wing. In 2012, for instance, he trashed Obama's plans to roll out his backing for gay marriage by committing the cardinal vice presidential sin on \\"Meet the Press\\" of getting ahead of the boss. But White House insiders say Obama values Biden's loyalty and owes him one for steadying the re-election campaign after his own first disastrous debate with Mitt Romney. Vice presidential scholar Joel Goldstein said Biden's influence can be measured in how often Obama reaches into his inner circle for staffers, notably Tom Donilon, Jay Carney and new Ebola czar Ron Klain. \\"On the one hand, people have this perception of him as an undisciplined guy because he says things that are viewed as gaffes. But on the other hand to have functioned in the way that he has shows a tremendous amount of discipline.\\" Biden has been in on every big national security decision, masterminded the withdrawal from Iraq, been a skeptic on military force, managed stimulus spending and gets hours of face time with the president. He has grabbed important national security portfolios including China and mentoring Ukraine's new government. But former secretary of defense Robert Gates wrote that though it was impossible not to like Biden, he had been \\"wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.\\" Despite his outsized persona, Biden would likely be welcomed back to the Senate warmly even with his eccentricities, according to veteran journalist Jules Witcover, who wrote the vice president's biography. Some members \\"thought he talked too much and put his foot in his mouth\\" and some Republicans view him as \\"a bit of a loose cannon.\\" Title:","output":"\\"Joe Biden's Potential Rise to Senate Power: A Welcome Twist for a Career of Unpredictability\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When making whipped cream, it is recommended to chill your whisk and your mixing bowl so the cream doesn't melt. Justification: Whipped cream is made by incorporating air into cream with a fat content of at least 30%. Chilling the cream helps keep the fat solid which in turn helps keep the air bubbles intact. Thus, the colder the tools and cream are, the better they'll produce firm, longer-lasting whipped cream. Here is how you can prepare your tools for making whipped cream:  1. Choose a large mixing bowl and a whisk. 2. To chill the bowl and the whisk: Place them in the refrigerator (not the freezer) for at least 20-30 minutes before you plan to make the whipped cream. 3. Ensure the cream is also chilled because as mentioned before, cold cream whips up better. 4. After chilling, you can remove the tools from the fridge when you're ready to make the whipped cream. On the other hand, warming up your whisk and mixing bowl (option b) is not recommended because it can cause the cream to get too warm, which could prevent the fat from trapping the air bubbles effectively, leading to a less voluminous and less stable whipped cream."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Morse, elevated to fame and fortune by his invention of the telegraph, styled himself “an American who knows no North nor South nor East nor West, but who feels that everyone within the United States is his fellow countryman.” Lean, restless and pulsating with energy, the “Lightning Man” cherished the Union. Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded. Yet the acute phase of North-South sectionalism coincided with the arrival of the telegraph, which rocketed information ahead at speeds that seemed miraculous. Was this merely a coincidence? Or could the telegraph somehow have made Americans more distrustful of one another, and placed the country on the high road toward civil war? War between the United States and Mexico created the angry irritant that ultimately tore the Union apart — the question of slavery in the territories. An enormous region was about to come under America control — all of today’s California, Nevada and Utah, most of Arizona, plus parts of three other future states. Free soil advocates demanded that any lands seized from Mexico be declared off limits to slavery. But many white Southerners insisted they should have the right to take slaves wherever they pleased. In 1846 and 1847, as fighting took place in Mexico, a war of words raged in Washington — and it did not cease when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended military hostilities in early 1848. Although the climate of the newly acquired southwest was too arid for plantation slavery, nothing could still the contest between those who would prohibit it there and those who would protect it. One observer noted astutely that the two factions each wielded one side of “a pair of shears, neither of which could cut until joined together.” But with each side pulling its blade, the shears threatened to sever the Union. Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in November 1860 ultimately brought matters to a head. He and the Republican Party were pledged to prevent slavery’s further expansion. And many white Southerners considered that an intolerable affront. Notwithstanding his New England origins, Morse was well-disposed toward white Southerners. In his earlier career as a painter, he had traveled South to do commissioned portraits. He found no fault there. He regarded slavery as a benefit to everyone involved — it allowed “a weak and degraded race” to labor productively, protected and guided by Christian masters. And he held abolitionists in particular contempt — “a more wretched, disgusting, hypocritical crew, have not appeared on the face of the earth since the times of Robespierre.” Morse’s telegraph, first successfully demonstrated in May 1844, became a booming business during the next four years. By the summer of 1846, just as American forces headed south into Mexico, the poles and wires were in place to inaugurate the first telegraphic connection between New York and Washington. Almost immediately afterwards, the line between New York and Boston opened. By September, New York was linked to Buffalo and soon to points west. Work then began on a Southern line from Washington to New Orleans, via Richmond, Charleston and Mobile. By 1848, when the Mexican War concluded, the telegraph linked North and South more closely than ever before. Telegraphy transformed journalism. Newspaper publishers quickly grasped the new technology’s potential. The magical words “By Magnetic Telegraph” alerted readers to events that had just taken place hundreds of miles away. Steam-powered rotary presses — another new invention — enabled publishers to rapidly print newspapers in great quantities, and with far lower per unit costs. So mid-century Americans bought and read more newspapers than any other people on the face of the earth. The telegraph and newspapers combined to exert a uniquely powerful influence on American culture. No other part of the world was so affected. By 1860, there were 50,000 miles of telegraph in the United States, all built during the previous 16 years. Some 3,725 American newspapers were published daily or weekly. Fewer than 200 million newspaper copies were printed in 1840, but almost 900 million in 1860. New York City became the nerve center of American journalism — led by the New York Herald, the New York Tribune and the New York Times, founded in 1851. Even in many small and medium-sized localities, rival newspapers, each typically with a strongly partisan orientation, took hold. These startling advances in communications were closely tied to huge improvements in overland transport. Railroads — yet another new technology — vaulted forward in the late 1840s and 1850s. Railroad mileage jumped from fewer than 3,000 miles in 1840, mostly in the East, to over 36,000 miles that stretched West and South by 1860, across all settled parts of the Union. Bigger, faster, more powerful trains sped both passengers and freight to their destinations. The telegraph proved to be an essential mechanism for coordinating these far-flung operations. “Antebellum futurologists” expected that improved communications and transport would knit the Union together. They anticipated that Americans would become “more and more one people, thinking and acting alike,” writes Samuel F. B. Morse’s biographer, Kenneth Silverman. Prominent among the optimists was Morse himself. His famous motto — “What hath God wrought!” — fused personal success with national greatness. Instead, of course, national unity unraveled as antagonistic North-South stereotypes hardened during the 1850s. The dominant modern narrative of mid-19th century American history suggests that North and South began to see each other more clearly — and that each discovered how genuinely different the other had become. While a fast-changing North embraced progress and improvement, the South remained wedded to an archaic, retrogressive labor system. Under the circumstances, Northern and Southern outlooks and values necessarily diverged. There are powerful reasons why this image of a modern North and a static South is attractive — it so neatly seems to explain the bloodbath that soon followed. It says that two incompatible regions could not peacefully remain together. And the stereotypes at first glance make sense — nobody could mistake Massachusetts for Mississippi. Explore multimedia from the series and navigate through past posts, as well as photos and articles from the Times archive. But there were other reasons why each section viewed its counterpart in such a harsh light. Partisan managers during the 1850s had motive to play up North-South differences. Republicans warned that a “slave power conspiracy” stood poised to rob free white Northerners of access to the fertile West, while Southern Democrats depicted Republicans as dangerous radicals whose success would lead to a violent abolitionist invasion of the slave states. As Elizabeth Varon recently wrote here, North-South acrimony also included deliberately offensive gendered insults — its Northern critics saw a white South filled with lustful sadists, whereas some Southerners satirized Northern men as effeminate weaklings. By any reasonable standard, all of these images were overblown. And they especially distorted the border regions — the Upper South and the Lower North. Southern Illinois and Indiana actually had much in common with Kentucky and Missouri. And few whites living in the Upper South wanted their states to become more like the Deep South. New communications technologies must have played a key role in transforming exaggerated stereotypes into compelling realities, and persuading Northerners and Southerners that they were more different from each other than they actually were. “It was surely no accident,” Edward L. Ayers has written, “that a long-brewing sectional animosity boiled over when railroads, telegraphs, and newspapers proliferated in the 1840s and 1850s.” Both North and South, “rival editors wrenched the most inflammatory words out of context, underlining their danger, amplifying their threat.” The “frantic rush in every direction” that accompanied new railroads sharpened anxieties about the future of the territories. Even though North and South “shared a great deal,” part of what they shared was popular politics and a print media that depicted the opposite section in sinister terms. The possibility just sketched here — that his brainchild may somehow have fueled the fire — is one that Samuel F. B. Morse could not have accepted. Horrified by the course of events in early 1861 as the Union fractured and war threatened, he and some friends organized an “American Society for Promoting National Unity.” But it was too little and too late. The “Lightning Man” may have unleashed forces that neither he nor anyone else could control. Follow Disunion at twitter.com/NYTcivilwar or join us on Facebook.

And tonight , he only let me sing \\" Hi Lili \\" once before asking for \\" bed . \\" That 's the second time he 's cut short lullaby time to go to bed . Why did he cut the lullaby short ? Pick your answer from:  + None of the above choices .  + He was tired and wanted to go to bed .  + He wanted peace and quiet .  + He disliked the narrator 's singing .","output":"Based on the context provided in the text, it appears that the most likely reason the child cut the lullaby short is because he was tired and wanted to go to bed.  In the given passage, the narrator shares an anecdote about a child who enjoys listening to songs with echoed words, such as in the Bob Marley classic \\"Three Little Birds.\\" It is mentioned that the child finds this repetition endearing. However, on this particular night, the child only allows the narrator to sing the lullaby \\"Hi Lili\\" once before requesting to go to bed. This behavior of cutting lullaby time short is noted to have occurred for the second time. Given the available answer choices, the most plausible explanation for why the child cut short lullaby time is that he was tired and wanted to go to bed. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the child specifically asks to go to bed, suggesting that he is ready to sleep rather than desiring peace and quiet or disliking the narrator's singing. Additionally, the child is depicted as being fond of songs with echoed words, which intimates a generally appreciative attitude toward music rather than a distaste for the narrator's vocal performance. In summary, the most likely reason the child cut the lullaby short is that he was tired and wanted to go to bed, as he specifically asked for it and had previously shown an affinity for songs with echoed words. This interpretation aligns with the text's details and the child's demonstrated preferences, ruling out the other answer choices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer based on context: In April 1758, the British concluded the Anglo-Prussian Convention with Frederick in which they committed to pay him an annual subsidy of £670,000. Britain also dispatched 9,000 troops to reinforce Ferdinand's Hanoverian army, the first British troop commitment on the continent and a reversal in the policy of Pitt. Ferdinand had succeeded in driving the French from Hanover and Westphalia and re-captured the port of Emden in March 1758 before crossing the Rhine with his own forces,  which caused alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand's victory over the French at the Battle of Krefeld and the brief occupation of Düsseldorf, he was compelled by the successful manoeuvering of larger French forces to withdraw across the Rhine. By this point Frederick was increasingly concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. Just east of the Oder in Brandenburg-Neumark, at the Battle of Zorndorf , a Prussian army of 35,000 men under Frederick on 25 August 1758, fought a Russian army of 43,000 commanded by Count William Fermor. Both sides suffered heavy casualties - the Prussians 12,800, the Russians 18,000 - but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory. The American historian Daniel Marston described Zorndorf as a \\"draw\\" as both sides were too exhausted and had taken such losses that neither wished to fight another battle with the other. In the undecided Battle of Tornow on 25 September, a Swedish army repulsed six assaults by a Prussian army but did not push on Berlin following the Battle of Fehrbellin. How many total casualties did were there at the Battle of Zorndorf?","output":"At the Battle of Zorndorf, there were a total of 30,800 casualties. The Prussian army, under the command of Frederick, suffered 12,800 casualties, while the opposing Russian army, commanded by Count William Fermor, suffered 18,000 casualties. Both sides experienced heavy losses, leading the American historian Daniel Marston to describe the battle as a \\"draw\\" due to the exhausted state of both armies and their reluctance to engage in another battle with each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.  Paragraph: Thorn county used fossil fuels for their energy needs, while Plant county used nuclear power. They both polluted the environment in different ways.

Please remove spaces between words.","output":"January2,1976,was theopening oftheinvestigationoftheSanctityoftheVirtues. The opening of the investigation of the Sanctity of the Virtues on January 2, 1976, marked an important milestone in the course of the Catholic Church's recognition of individuals who displayed exemplary lives of holiness and dedication to their faith. The process of recognizing a person as a saint is a thorough and meticulous one, and it involves several stages. The Sanctity of the Virtues investigation is the initial part of the canonization process, examining whether the candidate in question had practiced the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity in a heroic manner, as well as the cardinal virtues of prudence, justice, temperance, and fortitude. In a broader sense, the virtues refer to the positive moral qualities that guide an individual's actions and decisions. The careful analysis of these virtues in a person's life is necessary because it helps ascertain if the person led a life of profound holiness and could potentially serve as a moral example and role model to others. The cause for canonization, which includes the Sanctity of the Virtues, comprises a series of steps that start with the initiation of the investigation at the local level. The bishop, as the ecclesiastical authority, is responsible for gathering information about the proposed candidate, which includes testimonies, written accounts of their life, and other relevant documents. Once the documents are compiled and organized, they form the \\"positio,\\" a comprehensive summary of the cause. Upon completion of the local procedures, the cause is then forwarded to the Vatican, specifically to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. A team of theologians, historians, and other experts thoroughly analyze the positio, evaluating not only the sanctity of the life of the person in question but also the presence of any miracles attributed to their intersession following their death. After confirming the sanctity of the virtues and the presence of approved miracles, the Pope may proclaim the candidate to be a Blessed, and eventually, with additional miracles, canonize them as a Saint. The whole process can take many years or even centuries, and some causes are known to have lasted for an extended period before reaching a successful conclusion. In summary, the investigation of the Sanctity of the Virtues on January 2, 1976, proved significant in the ecclesiastical journey of recognizing a person's holiness and dedication to their faith. This process is a crucial part of the Catholic Church's careful and time-consuming efforts to identify individuals who can serve as moral examples for the broader Christian community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: My mom has been married three times, (nothing against her) and the first two times ended up a total mess. My dad, the first one, ended up just being a shot gun wedding. He was abusive and too young to be married with a child. They got divorced shortly after. A couple years later she met a man named Rob. He was fun, loving, kind, great with me, everything she had been looking for. They dated for.. a few months I think? Maybe a year. Then they got married and we moved to Texas. They were married for 5 years and she was just as miserable those 5 years. He was mean, he lied about everything, he was addicted to porn and stole from his job. He was controlling and wouldn’t let anyone else handle money. It was a rough house to grow up in and hard on my mom as she tried to keep me from the abuse. Eventually he cheated on her with one of her best friends and she kicked him out. I didn’t even notice he was gone for a week because he was so absent in my life. He apologized, turned into the man she first met and they tried again. He again cheated on her and she left him again, that time for good. They ended up finalizing the divorce a year later. I remember her telling me that she confronted him about his change of character and he had told her “Everyone puts on an act at first.” As if it was a normal thing. He had depression and I believe he wanted everyone to be just as miserable as he was. After they got divorced he had on and off again relationships, got a girl pregnant and got married, then she divorced him. He lived with his cousin for a while. The only stability he ever had was with my mom and I. I think that’s why he wanted to leave. Stability meant he had to become an adult and he didn’t want to have to take responsibility.

Solve -3*p - p = -20 for p.","output":"Alright, let's go step-by-step to solve the equation for 'p'. So, we have -3*p - p = -20 Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation.          We have -3p - p which combines to become -4p.          So, now our equation looks like: -4p = -20 Step 2: To solve for 'p', we should isolate 'p'. Do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -4         -4p / -4 = -20 / -4 Step 3: After simplifying, we get:       p = 5 So, the solution is p = 5.  This is derived from the fundamental algebraic principle that what you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other side for the equation to remain balanced.

There are several reasons that could have contributed to this desire for a change of scenery: 1. Seeing the Eiffel Tower: The Eiffel Tower is one of the most iconic and recognizable structures in the world, and it is a symbol of France.

Background: Sebastian Newbold Coe, Baron Coe,  (born 29 September 1956), often referred to as Seb Coe or Lord Coe, is a British politician and former track and field athlete. As a middle-distance runner, Coe won four Olympic medals, including the 1500 metres gold medal at the Olympic Games in 1980 and 1984. He set eight outdoor and three indoor world records in middle-distance track events - including, in 1979, setting three world records in the space of 41 days - and the world record he set in the 800 metres in 1981 remained unbroken until 1997. Coe's rivalries with fellow Britons Steve Ovett and Steve Cram dominated middle-distance racing for much of the 1980s. Context: When London announced its bid to hold the 2012 Olympics, Coe became an ambassador for the effort and a member of the board of the bid company. With the May 2004 resignation of chairman Barbara Cassani, Coe became the chairman for the latter phase of the bid. As Coe was a well-known personality in Olympic sport, it was felt he was better suited to the diplomatic finesse needed to secure the IOC's backing. Coe's presentation at the critical IOC meeting in July 2005 was viewed by commentators as being particularly effective, against tough competition from Paris and Madrid, and the London bid won the IOC's blessing on 6 July.  In September 2008 Coe controversially told reporters \\"Fuck 'em\\" when asked about the opposition to the creation of a footballing Team GB from Scottish and Welsh supporters as reported in The London Paper.  Coe attended the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver to see how the city coped with the challenges of hosting. Lord Coe noted the Games had \\"gradually recovered from its tumultuous start\\" and queried that he \\"never thought the British would find rivals in their preoccupation with the weather which is almost elevated to an Olympic event\\" as he credited VANOC for meeting unforeseen challenges such as the unseasonably warm weather of Cypress Mountain. Coe added \\"Rarely have I seen a host city so passionate and so ready to embrace the Games\\".  Coe was instrumental in asking Queen Elizabeth II to star in Happy and Glorious a short film featuring James Bond which formed part of the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. The director of the ceremony, Danny Boyle first pitched the idea to Coe, who loved it so much that he took it to Edward Young, Deputy Private Secretary to the Queen. A friend of Coe's from their days of advising William Hague, Young \\"listened sagely, laughed, and promised to ask the Boss\\". Word soon came back to Coe that she would love to take part. Coe has said that London 2012 is not only about five weeks of summer sport but about encouraging more people to take up sport at all levels of competition. Coe is the Patron of the British Dragon Boat Racing Association (BDA). Question: What was his job? Answer:","output":"Sebastian Newbold Coe, or Seb Coe, held multiple positions throughout his career. Initially, he was a track and field athlete, specializing in middle-distance running. Later, he became a British politician.

At the clinic, Victor discovers Celia has fallen in love with Dr. Zuckerbrot, who is concerned her husband's suicide will reflect badly on his practice. Trabucco accidentally is injected with a tranquilizer intended for Victor, who volunteers to fulfill the killer's contract when Trabucco's vision is impaired. After overcoming assorted complications, Victor completes his task. However, despite Victor's high hopes, Trabucco has no intention of sticking together and parts ways with him following their escape. Trabucco retires to a tropical island, where he unexpectedly is joined by his nemesis after Celia runs off with Dr. Zuckerbrot's female receptionist to become a lesbian couple. Desperate to see Victor gone, Trabucco suggests to his native attendant to reinstate the old custom of human sacrifices for the local volcano ..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The last name of the person the tranquilizer was intended for is Clooney. The tranquilizer was intended for Victor Clooney."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a young woman who was always interested in style, I got lucky in interning  with a fashion company in Tokyo, last summer.    I worked as an assistant in the Business Planning Department, helping with marketing for the 2007 Spring/Summer collections. Fashion is a beautiful industry. But against my expectation, it also has lots of ordinary work. Every day, I would do sample testing, prepare the brochure for future launches, and meet with customers and visitors.    Japanese companies had a traditional work style. We had a meeting every morning at 9 o'clock. Every Monday, all employees, including those in other parts ofprefix = st1 /Japan, would take part in a conference call. Every afternoon, after finishing work, each of us would say goodbye to every manager in the company, which took more than five minutes. All of this kept me fresh. And the strict work atmosphere caused me to work harder. At the end of last August, the company's 2007 Spring/Summer collection started with a big show and was very successful. Lots of customers showed an interest in our products, including a businessman from Hong Kong.  He went to our company for more details on the products, but he couldn't speak Japanese and none of the staff spoke good English.    Just when the situation seemed helpless, I offered to give it a try. I was a Japanese major, but I had also practiced my English often. My translation job was praised by both the customer and my boss. And the guest made a big purchase.    The two-month internship taught me a lot about business. And the pay - 150,000 yen, or over 10,000 yuan a month- was enough to cover my daily living costs inTokyo.   Moreover, the experience made me stand out. Every interviewer I've spoken with showed an interest and discussed my internship with me.   And thanks to this experience, I've found a good job in one of the Big Four accounting firms and will start working this summer. What can you learn from the passage? A) Internship usually plays an important role in finding a good job. B) Chinese are good at English. C) Japanese are good at spoken English.

Question: Besides the playback system how were acoustic limitations negatively affected? Context: Delicate sounds and fine overtones were mostly lost, because it took a lot of sound energy to vibrate the recording horn diaphragm and cutting mechanism. There were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances in both the recording and playback system. Some pictures of acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped with tape to help mute these resonances.

Answer the question...who put the chapters and verses in the bible??","output":"To answer the question of who put the chapters and verses in the Bible, I will divide my response into two parts: chapters and verses. 1. Chapters: The division of the Bible into chapters can be credited to Stephen Langton, an Archbishop of Canterbury. Langton introduced chapter divisions around 1227 AD to make it easier to reference specific passages in the scriptures. This categorization allowed for a more systematic study of the texts and facilitated public readings. 2. Verses: The person responsible for dividing the Bible into verses is Robert Estienne, also known as Robert Stephanus. He was a French printer and classical scholar who introduced this system during the 16th century. Specifically, he applied the verse divisions in his printed editions of the Bible: the Latin Vulgate in 1551 and the Greek New Testament in 1555. Just like with chapters, the division into verses provided easier referencing and improved overall navigation throughout the texts. In conclusion, the Bible is divided into chapters and verses, with Stephen Langton responsible for the formation of chapters and Robert Estienne for the distinction of verses. Both contributions have significantly impacted the way people study and reference the Bible today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Imagine you are standing in a farm field in central Illinois. The land is so flat you can see for miles and miles. On a clear day, you might see a grain silo 20 miles away. You might think to yourself, it sure is flat around here. If you drive one hundred miles to the south, the landscape changes. In southern Illinois, there are rolling hills. Why do you think this is? What could have caused these features? There are no big rivers that may have eroded and deposited this material. The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it. To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years. Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States. Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice. Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice. The massive ice sheet, called a glacier, caused the features on the land you see today. Where did glaciers go? Where can you see them today? Glaciers are masses of flowing ice.  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are glaciers and what affect do they have on land?\\" is \\"A large river that erodes soil\\"? Pick your answer from:  a). no  b). yes","output":"a). no Glaciers are not large rivers that erode soil. They are masses of flowing ice formed from compacted snow that accumulate over time. Glaciers significantly influence landscapes through processes like erosion, transportation, and deposition of rocks and sediments, which help in shaping and modifying the land over time. In the context provided, the central part of Illinois is relatively flat because glaciers moved across this area during the last ice age. The massive ice sheet, around a mile thick, smoothed out the surface as it slowly advanced and retreated, depositing materials it had eroded and carried along the way. This created the flat landscape you can observe today. As you move further south to the rolling hills of southern Illinois, the landscape there was less influenced by the glaciers, allowing the natural topography to remain more varied and hilly. Glaciers still exist today, primarily found in colder regions such as Greenland, Antarctica, and high mountain ranges like the Himalayas and the Alps. These glaciers continue to shape and influence their surrounding landscapes, albeit at a slower rate due to their retreat caused by global climate change."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that Derry was being zapped (experiencing an electric shock).  Step 3: Evaluate the logical connection between premise and hypothesis In order to determine if the premise supports the hypothesis, we must examine whether the writhing motion described in the premise could be an indication of Derry being zapped. Step 4: Compare writhing motion to the zapping hypothesis Writhing could be a reaction caused by multiple factors, such as feeling pain, discomfort, or experiencing sensory overload from being connected to the circuitry mesh. One possible cause of the writhing could be electric shock (being zapped), which can cause involuntary muscle contractions and discomfort. Step 5: Assess if the premise implies the hypothesis Since the writhing motion could be caused by multiple factors and not exclusively by electric shocks, it is not possible to definitively conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is true as well.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of war materiel during the Second World War, such as the Avro Manchester and Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power the Spitfire, Hurricane, Mosquito and the Lancaster. The engines were made by Ford, under licence. The 17,316 workers employed in Ford's purpose-built factory had produced 34,000 engines by the war's end. The facility was designed in two separate sections to minimise the impact of bomb damage on production. The wood-working factory of F. Hills & Sons built more than 800 Percival Proctor aircraft for the RAF between 1940 and 1945, which were flight tested at the nearby Barton Aerodrome. Other companies produced gun bearings, steel tracks for Churchill tanks, munitions, Bailey bridges, and much else. ICI built and operated the first facility in the UK able to produce penicillin in quantity.As an important industrial area, the park suffered from extensive bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of December 1940. On the night of 23 December 1940, the Metropolitan-Vickers aircraft factory in Mosley Road was badly damaged, with the loss of the first 13 MV-built Avro Manchester bombers in final assembly. The new Ford factory producing aircraft engines was bombed only a few days after its opening in May 1941. Trafford Hall was severely damaged by bombing, and was demolished shortly after the war ended.In the December 1940 air raids, stray bombs aiming for Trafford Park landed on Old Trafford football stadium, the nearby home of Manchester United, but this air raid only resulted in minor damage and matches were soon being played at the stadium again. On 11 March 1941, however, stray bombs aimed at Trafford Park fell onto Old Trafford for a second time, causing serious damage to the stadium. It was comprehensively rebuilt after the war and re-opened in 1949, until which time Manchester United played their home games at Maine Road, the stadium of Manchester City in Moss Side.At the outbreak of war in...

But after a conversation with security guard Reese Wilson (Loretta Devine) about her experience with a series of murders that had happened on the campus she had previously worked in, she decides to make a film about a serial killer murdering in the fashion of urban legends. Meanwhile, a student named Lisa (Jacinda Barrett) feels dazed and prepares to leave the bar, when someone abducts her. She wakes up in a bathtub filled with ice and discovers that her kidney was removed. Attacked by her abductor, she tries to flee through the window and is decapitated in the process. Lisa is not missed as she was about to go on a trip. The next day, Amy is preparing the shooting of her thesis film but is deserted by the assigned camera man, Toby Belcher (Anson Mount), who accuses Amy of stealing his thesis idea. Shooting begins with another camera man, Simon. When Sandra (Jessica Cauffiel), Amy's actress friend who played a victim in a scene, returns to an empty studio after forgetting her keys, she is attacked and slashed to death with a straight razor by the same killer who killed Lisa. Her friends witness her death when the material is smuggled into a sequence of takes of the scene, but discount it as another piece of acting, wondering who shot it. As there is no body and Sandra was about to go on a trip, her disappearance goes unnoticed. Travis (Matthew Davis) is found to have committed suicide at the campus tower.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: The throttle body is the point that your intake meets the engine and the air is funneled into the intake manifold.  In many applications, installing a throttle body with a larger diameter will allow even more air to flow into the engine, resulting in an increase of power.  Throttle bodies are often held in place with four bolts and will require a new gasket to be placed between the throttle body and intake manifold when installed.  Throttle body diameter is usually measured in millimeters.  Swapping a 65 millimeter throttle body for a 75 millimeter one can dramatically increase the air that flows into the engine. You can purchase throttle bodies with larger diameters at many auto parts stores or online performance marketplaces. Make sure to purchase a throttle body designed for your specific year, make and model of vehicle. Replacing the pistons in your engine is a significant project, but the resulting horsepower increase can be equally as significant.  In many vehicles, you will need to remove the entire engine to replace the pistons, but in some you can actually remove the oil pan and crank shaft, followed by the piston rods and pistons.  If installing forced induction like a turbocharger or supercharger, you should choose pistons made of forged steel as opposed to the more common cast steel.  Forged steel can withstand higher pressures and temperatures. There are a number of steps involved in replacing pistons, many of which are best left to professionals. The camshaft or shafts in your engine have the important task of opening and closing the intake and exhaust valves that allow the air and fuel to enter the engine and the exhaust to exit it at just the right time.  Stock camshafts are designed with a combination of efficiency, power, fuel economy and emissions in mind, but replacing them with more specialized ones can dramatically increase the power output of the engine.  Many modern vehicles come equipped with variable cam timing (such as Honda’s V-Tech), but even these cam shafts can be replaced for more specialized applications. Pushrod motors have a camshaft located in the engine block, whereas modular motors will have them in the cylinder heads. Just as replacing components of the exhaust system will increase the efficiency of the exhaust exiting the engine, aftermarket exhaust manifolds designed with larger diameter pipes and equal length piping will improve the balance and efficiency of the way exhaust exits your engine.  Aftermarket exhaust manifolds are commonly referred to as headers, and can add significant power to your vehicle.  In many four-cylinder vehicles, the exhaust manifold is bolted to the cylinder head at the front of the car. Turbochargers are mounted to the exhaust manifold of turbocharged vehicles, and the increased efficiency of headers will have an even more dramatic effect on the power output of such vehicles. Many four cylinder sports cars now come equipped with turbochargers.  These turbochargers produce more pressure than regular atmospheric air can, forcing more air into the engine than would otherwise be possible.  Installing an aftermarket boost controller on the vacuum line between the turbocharger and waste gate can allow you to increase the amount of boost the turbocharger produces.  Remember that your engine needs to maintain an appropriate air/fuel ratio, so never increase the boost more than your specific vehicle’s fuel system can support. An aftermarket boost gauge can be considered mandatory for this modification to ensure you know exactly how many PSI of boost your vehicle is producing. An air/fuel or exhaust gas temperature gauge can help you ensure you are supporting the increased air flow with enough fuel.","output":"The throttle body plays a crucial role in regulating the airflow into the engine, ultimately impacting the vehicle's power. By installing a throttle body with a larger diameter, air intake can be increased, leading to a subsequent increase in power. This important component needs to be compatible with the vehicle's specific year, make, and model.  In addition to the throttle body, replacing the engine's pistons can lead to a significant horsepower increase. This complex process may require removing the entire engine, and it's best to use forged steel pistons for their ability to withstand higher pressures and temperatures. Due to the involved nature of this modification, seeking professional help is recommended.  Camshafts control the opening and closing of intake and exhaust valves, allowing for the right amount of air and fuel to enter the engine and exhaust to be expelled. Replacing stock camshafts with specialized ones can greatly increase the engine's power output. Some modern vehicles may have variable cam timing for enhanced performance, but even these can be replaced for specific applications.  One key component of the exhaust system is the exhaust manifold, which can also be altered to increase power. Aftermarket exhaust manifolds, or headers, feature larger diameter pipes and equal length piping for greater exhaust efficiency. This modification particularly benefits turbocharged vehicles, which rely on effective turbochargers for increased air intake.  Installing an aftermarket boost controller on turbocharged engines allows for greater boost and power output. However, it's essential to maintain an appropriate air/fuel ratio and not exceed the fuel system's capacity. As a result, it's imperative to have precise gauges installed for monitoring crucial parameters, such as boost, air/fuel ratio, and exhaust gas temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: You should never use a curling iron on wet hair, as it causes breakage and burning. Instead, make sure your hair is completely dry before curling it. Before you start curling, make sure your hair is free of tangles and snares by running a brush or comb through it. You can apply a detangling spray or serum if necessary, as well. Before you use your curling iron, apply a setting spray or hairspray to help the curls hold. You can also use a product like wave-enhancing spray, mousse, or gel, to help give your hair body and set the curls. Let it dry before you start curling your hair. Look for a setting spray that doubles as a heat protectant to prevent hair damage from the curling iron. To get extra curly hair, you need to use a small curling iron to create fairly tight curls. Choose a curling iron with a ¾ inch to 1-inch barrel to get small curls. Larger barrels will create a wavy, rather than curly, look. Begin with a small section at the crown (or top) of your head and work your way through the top portion of your hair. Then, curl the next highest layer all the way around before moving lower. Many people also start curling from the bottom, but it won’t make a big difference either way. Open the handle and close the hair in the curling iron. Start in the middle of the section, rather than clamping it at the end, to create curls that last all day. Begin twirling the iron so that the hair wraps around it. Then, gently release the clamp and slide the iron down the hair. Clamp it and roll it again. Continue this process until you reach the ends of your hair. Then roll the iron until it is close to, but not touching, your scalp. Clamping the middle of your hair in the iron and working your way toward the ends will create longer lasting curls that rolling the iron from the bottom of your hair up. Hold the curl in place for 5 seconds before releasing it. Then, open up the iron and pull the handle down, letting go of the curl. After you make the curl, wrap it around your finger in a small loop or bun. When you have it wrapped, use a bobby pin or single prong hair clip to secure it to your head. This process will help your curls set, and it keeps them out of your way as you curl the rest of your hair. As you go, alternate the amount of hair you curl at one time and well as the direction in which you roll the hair. Doing so will give you a bit more volume, as well as curls in different sizes and orientations, which will make them look more natural. Continue curling one piece of hair at a time until all your hair is curled. If you have a lot of hair and are curling small sections, this may take a while. While your curls are setting, spritz them with hairspray before unpinning them. Allow the hairspray to dry completely before you remove the bobby pins. Release the bobby pins, and unroll the curls. Shake your curls out, then use your fingers to separate them. Scrunch up or twist the curls with your fingers, creating the shape you want. Don’t brush out your curls, as this will undo all the work you’ve put in and create frizziness. You can apply a finishing product to set the style, if desired. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is: To curl your hair properly, ensure it is dry and tangle-free. Apply a setting spray or heat protectant, and choose a small curling iron (¾ inch to 1-inch barrel) for tight curls. Start curling from the top or crown and clamp the iron in the middle of the hair section, working your way towards the ends. Hold for 5 seconds before releasing. Wrap the curl around your finger and secure it with a bobby pin or hair clip to set. Alternate the amount of hair and direction of the curl for a natural look.

No; While the suggested answer provides a general definition of \\"convocation,\\" it does not specifically address the meaning of a \\"college convocation.\\" A much more accurate and detailed response to the question would be: A college convocation is a formal ceremony within an academic institution that typically serves to welcome and recognize students, faculty, and staff. The term \\"convocation\\" originates from the Latin \\"convocatio,\\" meaning \\"a calling together,\\" and it denotes the gathering of individuals for a special purpose. A college convocation usually takes place at the beginning of the academic year and marks the official commencement of the educational journey for new students. The event may include an address from the institution's president or dean, speeches from distinguished faculty or guest speakers, and a procession of students, faculty, and staff. During the convocation, incoming students are often introduced to the college's core values, expectations, and academic traditions. In some academic institutions, convocations may also be held to celebrate and recognize the achievements of graduating students, serving as a bookend to their academic experience. It is important to note that a convocation is not the same as a graduation ceremony, which marks the official conferral of academic degrees.

In which battle day group A would have more openings in their nest thatch, battle day three or battle day four?  In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity.  Hint: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Group A would have more openings in their nest thatch on battle day three. This is because on battle day three, Group A territory had low air humidity, while on battle day four, the territory had high air humidity. Acromyrmex heyeri ants adjust the openings in their nest thatch for temperature regulation and to reduce water loss for the colony. When the temperature is between 20-30 °C, they create more openings in the nest thatch to let heat out. However, when air humidity decreases, the ants will close the openings to reduce water loss. Since battle day four had high air humidity, the ants would likely close the openings in the nest thatch to conserve water, whereas on battle day three with low air humidity, they would open the thatch to help regulate temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Wynan Answer:","output":"Title: \\"A Web of Blackmail\\" Genre: Thriller/Drama Plot: In a quiet suburban town, lives Michael Cooper, a middle-aged man with a seemingly perfect life: beautiful wife, lovely kids, and a successful career. However, beneath his calm demeanor, Cooper hides his secret life as a prolific blackmailer, preying on wealthy individuals to maintain his luxurious lifestyle. One day, Cooper crosses paths with Maxwell Wynan, a prominent businessman, and philanthropist with a dark past. Cooper discovers that Wynan was involved in a hit-and-run accident many years ago that resulted in a young girl's death. To protect his reputation and family, Wynan went above and beyond to cover up the incident. After digging up concrete evidence, Cooper makes his move and starts blackmailing Wynan. At first, Wynan caves under the pressure and complies with Cooper's demands. He fears losing everything he has worked for, as well as the love of his family. He also worries that his long-buried secret will destroy his community standing, forcing him to accept the deal. However, Wynan soon grows desperate for a way out. With the help of his trusted assistant, Lila, he develops a counter-plan: they will search for Michael Cooper's past and find any incriminating evidence to turn the tables and free him from Cooper's grip. Through their investigation, they unveil that Cooper is notorious for this behavior and may be tied to unsolved extortion cases. As the intensity builds, both parties begin to manipulate the people around them in their ongoing battle of control. Cooper becomes merciless, targeting the people Wynan loves most, and forcing Wynan to take increasingly desperate measures to protect them. What starts as a simple blackmail scheme evolves into a complex game of cat-and-mouse where the stakes are high. Friends and family are entangled in the crossfire, leaving both men doubting everyone around them. Tensions culminate in a dramatic showdown where Cooper and Wynan confront one another. In the climax, Lila betrays Wynan by providing Cooper with some crucial evidence to eliminate Wynan for her personal reasons. Cooper goes for the kill, but in the last moment, Lila double-crosses Cooper and hands the information to the authorities, leading to Cooper's arrest and, ultimately, his downfall. Lila reveals that she, too, had been manipulated by Cooper earlier. As a result, she wanted to put an end to the web of blackmail and deceit Cooper constructed. Though still marred by his dark past, Wynan finds some redemption in assisting Lila in bringing Cooper's operation down. He dedicates his life to making amends for his past actions, both personally and through philanthropic work aimed at victims of hit-and-run accidents. The movie ends with Wynan embracing his family, acknowledging that they may not be able to leave their past behind entirely, but they will face it together and become stronger because of it, as they set off to rebuild their lives in the aftermath of Michael Cooper's web of blackmail."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"What happens to insects?\\" and the following answer choices:  - They are eaten  - Damages them  - decrease stamina  - They may not survive.  - ignored  - incinerated  - not eaten  - movement  Now knowing that most arthropods are insects and arthropods are eaten seasonally, choose the best answer.

There are two official languages spoken in Canada: French and English. Many people can speak both English and French. More than 60% of Canadians speak English as their language. About 25% of the Canadians speak French. In one province of Canada where French is the common language, the programmes on TV and radios as well as the teaching in schools are all in French. Today, Chinese has become the first inofficial  language in Canada. Canada's climate is not as cold all year around as some may believe. In winter, temperatures fall below freezing point throughout most of Canada. In summer, the southern provinces often experience high levels of temperatures that can reach over 30degC regularly. The weather in Canada is just like the weather in China. It is rather cold in the north while it is fairly warm in the south. Winters in the north last long with snow for half a year. As the cold northern climate, only one-fifth of the land is suitable for farming. As it is known to all, Canada has one-third of the world's supply of fresh water. It has many great lakes. There are five great lakes in the south. And there are many others, especially in the north. It is also rich in natural resources, such as coal, oil, natural gas of which Canadians make use to produce energy. People of northern Canada are called Inuit  , who came from Asia and settled in Canada about 4,000 years ago. They used to travel around from place to place with teams of dogs which pulled their baggage. Now, they seldom move. There are about 2,500 Inuit in all.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the dishwasher operation process: 1. Dirty dishes are rinsed: Before placing dishes in the dishwasher, it is recommended to rinse off food debris and other particles. This preliminary action can help reduce the load on the dishwasher and minimize the risk of clogging its filters or drain. 2. Dishes are placed into the dishwasher: Positioning dishes in the dishwasher should be done thoughtfully to maximize efficiency and cleaning performance. Larger items should be placed on the bottom rack, while smaller ones and glassware can go on the top rack. Ensure that the dishwasher is not overloaded or underloaded to attain optimal results. 3. A detergent is added to the detergent dispenser: Utilizing a suitable detergent is vital to achieving clean and spotless dishes. Measure the appropriate amount of detergent according to the manufacturer's instructions and place it in the dishwasher's detergent dispenser. 4. The dishwasher is closed, and the power is turned on: After the dishwasher is filled with dishes and detergent, close the door securely, and choose an appropriate cycle based on the types of dishes or level of dirtiness. The dishwasher will then start the cleaning process. 5. In about 1.5-2 hours, the dishes are clean: The duration of the dishwasher's cycle will depend on factors such as the selected program, the appliance's capacity, and the level of dirtiness. After the cycle is completed, the dishwasher will signal that the process has ended. At this point, open the dishwasher, let the steam escape, and wait a few minutes for the dishes to cool down before unloading. Now, to address the question: \\"Suppose the dishes are already clean; how will it affect hurting the dishwasher to clean better?\\" The options presented are more (A), less (B), and no effect (C). Considering that the dishwasher functions effectively when both dirty and rinsed dishes are inserted, putting already clean dishes in the dishwasher would not necessarily cause harm. However, it would be less efficient in terms of water and energy consumption. Consequently, Option B: \\"less\\" would be the most accurate answer, as the dishwasher might \\"clean better\\" with an accurate assessment of dish cleanliness and proper utilization of resources. It is essential to remember that while placing already clean dishes in the dishwasher may not have an immediate effect on the appliance's performance, consistently running unnecessary cycles will waste energy, water and detergent, as well as cause additional wear and tear on the dishwasher, resulting in a shortened lifespan or potential long-term damage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: The black-and-white aerial footage shows a line of purported Taliban insurgents slowly walking along a path in a lightly forested desert in Afghanistan's western Farah province. Suddenly, the screen flashes to white as the men disappear in a fireball — the result of a bomb dropped from a U.S. MQ-9 \\"Reaper\\" drone. \\"Taliban fighters on the run following Afghan-led offensive in #Farah province, #Afghanistan. Video shows U.S. airpower (MQ-9s) in support,\\" declared a short message accompanying the video, which was posted on the official account of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Subsequent footage showed more Taliban scrambling, in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the airstrikes. The Pentagon footage was released Wednesday, as U.S., NATO and Afghan government forces were locked in a fierce battle with the Taliban for control of the capital of Farah, which borders Iran. The tweet was unusually graphic. While the U.S. military often releases footage of buildings or vehicles being destroyed, it does not as frequently distribute videos that show individuals being bombed. Less than 24 hours later, the U.S. Air Force posted its own Afghanistan-related tweet that raised eyebrows — this one referencing a viral audio clip that has sparked a lighthearted online debate among those who hear the word \\"Laurel\\" and others who hear \\"Yanny.\\" \\"The Taliban Forces in Farah city #Afghanistan would much rather have heard #Yanny or #Laurel than the deafening #BRRRT they got courtesy of our #A10,\\" read the Air Force tweet. The Air Force has since apologized and deleted the tweet, saying it was sent in \\"poor taste.\\" The USFOR-A tweet remains. In a statement to VOA, a Pentagon spokesperson said the tweets do not represent a new social media strategy. \\"As with any other organization, the post was an attempt to bring awareness to a major/ongoing organizational activity by tying it to references or conversations already trending with their established audiences,\\" said Lieutenant Colonel Kone Faulkner. Why did the Air Force send the tweet? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. Because it had a new social media strategy  B. Because it was in poor taste  C. not enough information  D. Because it felt superior to the dead terrorists Answer:","output":"C. not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 2009, a genetically re-engineered measles virus, originally created as a cure for cancer, turns into a lethal strain which kills 94% of those it infects, mutates 5% into predatory, nocturnal mutants called \\"Darkseekers\\" who are extremely vulnerable to sunlight and other sources of UV, with only the remaining 1% immune. Three years after the outbreak, US Army virologist Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville (Will Smith) lives an isolated life in the ruins of New York City, which is now deserted, unsure if any other uninfected humans are left in the world. The effects of the virus vary in other species, animals that coexist with humans like rats and domestic dogs are infected but wild animals like deer and lions are unaffected. The city has fallen into ruins and overgrown vegetation covers crumbling buildings and wild deer roam the streets while being preyed upon by lions that have escaped Central Park Zoo. Neville's daily routine includes experimentation on infected rats to find a cure for the virus and trips through Manhattan to hunt for food and supplies. He also waits each day for a response to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, which instruct any uninfected survivors to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport. Flashbacks reveal that his wife (Salli Richardson) and daughter (Willow Smith) died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan, prior to the military-enforced quarantine of the island in 2009, in which Neville stays behind on the island as military personnel. Neville's loneliness is mitigated by the companionship of his German Shepherd Sam (given to him by his daughter Marley as a puppy to protect him before she died in the helicopter crash), interaction with mannequins he has set up as patrons at a video store, and recordings of old television broadcasts. At night, he barricades himself and Sam inside his heavily fortified Washington Square Park home to hide from the Darkseekers. One day while waiting for survivors, Sam follows a deer into a dark building.... Answer:","output":"Question: How does Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville attempt to find a cure for the lethal virus and cope with his isolation in the deserted New York City while simultaneously protecting himself from the dangerous \\"Darkseekers\\" in the 2009 post-apocalyptic film?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is 35 and cannot go on forever but United would be crazy not to try to keep the Swedish striker for another season because he has shown he still has such a lot to offer. As well as his 24 goals in 37 games for United, a big part of Ibrahimovic's impact is the effect he has had on his team-mates. His influence has been compared with that of Old Trafford legend Eric Cantona - and I can understand why. We know Ibrahimovic has got fantastic individual ability, but his charisma and the way he carries himself has seen him become the team's talisman. Media playback is not supported on this device It must be brilliant for United's young players - like Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard - to be around someone with Ibrahimovic's appetite, energy and desire. They can learn some things from him on the pitch during games, of course, but working with him every day and seeing his attitude in training and the dressing room will be invaluable experience for them. That is another reason for United to keep him, although even if he does stay I am pretty certain they will still go for a big-hitter in the summer to either play with him up front, or compete for his place. Ibrahimovic's mentality has not changed despite everything he has done in his career - he is still determined to be the best. He has played in the vast majority of United's games this season, which for someone his age is a superb achievement - in all competitions, Leicester's Wes Morgan is the only Premier League player to play more minutes. It is not as if Ibrahimovic is taking it easy, either. His languid style means it does not always look as if he is doing a lot of running during games, but he typically covers 9km every 90 minutes - the same distance per match as a striker as hard-working as Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, for example. All of that helps to show Ibrahimovic's hunger, and also demonstrates he is still a supreme athlete. However, both of those statistics would be overlooked if he was not scoring goals too. They are the really impressive thing and set him apart from other 35-year-old footballers. They have made a big difference for United too. His goal against Blackburn in the FA Cup on Sunday was his ninth winner in all competitions this season. Altogether his goals have earned United 11 points in the Premier League alone - a joint league high for 2016-17 with Chelsea's Diego Costa. Media playback is not supported on this device I played in the Premier League until I was almost 36 and to compete at that age you need to have a hunger in training, not just want to keep playing more games. On a day-to-day basis you have to keep pushing yourself. Your body is taking more and more punishment and it becomes harder and harder to get through it. You need to have huge willpower, but you also need a manager who understands what you need - when you need a rest, and when you do and don't need to train. Ibrahimovic has that in Jose Mourinho, which is great, but he still has to go out and do the business on the pitch. Mourinho has helped him there too because he knows he has a player who needs feeding, and their style of play does precisely that. The key for United is getting the ball up to Ibrahimovic, then getting players around him and running beyond him to deliver it into the box. They were not quite managing it earlier in the season but now they have found a way of making it work that suits Ibrahimovic and, more importantly, the team. If you give Ibrahimovic chances, the rest is up to him. United have been doing the first bit - he has had more shots at goal this season than any other Premier League player. Then of course his ability takes over, which is why he is delivering the goods. Media playback is not supported on this device Ibrahimovic has already been a winner at Wembley this season, when his goal against Leicester clinched the Community Shield. On Sunday he will get the chance to get his hands on more silverware when his side play Southampton in the EFL Cup final (16:30 GMT kick-off), but United will not be taking success for granted. Not many people gave Southampton a chance over two legs against Liverpool in the semi-finals and I think they have enough going forward to cause United problems. It will be a blow for United if Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Michael Carrick miss the game through injury, as Mourinho fears, but United will still rightly go into the game as favourites. Ibrahimovic's form obviously marks him out as their danger man, and he has already scored twice against Saints this season when he got off the mark at Old Trafford with both goals in a United win in August. So Southampton will know how big a threat he is when the ball comes into their box - what might decide the game is whether they can stop him this time. Alan Shearer was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. What is a summary of this text?","output":"Zlatan Ibrahimovic is a key figure for Manchester United, not only for his impressive goal-scoring record but also for his positive influence on the team's younger players. The Swedish striker has scored 24 goals in 37 games for United this season and his impact on teammates has been compared to Old Trafford legend, Eric Cantona. His determination and continued desire to be the best provide valuable lessons and experience for players like Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, and Jesse Lingard, especially in training and the dressing room. This makes retaining Ibrahimovic for another season a sensible move for United, despite his age."},{"instruction":"I felt very sick.  Quinn brought me to the hospital.

The Sweet (also known as Sweet) is a British glam rock band that rose to worldwide fame in the 1970s. Their best known line-up consisted of lead vocalist Brian Connolly, bass player Steve Priest, guitarist Andy Scott, and drummer Mick Tucker. The group was originally called Sweetshop. The band was formed in London in 1968 and achieved their first hit, \\"Funny Funny\\", in 1971 after teaming up with songwriters Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman and record producer Phil Wainman. Guitarist Mick Stewart joined in 1969. Stewart had some rock pedigree, having previously worked with The (Ealing) Redcaps and Simon Scott & The All-Nite Workers in the mid-1960s. In late 1965, that band became The Phil Wainman Set when the future Sweet producer joined on drums and the group cut some singles with Errol Dixon. In early 1966, Stewart left and later worked with Johnny Kidd & The Pirates.  The Sweet signed a new record contract with EMI's Parlophone label. Three bubblegum pop singles were released: \\"Lollipop Man\\" (September 1969), \\"All You'll Ever Get from Me\\" (January 1970), and a cover version of the Archies' \\"Get on the Line\\" (June 1970), all of which failed to chart. Stewart then quit, and was not replaced for some time. Connolly and Tucker had a chance meeting with Wainman, who was now producing, and knew of two aspiring songwriters, Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, who were looking for a group to sing over some demos they had written together. Connolly, Priest and Tucker provided the vocals on a track called \\"Funny Funny\\" which featured Pip Williams on guitar, John Roberts on bass and Wainman on drums. The latter began offering the track to various recording companies. The band held auditions for a replacement guitarist and settled on Welsh-born Andy Scott. He had most recently been playing with Mike McCartney (brother of Paul) in the Scaffold. As a member of the Elastic Band, he had played guitar on two singles for Decca, \\"Think of You Baby\\" and \\"Do Unto Others\\". He also appeared on the band's lone album release, Expansions on Life, and on some recordings by the Scaffold. The band rehearsed for a number of weeks before Scott made his live debut with Sweet on 26 September 1970 at the Windsor Ballroom in Redcar.  The Sweet initially attempted to combine various musical influences, including the Monkees and 1960s bubblegum pop groups such as the Archies, with more heavy rock-oriented groups such as the Who. The Sweet adopted the rich vocal harmony style of the Hollies, with distorted guitars and a heavy rhythm section. This fusion of pop and hard rock would remain a central trademark of Sweet's music and prefigured the glam metal of a few years later.  The Sweet's initial album appearance was on the budget label Music for Pleasure as part of a compilation called Gimme Dat Ding, released in December 1970. The Sweet had one side of the record; the Pipkins (whose sole hit, \\"Gimme Dat Ding\\", gave the LP its name) had the other. The Sweet side consisted of the A- and B-sides of the band's three Parlophone singles. Andy Scott appears in the album cover shot, even though he did not play on any of the recordings. Any interesting info on band members?","output":"Brian Connolly (Lead Vocals): Brian Connolly was born on October 5, 1945, in Govanhill, Glasgow, Scotland. Before joining The Sweet, Connolly was a part of several bands, including Wainwright's Gentlemen and The Army. His charismatic stage presence and powerful vocals played a significant role in the success of The Sweet. Unfortunately, he struggled with alcoholism, which ultimately affected his vocal abilities and led to his departure from the band in 1979. Connolly pursued a solo career and occasionally performed with a new version of The Sweet, called \\"Brian Connolly's Sweet.\\" He passed away on February 9, 1997, due to liver failure. Steve Priest (Bass, Vocals): Born on February 23, 1948, in Hayes, Middlesex, England, Steve Priest started playing bass at the age of 16. He formed The Sweet with Brian Connolly, Mick Tucker, and later Andy Scott. Priest was known for his flamboyant stage outfits and theatrical performances. He contributed lead and backing vocals to various songs and played a vital role in shaping the band's sound. After The Sweet's breakup in 1981, Priest released a solo album and eventually formed a new version of the band called \\"Steve Priest's Sweet\\" in 2008. He continued performing with his version of the band until his death on June 4, 2020. Andy Scott (Guitar, Vocals): Born on June 30, 1949, in Wrexham, Wales, Andy Scott was a skilled guitarist and songwriter. He joined The Sweet in 1970 and his addition to the lineup proved instrumental in their success. His guitar work and songwriting abilities helped the band transition from bubblegum pop to a heavier rock sound. Scott contributed songs like \\"The Ballroom Blitz,\\" \\"Fox on the Run,\\" and \\"Love is Like Oxygen.\\" Following the band's breakup, Scott had a brief solo career before forming the \\"Andy Scott's Sweet\\" in the late 1980s. He has continued to tour with his version of the band to the present day. Mick Tucker (Drums, Vocals): Born on July 17, 1947, in Harlesden, North West London, England, drummer Mick Tucker was a founding member of The Sweet. Before joining the band, Tucker was a part of Wainwright's Gentlemen with Brian Connolly. Known for his energetic, powerful, and precise drumming, Tucker contributed heavily to The Sweet's signature sound. He also provided backing vocals for several songs. After the band's breakup in 1981, he formed a group called \\"Tucker Brown\\" and later reunited with Andy Scott to perform as The Sweet. Tucker passed away on February 14, 2002, after battling leukemia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Given the following context:  Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person who is believed to have spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries?","output":"The last name of the person who is believed to have spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries is Lochner.

After arguing with her husband, Liza Murphy walked out of their home in Emerson, New Jersey, leaving behind her purse, her cigarettes, her cell phone and her three children, her husband told police. There has been no sign of her since August 19, 2007. Liza Murphy has been missing from her home in Emerson, New Jersey, since August 19, 2007. Murphy's friends and family reported her missing the next day. \\"In my heart, I fear the worst, that my daughter is gone,\\" said her mother, Sophia Stellatos. Police searched extensively for Murphy, especially around a reservoir not far from her home, but they found nothing. Cadaver dogs caught her scent near the George Washington Bridge, but the trail went cold, police told the family. Deepening the mystery, her husband, Joe Murphy, tried to take his own life a few days after his wife disappeared by walking into oncoming traffic and throwing himself in front of a fire truck, police say. He was hospitalized and recovered from his injuries, but police say he hired a lawyer and is no longer cooperating with investigators. His lawyer said Murphy, an Irish immigrant, has nothing to hide from the authorities. He said his client has no criminal record and no history of violence. Attorney Joseph Rem added that there was no physical violence in the marriage. According to her family, Liza Murphy, 42, was not the type of person to take off on her own without letting her family know.

Stellatos described Joe Murphy as possessive of his wife, never allowing her to go out with her friends. She said he was even jealous if she spent time with her parents. Rem pointed out that his client has not been named as a suspect or a person of interest in the case. He said police have not asked to speak to his client recently. Liza Murphy's children are 15, 13 and 10 years old now. Joe Murphy has full custody of them, and the Stellatoses have not seen their grandchildren since shortly before their daughter disappeared. Murphy and her children had spent the week before her disappearance visiting with her parents, who live about 125 miles away. They returned the Friday before Murphy's disappearance. Police say both the Murphy home and their vehicles have been processed for forensics, but they found no evidence of foul play or struggle. Liza Murphy had been suffering from depression and was on medication for fibromyalgia, a painful condition that affects the muscles and soft tissues. Police say she may have been accosted after she left home, still stewing over the argument. The police seek the public's help in this case.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Born in Selma, Alabama, Mia was the fourth of six children of Bill and Stephanie Hamm. She wore corrective shoes as a toddler after being born with a club foot. Hamm spent her childhood on various United States Air Force bases around the world with her family. While living in Florence, Italy, Hamm first played soccer, which was hugely popular there; her entire family quickly became involved in the sport. On May 22, 1999, Hamm broke the all-time international goal record with her 108th goal in a game against Brazil in Orlando, Florida. The following month, she led the national team at the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, hosted by the United States. During the team's first group stage match against Denmark, she scored her 110th international goal and served an assist to Julie Foudy as the U.S. won 3-0. Against Nigeria, Hamm's low free kick was knocked into the goal by a Nigerian midfielder. Within a minute, Hamm scored with a free kick. She later served an assist to Kristine Lilly before being substituted in the 57th minute. The U.S. won 7-1 and secured a berth in the quarter-finals. During the team's final group stage match, head coach Tony DiCicco rested a number of players, including Hamm, who was substituted at half-time. The U.S. defeated Korea 3-0 and finished Group A with nine points. In the quarter-finals, the U.S. defeated Germany 3-2. Playing Brazil in the semi-finals, Hamm was knocked down in the penalty area late in the second half; Michelle Akers converted the subsequent penalty and their team won 2-0.  After 90 minutes of scoreless regulation time and 30 minutes of sudden death, the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final was decided by a penalty shootout between the U.S. and China. The five American players to take penalty kicks, including Hamm, converted; China missed one attempt so that the home team won. The final surpassed the 1996 Atlanta Olympic final as the most-attended women's sports event, with more than 90,000 people filling the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. It held the record until 2014 for the largest U.S. television audience for a soccer match with 17,975,000 viewers. As of July 2015, it ranks third following the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup (25,400,000 viewers) and 2014 FIFA World Cup group stage match between the U.S. men's team and Portugal (18,220,000 viewers).  Immediately following the final, Hamm collapsed in the locker room from severe hydration. She was treated by medical staff with an intravenous drip and three liters of fluids. After 12 hours of sleep, she joined the team for magazine cover shoots, went to Disneyland for a celebration rally, and made numerous television appearances. A week later, the team met President Clinton at the White House and flew with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton on Air Force One to Cape Canaveral. Her leadership and performance at the 1999 World Cup cemented Hamm as a soccer icon. Did they get to the finals?","output":"Yes, they got to the finals.

Brink later comes for Gramps. Believing Brink to be an ordinary stranger, the crotchety old Gramps orders Mr. Brink off the property. Pud comes out of the house and asks who the stranger was. Gramps is surprised and relieved that someone else could see the stranger; he was not merely a dream or apparition. Pud tells Gramps that when he does a good deed, he will be able to make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wishes that anyone who climbs up his apple tree will have to stay there until he permits them to climb down. Pud inadvertently tests the wish when he has trouble coming down from the tree himself, becoming free only when Gramps says he can. Pud's busybody Aunt Demetria has designs on Pud and the money left him by his parents. Gramps spends much time fending off her efforts to adopt the boy.

Basic shapes: Start drawing the basic shapes of anime eyes. Generally, anime eyes consist of an upper and lower eyelid, iris, and pupil. Create light pencil sketches and practice drawing different shapes to familiarize yourself with the style you want to achieve. c. Details and variations: Practice adding details to your anime eyes. Add reflections, different color shades, lines, and more to accentuate the expressions and emotions of the character. Experiment with various eye shapes, eyelashes, and eyebrows to create unique characters. d. Expressions: To bring your character to life, learn how to draw different expressions. This includes happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc. Study how the eyes and eyebrows change when the character expresses different emotions. e. Practice, practice, practice: The key to mastering any skill is consistent practice. Draw anime eyes whenever you can, and over time, you will notice improvement. 2. Drawing Animals: To learn how to draw animals, follow these steps: a. Study animal anatomy: Begin by researching and studying different animal anatomies. Pay attention to the proportion, skeletal structure, and details that bring uniqueness to each animal species. b. Observing real animals: To get a better understanding of the animals, observe real-life references or watch videos online. This will help you learn about their movements, postures, and expressions. c. Simplify into basic shapes: Start simplifying the animal shapes into basic forms such as circles, ovals, rectangles, and triangles. This will help you break down the complexity of animals and make them easier to draw. d. Adding details: Once you are comfortable with the basic shapes, gradually add details such as fur, scales, facial features, and textures. It is essential to be patient and practice consistently. e. Shading and lighting: Mastering shading and lighting will add depth and dimension to your animal drawings. Practice different shading techniques and study how light interacts with different types of animal surfaces. f.

It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.  Michael and Robert are two patients at a cardiology clinic. Both just received their blood test results and were told that they need to improve their cholesterol levels. They were each recommended to begin exercising regularly.

The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

He tries to move her car but he only succeeds in getting a parking fine by a police officer (James Westerfield), who doesn't believe his weird story. Roger is a fishing tools expert and shop assistant who has even written a book about the sport. He teaches Major Phipps (Roscoe Karns) how to use a rodding cane at the department store where he works in, at Abercrombie and Fitch, in the fishing sports department. Roger gives him advice which he has heard from somebody else.Roger's customers, Abigail Page (Paula Prentiss) and Isolde 'Easy' Mueller (Maria Perschy), want Roger to participate on the fishing competition in lake C..... Easy is a public relations officer, and Abigail is an important person of the community. Roger will compete against Major Phipps. However, Rock tries to get out of the idea, as he has not idea about fishing. His boss, William Cadwalader (John McGiver) pushes him to win the competition.Abigail and Easy are both interested in Roger, although they realise fast that he has no idea about fishing. They pay John Screaming Eagle (Norman Alden) not to say anything about Roger being useless with fish. John is also a small conman. He isn't unable to put up even his net. Roger's boss pushes Roger to go, so he can't say no. Both girls watch him doing stupid things, and during a lunch together they laugh about a caterpillar which fell onto his salad, and his eating it subsequently.Abby helps Roger, explaining things for him. For example, she recommends him to use a scooter, but it ends up being driven by a bear. Also, when she tries to teach him how to drive a boat to go to the location of the catch, he ends up almost drowning and inside a safety balloon-like trousers, which he doesn't recommend his boss for selling.Roger can't even swim, but Abigail is attracted to him anyway. The frist time Abigail makes him use a fishing cane, he catches a fish. Roger feels disgusted by the slimmy fish. He loses... A:","output":"Based on the provided context from the movie \\"Man's Favorite Sport?\\", it is indicated that Roger Willoughby (Rock Hudson) does not truly know how to fish. Despite being a fishing tools expert and shop assistant, as well as an author of a book about the sport, his knowledge appears to be largely theoretical or borrowed from others. He is portrayed as a character who, despite his professional facade, personally lacks practical skills and understanding required for angling. This is evident in several situations throughout the movie. For instance, his inability to erect his own net and his reactions to catching a fish underscore his lack of hands-on knowledge and experience in the field. His customers, Abigail Page and Isolde 'Easy' Mueller, realize quite soon that he lacks genuine fishing abilities, to the point of even paying another character, John Screaming Eagle, to keep Roger's ineptitude a secret. Furthermore, Roger's various attempts at fishing-related activities, such as boating and using a fishing cane, often end in disaster or comedic failure, implying his inexperience and lack of know-how. For example, when his first attempt at using a fishing cane results in catching a fish, he is not thrilled or proud but rather feels disgusted by the slimy creature. This reaction is quite contrary to what one would expect from an experienced fisherman and further emphasizes the contradiction between his professional image and his actual abilities.  Additionally, in a turn of events that blends comedy with the irony of his situation, Roger, who is expected to be a pro fisherman, can't even swim. This is a critical skill for anyone involved in water-based sports like fishing, further highlighting his lack of practical experience and ability. Lastly, his fear of water and his naive approach to dealing with unexpected circumstances indicated through scenarios such as ending up inside safety balloon-like trousers and a scooter mishap driven by a bear, show his lack of preparedness and understanding of the risks involved in the sport, making it evident that despite his job, title, and assumed expertise, Roger Willoughby does not truly know how to fish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"A: The Maratha Kingdom, also known as the Maratha Empire, was primarily located in the western and central parts of India during its peak. It was an Indian power, warrior society, and administrative confederacy that rose to prominence in the 17th century and lasted until the early 19th century. The Maratha Kingdom was founded by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in 1674. Under his leadership, the Marathas created a strong and unified kingdom by expanding their territories through conquests and strategic alliances. The heartland of the Maratha Empire was the region of present-day Maharashtra, where the majority of the Marathi-speaking population resided. In addition, it extended to various regions across India, including parts of present-day Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. At its peak, the Maratha Empire controlled a significant portion of India, dominating much of the Deccan Plateau, and exerting influence even beyond its core territories. The empire reached its zenith during the rule of Peshwa Bajirao I, as the Marathas expanded their influence over a vast geographical area, including the northern Indian subcontinent and the southward regions of the Malabar coast and Tamil Nadu. However, over the course of several decades, the Maratha Kingdom faced numerous challenges, such as internal conflicts, power struggles among various factions, and the growing influence of the British East India Company. A series of Anglo-Maratha Wars fought between the British and the Marathas ultimately led to the gradual decline of the Maratha Empire. In 1818, following the Third Anglo-Maratha War, the Maratha Empire was finally dissolved, and most of its territories were annexed by the British Empire. However, some parts remained under Maratha rule as smaller, independent princely states that were integrated into British India. In conclusion, the Maratha Kingdom was primarily located in the western and central parts of India, with the core region being the modern-day state of Maharashtra. Throughout its history, the empire expanded and controlled various territories across the Indian subcontinent, leaving a lasting impact on the region's culture, history, and administration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There’s no one perfect way to deliver a compliment. The important thing is to sound like you really mean what you say, so that your compliment isn’t taken the wrong way. Since there’s a certain brand of meanness that involves tossing out fake compliments, you want to make sure the person you’re complimenting knows you’re being serious.  Make sure the person can hear you clearly, so it doesn’t sound like you’re saying something under your breath. Read the situation and don’t compliment someone if it could be construed as insincere. For example, if your new classmate walks in wearing a skirt with lots of wild colors, and everyone’s looking, you might not want to draw attention to her in front of people who may not like the skirt as much as you. , but don’t laugh. It’s always a nice idea to give a compliment with a smile, though you can also deliver it with a serious and sincere expression. However, if you laugh while you’re complimenting someone, he or she might not know whether you’re serious. You might appear to be joking, which can ruin the whole effect. Try not to laugh while you’re complimenting someone unless the quality you appreciate has something to do with the person’s humor. It’s an easy way to show that you mean what you say. Making eye contact is a form of nonverbal communication that helps people understand each other better. If you look down or look away, you’ll appear to be less sincere than if you make eye contact while you’re talking. Do your best to say it like you mean it, and not in a weird tone that could be taken the wrong way. The best compliments leave no room for misunderstandings. The recipient knows that you mean what you say, and he or she comes away from the conversation feeling good about it. It sounds pretty simple, but it’s common for compliments to carry hidden meanings. For example,  If you sound a little sarcastic, the person might think you’re making fun of him or her. It’s also possible to come off sounding jealous of the person you’re complimenting. Make sure you don’t seem angry or envious. Summary:","output":"Delivering a genuine and effective compliment depends on various factors, including tone, body language, and the situation itself. To ensure your compliment is well-received and sincere, speak clearly and avoid sounding condescending or insincere. Timing and context are important, as complimenting someone in an inappropriate situation may appear fake. Refrain from laughing while offering a compliment, as it could be interpreted as mockery. Make eye contact to reinforce sincerity, and be careful with your tone to avoid sounding sarcastic or jealous.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Electricity is a physical phenomenon associated with the presence of electric charge. Although initially considered a phenomenon separate to magnetism, since the development of Maxwell's Equations both are recognized as part of a single phenomenon:electromagnetism. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others. In addition, electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies.  - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\".  - The term export means shipping in the goods and services out of the jurisdiction of a country. The seller of such goods and services is referred to as an \\"exporter\\" and is based in the country of export whereas the overseas based buyer is referred to as an \\"importer\\". In international trade, \\"exports\\" refers to selling goods and services produced in the home country to other markets.  - Lightning is a sudden electrostatic discharge that occurs during an electrical storm. This discharge occurs between electrically charged regions of a cloud (called intra-cloud lightning or IC), between two clouds (CC lightning), or between a cloud and the ground (CG lightning). The charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves through this discharge referred to as a \\"strike\\" if it hits an object on the ground, and a flash, if it occurs within a cloud. Lightning causes light in the form of plasma, and sound in the form of thunder. Lightning may be seen and not heard when it occurs at a distance too great for the sound to carry as far as the light from the strike or flash.  - An economy (From Greek   \\"household\\" and o  \\"manage\\") is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and consumption of goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use and management of resources'. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency, but monetary transactions are only a small part of the economic domain.  - The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the United States federal government, tasked with gathering, processing and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT). As one of the principal members of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet.  - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking.  - ALMANAC is the name of a major breast cancer trial. The acronym stands for \\"Axillary Lymphatic Mapping Against Nodal Axillary Clearance.\\" This major randomized trial performed in several centres in the UK produced clear evidence that sentinel node biopsy (SNB), used to stage axillary spread of disease, can be used with low failed localization and false negative rates, provided both radioisotope and blue dye are used to locate the sentinel nodes.  - The World Factbook (also known as the CIA World Factbook) is a reference resource produced by the Central Intelligence Agency with almanac-style information about the countries of the world. The official print version is available from the National Technical Information Service and the Government Printing Office. Other companiessuch as Skyhorse Publishingalso print a paper edition. \\"The Factbook\\" is available in the form of a website that is partially updated every week. It is also available for download for use off-line. It provides a two- to three-page summary of the demographics, geography, communications, government, economy, and military of each of 267 international entities including U.S.-recognized countries, dependencies, and other areas in the world.  - This is a list of countries by electricity exports mostly based on The World Factbook .  - Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel and unlike attract. An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C). In electrical engineering, it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and, in chemistry, it is common to use the elementary charge (\\"e\\") as a unit. The symbol \\"Q\\" often denotes charge. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that don't require consideration of quantum effects.  - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules.  - The world is the planet Earth and all life upon it, including human civilization. In a philosophical context, the world is the whole of the physical Universe, or an ontological world. In a theological context, the \\"world\\" is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred. The \\"end of the world\\" refers to scenarios of the final end of human history, often in religious contexts.  - Skyhorse Publishing, Inc. is an American independent book publishing company founded in 2006.

After the August missile strikes, diplomatic options to press the Taliban seemed no more promising than military options. The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the  Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up  Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on  Bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to  Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel  Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained. Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib. The United States never obtained this access. An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \\"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the  Bin Laden family.\\" One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000. During these trips the NSC, Treasury, and intelligence representatives spoke with Saudi officials, and later interviewed members of the  Bin Laden family, about Usama's inheritance.

Movie plot title: Melancholia Movie plot: The film begins with an introductory sequence involving the main characters and images from space and introducing many of the film's visual leitmotifs. These are virtually still images revealing the key elements of the film: Justine (Kirsten Dunst) the bride in deep melancholy with birds falling behind her; of a lawn with trees and a sundial with two different shadows; Pieter Breughel's Hunters in the Snow (often used as interpretation of an idealised nostalgia) the non existent 19th hole (limbo) and the Black Horse collapsing catastrophically in slow motion (id/ego battle); Justine as a bride being swept along by a river; and her being held back by her wedding dress; and finally Justine and her nephew building their magic cave before the earth crashes into Melancholia becoming one. The film continues in two parts.Part One: \\"Justine\\" is of an ideal and perfect wedding that sweeps bride Justine along and which clashes with Justines fragile world.This act begins with an clumsy, oversized wedding vehicle unable to negotiate a curve in the road.Newlyweds Justine and Michael (Alexander Skarsgård) arrive two hours late to their own reception at the family estate where Justine's sister Claire and her husband John reside. Justine happens to notice a particularly bright red star in the twilight sky which John identifies as Antares.During the course of the wedding we realise that each of the characters represent a metaphor. These metaphors are developed during the night of the wedding reception. Her brother-in-law, John, represents sacrifice (cost of the wedding) and social conformity.

Question: Which rift ultimately led to the creation of the Detroit People Mover? Context: In November 1973, the city elected Coleman Young as its first black mayor. After taking office, Young emphasized increasing racial diversity in the police department. Young also worked to improve Detroit's transportation system, but tension between Young and his suburban counterparts over regional matters was problematic throughout his mayoral term. In 1976, the federal government offered 600 million for building a regional rapid transit system, under a single regional authority. But the inability of Detroit and its suburban neighbors to solve conflicts over transit planning resulted in the region losing the majority of funding for rapid transit. Following the failure to reach an agreement over the larger system, the City moved forward with construction of the elevated downtown circulator portion of the system, which became known as the Detroit People Mover.

Let's begin! Sometimes, our mommies and daddies face problems when they deal with banks or credit card companies. They might be unhappy with the service they get or find mistakes in their account. When this happens, they need to express their feelings, so they make a \\"complaint\\" (which is like telling someone they did something wrong). But you know what? Sometimes, even after making a complaint, the problems don't get fixed, and mommies and daddies still feel unhappy. This is when they share their complaints with a special group called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB is like a superhero who helps people with money problems by listening to their complaints and making sure the companies that handle our money treat us fairly. Now, there is some exciting news! These superheroes are planning to share the details of the complaints they receive with everyone. This means that when mommies and daddies check the internet, they can see what problems other families had when they used these money-handling companies. But why is this important? Well, when our parents can see these complaints, it helps them make better choices about which company to trust with their money. With more people knowing about the bad things some companies do, those companies will try harder to be good and fix their mistakes. It's a lot like how we behave when our teacher is watching us during school-time, right? So, the CFPB's decision to go public with financial complaints is pretty cool! It's going to help everyone, including our mommies and daddies, make better choices and protect their hard-earned money. And that's the story of how details of people's financial complaints are going to be shared with everyone. Remember, kids, it's important to share when something isn't right so that it can be fixed, and we can all learn from it!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It is available as either for download or in streaming, as opposed to first airing on broadcast or cable television. The format can be used as a preview, a promotion, as part of a collection of shorts, or a commercial. A webisode may or may not have been broadcast on TV. What defines it is its online distribution on the web, or through video-sharing web sites such as Vimeo or YouTube. While there is no set standard for length, most webisodes are relatively short, ranging from 315 minutes in length. It is a single web episode, but collectively is part of a web series, a form called web television that characteristically features a dramatic, serial storyline, where the primary method of viewership is streaming online over the Internet. The term \\"webisode\\" (a portmanteau formed from the words 'web' and 'episode') was first introduced in the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2009.  - Adult Swim is a programming block of the American cable network Cartoon Network that operates at night from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., Eastern and Pacific Time. It is programmed by Williams Street Productions, a subsidiary of Turner, which also developed two prior television programming blocks seen on Cartoon Network: Toonami (which later became a block on Adult Swim in 2012) and Miguzi. The name comes from a phrase used by public swimming pools in the United States to label designated times when children are restricted from using the facilities in favor of adults.  - CBS (an initialism of the network's former name, the Columbia Broadcasting System) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is a flagship property of CBS Corporation. The company is headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City with major production facilities and operations in New York City (at the CBS Broadcast Center) and Los Angeles (at CBS Television City and the CBS Studio Center).  - Worst Week is an American sitcom which originally aired on CBS from September 22, 2008 to June 6, 2009. The series was based on the British sitcom \\"The Worst Week of My Life\\". The show was adapted for American audiences by Fox under the title \\"Worst Week of My Life\\", but a series failed to materialize after the pilot was filmed.  - Childrens Hospital (originally titled Children's Hospital as webisodes) is a satirical American comedy television series and web series that parodies the medical drama genre, created by and starring actor/comedian Rob Corddry. The series began on the web on TheWB.com with ten episodes, roughly five minutes in length, all of which premiered on December 8, 2008. Adult Swim picked up the rights to the show in 2009 and began airing episodes in 2010.  - Cartoon Network is an American basic cable and satellite television channel that operates daily from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM (ET/PT) and is owned by Time Warner through the Turner Broadcasting System subsidiary. It was launched on October 1, 1992.   - A medical drama is a television program in which events center upon a hospital, an ambulance staff, or any medical environment and most medical episodes are one hour long and set in a hospital. Most current medical dramatic programming go beyond the events pertaining to the characters' jobs and portray some aspects of their personal lives. A typical medical drama might have a storyline in which two doctors fall in love. Communications theorist Marshall McLuhan, in his on the nature of media, predicted success for this particular genre on TV because the medium \\"creates an obsession with bodily welfare\\".   - Toonami is a brand name geared towards action-oriented programming, primarily consisting of American animation and Japanese anime. Originally an afternoon and evening block on Cartoon Network and ended on September 20, 2008, it is now (as of May 18, 2012) a late Saturday night adult-orientated animation block on Adult Swim. The brand was created by Sean Akins and Jason DeMarco and produced by Williams Street. The name is a portmanteau of the words \\"cartoon\\" and \\"tsunami\\", suggesting a \\"tidal wave\\" of animated shows.  - The Worst Week of My Life is a British television sitcom, first broadcast on BBC One between March and April 2004. A second series was aired between November and December 2005 and a three-part Christmas special, \\"The Worst Christmas of My Life\\" was shown during December 2006. It was written by Mark Bussell and Justin Sbresni.  - A web series is a series of scripted or non-scripted videos, generally in episodic form, released on the Internet and part of the web television medium, which first emerged in the late 1990s and become more prominent in the early 2000s (decade). A single instance of a web series program can be called an episode or \\"webisode\\", however the latter term is not often used.

The plates are back by the group Sons of Confederate Veterans. Opponents of the plates say they represent racism and hate. Carter's opponent, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal, also says he won't get rid of the plates. Article:","output":"Title: Debate Surrounds Specialty Plates Featuring the Confederate Flag In recent news, Jason Carter, a prominent political figure, has voiced his support for specialty vehicle plates that feature the Confederate Flag. This move comes as a response to the opposition surrounding the plates, which many argue embody racism and hate due to the historical significance of the flag. The specialty plates are backed by the group Sons of Confederate Veterans, whose mission is to preserve the history and legacy of Confederate soldiers. According to Carter, people have the right to express themselves through the display of these plates, which is an essential aspect of free speech. Despite Carter's support, his opponent, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal, has taken a different stance. Deal has stated that he does not intend to eradicate the plates, but he has refused to endorse them. Those against the Confederate Flag specialty plates argue that the flag's historical associations with slavery, racial oppression, and white supremacy make it an inappropriate symbol for public display. Furthermore, they maintain that presenting such a controversial emblem on state-sponsored vehicle plates can be seen as the government endorsing divisive and discriminatory beliefs.  On the other hand, supporters of the plates, like Jason Carter, contend that residents should be allowed to express their heritage and individual perspectives, which may not necessarily align with the commonly associated negative connotations of the Confederate Flag. The debate spotlighting the Confederate Flag specialty plates raises key questions about the balance between freedom of expression and the values symbolized by historic icons. As the nation struggles to reconcile its past with the pursuit of a more inclusive future, this discussion highlights the complexities that surround our understanding of history and the significance of the symbols we choose to represent it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: If you’ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you’re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. how long the problem lasted: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - 150 years - 250 years - 200 years A:","output":"200 years"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: WASHINGTON —Mitt Romney blasted GOP frontrunner Donald Trump in a colorful attack on Thursday, calling the businessman a \\"fraud\\" and warning that a Trump presidency could lead to the demise of democracy in America. But don't count on Romney's speech to slow down the Trump Train. Part of Trump's appeal to his supporters is that he doesn't come from the GOP establishment that Romney is part of, and consequently, Romney's words carry little weight with those disaffected voters. \\"I think it will have a negligible effect,\\" said Guy Harrison, a national Republican strategist unaffiliated with any candidate remaining in the field. Romney and the failures of the establishment elites paved the way for @realDonaldTrump. — Andrea Tantaros (@AndreaTantaros) March 3, 2016 Romney, a former business executive who ran unsuccessfully as the Republican candidate in 2012, went after Trump's business record — \\"A business genius he is not,\\" Romney said — and questioned Trump's intelligence, saying Trump is \\"very, very not smart.\\" But such attacks may not do much to stop Trump. \\"Donald trump is a big middle finger to the system,\\" said Jason Roe, a California Republican and Rubio backer. \\"The frustrating part about dealing with him is that, when you expose him, it doesn’t seem to matter to some of his supporters.\\" In fact, Roe said, attacks on Trump can have the opposite effect among some of his supporters who \\"think that if all these people hate him, and are attacking him, and don’t want him, then he might be the right guy.\\" Left to challenge Trump for the candidacy is Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich. Romney didn't endorse any of the remaining candidates but simply urged voters to back whichever one has the best shot of defeating Trump in the primary states that have yet to vote, saying \\"one of these men should be our nominee.\\" What Romney is proposing is a risky strategy that might end up with neither of the four candidates getting enough delegates by the Republican convention in Cleveland in July. Republican candidates need 1,237 delegates to clinch the nomination. However, according to FiveThirtyEight estimates, Trump could reach that goal by June. If none of the candidate gets enough delegates, it will spark a brokered convention — an almost unprecedented and likely messy event in which Republican Party officials would have to select the party's nominee. What is striking is that Mitt Romney just endorsed the anyone-but-Trump strategy, which leads to a contested convention — Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) March 3, 2016 And even Romney himself seemed to acknowledge that his broadside won't be enough to stop Trump from winning in the traditional primary process. \\"The rules of political history have pretty much all been shredded during this campaign,\\" Romney said.

One evening there was a big dance at the hospital. Most of the doctors and nurses would be there, but of course somebody had to be left to look after the sick children, and Joan was not of the lucky ones. She liked dancing very much, so when she had to start work that evening while her friends were getting ready to go to the dance, she felt very sorry for herself. She went to each sick child one after another and said good-night, until she came to one little boy, Dick. Dick was only eleven years old, but he had a very serious illness and couldn't move most parts of his body except his hands. Joan knew Dick would never get any better, but the little boy was always happy and always thinking about other people instead of himself. Dick knew that Joan loved dancing.

Article: Apollo 11, carrying Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin and Michael Collins, was launched on 16 July, 1969. Five days later they stepped down onto the moon. Neil Armstrong On the way there: Of all the wonderful views we had, the most impressive to me was on the way to the Moon when we flew through its shadow. We were still thousands of miles away, but close enough so that the Moon almost filled our window. The moon appeared blue-grey. It seemed almost as if it were showing us its roundness, its similarity in shape to our Earth, in a sort of welcome. I was sure it would be a hospitable  host. It had been waiting for its first visitors for a long time. After touch down: The sky is black, you know. It's a very dark sky, but it still seemed more like daylight than darkness as we looked out the window. It's a very strange thing but the surface looked very warm and inviting. It seemed to be tan . It's hard to explain that, because later when I held the material in my hand, it wasn't tan at all. It was black, grey and so on. Edwin Aldrin On the Moon: The blue color of my boots has completely disappeared now into this soil--still don't know what color to describe this other than grayish  cocoa.

Jews of any non-Ashkenazi background, including Mizrahi, Yemenite, Kurdish and others who have no connection with the Iberian Peninsula, have similarly come to be lumped together as Sephardic. Jews of mixed background are increasingly common, partly because of intermarriage between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi, and partly because many do not see such historic markers as relevant to their life experiences as Jews.\\".

She tried again. \\"Bad weather for the time of year,\\" she said. The old woman nodded. No matter what the young woman said, the hitchhiker   gave no answer except for a nod of the head. Then the young woman noticed the hitchhiker's hands, which were large and hairy. Suddenly she realized the hitchhiker was in fact a man! She stopped the car. \\"There is something wrong with the car,\\" she said, \\"Would you mind getting off and helping me?\\" The hitchhiker nodded and opened the door.

Instead of directly confronting the hitchhiker, she came up with a clever plan to get him to leave the car voluntarily. She told him that there was something wrong with the car and asked if he would mind getting out to help her fix it. The hitchhiker agreed and exited the car, at which point the young woman quickly drove away, leaving him behind. Only after she had escaped and reached the safety of the next village did the young woman discover the gun inside the hitchhiker's handbag. While the presence of the gun may have ultimately justified her decision to ask the hitchhiker to leave the car, she was not aware of it at the time she made the request.

Her words: „It doesn‘t matter where and with who, al long as we celebrate together.“  Fast forward end of November my boyfriend tells me that his friends invited us to spend new Year together again. My boyfriend tells them that my bf wanted to spend it with us so our friend says she can come too and is more than welcome.  I reach out to her and ask her if it would be okay for her. We would be like ten persons and she knew three of them. She says she dont know because she dont know any of them. I tell her i was always at her partys no matter how many people i know or not. I was there to spend time with her, but i also told her if she doesn‘t want, we can tell them no and we will spend the eve toghether without my boyfriends friends.  I don‘t get an anwer for weeks. On Christmas i text her and wish her and her family a merry christmas. I just get a: you too.  Last week his friends told us they were going shopping for nye and if we wanted to party with them, we should join in so we can split costs. As my friend dont gave a answer for three weeks my boyfriend accepted and we stayed the night by his friends.  Even if i didnt do anything wrong in my eyes i think she is mad at me. I invited her the last two times to spend time with me and my friends and she twice told me she has to work but i think it was an excuse both times because our friends have kids. I didnt get a happy new year message from her even when she was online. Was i the asshole?

The best friend initially expressed a desire to spend NYE with the author, stating that it didn't matter where or with whom they celebrated. 2. The author tried to include the best friend by asking her if she would be comfortable joining them at the NYE party with the boyfriend's friends (giving her the option to say no, and they could make alternative plans together). 3. The best friend did not give a clear answer for weeks, leaving the author in an uncertain position. 4. The author and her boyfriend eventually decided to join the party, as the best friend had not provided a response during that time. 5. While the best friend might be upset, she had multiple opportunities to express her concerns, and the author was willing to accommodate her preferences. Based on these points, it can be concluded that OTHER (the best friend) is wrong in this situation, as she did not communicate her preferences clearly and left the author in an uncertain position despite their efforts to include her.

From the premise given, we can gather various pieces of information that align with the hypothesis. Let's break down the premise and draw the connections to the hypothesis. Premise: 1. Two boys are standing in the middle of the street. 2. The one with black shorts is standing back, clapping his hands together. 3. The other boy, dressed in gray, is running forward. From the available information given in the premise, we can reliably deduce that the hypothesis is accurate. Here is the reason why: Hypothesis: There are two boys standing on the road. The premise clearly states that there are two boys involved in the scenario. Additionally, it provides further information regarding their actions and their clothing, which does not contradict or conflict with the main statement contained in the hypothesis. Given the description, the hypothesis only focuses on the existence of two boys on the road, which is explicitly mentioned in the premise. Therefore, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis, which suggests the presence of two boys on the street, is also accurate and true. However, it's important to note that there might be some supplementary contextual details that could impact the conclusion, such as the boys' age, their relationship to each other, or specific cultural aspects regarding standing or playing in the street. Nevertheless, these variables do not directly interfere with the validity of the hypothesis. Thus, based on the premise provided, we can reasonably conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. There are two boys standing (or in one case, running) on the road, and the description of their actions and outfits validates this statement to be accurate and consistent with the information given."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sparky never asked a classmate to go out in high school. He was too afraid of being refused. However, one thing was important to Sparky - drawing. He was proud of his artwork. Of course, no one else appreciated it. In his senior year of high school, he sent some cartoons to the editors of the Yearbook. Although the cartoons were turned down, Sparky was so confident about his ability that he decided to become an artist. After completing high school, he wrote a letter to Walt Disney Studios. He was told to send some samples of his artwork, and the subject for a cartoon was suggested. Sparky spent a great deal of time on it. Finally, the reply came from Disney Studios. He had been rejected once again. Another loss for the loser. So Sparky decided to write his own autobiography in cartoons. He described his childhood - a little boy loser and underachiever. The cartoon character would soon become famous worldwide. For Sparky, the boy who had little success in school and whose work was rejected again and again was Charles Schulz.

However, the usage of the word \\"love\\" generally conveys a positive meaning. In this context, it seems to suggest some form of appreciation or admiration towards an American director. The phrase \\"in years\\" possibly implies that the person is looking forward to an event or product by the said director after a considerable amount of time has passed.

I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now?

Answer: Title: Underwhelming performance for a gaming emulator Review: I recently downloaded the org.ppsspp.ppsspp app and, as someone who has tried various gaming emulators, I must say it falls quite short of my expectations. After testing it out for a week, I decided to give it a 2-star rating (1 being the lowest, and 5 being the highest). Here's why: 1. Performance: I encountered multiple lags and stutters during my game sessions, which made it difficult to fully enjoy the titles I played. In comparison to other emulators, the org.ppsspp.ppsspp app seems to struggle with handling resource-intensive games, which is quite disappointing. 2. User Interface: The interface is not very intuitive or user-friendly, as it took me some time to navigate through the options and settings. A more streamlined design could have made the experience smoother for new users like myself. 3. Compatibility: While the app claims to support a vast range of games, I found that it was incompatible with some of my favorite titles. Since compatibility is a crucial element for gaming emulators, the app loses points in this department. 4. Ads and Pop-ups: Experiencing ads and pop-ups during my gaming sessions was a major letdown, as it disrupted my engagement and took away from the immersive experience. In conclusion, the org.ppsspp.ppsspp app could be greatly improved by addressing these issues. I hope that the developers invest time in enhancing the app's performance, compatibility, and user experience, making it a more reliable and enjoyable gaming emulator."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Krones -  Krones AG is a German packaging and bottling machine manufacturer.

Mining engineer Mike Lambert takes a temporary job driving a truck.  When the brakes fail while coming down a steep highway, he steers his way through a small town and is lucky to just dent the pickup of Jeff Cunningham.  Jeff demands Mike's employer pay for the damage, but the man refuses. Mike pays him himself. Later, the police find Mike in a bar and arrest him for reckless driving and having an expired license.  A total stranger, barmaid Paula Craig, pays his 50 fine. When Mike gets drunk, Paula quits her job and finds him a hotel room. Then she meets Steve Price and tells him, \\"I found him\\", a stranger with the same height and build as Steve. The next day, Mike goes looking for a job. The clerk at the assay office puts him in touch with Jeff, a prospector who has found a rich vein in an old, abandoned silver mine.

Pick from:  (A). yes;  (B). it is not possible to tell;  (C). no;","output":"(C). No The sentence, \\"A dark-haired man on a bucking bronco,\\" implies that the bronco is in action as it is bucking. Bucking is a term used to describe a particular movement made by an animal, typically a horse or a bronco. In this case, the bronco is attempting to unseat the rider (the dark-haired man) by moving violently and unpredictably.  Thus, the statement \\"The bronco isn't moving\\" is not true in this situation. From the given information, we can surmise that the bronco is, in fact, moving because it is described as \\"bucking.\\" This movement is characterized by the bronco jumping or leaping into the air with an arched back and failing front legs before landing on all four legs. Therefore, we can confidently answer (C). No, the bronco is not stationary and the sentence, \\"The bronco isn't moving,\\" is not true in the context of the initial sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Worse than simply being denied admission ,the school didn't reply to her at all.It wasn't a matter of her school records,but of her skin color:Wallsis African American,and in those days,that fact alone closed a lot of doors. \\"I was sad and I was hurt,\\"Walls toldABCNews.\\"I did not expect the skin color would affect my application.I thought I could go to university like other students.\\" Four years later,the government declared that all schools should not discriminate against African Americans-- but it was too late for Walls.She'd moved on with her life, becoming a wife and a mother,and working as an elevator operator.She retired last year,at the age of 77. She stayed quiet about the unfairness she'd faced in Missouri State.Her son,Terry,went through school records and found that she'd been the first black student to ever apply to the college.Today,four percent of the Southwest Missouri State College body is African American--including Terry. Although it's too late for Missouri State to change the past,the school is awarding Walls with an honorary degree from the school.While she knows it's too late for herto change the course of her own life with the degree,it's a chance for her to show her family that Missouri State has changed in the last 60 years,and there's not a single door closed to them anymore.

However, it is known that Terry did attend and presumably graduated from Southwest Missouri State College, the same institution that his mother, Mary Jean Price Walls, was not able to attend due to racial discrimination. Interestingly, Terry was instrumental in uncovering the historical significance of his mother's application when he searched through school records and discovered that she had been the first black student to apply to the college. However, the article does not specify if Terry's admission to the college occurred as a direct result of his mother's previous application.

Even though Deanna Durbin was younger than the 21 year old Hayley Mills while playing the doting daughter(s) roles, Durbin looks much older, as in adult. And so do all of her so-called siblings.  And this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film.

Answer this question: who plays snape in the harry potter movies??","output":"Alan Rickman, a highly-regarded English actor, played the role of Severus Snape in the Harry Potter movies. Born on February 21, 1946, in Acton, London, Rickman had a successful career in film, television, and stage productions before taking on the iconic role of Snape. The character of Severus Snape, created by author J.K. Rowling, is a complex and enigmatic figure. Throughout the book series and film adaptations, Snape initially appears as an antagonist, serving as the Potions Master and later the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. However, it becomes evident that his true loyalties are genuinely complex, leading to a significant revelation in the final installment of the series. Rickman brilliantly portrayed the nuances of Snape's character, showcasing his harsh and cold demeanor while also hinting at the underlying vulnerability and hidden motives. His performance earned him praise from critics and fans alike, solidifying his place as one of the most memorable characters in the entire Harry Potter universe. Throughout the eight films, Rickman's portrayal of Snape displayed steadfast dedication to protecting Harry and his friends, even though it often involved making difficult and morally ambiguous decisions. Before his role in Harry Potter, Alan Rickman had an extensive career that included notable performances such as Hans Gruber in Die Hard (1988), the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991), and Colonel Brandon in Sense and Sensibility (1995). His commanding screen presence and deep, velvety voice made him a natural fit for playing antagonistic roles as well as those with a sense of gravitas. Sadly, Alan Rickman passed away on January 14, 2016, after a battle with pancreatic cancer. His legacy as an actor and his portrayal of Severus Snape live on, captivating generations of Harry Potter fans and admirers of his incredible talent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the information you found on Google is not the correct answer to your question. The statement you found is about the BC Lions, a team in the Canadian Football League (CFL), and their home stadium, BC Place. It does not address the age requirement for playing professional football in the Canadian league. To answer your original question, there is no specific age requirement to play professional football in the Canadian Football League (CFL). However, most CFL players are usually at least 18 years old, as this is the age they graduate from high school and become eligible for college or university sports programs. A majority of CFL players are recruited from college or university football teams, where they have gained valuable experience and exposure to professional scouts. Typically, players in their early-to-mid twenties begin playing in the CFL after completing their college or university eligibility. While age is not a specific requirement to play in the CFL, the league does have certain eligibility rules and regulations that players must meet. These can include citizenship requirements and the level of football experience. Players must also undergo a physical evaluation and meet certain standards of athletic ability, as well as demonstrate the necessary knowledge of the sport, tactics, and strategies used in professional football. Additionally, players who wish to be drafted or signed by a CFL team must enter the CFL Draft, which occurs annually and is open to eligible Canadian and international players. The draft process involves interviews, physical testing, and evaluations to ensure that players are prepared to compete in the league. In summary, there is no specific age requirement to play professional football in the Canadian Football League. However, most players tend to be at least 18 years old and are typically in their early-to-mid twenties when they begin their careers in the CFL.

In a democratic system, legislation is passed through extensive discussions and negotiations among all the parties involved, including the multiple political parties represented in the parliament. It seems, according to the representatives of these parliamentary political parties, that significant discussions have not yet taken place regarding the formation of the new cabinet. These representatives imply that the proposed composition of the new cabinet has not been properly examined and debated so far, leaving many questions unanswered and issues unresolved. This could be due to a variety of reasons.  Perhaps there hasn't been enough time allocated for these discussions to take place, or perhaps there are disagreements or disputes between the parties that are preventing progress. It's also possible that some parties are not fully engaged in the process, or are not satisfied with the current proposals for the cabinet's composition. Cabinet formation is a critical process in a parliamentary democracy. It involves the appointment of individuals to the executive branch of government, typically including the Prime Minister and other senior political figures who are responsible for running the country. The composition of the cabinet can influence a wide range of policy areas and can significantly affect the government's direction and performance. Therefore, it's crucial that all parties, especially those represented in parliament, are thoroughly involved in discussions about the formation of the new cabinet. It's essential for the viability and effectiveness of the new government that these negotiations are carried out in a fair, transparent, and comprehensive manner. In order for this to happen, there needs to be sufficient time and space for proper debate and negotiation, with all relevant stakeholders having a chance to voice their views and concerns. Only then can a cabinet be formed that is representative of the different political parties in the parliament and capable of governing effectively and efficiently.

Xander wanted to help, so he decided to be a hero and do something. To save the girl, Xander pushed her up, above the water, so she could breathe and not be in danger anymore.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.\\"?

According to the text, Jesuit Father Ippolito Desideri was in Tibet from 1716 to 1721. During this period, it is stated that Desideri developed a deep understanding of Tibetan culture, language, and Buddhism, indicating that he spent a significant amount of time immersed in Tibetan society. Further information on the other individuals and events mentioned in the text includes references to various Capuchins who also spent time in Tibet within the years of 1707-1711, 1716-1733, and 1741-1745. While it should be noted that this was a different time frame than Desideri's period in Tibet, this adds context to the continuous presence of Christian missionaries in the region during the 18th century. Additionally, the text notes that some Tibetan monarchs and their courts, along with the lamas of the Karmapa sect, used Christianity as a strategic tool to counterbalance the influence of the Gelugpa sect within the 17th century. The text's timeline concludes with 1745, the year when all missionaries were expelled from Tibet at the insistence of the lama. This narrates the culmination of over a century of complex interplays between Buddhism and Christianity within the Tibetan political and religious landscape, with Father Ippolito Desideri's stay being a significant part of this intricate history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Secretariat Is Syndicated For Record 6.08‐Million MIAMI, Feb. 26 (AP)—Secretariat, the 1972 horse of the year, has been syndicated for a record sum of 6.08‐million, the man handling the transaction said today. “There are a few people left we are still talking to about the other shares,” said Seth Hancock. “But the syndication is near completion. Each share will sell for 190,000.” Mrs. John Tweedy, owner of 3‐year‐old Secretariat, will retain four of the 32 shares, he said. Final arrangements were still being made on disposition of the other 28 shares, said Hancock, president of Claiborne Farms in Paris, Ky. The syndication price surpasses the previous high of 5.44‐million fora Nijinsky in 1970. Other high figures were 5‐million for Vaguely Noble and 4.8‐million for Buckpasser. “Mrs. Tweedy will receive all the money he wins this year,” said Hancock. “And Secretariat will be retired to stud by December first at the latest. He wouldn't have been retired that early if Mr. Chenery had lived. But Mrs. Tweedy has to satisfy the tax people.” Mrs. Tweedy reportecily was forced to syndicate the colt because of taxes imposed on the estate of her father, C. T. Chenery, who owned Meadow Stables. Secretarist will make his first start in the seven‐furlong Bay Shore Stakes at Aqueduct on March 17, according to Mrs. Tweedy and her trainer, Lucien Laurin. After that it will be the Gotham at one mile on April 7, also at Aqueduct. Laurin said they won't be keeping the colt in Florida for the Ihtcheson at Gulfstream Park “because the races are too far apart. It doesn't fit into the pattern.” Secretariat's third race will be either the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct on April 21 or the Blue Grass at Keeneland five days later. “We're still uncle. tided about that one,” Mrs. Tweedy said. The son of Bold Ruler earned 456,404 during the 1972 season. In his debut on July 4, he wes impeded in the stretch and finished fourth.

We have the equation: 5*l + 35 = -23 + 13 First, we can simplify the equation by adding the numbers on the right side: -23 + 13 equals -10. So the equation becomes: 5*l + 35 = -10 Now, we want to get 'l' by itself. We can do this by moving the \\"+35\\" to the other side. To do that, we'll subtract 35 from both sides: 5*l + 35 - 35 = -10 - 35 5*l = -45 (because 35-35 is 0, and -10 - 35 equals -45) Next, we need to get 'l' by itself. Right now, we have 5 multiplied by 'l' (5*l). So we need to do the opposite, which is to divide it by 5: 5*l / 5 = -45 / 5 l = -9 (because -45 divided by 5 equals -9) So, the answer is l = -9."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The renowned artist is scheduled to face a pretrial hearing on September 4th, after being accused by model-actress Daphne Joy of causing damage to her property and harming her physically.  Step 1: Present the rapper's upcoming court date. The rapper, widely known as 50 Cent, is set to appear in court next month for a pretrial hearing that's scheduled for September 4th.

It's impossible to say. c). No. The answer is:","output":"c). No. Pascal's Law, also known as Pascal's Principle or the Principle of Transmission of Fluid-Pressure, was not invented by Earl. It was established by the French mathematician Blaise Pascal in 1647-48. The principle states that a pressure change occurring anywhere in a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid such that the same change occurs everywhere. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) was a prominent French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher who made significant contributions to various fields, including the study of fluids, geometry, probability theory, as well as philosophy and theology. Pascal's law is one of the fundamental principles of modern fluid mechanics, with numerous practical applications in hydraulics and fluid power systems. Pascal's law is derived from the fact that the pressure exerted on a fluid in a confined space is evenly distributed in all directions. Consequently, if any external force is applied to the fluid, the increase or decrease in pressure will propagate uniformly through the fluid. This principle is the foundation of hydraulic systems and devices like hydraulic presses, jacks, and brakes, which take advantage of the even transmission of force to produce the desired pressure output. It is important to clarify that the term \\"invented\\" is not accurate when referring to scientific laws or principles, as these laws describe natural phenomena that exist regardless of human intervention or understanding. Instead, the term \\"established\\" or \\"discovered\\" would be more appropriate when discussing the contributions of scientists like Pascal.

Q:The answer to the question: Who were the Germans intending to blame the assassination attempt on? is inside the article: In 1942, Nazi Germany attempts to bring neutral Turkey into the war on its side by staging an assassination attempt on Franz von Papen, its own ambassador to the country. Much to the annoyance of Colonel Robinson, von Papen survives and the Russians that his agent provocateur was trying to frame have solid alibis, forcing him to turn to another scheme to inflame Turkey's traditional rivalry with Russia.  Meanwhile, American machinery salesman Joe Barton boards the Baghdad-Istanbul Express train at Aleppo and is attracted to another passenger, Ana Remzi. She is worried about being searched by customs agents once they reach the Turkish border; she asks Joe to hold on to an envelope containing some securities, all that remains of her inheritance. Joe obliges, but when he later examines the envelope, he finds maps of Turkey with writing on them. When they stop in Ankara, he goes to her hotel to return her property, only to find she has been fatally wounded. He hides when someone else approaches the room. He watches unobserved as Soviet spy Nikolai Zaleshoff searches the dead woman's luggage. Then, Joe exits through the window. Leaving the scene, he is seen by Tamara Zaleshoff, Nikolai's sister and partner in espionage. The Turkish police take Joe in for questioning, only it turns out that they are German agents. They take him to their leader, Colonel Robinson. Robinson wants the maps. Joe refuses to cooperate, and is taken away to be interrogated by Mailler.

The bus to work is making a strange, loud, thumping sound, but the driver keeps motoring along. There's an unmistakable smell of smoke coming from the restaurant kitchen, but the waiters and waitresses continue taking orders as if nothing is amiss. There is lightning in the sky above the outdoor field of a sporting event and warning sirens can be heard from somewhere in town, but the officials allow the contest to play on. The packaged meat looks a little funny, but the sell-by date is current, and the supermarket has it out on prominent display. \\"They must know what they're doing, right?\\" We tend to take it on faith that they -- whoever the amorphous \\"they\\" may be -- are on the case and full of expertise and wisdom, ever on the lookout for any threats to the well-being of those who are counting on them. So when there are signs that mistakes have slipped past inspectors, past engineers, past control towers -- signs that, for all the double-checking, perhaps a little triple- or quadruple-checking may have been called for -- people pause to consider if the safeguards assumed to be constantly in place are really so fail-safe.

Food-product recalls around the nation have brought worries to consumers used to taking home products assuming they are safe. In Idaho and Washington, state health departments directed people not to eat raw clover sprouts produced by Evergreen Fresh Sprouts after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cited seven confirmed and three likely cases of E. coli infection. Nearly 15,000 pounds of hummus and dip products were voluntarily recalled by Lansal Inc. because of possible bacterial contamination flagged by the Texas Department of Health. Merchants in Missouri and Illinois were returning bulk and packaged walnuts to Sherman Produce, which issued a recall as a precautionary measure against possible listeria. And the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced that 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products were being recalled because of possible E. coli contamination. In the world of automobiles, General Motors signaled to Barclays Capital analysts that it may continue with recalls into the middle of the summer. GM, so far this year, has called in almost 14 million vehicles in the U.S., in 29 separate recalls -- which constitutes more vehicles recalled than the total of what GM has sold domestically in the last five years. The Federal Aviation Administration was looking into a near miss between two passenger jets in the skies near George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston earlier this month.

Most of the time, things go just fine. But when stories like these appear in the news in a single week, there is the impulse to wonder just what else is perhaps being missed. And to reflect upon just how many times each day we depend on precision and diligence that, without knowing exactly who is responsible for it, we presume is there. In truth, people reluctantly understand that the idea of endless layers of perfectionist platoons of unblinking and errorless industrial inspectors, while something to be aimed for, is probably a pipe dream. Consumers know that their own common sense, and personal scrutiny of what they buy, is their best protection. Yet there are many areas in which the customer cannot be expected to be an expert, which is why the relentlessness and rigor of professional inspectors and regulators is so essential. The old joke is that the ultimate act of faith in one's fellow man is opening the door to take a box of pizza from the delivery guy, and then eating it. But each time you step into a high-rise elevator and count on all the mechanisms that hold it in the air being up to standards; each time you get a prescription filled and count on the pharmacist dispensing the correct medication into the bottle; each time you watch your child climb onto a purposely scary amusement park ride and count on someone having made certain every rail at every turn is intact and tight and correctly angled; each time you blithely drive through a green-light signal at a busy intersection and count on the light for the perpendicular street being red just like it's supposed to be; each time you start to count backward from 100 as the anesthesiologist begins to administer the first drops of the dose before you drift off. ... each time, you are, of necessity, relying on the conscientiousness, thoroughness, and devotion to detail of strangers. There's a whole lot that, without stopping too often to ruminate over it, we assure ourselves is being done correctly by people we will never meet. Thinking too much about that, especially after a week like the one just past, could drive us nuts. And after all, they must know that they're doing. Right? Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses the phrase \\"They must know what they're doing, right?\\" and how it is often used to express doubts about those who are in charge. The author highlights a series of events that have called into question the effectiveness of quality assurance processes and in-house inspection in various industries, such as food recalls, automobile issues, and near-miss incidents in aviation. The article emphasizes that consumers, although they cannot be experts in every field, rely on the precision and diligence of inspectors and regulators to ensure that products and services are safe and reliable. It suggests that the idea of endless layers of perfection and errorless inspectors might be a pipe dream, but it is still a situation that should be aimed for."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the premise does not provide any information about the inclusion or exclusion of records generated by psychiatrists. The hypothesis states that \\"The law states that records generated by psychiatrists are covered.\\" To accurately determine the validity of this hypothesis, you would need more information about the scope of the law that has not been provided in the premise.

Choices:  - loss of oxygen - blisters - ascending - vertigo - getting a snack  The rationale to choose \\"ascending\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The correct answer to this question is \\"ascending,\\" as it directly contrasts with James's preference for going down. The rationale behind this choice is manifold, considering several factors related to his understanding of climbing, the various challenges presented by each option, and the nature of James's character. First and foremost, as mentioned in the question, James loved going down. This statement implies that he found descending to be more enjoyable or easier than the other components of climbing. Therefore, it would make sense that his least favorite aspect of climbing would be its polar opposite, which in this case is \\"ascending.\\" Choosing \\"ascending\\" as the answer aligns with James's own preferences, and it accentuates the contrast between his love for descending and his disdain for climbing upwards. Second, examining the other options helps further support the reasoning behind choosing \\"ascending\\" as the answer. \\"Loss of oxygen,\\" \\"blisters,\\" and \\"vertigo\\" are all potential physical challenges or consequences of climbing, but they do not speak directly to James's experience or preferences. These options may be considered worse aspects for some climbers, but the information provided in the question does not specify whether or not James encounters these issues himself. Thus, these choices are not as directly related to his stated preference for going down. \\"Getting a snack\\" is an activity that is not directly related to the act of climbing, nor does it inherently imply a negative or challenging aspect of the experience. Therefore, it does not seem relevant in determining the worst part of climbing for James. Lastly, considering James as a character, his preference for descending may indicate that he values the feeling of accomplishment that comes with reaching the bottom after a challenging climb or the sense of relief that comes with overcoming gravity and no longer having to exert physical effort in an upward direction. Ascending, on the other hand, requires a significant amount of physical exertion, time, and focus, which could be seen as the worst part of climbing for someone who values the downhill journey more. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"ascending\\" as the answer to the question lies in its direct opposition to James's love for going down, the lack of relevance or relation to his preferences in the other options, and the potential implications it has on his character and values. Given these factors, it seems reasonable to determine that the worst part of climbing for James is, indeed, ascending."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His two older brothers, Geoffrey and Randy, are mostly disobliging. One night, the three boys are left alone when their mother visits relatives, so they decide to visit a local circus for a night of amusement, despite Casey's uncontrollable coulrophobia. Meanwhile, the local state insane asylum has sent a majority of the hospital's inmates to the carnival for therapy, but three psychotic mental patients break away from the group and kill three clowns, taking their makeup and costumes. While at the circus, Casey innocently visits a fortune teller despite Randy's better judgment. The fortune teller reveals to Casey that his life line has been cut short, and says to him: \\"Beware, beware, in the darkest of dark /though the flesh is young and the hearts are strong /precious life cannot be long /when darkest death has left its mark.\\" As the boys return from the circus, a shaken Casey thinks his nightmare is over, but it has only just begun. When the clowns target their home, Casey is forced to face his fears once and for all. Casey and his brothers are locked inside their isolated farmhouse and the power is turned off. Casey attempts to call the police, but because Casey says that the \\"clowns from the circus are trying to get him\\", the police officers assume that Casey's fear of clowns caused him to have a realistic nightmare. The officers tell Casey that everything will be fine if he goes back to sleep, and hangs up. Randy mockingly dresses up as a clown, disbelieving of Casey's claims that clowns are inside the house. His plan to jump out at Geoffrey and Casey is cut short after he is stabbed by one of the clowns.

One of the largest draws for the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is the 20 consecutive evenings of rodeo and concert, held in NRG Stadium. Tickets are relatively inexpensive, averaging about 29 in 2016, and also grant admission to the livestock show and fairgrounds. More than 43,000 season tickets are sold every year, with the remaining seats 30,000 seats available for individual-show sale. Members of the HLSR are given an opportunity to buy individual tickets before the general public.  RodeoHouston is run independently of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). It offers one of the largest prize purses in North America, over 2 million, but the winnings do not count towards the competitors' qualification for the PRCA National Finals Rodeo. RodeoHouston is an invitational, featuring 280 of the top professional cowboys. They compete in a playoff format, with the ultimate champion in each event earning 50,000. On the final evening, the rodeo hosts the Cinch SuperShootout. Champions from each of the top 10 rodeos in North America are invited to compete as teams in a subset of rodeo events. The finals and the SuperShoot are televised on Fox Sports.  After the professional rodeo concludes, children are given an opportunity to compete. Each evening, 30 high school students from across the state compete in the calf scramble. They are given the opportunity to chase down (on foot) and catch one of 15 calves, put a halter on them, and drag them back to the center of the stadium. Winners are given money to purchase their own heifer or steer to show the following year. Immediately following the calf scramble is mutton busting. Five- and six-year-olds wearing protective gear try to ride a sheep across a portion of the arena. On the last night of the rodeo, the winners from each of the previous evenings compete again to see who will become grand champion.  A rotating stage is then brought into the arena for the nightly concert. The majority of evenings are performances by country music singers, although several nights are dedicated to pop or rock music. The annual Tejano music night generally draws the largest crowds. The winner of the annual Mariachi Invitational competition is invited to perform onstage with the Tejano acts. Answer this question \\"What else can they do at the rodeo and concert\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"At the rodeo and concert, they can also attend the livestock show and fairgrounds, watch children compete in the calf scramble and mutton busting, and enjoy the annual Tejano music night featuring the winner of the Mariachi Invitational competition performing onstage with Tejano acts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: suppose Less ice crystals collide with each other happens, how will it affect More ice crystals will get heavy and fall.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If less ice crystals collide with each other, the effect on more ice crystals getting heavy and falling would be lesser as well. This is because the process of ice crystals colliding, sticking together, and growing in size is necessary for them to eventually become too heavy to remain in the air and fall as snowflakes.  In the scenario you presented, where fewer ice crystals collide with each other, there would be a reduction in the growth of larger ice crystals and snowflakes. As a result, there would be fewer large and heavy snowflakes formed, which in turn would decrease the number of ice crystals that would become too heavy to remain in the air. This ultimately leads to less ice crystals falling to the ground as snow. In conclusion, if less ice crystals collide with each other, it has a lesser effect on more ice crystals getting heavy and falling to the ground as snow. This alteration in the process disrupts the natural progression of ice crystals turning into snowflakes and accumulating the necessary weight to fall out of the air, leading to a decrease in overall snowfall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The single, released in late July, was a number-one hit in the United States, and became a big international seller. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 3 song for 1967 (the other two were #2 \\"The Letter\\" by the Box Tops and #1 \\"To Sir With Love\\" by Lulu). The song is ranked #412 on Rolling Stone's list of \\"the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\" and at #144 in Pitchfork's 200 Best Songs of the 1960s. The song is a first-person narrative to \\"sparse\\"  musical accompaniment. It reveals a tale, mostly in the form of brief dialog extracts by the narrator's family at dinnertime, on the day that a local boy - and apparently friend of the narrator - jumped to his death from a nearby bridge. Throughout the song, the suicide and other tragedies are contrasted against the banality of everyday routine and polite conversation. The final verse conveys the quick passage of events and other deaths in a year's time.  The song begins with the narrator, her brother and her father returning, after agricultural morning chores, to the family house for dinner (on June 3). After cautioning them about tracking in dirt, \\"Mama\\" says that she \\"got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge\\" that \\"Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\".  At the dinner table, the narrator's father appears unmoved and almost dismissive; he comments that \\"Billie Joe never had a lick o' [meaning, any] sense\\", and asks for the biscuits to be passed to him, and comments that he has \\"five more acres in the lower forty\\" to plow. Her brother seems somewhat taken aback (\\"I saw him at the sawmill yesterday ... And now you tell me Billie Joe has jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\"), but follows the comment by asking for a second slice of pie. He recalls a prank that he and his friends played on the narrator, and that he saw her and Billie Joe talking after church a few days previously.  The only person who seems genuinely upset is the narrator. Her mother - who eventually notices the narrator's abrupt and complete change of mood at the news - seems unable to realize she is affected by the news (\\"Child, what's happened to your appetite? I been cookin' all mornin' and you haven't touched a single bite\\"). She shares other news instead, that a local preacher visited earlier in the day, and almost as an aside, that the preacher had mentioned seeing Billie Joe and a girl who looked very much like the narrator herself \\"throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\" - the object they were throwing is not identified. But again, the narrator's mother fails to connect this in any way to her daughter's emotional distress.  In the song's final verse, a year has passed, and brought more harm and pain. The narrator's brother has married Becky Thompson, but they have moved away to another town (\\"bought a store in Tupelo\\"). Their father died from an unspecified viral infection, and their mother has been depressed and despondent, and \\"doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything\\". The narrator is also affected by the malaise; the main change she describes in her own life, is that she often visits Choctaw Ridge and picks flowers there to drop from the Tallahatchie Bridge into the murky waters of the river where Billy Joe jumped to his death.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What does her mother do?","output":"Her mother cooks for the family and shares news with them during dinner.

Five style lessons learned from Coachella 2016 Coachella is a good barometer of style. On the basic level of “what the super rich kids are wearing now” but also as a measure of how catwalk styles have been absorbed by the mainstream. Here are five style lessons we’ve learned from the first weekend. Deep in the heart of the arid Colorado desert, the practical concerns of Coachella are multiple. Not getting dust in your face and not letting your hair go all “Monica from Friends” are chief among them. The bandana – with its associations of the wild, wild west and hip hop (most recently as a key part of Ty Dollar ign’s wardrobe) – has been used as both on a practical level (it pulls back your hair) and as a stylish accessory. Seen on Victoria’s Secret Taylor Hill, Hailey Baldwin and Leonardo DiCaprio. Taylor Swift’s morphing into style maven has been gradual; but this month’s Vogue spread sees it peak with her stepping into high couture wear, in Vetements’ foil dress and boots. So we thought we should really take her advice. Already nicknaming the festival “bleachella” (her own and Kylie Jenner’s peach hair come to mind, taking a cue from Palace), she cutely asked on her Instagram: “I feel like maybe chokers are the new flower crowns?” Yes, Taylor, they are. Rayanne Graff’s favourite accessory has already been on the catwalk at London fashion week (there was a visual shout out to Anne Boleyn at the Topshop Unique collection) and it feels like the new way to signal an alt direction in a normal, smart-casual outfit. Rock bores like myself like to yammer on about how people should not be seen in band T-shirts that they don’t have personalised tattoos of. But the vintage tee has moved on. Sure, it still telegraphs an element of pop culture nous in the wearer but in fashion terms, it’s a nod to an era when the shape of the rock band T-shirt was a classic, loose and baggy shape. To wit: at Coachella, Kanye West wore a Pink Floyd T-shirt and Joey Bada wore a Tupac All Eyez On Me tee. The humble cap is a stalwart of men’s wardrobes. It’s a multipurpose item: as a cloak of invisibility (it covers up multiple hair crimes), a sun visor and, semantically, it suggests a streak of carefree and youthfulness.

Classic rock band T-shirts made a comeback, no longer needing to be specific to the wearer's musical taste in order to represent a nod to the era. Men's caps, or \\"dad caps,\\" have become a symbol of youthfulness and carefree style, as seen on Leonardo DiCaprio.

Born on August 7, 1960, in New York City, David Duchovny started his acting career with a series of small roles in both television and film. However, his breakthrough role came as FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder, who investigated unsolved paranormal and extraterrestrial cases alongside his partner, Special Agent Dana Scully, played by Gillian Anderson. Fox Mulder is a complex character with a strong, almost obsessive, drive to uncover the truth behind mysterious phenomena that are often dismissed or ignored by the government and mainstream science. As Mulder strives to vindicate his sister's mysterious disappearance, which he believes was an alien abduction, he and Scully unravel a myriad of enigmas that challenge conventional understanding and invite viewers to question the nature of truth and reality. Duchovny's portrayal of Mulder was widely praised, earning him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series Drama in 1997, as well as multiple nominations for Primetime Emmy Awards and Screen Actors Guild Awards. The X-Files, with Duchovny's performance as Mulder alongside Gillian Anderson's Scully, became a cult phenomenon and went on to influence numerous other television series, films, and popular culture references.

Neilston Community Council forms the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. It is one of ten community councils of the East Renfrewshire council area. East Renfrewshire Council, the unitary local authority for Neilston, is based at Giffnock, close to the border with the City of Glasgow, and is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice, while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The territory of what became Neilston anciently formed part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. It has lain within the county boundaries of Renfrewshire from a very early time. Neilston emerged as a parish and administrative unit in 1170, and was for many years under the lordship of the Mures of Caldwell whose tombs are at the parish church. The parish was 8 miles (13 km) in length and by from 2 miles (3 km) to 4 miles (6 km) in breadth, encompassing six sevenths of what is now the town of Barrhead. Neilston Parish Council, a local body with limited power, was established in 1895, following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1894, and abolished in 1930 following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929. In 1890, Neilston fell under the authority of Renfrewshire County Council, where it remained until 1975 when the county was superseded by the regional council area of Strathclyde. In 1903, Neilston was within the Paisley Small Debt Court District and Poor Combination. From 1975 to 1996, Neilston was in the Renfrew District of Strathclyde until the two-tier regions and districts of Scotland were abolished.

Summarize the following: Before you're ready to serve it, keep your champagne (and all wine) in cool-but-not-cold conditions with little direct light and very little variation in temperature. Basements that stay between 40ºF and 60ºF (4ºC-15ºC) are perfect. Horizontal storage helps prevent the wine from spoiling and allows the cork to remain moist, which will help keep the air out and keep the gas in. This is an important factor in maintaining the flavor and bubbles in your champagne. Colder champagne tastes better, but it is also less likely to bubble over when you open it. The ideal drinking temperature is between 45ºF and 48ºF (7ºC-9ºC). If you've got the time, 4 hours or more in a refrigerator will be enough to put your champagne into the proper range. The classic way to chill champagne is in an ice bucket. Champagne buckets are frequently larger than other wine chilling buckets to allow for more water and ice. You should fill the bucket with half water and half ice and let it chill for 15-20 minutes before serving.","output":"To ensure the best quality and taste of your champagne, it is crucial to store and chill it properly before serving. Optimal storage conditions include a cool, dark environment with minimal temperature fluctuations, such as a basement with temperatures ranging between 40ºF and 60ºF (4ºC-15ºC). Storing champagne bottles horizontally is recommended to keep the cork moist, thereby retaining the gas and preserving the champagne's flavor and effervescence. While colder champagne is more enjoyable and less likely to overflow upon opening, the ideal drinking temperature lies between 45ºF and 48ºF (7ºC-9ºC). To achieve this, refrigerate the champagne for at least four hours before serving. Alternatively, using a champagne bucket can be an effective and elegant way to chill the beverage. Champagne buckets are typically larger than standard wine chillers, as they accommodate more water and ice for efficient chilling. By filling the bucket with equal parts water and ice, and placing the champagne bottle inside for 15-20 minutes, you will achieve the ideal serving temperature while adding a sophisticated touch to your presentation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... Question: What does David Meyer do for a living?

Al-Ma'arri held and expressed an irreligious world view which was met with controversy, but in spite of it, he is regarded as one of the greatest classical Arabic poets. Abu al-'Ala\` was born in Ma'arra, modern Maarrat al-Nu'man, Syria, near the city of Aleppo, in December 973. At his time, the city was part of the Abbasid Caliphate, the third Islamic caliphate, and was during the Golden Age of Islam. He was a member of the Banu Sulayman, a notable family of Ma'arra, belonging to the larger Tanukh tribe. One of his ancestors was probably the first qadi of Ma'arra. The Tanukh tribe had formed part of the aristocracy in Syria for hundreds of years and some members of the Banu Sulayman had also been noted as good poets.  He lost his eyesight at the age of four due to smallpox. His later pessimism may be explained by his virtual blindness. Later in his life, he regarded himself as \\"a double prisoner\\" which referred to both this blindness and the general isolation that he felt during his life.  He started his career as a poet at an early age, at about 11 or 12 years old. He was educated at first in Ma'arra and Aleppo, later also in Antioch and other Syrian cities. Among his teachers in Aleppo were companions from the circle of Ibn Khalawayh. This grammarian and Islamic scholar had died in 980 CE when al-Ma'arri was still a child. Al-Ma'arri nevertheless laments the loss of Ibn Khalawayh in strong terms in a poem of his Risalat al-ghufran. Al-Qifti reports that when on his way to Tripoli, al-Ma'arri visited a Christian monastery near Latakia where he listened to debates about Hellenistic philosophy, which planted in him the seeds of his later scepticism and irreligiosity; but other historians such as Ibn al-Adim deny that he had been exposed to any theology other than Islamic doctrine.  In 1004-5 al-Ma'arri learned that his father had died and, in reaction, wrote an elegy where he praised his father. Years later he would travel to Baghdad where he became well received in the literary salons of the time, though he was a controversial figure. After the eighteen months in Baghdad, al-Ma'arri returned home for unknown reasons. He may have returned because his mother was ill, or he may have run out of money in Baghdad, as he refused to sell his works. He returned to his native town of Ma'arra in about 1010 and learned that his mother had died before his arrival.  He remained in Ma'arra for the rest of his life, where he opted for an ascetic lifestyle, refusing to sell his poems, living in seclusion and observing a strict vegetarian diet. His personal confinement to his house was only broken one time when violence had struck his town. Though he was confined, he lived out his later years continuing his work and collaborating with others. He enjoyed great respect and attracted many students locally, as well as actively holding correspondence with scholars abroad. Despite his intentions of living a secluded lifestyle, in his seventies, he became rich and was the most revered person in his area. Al-Ma'arri never married and died in May 1057 in his home town.

Article: Older fathers have uglier children, researchers have claimed after linking age to genetic mutations . The finding comes weeks after leading scientists reported children born to men over the age of 45 run a higher risk of having autism and mental disorders. With age, sperm -producing cells do not copy a man's DNA as effectively, leading to genetic mutations. Martin Fielder, an anthropologist  at Vienna University, told the Sunday Times: 'Every 16 years the mutation rate doubles. Other researchers found 25 mutations per sperm in a 20-year-old, but at age 40 it is 65 mutations. By 56, it doubles again. The effect is very visible - someone born to a father of 22 is already 5-10 per cent more attractive than those with a 40-year-old father and the difference grows with the age gap. In contrast, women pass on a maximum of 15 mutations to their baby, regardless of age, according to the study published in the journal Nature. Surveying a group of six men and six women, researchers showed them each 4,018 photographs of 18-20-year-old men and 4,416 of women the same age, and asked to assess their attractiveness. Those with older fathers were consistently considered less attractive. However, the children of older men, though less attractive, are likely to outlive their peers with younger fathers, it is claimed. Professor Lee Smith, a geneticist at Edinburgh University, told the Sunday Times other research found such children have longer telomeres  - the caps on the end of chromosomes --- which are associated with longer life. But the mounting research connecting parents' age with autism is cause for concern, experts warn. Autism is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone's ability to interact socially and communicate openly. In the UK, around one in 100 adults is thought to be affected by autism, mostly men, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Company X stopped taking on more debt, and decided to file for bankruptcy, while company Y, kept benefiting from the tax benefits of debt, having a lower debt level.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which company had fewer costs than benefits related to debt, company X or company Y?  Hint: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]  An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing. Answer:","output":"Company Y had fewer costs than benefits related to debt. According to the trade-off theory of capital structure, a company balances the costs and benefits of debt financing. In this case, Company X stopped taking on more debt and filed for bankruptcy, indicating that the costs of financial distress, including bankruptcy costs and non-bankruptcy costs, outweighed the tax benefits of debt for this company. On the other hand, Company Y continued to benefit from the tax advantages of debt while maintaining a lower debt level, suggesting that the benefits of debt financing surpassed the costs for Company Y. Therefore, Company Y had fewer costs associated with debt than Company X."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: The Charaka Samhita, thought to have been written between 300 and 500 AD, mentions a metal which, when oxidized, produces pushpanjan, thought to be zinc oxide. Zinc mines at Zawar, near Udaipur in India, have been active since the Mauryan period. The smelting of metallic zinc here, however, appears to have begun around the 12th century AD. One estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries. Another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period. The Rasaratna Samuccaya, written in approximately the 13th century AD, mentions two types of zinc-containing ores: one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes. Question: What are the two uses of zinc ore mentioned in the Rasaratna Samuccaya?","output":"The two uses of zinc ore mentioned in the Rasaratna Samuccaya are: 1) for metal extraction and 2) for medicinal purposes."},{"instruction":"Q:Information:  - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost.  - Gun Fight, known as Western Gun in Japan and Europe, is a 1975 arcade shooter game designed by Tomohiro Nishikado, and released by Taito in Japan and Europe and by Midway in North America. It was the first video game to depict human-to-human combat, while the Midway version was also the first video game to use a microprocessor. Following its November 1975 release in North America, it went on to sell over 8,000 arcade cabinets in the United States. It was ported to the Bally Astrocade video game console as a built-in game in 1977 as well as several home computer platforms.  - The Astrocade is a second generation home video game console and simple computer system designed by a team at Midway, at that time the videogame division of Bally. It was marketed only for a limited time before Bally decided to exit the market. The rights were later picked up by a third-party company, who re-released it and sold it until around 1984. The Astrocade is particularly notable for its very powerful graphics capabilities for the time of release, and for the difficulty in accessing those capabilities.  - Shooter games are a subgenre of action game, which often test the player's speed and reaction time. It includes many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar using some sort of weapon. Usually this weapon is a gun, or some other long-range weapon. A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition. Most commonly, the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions without the player character being killed or dying. A shooting game is a genre of video game where the player has limited spatial control of his or her character, and the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character's enemies using long-range weaponry.   - Redemption games are typically arcade games of skill that reward the player proportionally to their score in the game. The reward most often comes in the form of tickets, with more tickets being awarded for higher scores. These tickets can then be redeemed (hence the name) at a central location for prizes. The most inexpensive prizes (candy, small plastic or rubber toys) may only require a small number of tickets to acquire, while the most expensive ones (skateboards, low end electronics) may require several thousand. In general, the amount of money spent to win enough tickets for a given prize will exceed the value of the prize itself. Some redemption games such as Flamin' Finger involve elements of chance, which can be set by the operator.  - Pinball is a type of arcade game, in which points are scored by a player manipulating one or more steel balls on a play field inside a glass-covered cabinet called a pinball machine (or pinball table). The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Many modern pinball machines include a story line where the player must complete certain objectives in a certain fashion to complete the story, usually earning high scores for different methods of completing the game. Points are earned when the ball strikes different targets on the play field. A drain is situated at the bottom of the play field, partially protected by player-controlled plastic bats called flippers. A game ends after all the balls fall into the drain a certain number of times. Secondary objectives are to maximize the time spent playing (by earning \\"extra balls\\" and keeping the ball in play as long as possible) and to earn bonus games (known as \\"replays\\").  - The original console in the series was the first video game console to ship 100 million units, 9 years and 6 months after its initial launch. Its successor, the PlayStation 2, was released in 2000. The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling home console to date, having reached over 155 million units sold as of December 28, 2012. Sony's next console, the PlayStation 3, was released in 2006 and has sold over 80 million consoles worldwide as of November 2013. Sony's latest console, the PlayStation 4, was released in 2013, selling 1 million consoles in its first 24 hours on sale, becoming the fastest selling console in history.  - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.  - A merchandiser is an arcade gaming device, which features a machine that contains a display of merchandise, which can be won by playing the game. In the trade, such games are described as Skill With Prizes (SWP) games, and are a hybrid of games of skill and games of chance, with the preponderance of skill or chance differing between devices and often able to be set by the operator.  - Outlaw is a single - player arcade game by Atari Inc. , originally released in 1976 . It simulates an Old West fast draw duel between the player and the computer . Outlaw was a response to Gun Fight , released by Midway in North America the year before .  - The golden age of arcade video games was the era of greatest popularity and technological innovation for arcade video games. The exact time period is a matter of debate, but key moments include the release of \\"Space Invaders\\" in 1978 and the introduction of vector display technology in 1979. The golden age lasted until the late 1980s, when home video game consoles like the NES were introduced.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Early career. Nishikado graduated with an engineering degree from Tokyo Denki University in 1968. He joined Pacific Industries Ltd in 1969, a subsidiary of the Taito Trading Company. After working on mechanical games, in 1972, he developed \\"Elepong\\" (similar to \\"Pong\\"), one of Japan's earliest locally produced video arcade games, released in 1973. He produced over 10 video games before \\"Space Invaders\\" was released in 1978. He left Taito in 1996 to found his own company, Dreams. As of 2013, he is no longer with Dreams, and presently works for Taito as a technical advisor.  - A ball is a round object (usually spherical but sometimes ovoid) with various uses. It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch, marbles and juggling. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles.  - An amusement arcade (often referred to as \\"video arcade\\" or simply \\"arcade\\") is a venue where people play arcade games such as video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games, merchandisers (such as claw cranes), or coin-operated billiards or air hockey tables. In some countries, some types of arcades are also legally permitted to provide gambling machines such as slot machines or \\"pachinko\\" machines. Games are usually housed in cabinets. The term used for ancestors of these venues in the beginning of 20th century was penny arcades.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play.

Answer:","output":"Based on the review provided, it is evident that the customer was highly dissatisfied with the product. The title of the review, “Horrible!” clearly suggests a strong negative response to the product, indicating an unhappy customer. Illustrations of dissatisfaction can further be observed in the phrases and language used throughout the review, which are largely negative in nature. In the review, the customer's dissatisfaction arises primarily from the product not fulfilling their expectations. They purchased the product in the belief that it would be suitable for beginners learning bass, but they found their experience greatly differed from what was advertised. The reviewer found that the instructional DVD was confusing and unnecessarily fast-paced. The complexity of the lessons increased rather rapidly after simple introductions, which wasn't suitable for a beginner. The reviewer also points out that the lessons quickly escalated to playing blues riffs and complex music theory, which they found overwhelming and irrelevant to the 'beginner' designation of the product. Another point indicating dissatisfaction is the reviewer's sense of regret. They mentioned their initial instinct about exchanging the product when it arrived - reflecting their disappointment with the quality of the item upon first impression. However, they ignored this instinct, leading to their subsequently negative experience. The review ends with the customer stating that the product might end up as “garage sale fodder,” implying that they find it useless and express a lack of desire to keep it. This final statement reiterates the overall tone of negativity and disappointment in this review. Therefore, evaluating all these elements from the title of the review to the detailed points of dissatisfaction, one can conclude that the customer was undoubtedly dissatisfied with their purchase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment.  Paragraph: Sarah and Sophie are sisters living in two different cities. Sarah lives in a very rural area with hardly any air pollution. Sophie lives in a heavily industrialized urban area with many factories and people driving cars to their destinations. This all leads to Sophie's city having a large amount of pollution going into the atmosphere.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Does Sophie's city do more or less harm to the environment than Sarah's? Answer:","output":"Sophie's city does more harm to the environment than Sarah's city. This is because Sophie's city is heavily industrialized and has a large number of factories and vehicles contributing to air pollution.

Does \\"In 1763, Spain traded Florida to the Kingdom of Great Britain for control of Havana, Cuba, which had been captured by the British during the Seven Years' War.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"What did Spain trade Florida for\\"","output":"Yes, the statement \\"In 1763, Spain traded Florida to the Kingdom of Great Britain for control of Havana, Cuba, which had been captured by the British during the Seven Years' War.\\" contains the correct answer to the question, \\"What did Spain trade Florida for?\\". In this context, Spain traded Florida to the Kingdom of Great Britain in exchange for control of Havana, Cuba. To elaborate further, the mentioned event took place during the mid-18th century, a time characterized by global conflict among various European powers, including Spain, Britain, and France. The Seven Years' War (1756-1763) was a key conflict during this period, involving these powers and their respected colonies, as well as other territories worldwide. Throughout this war, major battles occurred across Europe, the Americas, West Africa, India, and the Philippines, featuring numerous naval engagements and territorial changes. One of the major events during this conflict was the capture of Havana by British forces in 1762. Havana, a vital port and a crucial trading hub in the Caribbean, had been under Spanish control for centuries and served as a significant stronghold for their transatlantic connections and commerce. Knowing the value of Havana for Spain, British forces aimed to weaken their rivals by seizing this strategic location. In August 1762, as part of a larger amphibious operation, the British successfully captured Havana following a two-month-long siege. This event severely disrupted Spanish trade in the Caribbean, causing economical turmoil and escalating tensions between the two powers. Realizing the necessity to regain control over Havana, Spain began negotiations with Britain to find a solution. This process culminated in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, which marked the official end of the Seven Years' War. Among the many territorial exchanges and agreements in this treaty was the decision that Spain would cede Florida to Britain, in return for the restoration of Havana, as well as the territory of Spanish East Florida. Consequently, the statement provided contains accurate information, as Spain traded Florida, a territory in the southeastern region of North America, to the Kingdom of Great Britain in exchange for the control of Havana, Cuba, a vital and strategic location in the Caribbean. This exchange of territories significantly affected the balance of power in the Americas and shaped the course of history in this region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: The Packers stayed undefeated after a crushing victory over the Vikings. Just 1:18 into the game Randall Cobb managed to make a punt-return TD over 80 yards to give the Packers the lead. The Vikings managed just 1 first down before the Packers defense forced them into another punt, Aaron Rodgers & co. took advantage of it and the lead went up to 14. 1:18 before the end of the first quarter the Vikings kicker Ryan Longwell missed a 52-yd field goal. The second quarter started the way the first went with a Packers score, Mason Crosby connected on a 25-yd FG. No more scoring happened in this half, Tramon Williams successfully intercepted a pass by Ponder, making it only the second highlight that quarter. The Vikings were shut down by the Packers defense by managing not to score the whole first half. At the start of the third quarter Rodgers found Jordy Nelson for a 17-yd TD pass to push the lead to 24-0. Later on, Adrian Peterson scored a TD after a 3-yd run to give Minnesota the only points in the game. The rest of the way was a one-sided affair, with the Packers scoring another three touchdowns. John Kuhn and Nelson for the second time gave Rodgers two more TD passes in this game. Rodgers watched the last 10:30 of the game from the bench, looking at his backup Matt Flynn, who did score a 3-yd run TD 4:33 before the end of the game. With this win the Packers went to 9-0 sweeping the Vikings in the season and dropping the Vikings to 2-7. Rodgers again had a good passing game with connecting on 23 of his 30 pass attempts. Nelson was next to Rodgers the player of the game with his two touchdowns. The Packers will now play home to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, while the Vikings play at home against Oakland.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"If \\"the owl isn't hungry\\" happens, it could indirectly impact the step \\"the owl locates prey with its hearing\\" in the process. When the owl is not hungry, it is less motivated to hunt for prey, affecting its overall behavior and engagement in the hunting process. The hunger level of the owl could affect the intensity and focus it puts into using its senses to locate prey. While the keen eyesight and sensitive hearing are still present, the owl's lack of hunger reduces the likelihood of it utilizing these abilities to find prey. The perturbation in this case is an indirect impact on various steps throughout the entire process as the fundamental reason for the owl engaging in its hunting behavior – its hunger – is no longer influencing its actions. So, to answer the question, the supposed perturbation in this case is indirectly impacting a step of the process. It does not directly affect the owl's ability to locate prey using its hearing but alters the circumstances in which the owl is likely to utilize that hearing to find prey."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was improvised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction. As it turned out, the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes' notice on the first hijacked plane, no advance notice on the second, no advance notice on the third, and no advance notice on the fourth. We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities. NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information, and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew. Individual FAA controllers, facility managers, and Command Center managers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert, in ground-stopping local traffic, and, ultimately, in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly. More than the actual events, inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings, raising questions about the adequacy of the response. Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military's capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources. In addition, they overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning. In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA. This statement was incorrect. There was no hijack to report at 9:16. United 93 was proceeding normally at that time. In this same public testimony, NORAD officials stated that at 9:24, NEADS received notification of the hijacking of American 77. This statement was also incorrect. The notice NEADS received at 9:24 was that American 11 had not hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington, D.C. In their testimony and in other public accounts, NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were scrambled to respond to the notifications about American 77,178 United 93, or both. These statements were incorrect as well. The fighters were scrambled because of the report that American 11 was heading south, as is clear not just from taped conversations at NEADS but also from taped conversations at FAA centers; contemporaneous logs compiled at NEADS, Continental Region headquarters, and NORAD; and other records.  Question: \\"Who needed to clarify the record of the U.S. defense of 9/11?\\" Response: \\"FAA\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct.

CHAPTER V  CASTELL'S SECRET  In John Castell's house it was the habit, as in most others in those days, for his dependents, clerks, and shopmen to eat their morning and mid-day meals with him in the hall, seated at two lower tables, all of them save Betty, his daughter's cousin and companion, who sat with them at the upper board. This morning Betty's place was empty, and presently Castell, lifting his eyes, for he was lost in thought, noted it, and asked where she might be--a question that neither Margaret nor Peter could answer.  One of the servants at the lower table, however--it was that man who had been sent to follow d'Aguilar on the previous night--said that as he came down Holborn a while before he had seen her walking with the Spanish don, a saying at which his master looked grave.  Just as they were finishing their meal, a very silent one, for none of them seemed to have anything to say, and after the servants had left the hall, Betty arrived, flushed as though with running.  \\"Where have you been that you are so late?\\" asked Castell.  \\"To seek the linen for the new sheets, but it was not ready,\\" she answered glibly. \\"The mercer kept you waiting long,\\" remarked Castell quietly. \\"Did you meet any one?\\"  \\"Only the folk in the street.\\"  \\"I will ask you no more questions, lest I should cause you to lie and bring you into sin,\\" said Castell sternly. \\"Girl, how far did you walk with the Señor d'Aguilar, and what was your business with him?\\"  Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1.

Choices:  - kitchen - tea room - china cabinet - kitchen cabinet - cup  The rationale to choose \\"china cabinet\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The china cabinet is the ideal choice for storing a saucer that you don't use but want to look at for several reasons. Let's explore these reasons in depth: 1. Aesthetic value: A china cabinet is specifically designed to showcase your finest chinaware, glassware, and other valuable collections. The saucer, being a beautiful and potentially valuable piece, would fit perfectly in such a cabinet. The glass doors and thoughtful lighting in most china cabinets help to highlight and display the items inside the cabinet, allowing you to appreciate the saucer's beauty and craftsmanship. 2. Protection: China cabinets are built to protect your delicate and valuable items from dust, dirt, and potential damage. Many cabinets have cushioned shelves and secure doors to minimize the risk of breakage, ensuring that your saucer remains in pristine condition. Unlike other storage options, a china cabinet will keep your saucer safe while still allowing you to enjoy it visually. 3. Organization: Choosing a china cabinet helps you maintain order in your living space. By designating a single, central location for your special and decorative pieces, you avoid clutter and disorganization elsewhere in your home. Additionally, since your saucer will have its own proper place, you reduce the likelihood of misplacing it. 4. Versatility: China cabinets come in various styles, sizes, and materials. This ensures that you can find the perfect cabinet to match your home decor and accommodate the saucer's size and style. Many china cabinets also have adjustable shelves, allowing for customization of the cabinet's layout to best display your unique collections. 5. Enhancing the theme: If you have a particular theme or collecting focus, a china cabinet provides a dedicated space to showcase it. Whether your theme is antique china, floral patterns, or teapots, featuring your saucer in a china cabinet alongside other related items creates a cohesive, attractive focal point in your home. While other options like kitchen cabinets or tea rooms may serve as functional storage spaces, they typically don't provide the visibility, protection, and aesthetic enhancement that a china cabinet does. Displaying your saucer in a kitchen cabinet might be a more practical choice if it were an item you used regularly; however, since your goal is to showcase the saucer without actually using it, the china cabinet is the optimal choice for both protection and display purposes. And while a cup might be a natural pairing for a saucer, the limited visibility of the saucer when paired with a cup does not allow for full admiration of the item. In conclusion, a china cabinet is the best choice for keeping a saucer you don't use but want to look at. It provides a secure, organized, and visually appealing environment for your saucer while protecting it from potential harm. Displaying your saucer in a china cabinet not only enhances your home's aesthetic appeal but also allows you to truly appreciate the beauty and craftsmanship of your special piece."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many of the world's pollution problems have been caused by the crowding of large groups of people into the cities. Supply for the needs of the people leads to further pollution by industry. If the rapid increase of world population in countries continues at the present rate, there may be much greater harm to human beings. Some scientists speak of the increase in numbers of people as \\"population pollution.\\" About 2,000 years ago, the world population was probably about 250 million. It reached a billion in 1850. By 1930 the population was two billion. It is now three and a half billion. It is expected to double by the year 2,000. If the population continues to grow at the same rate, there will be 25 billion in the world a hundred years from now. Man has been using the earth's resources more and more rapidly over the past years. Some of them are almost used up. Now many people believe that man's greatest problem is how to control the growth of the population. The material supplies in the world will be far from enough to support the human population in time to come, if the present rate of increase continues. Already there is overcrowding in many cities and starvation in some countries. Should man's population keep on growing so rapidly as before? Many people believe that human survival in the future depends on the answer to this question. Which of the following is Wrong according to the passage? A) In 1850 the world population reached a billion. B) Man must fight a battle against population pollution. C) The world's population is increasing with years. D) All of the earth's resources are gone now. The answer to this question is:","output":"D) All of the earth's resources are gone now. Step 1: Read the passage and try to understand the main points. The passage mainly discusses the rapid increase in world population, its detrimental effects, and the importance of controlling population growth. Step 2: Analyze each option to determine if the passage supports it. A) In 1850 the world population reached a billion. - The passage states, \\"It reached a billion in 1850.\\" So this statement is supported by the passage. B) Man must fight a battle against population pollution. - The passage mentions, \\"Some scientists speak of the increase in numbers of people as \\"population pollution\\".\\" This indicates there is a problem of population pollution, implicitly suggesting that man must address this issue. C) The world's population is increasing with years. - The passage provides examples of how the world population has increased over years and even predicts a possible doubling by the year 2000. Hence, this statement is supported by the passage. D) All of the earth's resources are gone now. - The passage states, \\"Man has been using the earth's resources more and more rapidly over the past years. Some of them are almost used up.\\" The statement says \\"some\\" of the resources are almost used up, but it does not claim that all resources are gone. Step 3: Choose the option that is not supported by the passage. Since option D is not supported by the passage, it is the wrong statement according to the passage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They convey the same information but use different sentence structures and slightly different phrasings. Here is a step-by-step justification of why they can be considered paraphrases: 1. Both sentences are discussing distributions in the context of one dimension. - The first sentence mentions \\"one-dimensional examples,\\" while the second sentence does not explicitly mention one dimension. However, since it lists the same distributions, which are all one-dimensional, we can infer that the second sentence is also talking about one-dimensional distributions. 2.

The overall structure and phrasing of the sentences are different, but they still convey the same core information. - The first sentence is structured as \\"One-dimensional examples include [list of distributions].\\" - The second sentence is structured as \\"Examples include [list of distributions].\\" - Both structures ultimately convey that these distributions are examples of one-dimensional distributions, even though the second sentence does not explicitly mention \\"one-dimensional.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what have parts that regenerate after bisection?\\" is \\"roots\\", given that  roots have parts that regenerate after bisection?","output":"The answer \\"roots\\" can be considered partially correct in response to the question \\"what have parts that regenerate after bisection?\\" as roots indeed possess the ability to regenerate after bisection in certain situations. However, it is essential to keep in mind that several other organisms and structures also have regenerative capabilities. Roots serve a vital role in plants by providing anchorage, absorbing water and nutrients, and storing food. Some plants have roots capable of regeneration when they are cut or damaged. For example, when roots of plants such as willow or mint are bisected, they can produce new roots and shoots from the cut sites. This ability to regenerate can depend on factors such as plant species, age, environmental conditions, and the location of the cut site on the root. However, roots are not the only structures known for regenerative capabilities after bisection. Here are some other examples: 1. Planarians: Flatworms, commonly known as planarians, are known for their extraordinary regenerative abilities. When bisected, their body parts can regenerate and form a full organism within a few days or weeks. They can even grow a new head complete with a brain and eyes. 2. Hydra: These tiny freshwater organisms belong to the phylum Cnidaria, and they have the ability to regenerate tissue rapidly. If a hydra is separated into two parts, both parts can regenerate and develop into a complete organism. 3. Axolotl: This aquatic salamander has remarkable regenerative properties. They can regenerate limbs, spinal cord, heart, and even parts of eyes and brain after injury or amputation. 4. Starfish: Known for their radiating arms, starfish can regenerate an entirely new organism from a portion of their body if a part of the central disc is attached. 5. Lizard tails: Some species of lizards, such as geckos, can regenerate their tails after they have been detached or severed. This process can take weeks to months, depending on the lizard species. 6. Liver: In humans and some other mammals, the liver can regenerate after injuries or partial removal (hepatectomy). The liver can restore its full functionality even if 70% of its mass is removed. In conclusion, although roots possess the ability to regenerate after bisection, they are not the only example of structures capable of regeneration. A more comprehensive and accurate answer to the question would be \\"roots, planarians, hydra, axolotl, starfish, lizard tails, and liver, among others.\\" Each organism and structure present unique regenerative properties, and studying these mechanisms can help us better understand the underlying biological processes and potentially develop innovative treatments for human diseases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the popular mind, the history of Hong Kong, long the entryway to China for Westerners, begins in 1841 with the British occupation of the territory. However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What was the full name of the person whose analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment? is inside the article: In recent years, several other craters of around the same age as Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20°N and 70°N. Examples include the disputed Silverpit crater in the North Sea, and the Boltysh crater in Ukraine. Both are much smaller than Chicxulub, but are likely to have been caused by objects many tens of meters across striking the Earth. This has led to the hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time. Another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger Shiva crater, though the structure's status as an impact crater is contested.The collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, giving rise to many impacts over a period of a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past. This scenario may have occurred on Earth at the end of the Cretaceous, though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 years apart.In late 2006, Ken MacLeod, a geology professor from the University of Missouri, completed an analysis of sediment below the ocean's surface, bolstering the single-impact theory. MacLeod conducted his analysis approximately 4,500 kilometres (2,800 mi) from the Chicxulub crater to control for possible changes in soil composition at the impact site, while still close enough to be affected by the impact. The analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment, which indicated there was only one impact. Multiple-impact proponents such as Gerta Keller regard the results as \\"rather hyper-inflated\\" and do not agree with the conclusion of MacLeod's analysis, arguing that there might only be gaps of hours to days between impacts in a multiple-impact scenario (cf. Shoemaker-Levy 9) which would not leave a detectable gap in deposits., can you guess it ?

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process. Speaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises. “When we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,” Pompeo said. President Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements. Pompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements. The secretary of state and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo said they are united in support of the U.S.-North Korea agreement, and in agreement on the goal of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program. After the summit,... According to the above context, answer the following question. Who did Trump meet with representing North Korea?

He is an avid reader and develops into a \\"frighteningly intelligent\\" student at University High School, where his antisocial behavior leads the administration to give him straight A's if he agrees not to return. In December 1975, at age 17, he proposes to his friend Georg Ruthenberg that they start a band, showing him potential lyrics and claiming to have a \\"five-year plan\\" inspired by the David Bowie song \\"Five Years\\". They recruit Terri Ryan, Belinda Carlisle, and Becky Barton for the group and con money for instruments. Jan Paul comes up with the name Germs, representing the germination of an idea. He sings while Georg plays guitar, Terri plays bass guitar, and Becky plays drums. The Germs play their first gig on April 16, 1977. As they are heckling the Damned outside the Whisky a Go Go, Claude \\"Kickboy Face\\" Bessy of Slash magazine suggests that they perform at an open mic across the street. The Germs give an impromptu performance of their song \\"Sex Boy\\", but do not know how to play their instruments and are heckled by the audience. Jan Paul responds by throwing flour at them and dipping the microphone in peanut butter; the band is thrown out but excited by the experience. Jan Paul comes up with pseudonyms for the members: Georg becomes Pat Smear, Terri becomes Lorna Doom, and Becky becomes Donna Rhia, while Belinda bows out of the band.

Q:Given the below context:  In 1859 Burges began work with Ambrose Poynter on the Maison Dieu, Dover, which was completed in 1861. Emulation of the original medieval style can be seen in his renovation of the grotesque animals and in the coats of arms incorporated into his new designs. Burges later designed the Council Chamber, added in 1867, and in 1881 began work on Connaught Hall in Dover, a town meeting and concert hall. The new building contained meeting rooms and mayoral and official offices. Although Burges designed the project, most of it was completed after his death by his partners, Pullan and Chapple. The listed status of the Maison Dieu was reclassified as Grade I in 2017 and Dover District Council, the building's owner, is seeking grant funding to enable a restoration, focussing on Burges's work.In 1859–60, Burges took over the restoration of Waltham Abbey from Poynter, working with Poynter's son Edward Poynter and with furniture makers Harland and Fisher. He commissioned Edward Burne-Jones of James Powell & Sons to make three stained-glass windows for the east end, representing the Tree of Jesse. The Abbey is a demonstration of Burges's skills as a restorer, with \\"a profound sensitivity towards medieval architecture.\\" Mordaunt Crook wrote of Burges's interior that, \\"it meets the Middle Ages as an equal.\\" In 1861–2, Burges was commissioned by Charles Edward Lefroy, secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons, to build All Saints Church, Fleet, as a memorial to Lefroy's wife.

So, our new equation will look like: 60 = -20*p To find out the mystery number \\"p,\\" we can think of dividing the large group of 60 friends equally among the -20 teams. To do this, we will divide 60 by -20: p = 60 / (-20) When we divide 60 by -20, we get -3.  So, the mystery number \\"p\\" is -3. This means that each of the -20 teams will have -3 players.

Côte d'Ivoire's President Laurent Gbagbo promulgated new election laws on July 14, including the creation of an independent electoral commission to oversee the presidential vote, which is slated for October 30. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? New elections in Côte d'Ivoire will take place on October 30.","output":"Based on the information provided in the given paragraph, it appears that the presidential vote, which is a part of the election process, is indeed slated for October 30. Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that the sentence \\"New elections in Côte d'Ivoire will take place on October 30\\" is true. The paragraph highlights key aspects of the electoral reform initiated by President Laurent Gbagbo. Firstly, it mentions the promulgation of new election laws on July 14. The promulgation of new laws is a significant step in the electoral process, as it ensures that the rules and regulations governing the said process are transparent, just, and up-to-date. Moreover, the introduction of new election laws demonstrates the government's commitment to adhering to democratic norms and reinforcing the credibility and legitimacy of the elections. One of the major changes in the electoral process, as mentioned in the paragraph, is the creation of an independent electoral commission. This provision paves the way for impartial and non-partisan supervision of the elections, thereby contributing to the overall fairness and integrity of the electoral process. The establishment of an independent body for overseeing the presidential vote fosters confidence and trust among the population and the competing political factions. It also helps to curtail potential allegations of misconduct, fraud or infringement and lays a solid foundation for a peaceful transition of power. The scheduled date for the presidential vote is October 30, as clearly indicated in the passage. Considering these facts, we can deduce that the elections, including the most crucial aspect, the presidential vote, are indeed slated for that date. Therefore, the statement \\"New elections in Côte d'Ivoire will take place on October 30\\" is true based on the information provided. However, it is important to note that the political context and potential unforeseen circumstances could lead to changes in the election date or the implementation of the aforementioned laws and regulations. History has shown that electoral processes can be subject to delays and challenges both in Côte d'Ivoire and elsewhere.

His work is lost , but his Historia in at least four books is quoted by Gregory of Tours . It was perhaps a continuation of the Res gestae by Ammianus Marcellinus ( which ended in 378 AD ) and dealt with events at least until the death of Valentinian II ( 392 AD ) . The work of Sulpicius Alexander as extracts in Gregory 's Decem Libri Historiarum ( II 9 ) is considered an important source in any discussion of the origin of the Frankish tribes .  - The Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA) was a U.S. nuclear thermal rocket engine development program that ran for roughly two decades. NERVA was a joint effort of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and NASA, managed by the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office (SNPO) until both the program and the office ended at the end of 1972.  - Valentinian II (371  15 May 392), was Roman Emperor from AD 375 to 392.  - Ammianus Marcellinus (born c. 325330 died c. 391400) was a Roman soldier and historian who wrote the penultimate major historical account surviving from Antiquity (preceding Procopius). His work, known as the Res Gestae, chronicled in Latin the history of Rome from the accession of the emperor Nerva in 96 to the death of Valens at the Battle of Adrianople in 378, although only the sections covering the period 353378 survive.  - St. Martin of Tours (316 or 336  8 November 397) was Bishop of Tours, whose shrine in France became a famous stopping-point for pilgrims on the road to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. He has become one of the most familiar and recognizable Christian saints, sometimes venerated as a military saint. As he was born in what is now Szombathely, Hungary, spent much of his childhood in Pavia, Italy, and lived most of his adult life in France, he is considered a spiritual bridge across Europe.  - Valentinian I (3 July 321  17 November 375), also known as Valentinian the Great, was Roman emperor from 364 to 375. Upon becoming emperor he made his brother Valens his co-emperor, giving him rule of the eastern provinces while Valentinian retained the west.  - Procopius of Caesarea (; 500  554 AD) was a prominent late antique scholar from Palaestina Prima. Accompanying the Roman general Belisarius in the wars of the Emperor Justinian, he became the principal Byzantine historian of the 6th century, writing the \\"Wars\\" (or \\"Histories\\"), the \\"Buildings of Justinian\\" and the now-celebrated (and infamous) \\"Secret History\\". He is commonly held to be the last major historian of the ancient Western world.  - The Battle of Adrianople (9 August 378), sometimes known as the Battle of Hadrianopolis, was fought between an Eastern Roman army led by the Eastern Roman Emperor Valens and Gothic rebels (largely Thervings as well as Greutungs, non-Gothic Alans, and various local rebels) led by Fritigern. The battle took place about north of Adrianople (modern Edirne in European Turkey, near the border with Greece and Bulgaria) in the Roman province of Thracia. It ended with an overwhelming victory for the Goths and the death of Emperor Valens.  - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.  - Valens (328  9 August 378), fully \\"Flavius Julius Valens Augustus\\", was Eastern Roman Emperor from 364 to 378. He was given the eastern half of the empire by his brother Valentinian I after the latter's accession to the throne. Valens, sometimes known as the Last True Roman, was defeated and killed in the Battle of Adrianople, which marked the beginning of the collapse of the decaying Western Roman Empire.  - Saint Gregory of Tours (30 November c. 538  17 November 594) was a Gallo-Roman historian and Bishop of Tours, which made him a leading prelate of Gaul. He was born Georgius Florentius, later adding the name Gregorius in honour of his maternal great-grandfather. He is the main contemporary source for Merovingian history. His most notable work was his \\"Decem Libri Historiarum\\" or \\"Ten Books of Histories,\\" better known as the \\"Historia Francorum\\" (\\"History of the Franks\\"), a title given to it by later chroniclers, but he is also known for his accounts of the miracles of saints, especially four books of the miracles of Martin of Tours. St Martin's tomb was a major draw in the 6th century, and Gregory's writings had the practical aspect of promoting this highly organized devotion.  - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire.  - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen).

Write a text based on \\"serbia-montenegro shortens obligatory military service to six months\\" Text:","output":"Title: Serbia-Montenegro Reduces Obligatory Military Service to Six Months: Implications and Motivations In a recent and significant development, the government of Serbia-Montenegro has made the decision to shorten the obligatory military service period from the previous duration of 12 months down to just six months. This move holds considerable implications, both domestically and internationally, in the realm of defense policy, fiscal allocations, and the conscription experiences of young men in the region. In this article, we aim to delve deep into the consequences of this policy change, analyze its potential benefits and drawbacks, as well as explore the possible motivations driving this decision. Factors Driving the Policy Change The adjustment in the obligatory military service period may have been influenced by a variety of factors, including the changing security landscape in Europe, economic constraints, and the demographic situation in Serbia-Montenegro. There has been a shift in focus among European defense establishments, largely emphasizing the need for a more professional and technologically advanced military force. This has led to the increasing adoption of the concept of a 'smart defense', leveraging growing technological capabilities to maximize efficiency and effectiveness. In addition to this, Serbia-Montenegro's economy has faced several challenges in recent years, leading to constraints in defense expenditure. Consequently, it has become increasingly necessary for the authorities to strike a balance between preserving the security posture of the nation while ensuring fiscal prudence. By reducing the duration of the obligatory military service, the costs associated with conscription and maintaining a large reserve force will likely be lowered. The demographic situation in Serbia-Montenegro has also created pressures on conscription policies. The region has been experiencing a decline in birth rates and an aging population. This has prompted questions about the feasibility of maintaining a large conscript-based military force. A shorter military service period might help alleviate some of these concerns by lessening the burden on young men in Serbia and Montenegro. Implications of the Policy Change The decision to reduce the obligatory military service period will likely have a range of implications for both Serbia and Montenegro. One of the notable consequences of this shift is the potential for an increase in the quality of service and training provided to conscripts. With a shorter conscription period, the focus might be on offering more intense and specialized training programs for conscripts, ultimately benefiting the armed forces by honing the skills and capabilities of their personnel. Moreover, the young men of Serbia-Montenegro, who previously would have been subjected to a year-long service, will now have six additional months to pursue personal interests such as higher education or employment opportunities. This could lead to a more educated and skilled workforce contributing to the economy's growth. On the other hand, the reduced timeframe might also have drawbacks. Some argue that a six-month conscription period may not be adequate for instilling concepts of discipline, camaraderie, and national identity in military conscripts. Additionally, the reserves could be negatively affected, with concerns that there might be reduced numbers of adequately trained military personnel available to respond to regional crises or emergencies. International Perspective From an international standpoint, Serbia-Montenegro's decision to decrease the obligatory military service period might be interpreted as a move towards modernizing their military force. Western European nations have increasingly transitioned from conscript-based militaries to professional, volunteer-based systems in recent years. As Serbia and Montenegro strive to deepen their integration with European security structures, this policy change might be seen as a step towards aligning with current European defense establishments. In conclusion, the decision to reduce the obligatory military service period in Serbia-Montenegro is a significant policy change with a multitude of implications, both advantages and disadvantages. While the motivations behind this alteration can be varied, it nonetheless highlights the dynamic nature of military planning and strategy. As Serbia-Montenegro continues to refine and modernize its defense policies, the challenges and benefits of this policy change will become increasingly apparent, shaping the future of the region's security posture and its standing on the global stage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable y on one side of the equation. In order to do this, we need to move the constant term (29107) to the other side of the equation. We do this by adding 29107 to both sides of the equation: -2136 * y - 29107 + 29107 = -106003 + 29107 This simplifies to: -2136 * y = -76896 Step 3: Solve for y by dividing both sides of the equation by -2136. y = -76896 / -2136 Step 4: Do the division to find the solution for y. y ≈ 36 So the solution is approximately y = 36."},{"instruction":"Given the following context:  Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not \\"paid her dues\\" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on Neighbours.

Background: Rockefeller was the second of six children and eldest son born in Richford, New York to con artist William Avery \\"Bill\\" Rockefeller (November 13, 1810 - May 11, 1906) and Eliza Davison (September 12, 1813 - March 28, 1889). His siblings were Lucy (1838-1878), William Jr. (1841-1922), Mary (1843-1925) and twins Franklin (Frank) (1845-1917) and Frances (1845-1847). His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a \\"botanic physician\\" and sold elixirs. Context: The strike, called in September 1913 by the United Mine Workers, over the issue of union representation, was against coal mine operators in Huerfano and Las Animas counties of southern Colorado, where the majority of CF&I's coal and coke production was located. The strike was fought vigorously by the coal mine operators association and its steering committee, which included Welborn, president of CF&I, a spokesman for the coal operators. Rockefeller's operative, Lamont Montgomery Bowers, remained in the background. Few miners actually belonged to the union or participated in the strike call, but the majority honored it. Strikebreakers (called \\"scabs\\") were threatened and sometimes attacked. Both sides purchased substantial arms and ammunition. Striking miners were forced to abandon their homes in company towns and lived in tent cities erected by the union, such as the tent city at Ludlow, a railway stop north of Trinidad.  Under the protection of the National Guard, some miners returned to work and some strikebreakers, imported from the eastern coalfields, joined them as Guard troops protecting their movements. In February 1914, a substantial portion of the troops were withdrawn, but a large contingent remained at Ludlow. On April 20, 1914, a general fire-fight occurred between strikers and troops, which was antagonized by the troops and mine guards. The camp was burned, resulting in 15 women and children, who hid in tents at the camp, being burned to death. Costs to both mine operators and the union were high. This incident brought unwanted national attention to Colorado.  Due to reduced demand for coal, resulting from an economic downturn, many of CF&I's coal mines never reopened and many men were thrown out of work. The union was forced to discontinue strike benefits in February 1915. There was destitution in the coal fields. With the help of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects.  The casualties suffered at Ludlow were successfully labeled a massacre and mobilized public opinion against the Rockefellers and the coal industry. The United States Commission on Industrial Relations conducted extensive hearings, singling out John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the Rockefellers' relationship with Bowers for special attention. Bowers was relieved of duty and Wellborn restored to control in 1915, then industrial relations improved. Rockefeller denied any responsibility and minimized the seriousness of the event. When testifying on the Ludlow Massacre, and asked what action he would have taken as Director, John D. Rockefeller stated, \\"I would have taken no action. I would have deplored the necessity which compelled the officers of the company to resort to such measures to supplement the State forces to maintain law and order.\\" Rockefeller admitted that he had made no attempt to bring the militiamen to justice. Question: What was the strike of 1913-14? Answer:","output":"The strike of 1913-14, also known as the Colorado Coalfield Strike, was a big disagreement between coal miners and the people who owned the coal mines in Colorado. The miners wanted better working conditions and to join a group called the United Mine Workers. The owners didn't want this to happen. So, the miners stopped working, and it led to a lot of tension and fights between the two sides. During one of these fights, called the Ludlow Massacre, some women and children were sadly killed in a tent city. This strike received a lot of attention, and people were very upset about what happened."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In the sentences you provided, \\"I put the cake away in the refrigerator\\". The refrigerator is being identified as a place where the cake is put away. In the next sentence, \\"It has a lot of leftovers in it\\", the pronoun \\"It\\" refers to the preceding noun, which was most recently and specifically mentioned in the previous sentence, that is \\"the refrigerator\\". This is a common instance of the use of pronouns in the English language. A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun. In this case, the pronoun \\"It\\" is used to avoid repetition of the noun \\"the refrigerator,\\" making the sentence smoother and easier to read.  Saying \\"The refrigerator has a lot of leftovers in it\\" would be just as semantically correct but for ease of conversation and fluency, we often use pronouns like 'it' to replace and reference a noun we've mentioned before.  So in summary, yes, \\"the refrigerator\\" and \\"It\\" are the same in this context.

(April 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film opens with an animated prologue revealing the origins of leprechauns, stating that they were summoned by a king to protect his gold. After the death of the king the Leprechauns returned to their places of origin, all except one (Warwick Davis) who through the ages slowly became corrupted and obsessed with the gold he still guarded. In the present, Father Jacob (Willie C. Carpenter) finds the leprechaun's gold and intends to build a youth center. Jacob manages to banish Lubdan the Leprechaun, summoning demonic hands which drag him underground, but soon after dies of injuries inflicted by the leprechaun during the fight. One year later, two friends Emily Woodrow (Tangi Miller) and Lisa Duncan (Sherrie Jackson), have their fortune told when the clairvoyant Esmeralda (Donzaleigh Abernathy) who warns them that they will attain great wealth soon, but it must be denied as it will come at a great price and summon a terrible evil. While having a barbecue at the abandoned youth center construction site with Lisa, their stoner friend Jamie Davis (Page Kennedy) and her ex-boyfriend-turned-drug dealer Rory Jackson (Laz Alonso), Emily falls through a hole and discovers the Leprechaun's gold in a tunnel where it was hidden by Father Jacob. Evenly splitting up the gold, the quartet of friends use it to fulfill their fantasies, unaware that by taking the gold they have released Lubdan the Leprechaun, who begins stalking the group (killing a guest by impaling his chest with a bong, taking one of his coins at a party held by Jamie, prompting the police to temporarily arrest him). At the salon where Emily works the Leprechaun sneaks in and, after killing a regular customer, Doria, on the massage table by breaking her neck, attacks Emily, who barely escapes and warns Rory and the recently released Jamie,...

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In a Paris theater in 1640, a play begins before a fairly full house. After a few painfully dull lines are delivered by principal actor Montfleury (Arthur Blake), a boisterous heckler in a box disrupts the proceedings. The heckler is Cyrano de Bergerac (José Ferrer), poet and supreme swordsman, who says he cannot endure the actor's bombastic style. He gives Montfleury a slow count of three to disappear before coming at him, and the actor runs away. Eventually Cyrano confronts the playwright and theater manager, insisting that the play be closed. When the manager complains that he can't afford to refund money to the audience, Cyrano throws him a bag of gold coins.Watching from another box in the theater are Cyrano's distant cousin, the beautiful Roxane (Mala Powers), with her attendant (Virginia Farmer); the Comte de Guiche (Ralph Clanton), who is Roxane's suitor; and the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), an arrogant aristocrat who is so annoyed he insults Cyrano with snide but clichéd comments about his enormous nose. This can only lead to a duel.Cyrano first mocks the vicomte's lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert might have phrased references to the giant nose, much to the amusement of the audience. Cyrano then announces he will compose a poem and recite it during the duel, which he does -- thus showing off simultaneously his skills as poet and swordsman. With the last line, he stabs his opponent, and the audience leaves.Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies, but Cyrano is unconcerned.When Le Bret presses him as to why he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw the actor making advances towards Roxane. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of being loved in return because of his deformity, his huge nose. Le Bret suggests they go out to eat, but Cyrano says he has no money left, as all he had was in the bag he threw at the theater manager -- a costly... Answer:","output":"\\"A Poet's Duel: The Daring Exploits of Cyrano de Bergerac\\" The suggested movie title, \\"A Poet's Duel: The Daring Exploits of Cyrano de Bergerac,\\" encapsulates the central themes and story elements of this adventurous and romantic tale. Set in 17th-century Paris, the film's protagonist, Cyrano de Bergerac, is a skilled poet and swordsman whose exploits revolve around his artistic talent, wit, and prowess in dueling. The first part of the title, \\"A Poet's Duel,\\" highlights the unique way in which Cyrano engages in combat with his opponents, as seen in his duel with the Vicomte de Valvert. The title not only showcases his physical skills as a swordsman but also his exceptional verbal artistry, as he astoundingly composes a poem and recites it during the duel. This clever combination of poetic and combative capabilities offers a fresh and enthralling approach to a traditional duel, making it one of the most memorable and captivating aspects of the movie. The title emphasizes this connection by placing the word \\"duel\\" beside the word \\"poet,\\" illustrating how Cyrano's poetry is just as much a weapon as his sword. The second part of the title, \\"The Daring Exploits of Cyrano de Bergerac,\\" conveys the excitement and danger that accompany Cyrano's adventures throughout the film. From his bold confrontation with the actor Montfleury and the theater manager to his battle against the snobby Vicomte de Valvert, each moment showcases Cyrano's unyielding courage, wit, and flair for the dramatic. Furthermore, this part of the title underscores the film's central character and his driving motivation: his immense love for the beautiful Roxane. This unrequited love, coupled with his insecurities about his appearance, fuels Cyrano's daring and selfless actions, providing the emotional core of the story. In conclusion, \\"A Poet's Duel: The Daring Exploits of Cyrano de Bergerac\\" is a fitting movie title that captures the essence of this extraordinary tale. By highlighting Cyrano's unique blend of poetic and combative skills, as well as his courageous and romantically driven adventures, the title promises a thrilling journey filled with action, drama, and unyielding passion for love and life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Passage: The music video for \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" was directed by Philipp Stölzl for Oil Factory Films and filmed on a London sound stage on September 23–24, 1999. Manson's android shots (the laboratory, kissing and driving scenes) were filmed on the first day, with the pyrotechnic scenes shot on the second. For her \\"death\\", Manson kissed a lookalike model. The University of London's Senate House was the exterior for the fictional New Globe Theatre. Post-production and editing were completed two weeks later.In the video (set in 1964) terrorists build an android replica of Shirley Manson, who can kill her targets with a kiss, on an unnamed Pacific island. The android is fitted with a bomb, primed before it leaves on its mission. The android makes its way to Chicago's New Globe Theater and lets itself into Shirley Manson's dressing room, killing Manson and assuming her identity to perform the coda of a song on a large steel globe. As the android and the band receive a standing ovation from the audience, the bomb counts down. Smiling, the android Manson thrusts its arms in the air; the screen blacks out as the timer reaches zero, and an explosion is heard.  Stölzl (chosen by Garbage) drew up a treatment liked by the band, but MGM and Eon (who commissioned the video) did not consider it \\"Bond enough\\". Stölzl's reworked storyboard featured Manson as an android clone who kills her human counterpart, a concept the band also liked. He provided a special-effects company with sketches of the android, and a replica was constructed with aircraft and missile parts, tubing, metal and plastic. The android was combined with Manson in post-production to show its mechanical interior. \\"It reminds me of The Man Who Knew Too Much. Some of the shots look like Stanley Kubrick\\", recalled Vig. \\"For us it was just important that the music video was also a Garbage video.\\" \\"[It's] like a mini-Bond action-packed film, where an android removes evil from the world and sacrifices herself in the process like a kamikaze warrior. That's as close as we'll ever get [to being in a Bond movie],\\" Manson later said.The video's filming was documented by a Making the Video camera crew, and premiered on MTV after the program on October 20, 1999; it debuted in the United Kingdom and on Total Request Live the following day. A version of the video featuring footage from the film was shown in some countries; to preserve the video's narrative, the film footage appeared on a split screen. \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" video was included on the film's 2000 DVD release and Garbage's 2007 greatest-hits DVD compilation, Absolute Garbage.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A man in a midlife crisis may either gain or lose a lot of weight. With that obviously comes changes in eating and exercising, too. This will seem to come on suddenly instead of a gradual weight loss or gain that most of us experience ten times over. Some men will gain a lot of weight, start binging on junk food and take up a sedentary lifestyle. Others will lose weight, lose interest in food, and even go on crash diets or excessively exercise. In certain cases, both are unhealthy. It's possible that a rogue, gray nose hair set off your man's midlife crisis. If he had this dawning revelation that he's getting old, he may start taking strides to look and stay young, ridiculous as they may be. He may try anti-aging solutions that range from a cabinet full of creams to cosmetic procedures or even plastic surgery. A change of fashion may come, too. All of a sudden it's as if he's raided your son's closet in a desperate attempt to be cool. Sounds terribly embarrassing, but it's nothing compared to plastic surgery. Often men mid-crisis see themselves and realize that they don't recognize their reflection. In their heads, they're still that gregarious 25-year-old with a full head of hair and tanned, glowing skin. One day they wake up and that hair seems to have moved to their nose and ears and that tan, glowing skin is still tan and glowing, just a few inches south.

Though there're many kinds of resources, with the fast increase of population and the increase of many more factories, the more we use, the fewer there will be left for the future. Oil is getting less and less year after year. It's said that oil can last for only 50 years. Natural gas perhaps will last about 38 years. Oil can be used in many ways and it's difficult to imagine what the modern world will be like without oil. But oil isn't easy to find and get out of the earth. Men must study the rocks. When they think the rocks in a certain place may have oil, a metal tower is built. A machine in the tower cuts a hole down into the ground. At the same time, a steel pipe is pushed down to stop the sides from falling in and to keep out water. At last if the men are right, usually the oil rushes up the sides with great force by the pressure of the gas in the top of the rock, and it rushes high into the air. If the oil catches a light, there will be a terrible fire. So a kind of cover is fixed on the top of the pipe, and the oil can run out through taps . If we are near the middle of the oil field, we can also get gas. Such gas is sent through pipes to towns far away and used in houses and factories like coal gas.

Information:  - John Henry Bonham (31 May 1948  25 September 1980) was an English drummer, musician and songwriter, best known as the drummer of Led Zeppelin. Bonham was esteemed for his speed, power, fast bass-drumming, distinctive sound, and \\"feel\\" for the groove. He is considered by some publications to be one of the greatest drummers in rock.  - The gittern was a relatively small gut strung round-backed instrument that first appears in literature and pictorial representation during the 13th century in Western Europe (Iberian Peninsula, Italy, France, England). It is usually depicted played with a quill plectrum, as we can see clearly beginning in manuscript illuminations from the thirteenth century.  It was also called the guitarra in Spain, guiterne or guiterre in France, the chitarra in Italy and quintern in Germany. A popular instrument with court musicians, minstrels, and amateurs, the gittern is considered ancestral to the modern guitar; possibly other instruments like the mandore and gallichon.  - In Through the Out Door is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, and their final album of entirely new material. It was recorded over a three-week period in November and December 1978 at ABBA's Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and released by Swan Song Records on 15 August 1979. \\"In Through the Out Door\\" was the band's eighth and final studio release to reach the top of the charts in America, and was the last released by the band before the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980.  - ABBA (stylised ) are a Swedish pop group formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982. ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 at The Dome in Brighton, UK, giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest, and are the most successful group to ever take part in the competition.  - Swan Song Records was a record label launched by the English rock band Led Zeppelin on 10 May 1974. It was overseen by Led Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant and was a vehicle for the band to promote its own products as well as sign artists who found it difficult to win contracts with other major labels. The decision to launch the label came after Led Zeppelin's five-year contract with Atlantic Records expired at the end of 1973, although Atlantic ultimately distributed the label's product.  - Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums, has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music.  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\"  - \`\` Carouselambra '' is the fifth track on Led Zeppelin 's 1979 album In Through the Out Door . The name Carouselambra is a reference to the first section of the song sounding similar to carousel music . It is the second - longest song the band recorded in the studio ( after \`\` In My Time of Dying '' ) , clocking in at more than 10 minutes in length . It 's also a very unusual song for the band , as Jimmy Page 's guitar work is pushed almost to the background , while John Paul Jones dominates with heavy use of synthesizers .  - Polar Studios was a recording studio in Stockholm, Sweden, which operated from 1978 through 2004. The studio was formed by ABBA musicians Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson and the band's manager Stig Anderson, owner of the Polar Music recording label.  - A carousel (American English: from French \\"carrousel\\" and Italian \\"carosello\\"), roundabout (British English), or merry-go-round, is an amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders. The \\"seats\\" are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts, many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping, to the accompaniment of looped circus music. This leads to one of the alternative American names, the galloper. Other popular names are jumper, horseabout and flying horses.  - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.  - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age.  - Robert Anthony Plant, (born 20 August 1948) is an English musician, singer, and songwriter best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the rock band Led Zeppelin. A powerful and wide vocal range (particularly evident in his high-pitched vocals) has given him a successful solo career spanning over 30 years. Plant is regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock and roll; he has influenced fellow rock singers such as Freddie Mercury, Axl Rose and Chris Cornell. In 2006, Heavy Metal magazine \\"Hit Parader\\" named Plant the \\"Greatest Metal Vocalist of All Time\\". In 2009, Plant was voted \\"the greatest voice in rock\\" in a poll conducted by \\"Planet Rock\\". In 2008, \\"Rolling Stone\\" editors ranked him number 15 on their list of the 100 best singers of all time. In 2011, \\"Rolling Stone\\" readers ranked Plant the greatest of all lead singers.  - American English (variously abbreviated AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), also called United States English or U.S. English, is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States. English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the common language used by the federal government, considered the \\"de facto\\" language of the country because of its widespread use. English has been given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments. As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of Puerto Rico. Under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the United States district court for the territory.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Circus music (also known as carnival music) is any sort of music that is played to accompany a circus, and also music written that emulates its general style. Popular music would also often get arranged for the circus band, as well as waltzes, foxtrots and other dances.  - James Patrick \\"Jimmy\\" Page, (born 9 January 1944) is an English musician, songwriter, and record producer who achieved international success as the guitarist and founder of the rock band Led Zeppelin.  - A Zeppelin was a type of rigid airship named after the German Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin who pioneered rigid airship development at the beginning of the 20th century. Zeppelin's notions were first formulated in 1874 and developed in detail in 1893. They were patented in Germany in 1895 and in the United States in 1899. After the outstanding success of the Zeppelin design, the word \\"zeppelin\\" came to be commonly used to refer to all rigid airships. Zeppelins were first flown commercially in 1910 by Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-AG (DELAG), the world's first airline in revenue service. By mid-1914, DELAG had carried over 10,000 fare-paying passengers on over 1,500 flights. During World War I the German military made extensive use of Zeppelins as bombers and scouts, killing over 500 people in bombing raids in Britain.

Federal Aviation Administration The FAA has been cited as an example of regulatory capture, \\"in which the airline industry openly dictates to its regulators its governing rules, arranging for not only beneficial regulation, but placing key people to head these regulators.\\" Retired NASA Office of Inspector General Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz, who used to be a Special Agent with the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Transportation and with FAA Security, is one of the most outspoken critics of FAA. Rather than commend the agency for proposing a 10.2 million fine against Southwest Airlines for its failure to conduct mandatory inspections in 2008, he was quoted as saying the following in an Associated Press story: \\"Penalties against airlines that violate FAA directives should be stiffer. At 25,000 per violation, Gutheinz said, airlines can justify rolling the dice and taking the chance on getting caught. He also said the FAA is often too quick to bend to pressure from airlines and pilots.\\" Other experts have been critical of the constraints and expectations under which the FAA is expected to operate. The dual role of encouraging aerospace travel and regulating aerospace travel are contradictory.

Article: The creative projects of World Food Program (WFP) focused on preventing hunger from taking hold in the future and breaking the cycle of hunger. Here are some of the ways in which we work to prevent hunger in the future: School Meals As well as directly addressing hunger, School Meals projects encourage families to keep their children in school and help them build better futures. If children aren't hungry they will concentrate on their lessons. With a solid education growing children have a better chance of finding their own way out of hunger. These projects benefit girls especially. For more information: www.wfp.org/schools meals. Food for Assets  WFP's Food for Assets projects provide the hungry with food to lay the foundation for a better tomorrow. When poor farmers no longer have to worry about the next meal, they have the time and energy to build irrigation  systems that can increase production. Similarly, Food for Training projects allow the poor to devote time to learning skills that will sustain  them economically in the future. For more information: www.wfp.org/food-assets. HIV/AIDS WFP uses its food rations  to reduce the blow of HIV and AIDS. The agency distributes its rations to people living with HIV and AIDS, so they can keep providing for their families for longer and have time to transfer vital knowledge and skills to the growing number of AIDS children--the next generation of food providers in developing countries. For more information: www.wfp.org/hiv-aids. Purchase for Progress WFP buys large amounts of food in developing countries. It has this purchasing power and uses it to help poor farmers contact reliable markets where they can get competitive prices for their produce.

MARION, OH (WCMH) — The Ohio Inspector General says an investigation led to the discovery by staff of two operable computers hidden in a ceiling at the Marion Correctional Institution.      Officials say the inmates were using the computers to commit crimes including tax fraud and network attacks.      According to the Ohio Inspector General staff members at the Marion Correctional Institution found two operable computers hidden in the ceiling of the prison.      After investigating, it was determined the computers were being used by an inmate to steal the identity of another inmate to submit credit card applications and commit tax fraud. The computers were also used to illicitly create security clearance passes for inmates to gain access to restricted areas and download hacking tools that could be used in network attacks.      PHOTOS: Inmates placed computers in prison ceiling to commit crimes View as list View as gallery Open Gallery      The investigation also found, through a program run by the Ohio Penal Industries, that inmates had unregulated access to computer hardware, software, and accessories.      The Ohio Inspector General office says lax inmate supervision allowed inmates the ability to build computers from parts, transport them through several prison security checks, hide them in the ceiling, run cabling, and ultimately, connect the computers to the prison’s network      The investigation has been sent to the Marion County Prosecuting Attorney and the Ohio Ethics Commission for consideration. ||||| COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Unsupervised inmates at Marion Correctional Institution used two computers hidden in the ceiling to attempt identity fraud, an investigation from the state's top watchdog found.      After finding the computers in July 2015, then-Warden Jason Bunting and other prison officials did not immediately notify the Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Ohio Inspector General, as required by state policy.      Inmates Adam Johnston and Scott Spriggs obtained the computers through a program in which inmates disassemble old computers to be recycled, according to the inspector general's investigation.      Cleveland nonprofit RET3 provided computers to Marion Correctional's Green Initiative program. Inmates were only to disassemble computers, not refurbish them.      But prison employee Carl Brady told inmates to set aside newer computers from the program to keep for the prison. Brady said Bunting had approved inmate use of software to wipe the computers' memory.      \\"I've had Jason personally tell me a couple times just -- as long as they're not getting outside the institution, I don't care,\\" Brady told investigators.      Bunting told investigators he \\"knew obviously illegal activity was going on\\" but couldn't explain why he didn't report it to state authorities. He has since resigned from Marion Correctional.      The inmates connected the computers to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction network and created passes for inmates to access restricted areas in the prison. Investigators found software, videos, pornography and articles about making homemade drugs, plastics, explosives and credit cards on the computers.      Spriggs denied involvement with the computers but told investigators it would have been possible to move them 1,000 feet within the facility without detection.      \\"... the regulars [corrections officers] are less likely to even stop you. So if it's their post they're less likely to even say a word to you,\\" Spriggs said.      Johnston used the password of a prison employee-turned-contractor, Randy Canterbury, to log onto the network. Johnston told investigators he learned it by looking over Canterbury's shoulder.      The computers gave them access to inmate records including disciplinary records, sentencing data and inmate locations. Johnston also used the computers to message other inmates and his mother, Karen Gallienne.      Johnston told investigators the computers had been in place before June 2015. He used Canterbury's log-in to obtain the Social Security Number and other personal information about another inmate. He then applied for five credit and debit cards in the inmate's name using the address of his mother's neighbor.      In addition to allowing inmates unsupervised access to computer materials and the office where the contraband computers were housed, prison officials didn't follow state policy in reporting the incident, state investigators concluded.      The computers were discovered when the prisons department IT center detected a prison computer trying to hack through proxy servers. State investigators said prison officials waited too long to report the computers and also removed them and other materials from a crime scene before state troopers could examine it.      State prisons spokeswoman JoeEllen Smith said steps have already been taken to address the investigation's findings.      \\"We will thoroughly review the reports and take any additional steps necessary to prevent these types of things from happening again,\\" Smith said in a statement. \\"It is of critical importance that we provide necessary safeguards in regards to the use of technology while still providing opportunities for offenders to participate in meaningful and rehabilitative programming.\\"      The findings were forwarded to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office and the Ohio Ethics Commission for further review.

The unsupervised inmates later hid the PCs in the ceiling of a training room.      Investigators found software, pornography and articles about making drugs and explosives on the machines.      The discovery came after IT staff flagged unusual levels of internet activity on a contractor's account.      The PCs were found in 2015 but the case has only just been made public.      A report on the incident has been published by the Ohio Inspector General's Office and forwarded to the Ohio Ethics Commission and local officials.      It describes the series of events that led to the discovery of the computers in the ceiling of a training room at Marion Correctional Institution.      Network traffic      On 3 July 2015, an email alert told IT staff that the daily internet threshold for a user account had been exceeded.      But that account belonged to a contractor who was not scheduled to work on the day in question.      The mysterious user had tried to access certain file-sharing sites but had been blocked by the prison network's proxy server, which denies access to certain online content.      The user \\"then spent the next three hours straight trying to find sites that would circumvent the proxy and our policies,\\" an email to IT employees noted.      After investigating the source of the network traffic, a member of the IT staff and two other inmates who were with him found a network cable leading up into the ceiling.      \\"When I removed the ceiling tiles I found two PCs hidden in the ceiling on two pieces of plywood,\\" the staff member wrote in an incident report.      Image copyright Ohio Inspector General Image caption A rogue PC on the network was connected to port 16      One of the inmates who had set up the computers later described how he had used components from other PCs that were part of a computer waste recycling programme.      He then plugged his machine into an internet connection device in the prison, according to the Inspector General's report.      \\"And then... bam, I'm on the network,\\" he told investigators.      A trove of data was discovered on the machines, including records of passes being issued for inmates so they could access various parts of the prison.      Forensic analysis of the hard drives also found pornography, articles about making drugs, explosives and credit cards.

During Prohibition, Laurel and Hardy are sent to prison for concocting and selling their own home brew. They are put in a cell with \\"Tiger\\" Long, the roughest, toughest and meanest of all inmates. Stan has a loose tooth that causes him to emit a razzberry at the end of every sentence; the inmate interprets this as a coolly defiant attitude and is impressed—nobody else ever stood up to him like that. He and Stan become fast friends. Laurel & Hardy are assigned to attend prison school with James Finlayson being the teacher. The vaudeville routine that follows ends with a spitball meant for somebody else hitting the teacher in the face and the boys wind up in solitary. There is a sustained scene of the bleak cells with the unseen boys conversing through the walls. After a prison break, the boys escape to a cotton plantation, where they hide out undetected, in blackface. The boys sing \\"Lazy Moon\\".

Obviously , Target is pretty corporate so the slacks and tie came out . What can be said about the Target hiring process ?","output":"Based on the information provided, the Target hiring process can be summarized into the following steps, and I will justify each step during the analysis. 1. Initial contact by HR: In this step, the HR (Human Resources) department of Target reaches out to potential candidates to gauge their interest in a job opportunity. This step is necessary because it introduces candidates to the company and its culture and helps in pre-screening them based on their qualifications or experience. 2. Short phone interview: After the initial contact, a short phone interview is conducted by HR, usually to assess the candidate's communication skills, interest in the job, and basic understanding of the position applied for. This step is crucial because it helps narrow down the list of potential candidates for an in-person interview and saves time and resources for both the company and the candidates. 3. In-person interview scheduling: Once the candidate passes the phone interview, a more formal in-person interview is scheduled. This allows Target and the candidate to coordinate a suitable time and date when they can meet and have a more extensive conversation about the position and the candidate's qualifications. This step is essential because it moves the hiring process forward and solidifies the candidate's intention and commitment towards the job opportunity. 4. Half-day interview process: During the in-person interview, the candidate spends half a day going through various interview sessions. This could include one-on-one interviews, group interviews, or even job simulation exercises or tests, depending on the position applied for. This step is important as it provides a more in-depth evaluation of the candidate's skills, personality, and fit within the company. 5. Dress code and corporate culture: As mentioned, Target has a corporate atmosphere, and dressing appropriately for the in-person interview (i.e., slacks and tie) demonstrates the candidate's professionalism and adaptability to the company's culture. This is a crucial aspect because it shows the candidate's ability to fit in and conform to the established norms and expectations of the corporate environment. In conclusion, the Target hiring process is structured and methodical, ensuring a thorough evaluation of candidates and their ability to fit into the company culture and perform the job effectively. Each step in the process serves a specific purpose and helps in making informed decisions about hiring the most suitable candidates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school.

Context: There were serious scientific objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Karl von Nägeli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.

He attended Brookline High School (a 1991 graduate), and played baseball for the Brookline High School Warriors, but dreamed of working for the Red Sox. Epstein attended Yale University where he lived at Jonathan Edwards College. He served as sports editor of the Yale Daily News. Context: On October 12, 2011, Epstein agreed to a five-year contract worth 18.5 million with the Chicago Cubs. On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Epstein's official title with the Cubs would be President and that San Diego Padres general manager Jed Hoyer would take the GM position with the Cubs.  On October 23, 2011, he took out a full-page ad in The Boston Globe, thanking Red Sox fans and the team's owners for their support. Two days later, the Cubs officially introduced Epstein as president of baseball operations. While the Red Sox were already a winning team when Epstein was hired in Boston, the Cubs were coming off a fifth-place finish in the National League Central and had a depleted farm system. The Cubs finished in last place in the National League Central for the first three years of Epstein's presidency, as the focus was to acquire young talent rather than maximize short-term competitiveness. After a three-year, top-to-bottom rebuild, the Cubs clinched a playoff berth in 2015; their first since 2008. They advanced to the National League Championship Series, where they were swept by the New York Mets.  Epstein re-signed with the club on September 28, 2016, with a five-year contract estimated to be worth up to 25million. The Cubs finished the 2016 season with a 103-58 record, the best in the MLB and their best since the 1910 season. In the playoffs, they defeated the San Francisco Giants in the NLDS. The Cubs proceeded to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS, winning their first pennant since the 1945 season and sending them to the World Series. The Cubs then won their first World Series championship since 1908, when they defeated the Cleveland Indians in 7 games, breaking the so-called \\"Curse of the Billy Goat\\".

Question: When ice melts, it becomes a Answer:","output":"When ice melts, it becomes a substance known as water. This transformation occurs due to a change in the physical state of the substance, from solid to liquid. To better understand this process, let's delve deeper into the science behind it and explore the properties of ice and water, as well as the factors influencing this change. Ice is the solid form of water and is formed when water molecules slow down and lose energy due to decreased temperature. The lowered energy causes the molecules to arrange themselves in a distinct pattern called a crystal lattice structure. This organization allows ice to have unique properties, such as being less dense than water, which causes it to float on the surface. When the temperature rises above the freezing point, which is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) for pure water, the ice starts to absorb heat energy. This energy causes the molecules within the ice to vibrate and move, breaking the bonds that hold them together in the rigid crystal lattice. As these bonds weaken, the structure of the ice collapses, and the molecules become more mobile and disorganized.  This phase transition from solid ice to liquid water is called melting. The particles in the liquid state are still closely associated, but they can move freely and slide past each other. This allows water to flow and take the shape of its container. Liquid water has unique properties, such as a high heat capacity, an excellent ability to dissolve substances, and the capability to absorb and release large amounts of heat energy during phase transitions. Various factors can influence the melting of ice, including: 1. Temperature: As mentioned above, the temperature plays a crucial role in this process. Higher temperatures lead to increased molecular motion and faster melting.  2. Impurities: The presence of impurities, such as dissolved salts or other substances, can lower the freezing point of water, causing ice to melt at a lower temperature. 3. Pressure: Increased pressure can cause ice to melt because it forces the molecules closer together, disrupting the lattice structure. However, under certain conditions, the application of pressure may cause water to freeze rather than melt, a phenomenon known as \\"pressure melting.\\" 4. Surface area: The greater the surface area of the ice exposed to the heat, the faster the melting process will occur. 5. Conductivity of surrounding materials: If the ice is in contact with a substance that conducts heat well, like metal, it will melt more quickly than if it were in contact with a poor conductor, such as wood. In summary, when ice melts, it becomes water – a liquid state of the same substance. This change results from the absorption of heat energy, which triggers molecular vibrations and breaks the crystal lattice structure, enabling the molecules to flow freely. The process of melting is influenced by factors such as temperature, impurities, pressure, surface area, and the conductivity of surrounding materials. Ultimately, understanding the transition from ice to water provides valuable insight into the behavior of water molecules and the unique properties of this essential and versatile substance."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Eighteen months passed away in England, and nothing more was heard of the two fugitives to Africa. Lady Emily's cup was very full indeed. On the self-same day she learned of her husband's death and her son's mysterious and unaccountable disappearance. From that moment forth, he was to her as if dead. After Granville left, no letter or news of him, direct or indirect, ever reached Tilgate. It was all most inexplicable. He had disappeared into space, and no man knew of him.  Cyril, too, had now almost given up hoping for news of Guy. Slowly the conviction forced itself deeper and still deeper upon his mind, in spite of Elma, that Guy was really Montague Nevitt's murderer. Else how account for Guy's sudden disappearance, and for the fact that he never even wrote home his whereabouts? Nay, Guy's letter itself left no doubt upon his mind. Cyril went through life now oppressed continually with the terrible burden of being a murderer's brother.  And indeed everybody else--except Elma Clifford--implicitly shared that opinion with him. Cyril was sure the unknown benefactor shared it too, for Guy's six thousand pounds were never paid in to his credit--as indeed how could they, since Colonel Kelmscott, who had promised to pay them, died before receiving the balance of the purchase money for the Dowlands estate? Cyril slank through the world, then, weighed down by his shame, for Guy and he were each other's doubles, and he always had a deep underlying conviction that, as Guy was in any particular, so also in the very fibre of his nature he himself was.  What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. Whose husband died? 2. What happened to her son? 3. Where is she? 4. What is her son's name? 5. Did he write home? 6.

It is winter and Johnathan's car won't start, so he needs to walk to work. Even though it's sunny outside he's going to have to bundle up due to the cold temperature. In his closet there is a large black coat and a large white coat. He can't decide which coat to wear.                                                                                                                     Sarah is going to a family picnic in the park and is trying to decide what dress to wear. She knows it is going to be very hot and sunny today and she has narrowed her choices down to two different dresses. One is a dark colored dress and the other is a white dress.  Would the white coat absorb more or less sunlight?  Hint: Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them.","output":"When it comes to the decision of which coat Johnathan should wear and which dress Sarah should choose, it is essential to understand how colors affect the absorption of sunlight and its consequent impact on the temperature of the cloth. As hinted, the concept of absorption plays a crucial role here. When light is absorbed, the added energy raises the temperature of the matter. In Johnathan's case, he has to choose between a large black coat and a large white coat for his walk to work during the winter. As it is cold outside, his priority should be to wear a coat that can potentially keep him warmer by absorbing more sunlight. Dark colors, such as black, are known for absorbing sunlight more efficiently than lighter colors. This is because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them, converting that absorbed energy into heat, which in turn warms up the clothing. Therefore, Johnathan should opt for the large black coat to stay warmer during his walk to work. On the other hand, Sarah needs to choose a dress for her family picnic in the park, knowing that it will be hot and sunny. Her choices are a dark-colored dress and a white dress. Since it is going to be a hot day, Sarah would benefit from choosing a dress that absorbs less sunlight and consequently keeps her cooler. Light colors, such as white, reflect more sunlight than they absorb, which means there will be less heat absorbed by the clothing, keeping her cooler in the hot weather. So, Sarah should opt for the white dress for her day in the park. In summary, the white coat would absorb less sunlight than the black coat, as white reflects more sunlight than it absorbs, resulting in less heat being transferred to the material. Conversely, dark colors like black absorb more sunlight and convert it into heat, making them warmer to wear in colder weather.

Plot title: Sister Act Movie plot: The film opens in 1968 at St. Anne's Academy, a California Roman Catholic school, where a young girl named Deloris Wilson is scolded by Sister Immaculata (Lois de Banzie) for wisecracking and disobedience. The setting then changes to the present day, where Deloris (now going by the surname Van Cartier) is a lounge singer in a 1960s-themed act called The Ronelles (a parody of The Ronettes), who sing at The Moonlite Lounge of the Nevada Club in Reno, Nevada, run by her boyfriend, the mobster Vince LaRocca. After Deloris walks in on Vince having his chauffeur Ernie executed for betrayal, Vince orders his two henchmen Joey and Willy to kill her as well. Deloris flees Vince's casino to the local police station where Lieutenant Eddie Souther suggests she testify against Vince if he can be arrested and tried, but for now, she should go into witness protection until the time comes. Deloris is taken to St. Katherine's Parish in a seedy, run-down neighborhood of San Francisco, where Souther suggests she take refuge in the attached convent. Both Deloris and the stoic Reverend Mother object, but are convinced by Souther and Monsignor O'Hara to go ahead with it. Deloris 'becomes' a nun â habit and all â under the hand of Reverend Mother, who gives her the religious name 'Sister Mary Clarence' to complete the disguise. Mary Clarence objects to following the strictures and simple life of the convent, but comes to befriend several of the nuns, including the forever jolly Sister Mary Patrick, quiet and meek Sister Mary Robert, and the elderly deadpan Sister Mary Lazarus. After sneaking into a nearby bar, Mary Clarence is chastised by Reverend Mother and put into the choir, which she has seen to be dreadful. The choir nuns, learning that Mary Clarence has a background in music, elect her to take over as choir director, which she accepts, and she rearranges them to make them better singers.

France’s traditional enemies, Great Britain and Austria, had coalesced just as they had done against Louis XIV. Prussia, the leading anti-Austrian state in Germany, had been supported by France. Neither group, however, found much reason to be satisfied with its partnership: British subsidies to Austria had produced nothing of much help to the British, while the British military effort had not saved Silesia for Austria. Prussia, having secured Silesia, had come to terms with Austria in disregard of French interests. Even so, France had concluded a defensive alliance with Prussia in 1747, and the maintenance of the Anglo-Austrian alignment after 1748 was deemed essential by the Duke of Newcastle, British secretary of state in the ministry of his brother Henry Pelham. The collapse of that system and the aligning of France with Austria and of Great Britain with Prussia constituted what is known as the “diplomatic revolution” or the “reversal of alliances.” Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Who was the traditional partner with Great Britain at the beginning of the conflict?","output":"The traditional partner with Great Britain at the beginning of the conflict was Austria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Along with abandoning the territory which Shen Kuo had fought for, Cai ousted Shen from his seat of office. Shen's life was now forever changed, as he lost his once reputable career in state governance and the military. Shen was then put under probation in a fixed residence for the next six years. However, as he was isolated from governance, he decided to pick up the ink brush and dedicate himself to intensive scholarly studies. After completing two geographical atlases for a state-sponsored program, Shen was rewarded by having his sentence of probation lifted, allowing him to live in a place of his choice. Shen was also pardoned by the court for any previous faults or crimes that were claimed against him.  In his more idle years removed from court affairs, Shen Kuo enjoyed pastimes of the Chinese gentry and literati that would indicate his intellectual level and cultural taste to others. As described in his Dream Pool Essays, Shen Kuo enjoyed the company of the \\"nine guests\\" (Jiu Ke , jiuke), a figure of speech for the Chinese zither, the older 17x17 line variant of weiqi (known today as go), Zen Buddhist meditation, ink (calligraphy and painting), tea drinking, alchemy, chanting poetry, conversation, and drinking wine. These nine activities were an extension to the older so-called Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar.  According to Zhu Yu's book Pingzhou Table Talks (Ping Zhou Ke Tan ; Pingzhou Ketan) of 1119, Shen Kuo had two marriages; the second wife was the daughter of Zhang Chu (Zhang Chu ), who came from Huainan. Lady Zhang was said to be overbearing and fierce, often abusive to Shen Kuo, even attempting at one time to pull off his beard. Shen Kuo's children were often upset over this, and prostrated themselves to Lady Zhang to quit this behavior. Despite this, Lady Zhang went as far as to drive out Shen Kuo's son from his first marriage, expelling him from the household. However, after Lady Zhang died, Shen Kuo fell into a deep depression and even attempted to jump into the Yangtze River to drown himself. Although this suicide attempt failed, he would die a year later.  In the 1070s, Shen had purchased a lavish garden estate on the outskirts of modern-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province, a place of great beauty which he named \\"Dream Brook\\" (\\"Mengxi\\") after he visited it for the first time in 1086. Shen Kuo permanently moved to the Dream Brook Estate in 1088, and in that same year he completed his life's written work of the Dream Pool Essays, naming the book after his garden-estate property. It was there that Shen Kuo spent the last several years of his life in leisure, isolation, and illness, until his death in 1095.

Listen and ask questions. Pay attention to her body language.\\"","output":"Title: Mastering the Art of Conversation: A Guide to Engaging Women in Meaningful Dialogue Introduction: The art of conversation is a skill that can turn a regular encounter into an amalgamation of shared experiences, deep connections, and blossoming relationships. In the world of dating or even just socializing, having the ability to engage women in meaningful dialogue can make all the difference in creating a lasting impression. Unfortunately, many men struggle with how to talk to women, often resulting in awkward moments or one-sided conversations. Fret not, because in this article, we'll break down five essential elements to help you navigate the murky waters of small talk and beyond: ideas, introductions, compliments, listening, and body language. 1. Have Some Ideas About What to Talk About: Entering a conversation without any idea of what to discuss can be nerve-wracking and a surefire way to hit a dead end. To avoid this, take a few moments before the interaction to think of some topics of interest. Consider current events, pop culture, hobbies, and shared experiences as potential starting points. This will ensure that you have a repertoire of conversation starters to fall back on, and at the same time, gauge her interests to discover commonalities between the two of you. 2. Introduce Yourself: When meeting anyone for the first time, it's imperative to begin with a proper introduction. A confident, warm, and genuine introduction will set the tone for the entire conversation. Make sure to maintain eye contact and share your name with a friendly tone in your voice. Remember, the way we introduce ourselves is often a reflection of how we view ourselves. Therefore, believe in your value as a person and a potential friend or partner, and you'll project that self-assurance onto the conversation. 3. Compliment Her: Complimenting someone can be a powerful way to showcase your interest in them and boost their self-esteem. However, a misplaced or insincere compliment may have the opposite effect, making the situation uncomfortable. When complimenting a woman, be specific and genuine. Focus on complimenting her on her style, skills, or something she has said during the conversation, instead of solely relying on her physical appearance. This demonstrates your attentiveness and respect, and allows her to feel valued for more than just her looks. 4. Listen and Ask Questions: One of the most important aspects of a good conversation is having the ability to listen actively. It's not enough just to hear the words being spoken; pay attention to the meaning behind them as well. Show empathy and understanding by nodding, maintaining eye contact, and using appropriate facial expressions. Moreover, ensure to ask open-ended questions, which allow her to elaborate on her thoughts and experiences, and provide you with further insight into her personality. By actively listening and engaging her in this manner, you're building the foundation of a more meaningful connection. 5. Pay Attention to Her Body Language: Communication is more than just words; body language plays a crucial role in conveying and interpreting a person's thoughts and feelings. If you notice that she's leaning in, maintaining eye contact, and using open body language, these are positive signs of engagement and interest. Conversely, crossed arms, minimal eye contact, and one-word answers might indicate disinterest or discomfort. In such cases, it's essential to adjust your approach and address the situation. Be observant and cater your conversation accordingly, to ensure that both parties are at ease and share a positive experience. Conclusion: Mastering the art of conversation is a powerful tool that can help you build lasting connections and enhance your personal and professional life. By incorporating these essential elements - having ideas, introducing yourself, complimenting her, listening actively, and paying attention to body language - you'll be well-equipped to engage women in meaningful conversations. The key here is to be genuine, empathetic, and attentive, which will not only enable you to understand and appreciate the person you're conversing with, but also encourage her to reciprocate and invest in the budding relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Using soaps or perfumes can seriously aggravate or irritate your pubic area. Your pubic region has a specific pH level and certain soaps can throw this off.  Use specially pH balanced pubic washes to clean your pubic hair if you must use a product. You can find these washes over the counter or by asking your local pharmacist. Do not use deodorant, talcum powder, shampoo, or fragranced wipes to clean your pubic hair. This can be especially tempting if you are experiencing unpleasant odors from your pubic region. After using the toilet, you may want to wipe your pubic region with a damp towel or tissue paper. This will help you maintain the cleanliness of your pubic hair. Regularly wiping after using the toilet is essential in stopping the spread of harmful bacteria around your pubic region. Pubic hair, especially, is a great breeding ground for these germs. Moisture can cause irritation. Keeping your pubic hair dry can prevent discomfort and bacteria from growing.  Dry your pubic hair completely before putting on clothes after showering. Wear looser clothing and avoid nylon, synthetic, or tight clothing where moisture can be trapped. This is especially important when temperatures are high and sweating occurs down there. There's no firm evidence that having excessive pubic hair can trap germs or debris in your pubic region; however, trimming down the excess may make you feel cleaner. Depending on your preference, you may choose to trim pubic hair for a cleaner appearance.  You may feel ashamed or embarrassed if you have a lot of pubic hair. However, having pubic hair is a sign of maturity and having a lot of it is not a bad thing. And keeping your pubic hair clean and manageable is an important task to keep up your own personal health and hygiene. While trimming your pubic hair is okay, try to avoid shaving it off completely on a regular basis. Pubic hair protects against certain harmful bacteria and viruses, making it more difficult for them to enter the body. Regularly shaving that sensitive area could also cause increased skin irritation.","output":"To maintain pubic hygiene, avoid using soaps or perfumes, and instead use pH balanced pubic washes, keep the area dry, wear loose and breathable clothing, trim excess hair if preferred, and avoid regularly shaving off the hair completely as it protects against harmful bacteria and irritants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Jennifer is currently looking for a new city to move to since she is looking to change her life and just do something different. Jennifer is a strong environmentalist and doesn't want to move to a city that contributes a lot to climate change since she feels it's every person's duty to take care of the Earth. She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity. Dapperton, the other city she is considering, has a neat hobby shop that Jennifer likes and the city uses nuclear power for its electricity needs.  Will Dapperton have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Jamestown? The answer is:","output":"Dapperton will have a lower chance of acid rain than Jamestown. Step 1: Understand the main factors causing acid rain Acid rain is primarily caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from various sources, such as power plants, vehicles, and industrial processes. These gases react with moisture in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid and nitric acid, which then fall to the ground as acid rain or other forms of precipitation. Step 2: Compare the electricity generation methods of the two cities Jamestown uses coal to generate its electricity, while Dapperton uses nuclear power. Coal-fired power plants are known to produce large amounts of SO2 and NOx, which contribute to acid rain. On the other hand, nuclear power plants produce very low levels of these emissions, making them a more environmentally-friendly option in terms of air quality and acid rain potential. Step 3: Assess other factors that may contribute to acid rain in each city While electricity generation is a significant factor in acid rain, other factors, such as vehicle emissions and local industries, should also be considered. However, based on the information provided, there is no indication that either city has a particularly high or low level of these other factors. Step 4: Conclude which city has a lower chance of acid rain Given that Dapperton uses nuclear power for electricity generation and Jamestown relies on coal, which produces higher emissions of SO2 and NOx, Dapperton will likely have a lower chance of experiencing acid rain compared to Jamestown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Afterward all the local newspapers carried many human-interest stories featuring some of the families who suffered the hardest. One Sunday, a particular picture especially touched me. A young woman stood in front of an entirely shattered mobile home, a depressed expression twisting her features. A young boy, seven or eight years old, stood at her side, eyes downcast. Clutching     at her skirt was a tiny girl who stared into the camera, eyes wide with confusion and fear. The article that went with the picture gave the clothing sizes of each family member. With growing interest, I noticed that their sizes closely matched ours. This would be a good opportunity to teach my children to help those less fortunate than themselves.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. A handful of states select candidates by caucus instead of through ballots. During a caucus, voters gather at designated locations at a specific time to select the candidate of their choice. Check your local or state election website to find out if your state will be voting by caucus. 2020 caucus states include:  Alaska, Iowa, Kansas, Maine and Wyoming (both parties) Nevada, Washington, and North Dakota (Democrats only) Hawaii and Kentucky (Republicans only) If your party holds primary elections by caucus, they will select caucus locations throughout your state. Visit the official state website for your party to find out where you must go to participate in a caucus.  For example, if you live in Iowa and want to participate in the Democratic caucus, visit https://iowademocrats.org/. To participate in the Republican caucus, go to https://www.iowagop.org/. Your caucus location may be different from your regular polling place (e.g., where you would go to vote in the General Presidential Election). Visit your party’s state website or go to the U.S. Vote Foundation’s website to find out when your caucus will take place. Since caucuses take the form of a large meeting rather than an individual ballot voting process that is spread out throughout the day, you’ll need to arrive at a specific time in order to participate.  For example, the 2020 Iowa Democratic and Republican caucuses both began at 7:00 PM on February 3. It’s best to arrive slightly before the designated time (e.g., 30 minutes ahead of time) so that you can check in and go to the designated area. During a typical caucus, you’ll have an opportunity to listen to the candidates or their representatives talk about the issues and their positions. Candidates who can’t be there or send representatives from their campaigns may provide pamphlets or other literature for you to look at. If you haven’t already done so, decide which candidate(s) you want to support based on the information presented at the caucus. During the caucus, you may have an opportunity to vote for your preferred candidate by straw poll, or election officials may ask you to physically move to a space that represents your favorite candidate. Follow the directions at your caucus location to determine how to cast your vote.   For example, in the Iowa Republican Caucus, caucus-goers write down their preferred candidates on a paper ballot. In the Nevada Democratic caucus, attendees are divided up into “Presidential preference groups.” Election officials then tally up the number of people in each group to determine if a candidate has enough votes to be considered “viable” (e.g., 15% or more of the votes).  If your candidate doesn’t get enough votes to be considered viable in the first round of voting, you may have an opportunity to join a different group or vote for your second choice. You can also try to convince other caucus-goers to join your group. After some caucuses, you’ll have an opportunity to stay after the votes are cast and suggest “platform planks.” If you have ideas about issues that you would like incorporated into the official state platform for your party, now is the time to introduce them.  If you prefer, you can leave after the nominating contest ends. You aren’t obligated to stay for party business. Summary:","output":"To participate in a caucus, first, check if your state selects candidates through a caucus by referring to your local or state election website. Find out if your party holds primary elections by caucus and then visit the official state website for your party to find the location where you need to participate in the caucus. The caucus location may differ from your regular polling place. Plan to arrive slightly before the designated time (e.g., 30 minutes prior) to the caucus, so you can check-in. During the caucus, you have an opportunity to listen to the candidates or their representatives, read pamphlets or literature about them, and vote for your preferred candidate by either straw poll or physically moving to a space representing that candidate, depending on the instructions at your caucus location. In some cases, if your preferred candidate does not receive enough votes to be considered \\"viable,\\" you may have the opportunity to join a different group or vote for your second choice. You can also try to convince other guests to support your candidate. After the votes are cast, you may have the chance to stay and suggest \\"platform planks\\" for inclusion into the official state platform for your party or leave after the nominating contest is over."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Ella weighed just 1lb 10oz (737g) and was about the size of an adult's hand. For weeks she was kept in an incubator. Catherine, the daughter of ex-Labour leader John Smith, said she knew little about premature babies at the time. \\"I didn't really think there was that much chance of survival,\\" she told the BBC. But Ella survived - thanks to a research centre set up by former prime minister Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah after the couple's 10-day-old baby, Jennifer, died in 2002. Following the death, the Browns founded the charity PiggyBankKids - now known as TheirWorld - in memory of their daughter. And in 2004, the charity established the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory (JBRL) at the University of Edinburgh. The JBRL looked at ways to help premature babies thrive, including research into how much oxygen should be given to babies in incubators. It was this research that was to prove absolutely crucial to the survival of Ella 15 years later. Catherine's father had been one of the former prime minister's closest political allies. She became aware of the link between the Browns' charity and her own daughter after Ella started to pull through. \\"I thought I could donate to their research lab - because I knew they'd set up a research lab in Jennifer's name,\\" said Catherine. \\"I went on the website to try to make a donation, and I read a little, and I realised that some of the work they had done had impacted directly on the care that Ella was getting - and that was just incredibly moving.\\" Work done by scientists at the JBRL established that giving a premature baby too much or too little oxygen could seriously damage its chances of survival. \\"By the time Ella was getting care this change had made its way into clinical practice and it was one of the things we were very aware of because the machine that was monitoring oxygen was constantly going off,\\" said Catherine, from Dundee. \\"If the oxygen went too high or too low an alarm sounded and that would happen many times in an hour. It was so obviously being monitored very strictly and very closely. \\"That was as a result to the work done in Jennifer's name. I really think it made a difference. I personally believe it had a direct impact on her survival and it is humbling.\\" Speaking to the Daily Record, she added: \\"What Gordon and Sarah have done is the most extraordinary gift. They've given us our daughter.\\" Sarah, 53, said she first heard of Ella's birth after Catherine wrote them a letter. She told the BBC: \\"Gordon had opened it and came through and shared it. \\"She'd written saying that Ella had arrived, that she was thriving, that they were looking forward to a chance when she might go home in the near future - and that she recognised this link.\\" Sarah said it made her \\"proud\\" to know that research carried out in the lab had become part of medical practice and was helping to save babies' lives. \\"That they've helped Ella is enough, but that I also know it helps other babies in the future is really important,\\" she said. Speaking about her daughter Jennifer, Sarah said she had received \\"extraordinary care\\" from the NHS during her 10-day life. \\"I know that things could have been different and we may even have missed out on that so that's very precious to us. \\"But the loss is very deep and the loss will be with us always. We have two amazing sons but we will also have Jennifer in our hearts.\\" She added: \\"I feel very privileged that the lab is named for Jennifer, but truthfully there are many parents who have lost children who have contributed and who are still very much a part of how we create the work, how we raise funds to support the work. \\"There's a lot of us in it together.\\" Ellla is now two years old and in \\"absolutely brilliant\\" health, according to Catherine. The two women had an \\"emotional lunch\\" after Catherine wrote to the Browns - though she admitted it had been difficult to talk about Ella at first, as their experiences had been so different. But she told the BBC that Sarah had insisted she should not feel guilty. \\"Sarah said to me absolutely straight: 'Don't be ridiculous. What's the point of the lab, what's the point of all the work we've done in Jennifer's name if it isn't for an Ella?'\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"Ella, a premature baby weighing just 1lb 10oz (737g), survived thanks to research conducted at the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory (JBRL) at the University of Edinburgh.

Read this: In 2003, Nintendo announced that a new The Legend of Zelda game was in the works for the GameCube by the same team that had created the cel-shaded The Wind Waker. At the following year's Game Developers Conference, director Eiji Aonuma unintentionally revealed that the game's sequel was in development under the working title The Wind Waker 2; it was set to use a similar graphical style to that of its predecessor. Nintendo of America told Aonuma that North American sales of The Wind Waker were sluggish because its cartoon appearance created the impression that the game was designed for a young audience. Concerned that the sequel would have the same problem, Aonuma expressed to producer Shigeru Miyamoto that he wanted to create a realistic Zelda game that would appeal to the North American market. Miyamoto, hesitant about solely changing the game's presentation, suggested the team's focus should instead be on coming up with gameplay innovations. He advised that Aonuma should start by doing what could not be done in Ocarina of Time, particularly horseback combat.[l] At what event was a potential follow-up to Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned?

He works at a building construction site managed by MEMAR, the site foreman. Lateef's job is to serve tea and prepare food for the workers with whom he is always quarrelling. The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds. From then on his attitude changes completely; he becomes protective, helpful and gradually desperately in love with Rahmat. While Rahmat does not express herself verbally at all, over time she seems to respond to this love. During a surprise visit of the labour inspectors, they find themselves face to face with Rahmat. She panics and runs away, as they chase her through the city streets. Lateef runs after them, struggling with the inspectors while Rahmat flees. Lateef is beaten and taken to the police station. Now Memar must pay a fine, comply with the law, and lay off all illegal Afghan workers. Lateef can't bear Rahmat's absence, and decides to locate Soltan to get some news of her. He goes to the village where the Afghans live, walks around, meets an enigmatic cobbler, and ends up in the courtyard of a shrine near a graveyard...

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination.

Q: What are boggy regions with thick layers of peat called?    Choices:  - wetlands  - tropics  - meadows  - peatlands  A:","output":"The boggy regions with thick layers of peat are called Peatlands. Peatlands are a type of wetland which are dominated by peat, a type of soil made from partially decomposed plant material that has accumulated over a long period of time in a wet environment. This unique condition is due to the constant waterlogged state which slows down the decomposition process. The un-decayed plant material eventually turns into peat after a significant period of time, often several millenniums.  Peatlands are usually found in cooler climates where the rate of plant production is greater than the rate of breakdown in the waterlogged, anaerobic conditions. They range from bogs and fens which are primarily composed of mosses, to marshy peatlands dominated by reeds and grasses, and swamps that are forested peatlands.  Bogs are a popular type of peatland and often what most people visualize when imagining peatlands. Bogs are rain-fed, highly acidic, low in nutrients, and often populated by specialized and adapted plants such as sphagnum moss, carnivorous plants, and dwarf shrubs.  Fens are another type of peatland. Unlike bogs, fens are fed by groundwater containing nutrients dissolved from the underlaying rocks. As a result, fens are generally more alkaline and nutrient-rich compared to bogs, supporting a wider range of plant and animal life.  Peatlands play crucial roles in carbon storage, flood prevention, water purification, and biodiversity. They are significant carbon sinks, meaning they absorb more carbon dioxide than they release, which helps mitigate the impacts of climate change. However, when disturbed or drained for agriculture, forestry or for extracting peat for fuel or gardening, they can turn into significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The mismanagement and destruction of peatlands could be detrimental to the environment, contributing to climate change. For this reason, peatland conservation is critical to mitigating global warming and protecting ecosystems that rely on these unique habitats.  Therefore, while peatlands may seem like unproductive or barren landscapes to some, they are in fact very important ecosystems that contribute immensely to our planet's health and function."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Here is a news article: Our results show that pain tolerance positively predicts social network size. This therefore supports our hypothesis that variation in the μ-opioid system underlies individual differences in sociality. These results are consistent with a recent PET imaging experiment demonstrating a correlation between μ-opioid receptor availability and attachment style, such that individuals showing greater avoidance of social attachment exhibit lower receptor densities15. Our findings are also in agreement with previous pain tolerance studies indirectly implicating the endogenous opioid system in human social bonding activities such as music-making18, dancing19 and laughter20. In addition, laughter has since been shown to correlate with elevated μ-opioid activity, as measured by PET scanning (Manninen et al. in prep). This suggests that tests of pain tolerance like that used in our study may indeed serve as a useful proxy for assessing activation of the μ-opioid system.      Variation in μ-opioid receptor signalling may be due to underlying differences in both endogenous opioid release and receptor density, though their relative contribution is yet to be fully determined. However, studies of oxytocin and vasopressin signalling in rodents have shown that CNS receptor densities strongly modulate the influence of these neuropeptides, irrespective of neuropeptide abundance21. In fact, analyses of post-mortem brain tissue and in vivo PET studies in humans have revealed a broad range of μ-opioid receptor densities within the population, differing by at least 30–50%22. Such variation is likely to considerably affect the potency of β-endorphin11. Genetic studies suggest these differences in receptor density are partly the result of a non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism in the μ-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1), substituting aspartic acid for asparagine (A118G)23. This functional polymorphism is relatively common in the population, with the minor G allele having a frequency of 10–30%24, and is associated with reduced μ-opioid receptor expression24,25. The G allele has also been linked to increased social withdrawal26 and reactivity to social rejection27, as well as greater pain sensitivity and reduced relief from opiate drugs28. This is therefore in line with our proposition that variation in the μ-opioid system contributes to individual differences in both social behaviour and pain tolerance.      We acknowledge that use of pain tolerance as a proxy for μ-opioid receptor signalling, rather than its direct measurement, represents a limitation of our research. However, the μ-opioid system is critically involved in pain modulation6,29 and numerous PET studies implicate μ-opioidergic activation in both experimental and clinical pain settings30. Most notably, in humans undergoing a sustained muscular pain challenge, individuals exhibiting higher activity of the μ-opioid system report reduced sensory and affective pain31. A possible future direction that would benefit research in this field would be to combine PET scanning with a range of different pain tests to determine how reliably they can predict activity of the μ-opioid system. We also recognise the possible involvement of non-opioid signalling pathways, especially given the complex neurochemistry underlying pain responses32,33. In particular, oxytocin, vasopressin and endocannabinoids are all implicated in social behaviour34,35, as well as having analgesic effects36,37,38. Indeed, it is likely that they act in concert with β-endorphin39,40,41.      Further research is required to understand the causality of this relationship between pain tolerance and network size. It may be that individuals with genetic variants conferring enhanced μ-opioid neurotransmission derive greater reward from social interactions, thereby seeking more company. An alternative, though not mutually exclusive, explanation is that individuals leading lives rich in social interactions may release higher levels of endogenous opioids and/or have elevated receptor expression. However, we currently lack knowledge regarding the neuroplasticity exhibited by the μ-opioid system. This is of particular interest in relation to psychiatric disorders. Indeed, healthy females asked to sustain a sad mood for only 30 minutes show a reduction in μ-opioid receptor activation42. Thus prolonged sadness, as experienced by those suffering from depression, may over time lead to a significant fall in opioidergic signalling. We hypothesise that reduced μ-opioid activity may characterise the onset of conditions such as depression and schizophrenia, resulting in the common symptoms of anhedonia and social withdrawal. Indeed, endogenous opioids mediate hedonic experiences and are integral to our feelings of social connection8,12. In support of this, there is evidence of compromised μ-opioid receptor signalling in patients suffering from depression and schizophrenia43,44 and studies using rodent models of depression also implicate the μ-opioid system45.      With respect to the other notable results of our analysis, fitness was primarily included in the regression model to account for its influence on pain tolerance but revealed an interesting and novel negative relationship with network size. This indicates a trade-off between leading a socially active versus a physically active life. Beyond the obvious constraint of time, this relationship may reflect our underlying neurobiology such that individuals who exercise more may have greater reliance on this method of promoting β-endorphin release, rather than through social interactions. Though exercise is frequently prescribed as a treatment for depression, perhaps focus should also be placed on strengthening and expanding an individual’s social ties.      The relationship reported here between stress and network size may reflect the beneficial effects of social support in dealing with stressful situations46, since measures of social support often correlate with social network size47. Interestingly, one study found that the number of Facebook friends (a known correlate of real-world social network size48) is associated with enhanced perceptions of social support and reduced stress49. Whether online social networks play a role in relieving stress (or even intensifying it) over and above an individual’s actual social interactions remains uncertain. However, an alternative interpretation of our data is that stressed individuals find less time for social engagement and thus their network decreases in size.      Understanding the biological causes of variation in social network size is of particular interest given the robust association between an individual’s social support and their health, ranging from functioning of their immune, endocrine and cardiovascular systems46 to myelin integrity50. Interestingly, it is an individual’s perceived level of social support that may often be a more reliable indicator of their health status46,51. Compared to other lifestyle factors, we have limited understanding of the mechanisms via which sociality influences morbidity and mortality risk52, though reduced activation of the neuroendocrine stress response likely plays a significant role in both humans51,53 and animals54. Since β-endorphin is known to alleviate the stress response55 and protect against inflammation and cancer56, the activity of an individual’s endogenous μ-opioid system may have important consequences for their health. However, such a direct interaction between social and somatic health is yet to be explored.      In summary, there is substantial evidence that μ-opioid neurotransmission influences sensitivity not only to our physical environment but also our social one. This study adds to previous research implicating the μ-opioid system as a key neural substrate upon which human sociality has evolved. A better understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning our social lives is imperative, especially since our technology-driven world is rapidly changing the nature of social relationships and certainly outpacing any biological adaptations. Sociality is clearly of adaptive value to our species, yet in this digital era deficiencies in our social interactions may be one of the overlooked factors contributing to the declining health of our modern society. ||||| Link between larger friendship circles and pain tolerance may be down to the way the the brain’s endorphin system has evolved, researchers say      People with a larger circle of friends are better able to tolerate pain, according to research into the pain thresholds and social networks of volunteers.      The link is thought to be down a system in the brain that involves endorphins: potent pain-killing chemicals produced by the body that also trigger a sense of wellbeing.      “At an equivalent dose, endorphins have been shown to be stronger than morphine,” said Katerina Johnson, a doctoral student at the University of Oxford, who co-authored the research.            Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, Johnson and Robin Dunbar, professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of Oxford, sought to probe the theory that the brain’s endorphin system might have evolved to not only handle our response to physical discomfort, but influence our experience of pleasure from social interactions too. “Social behaviour and being attached to other individuals is really important for our survival - whether that is staying close to our parents, or our offspring or cooperating with others to find food or to help defend ourselves,” said Johnson.            Rhythm without the blues: how dance crazes make us feel a step closer Read more      To test the link, the authors examined both the social networks and pain thresholds of 101 adults aged between 18 and 34. Each participant was asked to complete a questionnaire, designed to quiz them on friends they contacted once a week and those they got in touch with once a month. The personality of each participant was probed, looking at traits such as “agreeableness”; they were also asked to rate their fitness and stress levels.            As greater endorphin activity in the brain is linked to higher pain tolerance, each participant was asked to squat with their back against a wall and their knees at right-angles to their body - a simple but uncomfortable exercise. They were asked to stay in the position for as long as they could bear it, providing researchers with an indirect method of gauging endorphin activity in the brain.            The researchers found that for both men and women, larger social networks were linked to a greater pain tolerance. What’s more, it was the number of friends contacted on a monthly - rather than weekly - basis that appeared to be the most important factor. “This relationship with brain endorphin activity may only be important when it comes to the limits of the number of close social bonds that we can maintain, since nearly all of us have some friends and family that we rely on in times of need,” said Johnson.      From the results, she added, when stress, fitness and agreeableness are controlled for, an increase from seven to 12 friends in this second layer of contacts is predicted to boost tolerance in the pain test from one minute to four minutes on average. But, said Johnson, it was not clear whether the link was down to greater social activity boosting the release of endorphins and thereby dampening the experience of pain, or whether people with a more active endorphin system - and hence higher pain tolerance - experience a greater reward from social activity and hence surround themselves with more friends.            Intriguingly, while participants who reported higher levels of fitness were able to endure the pain test for longer, the researchers discovered that these participants generally had smaller friendship groups.      “The obvious answer is that it is a question of time - if you are in the gym all the time you are going to have less time to socialise with your friends,” said Johnson. But, she adds, there is another possible explanation. “Both exercise and socialising trigger the endorphin system,” she said, adding that those who experience an endorphin rush from the gym might not feel the need to seek a similar feeling from mixing with friends.      Those who reported high levels of stress were also found to have fewer friends, although there was little correlation to pain tolerance. But it is not clear whether stress itself hinders people from forming and maintaining relationships, or whether by having more friendships others were better able to cope with life’s pressures. “It is probably a combination of the two,” said Johnson.      Working in a team increases human pain threshold Read more      While the research supports previous evidence that endorphin activity in the brain might be linked to social interactions, Johnson added that it is not yet clear what causes the differences between individuals. One possible explanation is that genetic variations can affect the density of endorphin receptors in the brain. “If you have more endorphin receptors this may predispose you to being more sociable,” she said.      Lauri Nummenmaa, from Aalto University in Finland, believes the study raises new avenues of research, adding that one experiment would be to probe whether the activity of the endorphin system increases when people socialise. “Those kind of experiments are needed to really nail down what is going on,” he said.

Provine, professor of psychology at the University of Maryland, and author of Curious Behavior: Yawning, Laughing, Hiccuping, and Beyond, believes it is important to further tease apart different ways in which social interactions might be linked to wellbeing.      “If experiencing chronic pain, should we join a choir, march off with an army, or spend more time with friends? All may have a positive effect, but the challenge is in establishing the mechanism through which such social interventions work,” he said. “Is it through release of the brain’s own opioids, as suggested by Johnson and Dunbar, cognitive mechanisms of attention or distraction, a combination of all three, or some other mechanism?” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A recent study conducted by the University of Oxford suggests that people with larger social networks are better at tolerating pain due to a part of the brain that involves endorphins - pain blocking chemicals that also trigger a sense of well-being.

Question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: The Pink Panther Strikes Again Movie plot: At a psychiatric hospital, former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is largely recovered from his obsession to kill the new Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) and is about to be released when Clouseau, arriving to speak on Dreyfus' behalf, drives Dreyfus insane again. Dreyfus promptly escapes from the asylum and once again tries to kill Clouseau by planting a bomb while the Inspector (by periodic arrangement) duels with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk). The bomb destroys Clouseau's apartment and injures Cato, but Clouseau himself is unharmed, being lifted from the room by an inflatable disguise. Deciding that a more elaborate plan is needed, Dreyfus enlists an army of criminals to his cause and kidnaps nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender (Richard Vernon) and the Professor's daughter Margo (Briony McRoberts), forcing the professor to build a \\"doomsday weapon\\" in return for his daughter's freedom. Clouseau travels to England to investigate Fassbender's disappearance, where he wrecks their family home and ineptly interrogates Jarvis (Michael Robbins), Fassbender's cross-dressing butler. Although Jarvis is killed by the kidnappers, to whom he had become a dangerous witness, Clouseau discovers a clue that leads him to the Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. Meanwhile, Dreyfus, using Fassbender's invention, dissolves the United Nations headquarters in New York City and blackmails the leaders of the world, including the President of the United States and his adviser (based on Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger), into assassinating Clouseau. However, many of the nations instruct their operatives to kill the other assassins to gain Dreyfus's favor and possibly the Doomsday Machine. As a result of their orders and Clouseau's habitual clumsiness, the assassins all end up killing each other until only the agents of Egypt and Russia remain. The Egyptian assassin (an uncredited cameo by Omar Sharif) shoots one of Dreyfus' henchmen, mistaking him for Clouseau, but is seduced by the Russian... My question: Who does Clouseau interrogate in England?

At the time she wrote the Longshot miniseries, writer Ann Nocenti was pursuing her Master's degree at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, working at the magazine Lies of Our Times, and reading the work of writers like Marshall McLuhan, Noam Chomsky, Edward S. Herman and Walter Lippmann. Mojo, a slaver and dictator who rules his dimension through the television programs he produces, was created as a direct result of these influences. (A character named Manufactured Consent after the Chomsky book of the same name, who appeared in Nocenti's 1990 book The New Mutants Summer Special, was also born of these works.) Artist Art Adams designed the character per Nocenti's instructions that he be disgusting and unpleasant, and also tried to make him look frightening. The wires that hold Mojo's eyelids open, thus preventing him from blinking, were inspired by an interview with actor Malcolm McDowell on Late Night with David Letterman, in which McDowell revealed that the similar apparatus he had to wear for the Ludovico technique scene in A Clockwork Orange had scarred his corneas. The rest of the equipment attached to Mojo's head controls his mechanized chair.  Mojo first appeared in Longshot #4 (December 1985), and was the main villain of the miniseries, appearing in the subsequent three issues.  The character subsequently appeared in The New Mutants Annual #2 (1986). That same year, in The Uncanny X-Men Annual #10, Mojo appeared as the villain in the story, which saw Longshot join the X-Men. In 1988, Mojo appeared in a backup story in The Uncanny X-Men Annual #12. He was the main villain of the one-shot special Excalibur: Mojo Mayhem (December 1989). Subsequent appearances include Marvel Comics Presents #89 (1991), The Uncanny X-Men Annual #15 (1991), Wolverine #52 (March 1992), X-Men #6 (March 1992), Wolverine #53 (April 1992), X-Men #7 (April 1992), #10-11 (July-August 1992), The Uncanny X-Men Annual 16 (Annual 1992), Marvel Comics Presents #119 (1993), What If? #59 (March 1994), X-Men Adventures: Season Two #11 (December 1994), Marvel: Portraits of the Universe #1 (March 1995), X-Men: Mutations #1 (1996), Youngblood/X-Force #1 (July 1996), X-Force/Youngblood #1 (August 1996), X-Force #60-61 (November-December 1996), The Adventures of the X-Men #9-10 (1996-January 1997), X-Babies: Murderama #1 (January 1998), X-Force #76 (April 1998), X-Babies Reborn #1 (January 2000), X-Men Unlimited #32 (September 2001), Exiles #18-19 (December 2002-January 2003), The Uncanny X-Men #460-461 (August 2005), and Exiles #73-74 (February 2006).

A: It uses an internal memory state to avoid the need to perform a one-to-one mapping of individual input symbols to distinct representations that use an integer number of bits, and it clears out the internal memory only after encoding the entire string of data symbols.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: An internal memory state is commonly used in various computational and communication systems to temporarily store and manage information while processing or transferring data. Several algorithms, techniques, and systems rely on internal memory states, including: 1. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are a type of artificial neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, like time series or natural language. They have an internal memory state called the hidden state, which allows them to remember information from previous time steps and use it for processing the current input. 2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: LSTM is a variation of RNNs specifically designed to learn long-term dependencies. They utilize memory cells to store information over long periods and adjust the flow of data through a combination of input, output, and forget gates, efficiently controlling the information flow in and out of the memory cells. 3. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs): HMM is a statistical model used for time series and sequence data analysis. It uses an internal memory state in the form of hidden states, which store information about the underlying system's state. These hidden states are not directly observable but can be inferred through the emitted observable states. 4. Data Compression Algorithms: Algorithms like Arithmetic coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) rely on internal memory states to encode and compress data efficiently. These algorithms maintain an internal dictionary or probabilities to map input symbols to unique codes, allowing for efficient encoding without the need for fixed-length representations. 5. Digital Communication Systems: In digital communication systems, like error-correcting codes and convolutional codes, an internal memory state is used to store and process information as it is transmitted through a noisy channel. This memory state helps in decoding the received data accurately by accounting for possible errors and channel distortions. 6. Finite State Machines (FSMs): FSMs are computational models used to represent and analyze the behavior of different systems. They consist of a finite number of states, transitions, and actions that occur based on input and internal memory. The internal memory state allows FSMs to track the current state and determine the next state based on given inputs. In summary, systems and algorithms that involve processing sequences, managing information flow, or making predictions based on previous data often utilize internal memory states to efficiently store and manage information. These memory states play a crucial role in enhancing the performance, accuracy, and functionality of various computational and communication systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds.

Express your answer as a common fraction.","output":"1. Since region A is a square and its perimeter is 16 units, each side of region A has a length of ( frac{16}{4} = 4 ) units. 2. Similarly, region B, also being a square, has a perimeter of 40 units, so each side of region B is ( frac{40}{4} = 10 ) units. 3. Assuming a straightforward relationship of perimeter multiplication, let's deduce that region C, adjacent or related to regions A and B, could possibly have a perimeter taken as a simple multiple of region A’s perimeter. If we take region C's perimeter as double the perimeter of region A (region C could be suggested to be next in sequence after B), then the perimeter of region C is ( 2times 16 = 32 ) units.    - Hence, each side of region C would have a length of ( frac{32}{4} = 8 ) units. 4. Calculating the areas:    - Area of region A = ( 4^2 = 16 ) square units.    - Area of region C = ( 8^2 = 64 ) square units. 5. Therefore, the ratio of the area of region A to region C is ( frac{16}{64} = frac{1}{4} ).

The asymptotes of the hyperbola are lines that the hyperbola approaches but never intersects. These lines are of the form y = pm dfrac{b}{a}x. Since we are given that the eccentricity e = dfrac{c}{a} = 2, we have c = 2a. Now we need to calculate the relationship between a, b, and c. From the definition of eccentricity and the properties of hyperbolas, we know that c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Substituting c = 2a into the equation, we get: (2a)^2 = a^2 + b^2  4a^2 = a^2 + b^2 Subtracting a^2 from both sides, we find that: 3a^2 = b^2 Taking the square root of both sides gives us: b = sqrt{3}a Substituting the value of b back into the equation of the asymptotes, we get: y = pm dfrac{sqrt{3}a}{a}x  y = pm sqrt{3}x Thus, the equations of the asymptotes for the given hyperbola are: boxed{y = pm sqrt{3}x}  By calculating the relationship between a, b, and the eccentricity e, and using the formula for the asymptotes of a hyperbola, we have found the equations of the asymptotes for this particular hyperbola.

According to the definition of the symmetric points, the orthocenter ( H ) of ( Delta ABC ) lies on this perpendicular bisector because ( A' ) is equidistant from ( H ) and ( B' ).     - Similarly, draw the perpendicular bisector of the line segment ( A'C' ) and extend it. The orthocenter ( H ) of ( Delta ABC ) lies on this perpendicular bisector as ( A' ) is equidistant from ( H ) and ( C' ).     - The intersection of these two perpendicular bisectors is the orthocenter ( H ). 2. **Finding the Vertices of ( Delta ABC )**:     - Since ( A' ), ( B' ), and ( C' ) are symmetric to ( H ) with respect to the sides opposite to vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) respectively, find the reflections:         - Reflect point ( A' ) over the line containing ( B'C' ) to obtain vertex ( A ).         - Reflect point ( B' ) over the line containing ( A'C' ) to obtain vertex ( B ).         - Reflect point ( C' ) over the line containing ( A'B' ) to obtain vertex ( C ). 3. **Verification**:      - Verify that the lines formed by the vertices ( A, B, C ) are perpendicular to the heights from ( H ) to the opposite sides, ensuring the orthocenter is correctly placed and that all construction points are correct.     - Ensure that ( H ) forms right angles with the sides at the foot of the altitudes, confirming the orthogonal symmetry. 4. **Final Construction**:      - The points ( A, B, ) and ( C ), obtained through the reflections, form the vertices of the required triangle ( Delta ABC ).

Here's a detailed breakdown: 1. Each row ( k ) in the grid contains numbers from ( (k-1)^2 + 1 ) to ( k^2 ). Therefore, for the k-th row, the numbers are:    [    left{ (k-1)^2 + 1, (k-1)^2 + 2, ldots, k^2 right}    ] 2. We identify the row in which the number 350 resides by finding ( k ) such that:    [    (k-1)^2 < 350 leq k^2.    ]    Simplifying this, we get:    [    (k-1)^2 < 350 quad text{and} quad 350 leq k^2.    ] 3.

The number in the 19th row adjacent to 350 horizontally can be determined by observing the pattern.

Since we are talking about a social group, (n geqq 2). 2. **Range of Possible Acquaintances**:    Each member in the group can have anywhere from 0 to (n-1) acquaintances within the group. Therefore, the range of possible number of acquaintances for any given individual is:    [    {0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1}    ] 3. **Impossible Scenarios**:    Note that it is impossible for one member to have 0 acquaintances and another to have (n-1) acquaintances at the same time. To understand why, consider if someone has (n-1) acquaintances, meaning they know everyone else in the group. Hence, no one in the group can have 0 acquaintances because everyone knows this person. 4. **Pigeonhole Principle**:    Since there are (n) people in the group and at most (n-1) different numbers of acquaintances possible (considering the above argument), by the Pigeonhole Principle at least two people must have the same number of acquaintances. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if (n) items are put into (m) containers, with (n > m), then at least one container must contain more than one item. 5. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, there exist at least two individuals in the group who have the same number of acquaintances.

This would mean every number from the set ({0, 1, ldots, n-1}) is utilized. This assumption is crucial because it sets up a contradiction. 4. **Removing a Member with 0 Acquaintances**:    If one member has 0 acquaintances, removing this person from the group means the remaining (n-1) individuals have acquaintances numbered without 0. This set of numbers would then range from    [    {1, 2, ldots, n-1}    ] 5. **Contradiction**:    However, removing a member who has 0 acquaintances, suggests that within the remaining (n-1) members, there should also be someone with 0 acquaintances as they now can’t know the removed member. Hence, this iterative removal strategy proves that there must be a duplication of acquaintance numbers among the group originally. 6. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, our assumption that each person has a distinct number of acquaintances is false.

Speed in m/s = (Speed in km/h) * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 60 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 60 * (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 60000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 16.67 m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by the train while passing the bridge using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The time taken to pass the bridge is given as 72 seconds, so: Distance = 16.67 m/s * 72 s Distance = 1200.24 m (approximately) This distance is the sum of the length of the train (let's call it L_train) and the length of the bridge (800 meters): L_train + 800 m = 1200.24 m Now, we can solve for the length of the train: L_train = 1200.24 m - 800 m L_train = 400.24 m Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{400.24}  meters."},{"instruction":"Simplify frac{{1+cos{20}°}}{{2sin{20}°}}sin{10°}left(frac{1}{{tan{5°}}}tan{5°}right)=______.","output":"To simplify the given expression frac{{1+cos{20}°}}{{2sin{20}°}}-sin{10°}left(frac{1}{{tan{5°}}}-tan{5°}right), we proceed as follows: begin{align*} frac{{1+cos{20}°}}{{2sin{20}°}}-sin{10°}left(frac{1}{{tan{5°}}}-tan{5°}right) &= frac{2cos^2{10°}}{4sin{10°}cos{10°}}-sin{10°}left(frac{cos{5°}}{sin{5°}}-frac{sin{5°}}{cos{5°}}right)  &= frac{cos{10°}}{2sin{10°}}-2sin{5°}cos{5°}cdot frac{cos^2{5°}-sin^2{5°}}{sin{5°}cos{5°}}  &= frac{cos{10°}}{2sin{10°}}-2cos{10°}  &= frac{cos{10°}-4sin{10°}cos{10°}}{2sin{10°}}  &= frac{cos{10°}-2sin{20°}}{2sin{10°}}  &= frac{cos{10°}-2sin(30°-10°)}{2sin{10°}}  &= frac{cos{10°}-2(sin{30°}cos{10°}-cos{30°}sin{10°})}{2sin{10°}}  &= cos{30°}  &= frac{sqrt{3}}{2} end{align*} Therefore, the simplified form of the given expression is boxed{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}}."},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, if |overrightarrow{AB}| = 2, |overrightarrow{AC}| = 3, and overrightarrow{AB} cdot overrightarrow{AC} = 3, then the area of triangle ABC is __________.","output":"Given triangle ABC, where the magnitude of vector overrightarrow{AB} is 2 and the magnitude of vector overrightarrow{AC} is 3.

So, the range of values for m is m < 5.     2. The equation of the circle can be transformed into (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 5 - m, where the center of the circle is at C(1, 2) and the radius r = sqrt{5 - m}.    The distance from the circle center C(1, 2) to the line l: x + 2y - 4 = 0 is d = frac{|1 + 2cdot2 - 4|}{sqrt{1^2 + 2^2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{5}}.    Since |MN| = frac{4sqrt{5}}{5}, we have frac{1}{2}|MN| = frac{2}{sqrt{5}}.

Since (frac{1978}{6} > 329), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one country that contains at least 330 members. Let's denote this country as country (A) with the largest member number (m_1). 3. **Difference Operation**:        Subtract the number (m_1) from the numbers of the other members in country (A). We get at least 329 differences, all of which, by assumption, are not the numbers of any members from country (A). Therefore, these differences must be the numbers of members from the remaining five countries. 4. **Further Application of Pigeonhole Principle**:        Since (frac{329}{5} > 65), there must be at least one country among the other five, call it (B), that contains at least 66 of these difference values.

This can be done in binom{10}{2} ways. binom{10}{2} = frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = frac{10 times 9}{2 times 1} = 45 ways **Step 2: Select individuals for tasks B and C** After allocating 2 individuals to task A, we have 8 individuals remaining. We need to select one individual for task B and one for task C. Since the selection is distinct, this is equivalent to arranging 2 people in 2 positions, which is 2!. However, since the individuals are selected from a pool, we also need to choose 2 individuals out of the remaining 8, which can be done in binom{8}{2} ways.

Since the inequality is satisfied for values between these roots, and given the nature of quadratic equations, it indicates that the parabola opens downwards, which means a<0. 2. **Finding a and b**:    - From the roots, we can set up the system of equations based on Vieta's formulas:      [      begin{cases}      -frac{1}{2} + 1 = -frac{b}{a}       -frac{1}{2} times 1 = frac{1}{a}      end{cases}      ]    - Solving this system gives us:      [      begin{cases}      a = -2       b = 1      end{cases}      ] 3. **Transforming the Second Inequality**:    - Substituting a=-2 and b=1 into the inequality bx^{2}-mx-2ageqslant 0 gives us:      [      x^{2} - mx + 4 geqslant 0      ]    - This inequality must hold for all x in [4, +infty). 4. **Determining the Maximum Value of m**:    - We consider two cases based on the vertex of the parabola formed by x^{2} - mx + 4:      - **Case 1**: The vertex frac{m}{2} leqslant 4.

A needle passing through a grid of unit cubes within the cube (each row and column ) would intersect these bricks in an even number of segments, specifically:    - Consider the needle, whenever it crosses from one face to another;    - If each penetration is blocked by some brick, we need to understand this pattern. 5. **Number of bricks along the needle path:**    The structure in terms of unit cubes is such that all penetrations would need an even involvement of bricks because:    - The entire cube consists of (20 times 20 times 20 = 8000) unit cubes.    - Bricks of (2 times 2 times 1) could imply an even count since they're divided into even parts and fit uniformly. 6. **Count of intersecting bricks:**    If a needle intersects any brick of capacity (2 times 2 times 1), and this is assumed for 1083 penetrations:    - Each penetration is blocked by (> 1083 times 2 = 2166) units.    - But our cube can only form from precisely 2000 such units.    - This implies an inherent contradiction.

For our parabola, a=-3 and b=-12, so the axis of symmetry is:    [    x = -frac{-12}{2 cdot (-3)} = -frac{-12}{-6} = 2    ]    This simplifies to x = -2. 2. **Direction of Opening**: Since the coefficient of x^2 (which is -3) is negative, the parabola opens downwards. 3. **Position of Points Relative to the Axis of Symmetry**: The axis of symmetry is at x=-2. We have three points: (-3,y_{1}), (-2,y_{2}), and (1,y_{3}). The point (-3,y_{1}) is to the left of the axis of symmetry, (-2,y_{2}) is on the axis, and (1,y_{3}) is to the right. 4. **Symmetry and Y-Values**: Since the parabola is symmetric about x=-2, and the parabola opens downwards, as x increases from values less than -2 (moving rightward), the y values first increase until the axis of symmetry and then decrease. Therefore, for x < -2, y increases as x increases. This means that as we move from x=-3 to x=-2, y increases, so y_{1} < y_{2}.  5. **Symmetric Points**: The point (1,y_{3}) is symmetric to a point on the left side of the axis of symmetry. This symmetric point would have an x-value of -5 (since it's equally distant from the axis as 1 but on the opposite side). Since -5 < -3 < -2, and we know the parabola opens downwards, it follows that y_{2} > y_{1}. Also, since y values decrease as we move past the axis of symmetry (from left to right), y_{3} is less than y_{1} and y_{2}. 6. **Conclusion**: Combining these observations, we find that y_{2} is the greatest because it's on the axis of symmetry where the parabola reaches its maximum (since it opens downwards), followed by y_{1} which is to the left of the axis, and y_{3} which is to the right and thus the smallest. Therefore, the relationship is:    [    y_{2} > y_{1} > y_{3}    ]    Encapsulating the final answer:    [    boxed{y_{2} > y_{1} > y_{3}}    ]"},{"instruction":"For some integers that are not palindromes, like 127, a person can create a palindrome by repeatedly reversing the number and adding the original number to its reverse.

Therefore:    [    sin alpha sin beta sin gamma leq frac{1}{8}    ] 6.

In the scenario where alpha geq 150^circ, beta and gamma must each be less than 30^circ. Thus, at least one of alpha, beta, gamma is leq 30^circ. **Proof using Contradiction:** 1. Assume for the sake of contradiction that 30^circ < angle PAB, angle PBC, angle PCA < 120^circ. Then:    [    frac{PG}{PA} = sin angle PAB > sin 30^circ = frac{1}{2} implies 2PG > PA    ]    By similar logic:    [    2PM > PB quad text{and} quad 2PN > PC    ] 2. Hence:    [    2(PG + PM + PN) > PA + PB + PC    ]    This contradicts the triangle inequality or Erdős–Mordell inequality, hence our original assumption must be false. **Conclusion:** Hence, there must be a contradiction with our initial assumption, and thus among the angles angle PAB, angle PBC, angle PCA, at least one must indeed be leq 30^circ.

This includes:    - 4 corner cubes per face    - 8 edge cubes per face (excluding corners)    Total = 12 cubes shaded per face. 3. **Shared Shading Between Faces**:    - Each corner cube touches three different faces.    - Each non-corner edge cube touches two different faces.     4. **Total Shaded Cubes Calculations**:    Considering the symmetry:    - 8 corners, each contributing 1 cube 3 times (3 different faces) => All 8 are counting for 3 faces directly.    - 24 edges, each contributing 1 cube 2 times => 12 cubes (as each edge cube contributes to two shaded edges).    - Center cubes on edges (these are non-existent in this shading pattern, but noted for completeness).    The above gives: 8 times 1 + 12 times 2 = 8 + 24 = 32. 5. **Adjustment by Overcounting**:    Since we count every cube only once in its shaded existence, the repeated counts are perfectly matched by the distinct face contributions.

Then we can write f(x_2) - f(x_1) = fleft(frac{x_2}{x_1}right). Since frac{x_2}{x_1} > 1, it follows that fleft(frac{x_2}{x_1}right) < 0 according to the given condition that f(x) < 0 when x > 1. This implies f(x_2) - f(x_1) < 0, which means f(x_2) < f(x_1). Therefore, f(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty).

Otherwise, we could choose a large enough triangle ( mathcal{S} ) covering all but this alone triangle, where one side of ( mathcal{S} ) will lie on ( t ). 4. **Shifting Algorithm**:    - Take ( t ) from either the left side of the leftmost pair or the right side of the rightmost pair and begin shifting it right or left according to the need.    - For ( t ) from the left side of the leftmost pair, shifting it right will always increase/decrease an even number of black triangles on either side of ( t ) due to our construction.    - If we take 2 vertices of ( mathcal{S} ) on ( t ) and the third one on either side of ( t ), we will always miss an even number of black triangles on one side of ( t ) and outside of ( mathcal{S} ), forcing ( n ) to be *ngood*.    - For ( t ) from the right side of the rightmost pair, the same argument works, forcing ( n ) to be *ngood*. 5. **Conclusion for Even ( n )**:    - This works for ( n ge 4 ) (and even, obviously, due to assumption) because of the shifting algorithm. 6. **Claim**: For ( n ge 5 ) and odd, ( n ) is ngood.    - **Proof**:      - Place ( frac{n-1}{2} ) unit black triangles described earlier both above and below ( ell ), and place 1 extra unit black triangle either above or below ( ell ) and somewhere between those ( frac{n-1}{2} ) unit black triangles recently chosen. Call this extra unit black triangle *special*.      - There exists at least one nice pair on either side of this due to ( n ge 5 ).      - Applying the shifting algorithm, we will face no problem until we reach the special triangle from either side. Even then, we will have ( ge 2 ) black triangles on either side, contrary to what we want, that is, one unit black triangle on one side. 7. **Conclusion for Odd ( n )**:    - We just need to check ( n le 3 ). 8. **Check for Small ( n )**:    - For ( n = 1 ), it is trivially true.    - For ( n = 2 ), we could choose one of the two unit black triangles, hence true.    - For ( n = 3 ):      - Let ( r ) be any line in any of ( mathbb{P}, mathbb{Q}, mathbb{R} ). Here ( mathbb{R} ) is the set of all horizontal lines.      - Let ( r' ) be any other line in the same set. Call the two lines ( {r, r'} ), along with the space between them, a *slide* if ( r ) and ( r' ) are consecutive.      - If all 3 unit triangles belong to different slides, the choice of ( mathcal{S} ) is obvious.      - If 2 of the 3 triangles are in the same slide, choose ( mathcal{S} ) such that it contains those 2 triangles and its third vertex lies on the opposite side of the third triangle with respect to the slide containing 2 triangles.      - If all 3 unit black triangles lie in the same slide, choose ( mathcal{S} ) such that it covers either the first and second but not the third, or the second and third but not the first, exhausting all cases. 9. **Final Conclusion**:    - The solution works for ( n = 1, 2, 3 ) only.

Assume ((x_0, y_0)) is a pair of positive integers that gives the smallest possible values of (x_0 + y_0). Without loss of generality, we can assume (x_0 geq y_0). 4.

Recall that the pyramid  SABC has mutually perpendicular lateral edges  SA, SB, and  SC. 1. **Given Geometry:**    - Pyramid  SABC      - Lateral edges:  SA,  SB, and  SC which are mutually perpendicular. 2. **Translation to Coordinate Geometry:**    Let's place the point  S  at the origin in a 3-dimensional coordinate system:    [    S = (0, 0, 0)    ]        Since the edges  SA, SB, and  SC  are mutually perpendicular, we can assign coordinates:    [    A = (a, 0, 0), quad B = (0, b, 0), quad C = (0, 0, c)    ]        Here, ( a, b, ) and ( c ) are positive real numbers representing the lengths of  SA, SB, and  SC respectively. 3. **Vectors Representing  triangle ABC:**    The side vectors of  triangle ABC  in terms of these coordinates are:    [    overrightarrow{AB} = (0 - a, b - 0, 0 - 0) = (-a, b, 0)    ]    [    overrightarrow{BC} = (0 - 0, 0 - b, c - 0) = (0, -b, c)    ]    [    overrightarrow{CA} = (a - 0, 0 - 0, 0 - c) = (a, 0, -c)    ] 4. **Dot Products for Angles in  triangle ABC:**    For  triangle ABC  to be acute-angled, the dot products of each pair of side vectors should be positive:    [    overrightarrow{AB} cdot overrightarrow{BC} > 0    ]    [    overrightarrow{BC} cdot overrightarrow{CA} > 0    ]    [    overrightarrow{CA} cdot overrightarrow{AB} > 0    ] 5. **Calculating the Dot Products:**    [     overrightarrow{AB} cdot overrightarrow{BC} = (-a, b, 0) cdot (0, -b, c) = (-a cdot 0) + (b cdot -b) + (0 cdot c) = -b^2     ]    Since ( b^2 > 0 ),  overrightarrow{AB} cdot overrightarrow{BC} < 0.

Nine of her llamas got pregnant with 1 calf, and 5 of them got pregnant with twins. After they give birth, Jill traded 8 of the calves for 2 new adult llamas. Then she sells some of her herd at the market. Jill now has a total of 18 llamas (calves and adults). What fraction of her herd did Jill sell at the market?","output":"Let's calculate the total number of llamas Jill had after the births and before any were sold or traded. Nine llamas had 1 calf each, so that's 9 calves. Five llamas had twins, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 calves. In total, there were 9 + 10 = 19 calves born. Now, Jill traded 8 of these calves for 2 new adult llamas. So, she lost 8 calves but gained 2 adults. Before the trade, Jill had her original herd of adult llamas plus the 19 new calves. We don't know the number of her original herd, so let's call that number X. After the trade, Jill had X + 19 - 8 = X + 11 llamas (since she traded 8 calves away and gained 2 adults). Now, Jill has a total of 18 llamas after selling some at the market. This means she sold some llamas to go from X + 11 to 18. So, X + 11 = 18 X = 18 - 11 X = 7 Jill originally had 7 adult llamas before the births. After the births and before any were sold or traded, she had 7 adults + 19 calves = 26 llamas. After the trade, she had 7 adults + 11 calves = 18 llamas. Since she now has 18 llamas and she had 26 before selling any, she must have sold 26 - 18 = 8 llamas. To find the fraction of her herd that Jill sold at the market, we take the number of llamas sold and divide it by the total number of llamas she had before selling: 8 sold / 26 total = 8/26 This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: 8/26 ÷ 2/2 = 4/13 So, Jill sold boxed{4/13}  of her herd at the market."},{"instruction":"Compute binom{18}{10}.

Initially, she narrated 27 stories per night; then, as she grew tired, she told 14 stories per night for some period, and during the last few nights, she told only one story per night. Could it be that the total number of stories she told the Sultan is a natural power of two?","output":"Given that Scheherazade narrated stories to the Sultan for 1001 nights, let: - (a) be the number of nights she narrated 27 stories per night, - (b) be the number of nights she narrated 14 stories per night, - (c) be the number of nights she narrated 1 story per night. We are given the equations: 1. (a + b + c = 1001) 2. (27a + 14b + c = 2^k), where (2^k) represents a power of 2. To find out if the total number of stories can be a power of 2, we can substitute (c) from the first equation into the second equation: [ c = 1001 - (a + b) ] So, substituting for (c) in the second equation gives: [ 27a + 14b + (1001 - a - b) = 2^k ] [ 26a + 13b + 1001 = 2^k ] [ 26a + 13b = 2^k - 1001 ] Since (2^k) is a power of 2, it is always even. However, 1001 is an odd number: - Therefore, (2^k - 1001) is odd because the difference of an even number and an odd number is odd. Next, notice that (26a + 13b) is also odd. This is because: - (26a) is even (since 26 is an even number multiplied by any integer (a)), - (13b) is always odd (since 13 is an odd number multiplied by any integer (b)). The sum of an even number and an odd number is odd, thus (26a + 13b) is odd. However, the expression (2^k - 1001) being odd does not immediately disprove the possibility. The crucial point is divisibility: - (2^k) for (k geq 0) does not have factors other than 2.  - The prime factorization of 1001 is (7 times 11 times 13). If we consider: [ 26a + 13b = 2^k - 1001 ] (13b (mod 13) equiv 0 pmod{13} ) [ 26a + 13b = 13(2a + b) ] This means either: [ 2^k - 1001 equiv 0 pmod{13} ] or (2^k equiv 1001 pmod{13} neq 0) However, (2^k) never ends up as a 13- multiple. Considering the simple contradiction arising within the multiplicative properties evaluates out the impossibility of such a scenario.

For which values of N can the crocodile move from any square on an infinite chessboard to any other square?","output":"Given that the infinite chessboard is colored in a checkerboard pattern, let us analyze the movement of the \\"crocodile\\" for different values of ( N ). The movement of the \\"crocodile\\" on a chessboard is defined by two steps: moving one cell horizontally or vertically and then ( N ) cells in the perpendicular direction. 1. **Odd ( N ) Analysis**:     - Consider ( N ) to be odd.     - If the \\"crocodile\\" starts on a white cell (without loss of generality), the first part of its move (one cell horizontally or vertically) will place it on a black cell.     - The second part of the move (moving ( N ) cells in a perpendicular direction) will place it back on a white cell, as ( N ) is odd and the color changes every cell.     - Thus, every move takes the \\"crocodile\\" back to a cell of the same color it started from.    From this, it follows that with odd ( N ), the \\"crocodile\\" will always remain on cells of a single color (either all white or all black) and cannot reach every possible cell on the board. Therefore, it cannot move from any cell to any other cell on the board. 2. **Even ( N ) Analysis**:     - Now, consider ( N ) to be even.     - If the \\"crocodile\\" starts on a white cell:         - The first part of its move (one cell horizontally or vertically) will place the \\"crocodile\\" on a black cell.         - The second part of the move (moving ( N ) cells in a perpendicular direction) will place it back on a white cell, as ( N ) is even and there will be no color change.     - Consequently, every \\"crocodile\\" move acknowledges transitions between cells of different colors, allowing it to reach both white and black cells eventually. 3. **Showing Connectivity**:     - To prove that the \\"crocodile\\" can move from one cell to any adjacent cell (which implies that every other cell is reachable):         - Suppose the \\"crocodile\\" wants to move from cell ((i, j)) to an adjacent cell ((i+1, j)) (one cell up).         - First, move one cell right (ending on ((i, j+1))), then move ( N ) cells up (ending on ((i+N, j+1))).         - Next, move one cell left (ending on ((i+N, j))) and then move ( N ) cells down (ending on ((i, j))).     - Similarly, by continuing this pair of operations ( frac{N}{2} ) times (for even ( N )), one can show that the \\"crocodile\\" reaches any cell in the grid. Consequently, for even ( N ), the \\"crocodile\\" can move from any cell to any other cell on the infinite chessboard. # Conclusion: The \\"crocodile\\" can move from any cell to any other cell on the infinite chessboard if and only if ( N ) is even.

Over 30 days, the total number of brushing sessions is 30 days * 3 times/day = 90 times.

Hence, based on the factorization of this polynomial, we have: [ prod_{i=1}^{n} (p - a_i) = p^n - a_1^n ] 4. **Combining Results**: Substituting this into our expression for varrho_n, we get: [ varrho_{n} = sqrt[n]{|p^n - a_1^n|} = |p| sqrt[n]{1 - left|frac{a_1}{p}right|^n} ] 5. **Limit Analysis**: Note that |p| = overline{P O}. Also, since |a_1| = overline{O A_1} is the radius of the circle and  |p| = overline{P O} > |a_1| , we have: [ left|frac{a_1}{p}right| = left|frac{overline{O A}_{1}}{overline{P O}}right| = lambda < 1 ] 6. **Taking the Limit**: Because lambda < 1 is independent of A_1 and n, as n to infty, lambda^n to 0. Therefore,  [ sqrt[n]{1 - lambda^n} to 1 ] 7. **Conclusion**: Hence, we conclude that: [ varrho_{n} = |p| sqrt[n]{1 - lambda^n} to |p| ] Thus, [ lim_{n rightarrow infty} sqrt[n]{overline{P A}_{1} cdot overline{P A}_{2} cdot ldots cdot overline{P A}_{n}} = overline{P O} ] Therefore, the limit is  [ boxed{overline{P O}} ]"},{"instruction":"the pigeon house of Ma'an Pool Park, a number of pigeons are being raised.

Based on the information that if 75 pigeons are sold, then the pigeon feed can last for 20 days, and if another 100 pigeons are bought, then the pigeon feed can only last for 15 days, we can set up an equation to solve it. Let the total amount of feed be F, and the daily consumption per pigeon be c. From the given information, we have two scenarios: 1. After selling 75 pigeons, the feed can last for 20 days for the remaining pigeons. This gives us the equation:    F = (x - 75) cdot 20 cdot c 2. After buying an additional 100 pigeons, the feed can only last for 15 days for the new total. This gives us the equation:    F = (x + 100) cdot 15 cdot c Setting these two equations equal to each other, since F is the same in both scenarios, we get: (x - 75) cdot 20 = (x + 100) cdot 15 Expanding and simplifying the equation: 20x - 1500 = 15x + 1500 Solving for x: 5x = 3000 x = 600 Therefore, the number of pigeons in the pigeon house is boxed{600}."},{"instruction":"A soccer league consists of ten teams.

However, each match is counted twice in this calculation since, for example, a game zwischen Team X and Team Y is considered once in X's count and once in Y's count.
