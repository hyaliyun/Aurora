Drawing from his own experience, he playfully informed the young woman that her future husband would \\"screw up a bunch,\\" but eventually, with time and patience, men learn the necessary skills for a successful marriage. This insightful marriage advice comes as Michelle Obama, the former First Lady, tweets a photo of the couple's wedding, commemorating their lifelong commitment.

Their union serves as an inspiration to many, showcasing the love and support they share as a couple and as a family. According to Barack Obama, the key to a successful marriage is understanding that, like anyone else, men will make mistakes. He explained that while it may take time for men to learn the ropes of marriage, they will eventually catch on. “Eventually we learn, but it takes us longer,” he quipped. This honest, down-to-earth perspective offers a realistic understanding of what it takes to nurture a loving, lasting relationship. The advice offered by the former President is a testament to the importance of dedication and patience in a marriage.

George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world.

Question: This article: A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu. contains an answer for the question: What were the full names of the two people whose libraries they left formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium?, what is it ?

Rather than excommunicate Bruce, Wishart absolved him and urged people to rise in his support. They both then travelled to Scone, where they were met by Lamberton and other prominent churchmen and nobles. Less than seven weeks after the killing in Dumfries, at Scone Abbey on 25 March 1306, Robert Bruce was crowned as King Robert I of Scotland. He then began a new campaign to free his kingdom. After being defeated in battle, he was driven from the Scottish mainland as an outlaw. Bruce later came out of hiding in 1307. The Scots thronged to him, and he defeated the English in a number of battles. His forces continued to grow in strength, encouraged in part by the death of Edward I in July 1307. The Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 was an especially important Scottish victory. In 1320, the Declaration of Arbroath was sent by a group of Scottish nobles to the Pope affirming Scottish independence from England. Two similar declarations were also sent by the clergy and Robert I. In 1327, Edward II of England was deposed and killed. The invasion of the North of England by Robert the Bruce forced Edward III of England to sign the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton on 1 May 1328, which recognised the independence of Scotland with Bruce as King.

Based on the premise \\"But, in his anxiety, the criminal has drawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free.\\" I was silent. \\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The criminal had full composure and was steady and alert. \\" is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, it is difficult to conclude that the hypothesis \\"The criminal had full composure and was steady and alert\\" is true. The premise does not provide enough evidence relating to the composure, alertness, or steadiness of the criminal. However, we can extract some information from the first sentence and analyze its meaning to further examine the hypothesis. The premise revolves around a criminal, Inglethorp, and the intricately woven net symbolizing the crime. The word \\"anxiety\\" suggests that the criminal is under considerable stress, which could indicate a lack of steady composure. When a person is anxious, they tend to exhibit signs of uneasiness, worry, or fear, which are not typically exhibited by someone who is fully composed, steady, and alert. Furthermore, since the anxiety resulted in the criminal drawing the net too closely, this could insinuate haste or a lack of precision, challenging the idea of the criminal being fully composed and alert to the situation. The second sentence - \\"I was silent.\\" - could be perceived as a reaction to the scenario described in the first sentence. This silence does not provide any additional evidence to support or directly refute the hypothesis. However, the speaker's silence could imply that they are taking time to carefully consider the matter or re-evaluate the hypothesis themselves based on the newly presented information. In summary, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"The criminal had full composure and was steady and alert\\" is true from the given premise. The anxiety experienced by the criminal may suggest that they lacked steady composure. This unfavorable state could have contributed to them making mistakes in the crime, leading to the idea that one can free Inglethorp from the tightly drawn net. However, the premise-by-itself does not provide enough evidence to support or wholly discard the hypothesis. It would be beneficial to gather more information and context to better evaluate the hypothesis's validity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(2) Have an assistant., does the word have mean the same thing?","output":"No, the word \\"have\\" in these two sentences does not exactly mean the same thing. In Sentence 1 (\\"I have a house and a car\\"), \\"have\\" is a verb that shows possession or ownership. In this context, it means that the speaker owns or possess a house and a car.  It is an example of a transitive verb, which means the verb \\"have\\" transfers action from the subject (\\"I\\") to the object (\\"a house\\" and \\"a car\\"). This action is the act of possessing or owning.  On the other hand, in Sentence 2 (\\"Have an assistant\\"), \\"have\\" is used as an imperative verb to indicate a command, request, or advice. Here, the speaker is instructing or advising someone else to employ or get an assistant.  This is a less common use of \\"have\\" and the sentence is less straightforward in meaning than the first. The word \\"have\\" still indicates some form of possession, but in this case instead of stating an existing possession, it suggests an action that should be taken by someone else for getting or possessing something. In both instances, “have” involves possession but one is in the context of stating a possession and the other is in advising or commanding to possess. It's also worth mentioning that accuracy of the interpretation can also somewhat depend on the broader context not given here. For example, \\"Have an assistant\\" could potentially mean that the speaker is stating they have an assistant themselves, if it is in response to a question, such as \\"Do you have any help?\\" but without more context, it's impossible to be sure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Worker X has a defective rate of 0.5% and Worker Y has a defective rate of 0.8%. The combined defective rate of both workers is 0.55%. We need to find out what fraction of the products was checked by Worker Y. Step 2: Set up an equation Let the fraction of products checked by Worker Y be represented by Y.  Then, the fraction of products checked by Worker X would be 1 - Y (since the total fraction must equal 1). Step 3: Use the given information to create the equation The combined defective rate is calculated by taking a weighted average of the defective rates of both workers. So, we can represent this as: (0.005 * (1 - Y)) + (0.008 * Y) = 0.0055 Step 4: Solve the equation for Y 0.005 - 0.005Y + 0.008Y = 0.0055 0.003Y = 0.0005 Y = 0.0005 / 0.003 Y = 1 / 6 Step 5: Choose the correct answer choice The fraction of products checked by Worker Y is 1/6.

The output should be a list with the same length as the input list, containing the products of the odd numbers (or 0 if there are no odd numbers in a list). Here's how to approach the task step by step: 1. Understand the input: The input will be given as a list of lists with integers. For example:    Input: [[-1, -47, -35], [-19, -49], [37, 50, 32, -1, 7], [7, -16, 20, 32], [-50, 6, -36], [-15, 21], [11, 1], [-32, -12, -26], [-9, -39]] 2. Initialize an empty list called 'output' to store the final results. 3. Iterate through the input list using a loop (for example, a for loop). For each inner list:    a. Initialize a variable called 'product' and set it to 1.    b. Iterate through the inner list (using another loop).       i. Check if the current number is odd (e.g., use the modulo operator: number % 2 != 0).       ii. If the number is odd, multiply the 'product' variable by the odd number.    c. After processing the inner list, check if 'product' is still 1 (which means there were no odd numbers). If so, set 'product' to 0.    d. Append the 'product' to the 'output' list. 4. After processing all inner lists, the resulting 'output' list contains the products of odd numbers for each inner list. Return this 'output' list as the final result. Using the provided example: Input: [[-1, -47, -35], [-19, -49], [37, 50, 32, -1, 7], [7, -16, 20, 32], [-50, 6, -36], [-15, 21], [11, 1], [-32, -12, -26], [-9, -39]] Output: [1645, 931, -259, 7, 0, -315, 11, 0, 351]"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She attends groups with her two friends, Alisha (Julia Garro) and Phil (Adam Wagner). One evening after giving her speech talking about the purity ring those in the group wear and what it means, she is introduced to Tobey (Hale Appleman) and finds him attractive. The four begin going out as a group, and Dawn has fantasies of marrying Tobey, although after acknowledging the attraction they agree that they cannot spend time together.One day, Dawn and Tobey and their friends meet at a local swimming lake. After swimming together, Dawn and Tobey go in to a cave to get warm and begin kissing. Dawn gets uncomfortable and tries to get them to go back. Tobey then attempts to force sex on Dawn, who panics and tries to push him off. Tobey becomes aggressive and shakes Dawn, resulting in her smacking her head on the ground. While she is recovering from disorientation, Tobey takes this as his chance to begin raping her. Dawn fights back and inadvertently bites off his penis with her vagina. Horrified, he stumbles away and she flees the scene. After a Promise meeting, she meets her classmate Ryan (Ashley Springer) at a dance; they talk, and he drops her off at her home.Dawn drops her purity ring off of a cliff and even goes back to the swimming hole, only causing her to scream in horror because a freshwater crab was crawling on Tobey's penis.

Continue the following story. Unlike Monica, Katrina had a hard time getting a loan due to her credit score.","output":"Katrina sat across from the loan officer, nervously fidgeting with her fingers. The bland, sterile walls of the bank did nothing to help ease her anxiety. She thought the process of getting a loan would be straightforward, but her mounting financial issues were catching up to her now. She couldn't help but compare herself to her best friend, Monica, who had recently secured a loan with seemingly no trouble at all. \\"Mrs. Thompson, I'm sorry to inform you that your loan application has been denied,\\" said the loan officer in a dry, emotionless tone. She proceeded to explain that the reason for the rejection was Katrina's poor credit score. Feeling defeated, Katrina took a deep breath and thanked the officer for her time, doing her best to hide the embarrassment and disappointment she felt. Upon leaving the bank, Katrina decided to take a long walk to clear her head. She knew she needed to take matters into her own hands to rectify her credit score, as her rejection at the bank weighed heavily on her mind. If people like Monica could secure a loan with such ease, why couldn't she do the same? Was her situation that much worse, or had she somehow not been as careful as she should have been with her finances? Determined to get answers, Katrina headed home and began searching online for ways to improve her credit score. She spent hours researching, understanding the factors that led to a lower credit score, and learning how she could tackle each of these issues step by step. First and foremost, Katrina realized she had too much debt relative to her income. This factor was making her a risky borrower in the eyes of the bank. She decided to take up a part-time job to increase her earnings and allocated a portion of her new income toward paying down her credit card balances, prioritizing those with the highest interest rates. In her research, Katrina also discovered the importance of paying bills on time. She was surprised to find out that her cell phone bill, which she occasionally paid a week or two late, was negatively impacting her credit score. To avoid any further late payments, she set up automatic bill payments for all of her monthly expenses. Additionally, Katrina understood that it was essential to have a mix of credit, which the creditors view as an indication of responsible borrowing. Though she had a few credit cards, she barely used any of them, which wasn't helping her credit score either. Consequently, Katrina strategized to make small purchases on each of her credit cards and pay off the balance in full every month without incurring interest. Katrina's determination didn't waver, and she soldiered on through months of consistent hard work to improve her credit score piece by piece. The part-time job pushed her to her limits, but she held onto the hope that it would all be worth it in the end. A year later, Katrina found herself back in the cold, sterile bank. This time, equipped with her newfound knowledge about credit scores, she felt much more confident about her chances of getting the loan. And sure enough, she was greeted with the loan officer's approval. As Katrina excitedly signed the loan documents, she couldn't help but think back to the days when she compared herself to Monica and the journey that led her to this very moment. Through persistence and understanding, she had successfully turned her financial life around. With her regained self-esteem, she realized that every hardship she had overcome had only made her a stronger person. She left the bank that day with a loan in her name, ready to create a brighter future and undeterred by the challenges that may come her way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: bored about planning a wedding  B: excited  C: elated to be engaged to Austin Answer:","output":"The context provided doesn't directly specify the girlfriend's reaction or feelings to Austin's proposal. However, considering the normal joy and anticipation affiliated with such a scenario, we can make an educated guess regarding her presumed response. In light of that, option B: \\"excited\\" and option C: \\"elated to be engaged to Austin\\" potentially stands as valid responses. We can rule out option A: \\"bored about planning a wedding\\" as it is somewhat negative and doesn't align with the romantic context of a marriage proposal, hence it can be seen as incongruous. However, between options B and C, the latter seems to be more appropriate as it is more explicit and relevant to the context provided. While both \\"excitement\\" and \\"elation\\" denote a positive emotional response, option C: \\"elated to be engaged to Austin\\" not only captures the emotional intensity more adequately, but it also specifically connects the feeling to the individual (Austin), who is directly involved in this scenario. So, in conclusion, according to the context provided, the answer that best answers the question, \\"How would their girlfriend feel as a result?\\" would be C: \\"elated to be engaged to Austin\\" due to its specificity and emotional approximation.

MTV show, based on a documentary, unites online crushes. People often aren't what they seem from behind a computer screen. Tips: \\"Stalk\\" before meeting, don't meet at your home, bring a friend.","output":"Title: Safeguarding the Spark: A Guide to Navigating Online Relationships Turn Real-Life Encounters Online dating has become the new frontier of forming connections and relationships, especially in a world that's increasingly moving online. While this form of connection has expanded the possibilities for finding love, it also comes with risks. The creators of the popular MTV show “Catfish,” based on the documentary of the same name, emphasize the importance of playing it safe when meeting an online acquaintance in real life. “Catfish” brings online crushes together, highlighting the reality that people often aren't what they seem from behind a computer screen. With this in mind, here are some vital tips to ensure your safety and well-being when transitioning an online relationship to reality. Tip 1: Perform a Background Check Before you decide to meet your online crush, consider doing a bit of “stalking” to ensure they are a genuine person and not someone with ill intentions. Use social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn to verify their identity. You can discover mutual connections, gather additional information about their interests, and check their consistency with what they have shared online. Additionally, try to perform a simple Google search on their name or photos to see if any red flags appear. In today's world, it's better to be safe than sorry. Tip 2: Choose a Public Venue for the First Meeting When preparing to meet your online acquaintance, insist on having the first encounter at a public place. Busy venues like coffee shops, restaurants, or parks are ideal locations, as they have a constant flow of people. By choosing such locations, you help ensure a safe environment where both parties feel comfortable. Avoid meeting at your home or their home, as it can put you in a vulnerable situation. Remember, safety first! Tip 3: Bring a Friend Along Another vital tip to consider is bringing a friend to your first meeting with your online crush. This additional measure adds a layer of security and reassurance, as your friend can offer support and intervene if things become uncomfortable. Your friend can also provide valuable feedback on their perception of your crush, giving you a chance to assess whether the person is genuine and suitable for you. If you're unable to bring along a friend, try to share your date's information, such as their name, photo, and your meeting location, with someone you trust, and keep them updated throughout the encounter. Tip 4: Listen to Your Intuition When meeting your online crush for the first time, trust your instincts. If something about the person feels off or disconcerting, it's essential to act accordingly to protect yourself. Remember that it's alright to end the meeting if you feel uncomfortable or unsafe at any point. Prioritize your safety and listen to your intuition; it exists for a reason. In conclusion, transitioning from an online relationship to real-life meetings can be an exciting and transformative experience. While it opens the door to potentially fulfilling relationships, it is crucial to approach these situations with caution and prioritize your safety. By taking the necessary precautions and utilizing the tips provided by the “Catfish” creators, you can effectively safeguard yourself while exploring new connections.

Although Farrell is clearly in love, it is implied that Susan is involved with someone else.During his next Naval deployment to the Phillippines, Farrell rescues a sailor from his ship during a storm and becomes a hero. He is brought back to Washington to work at the Pentagon in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Secretary of Defense David Brice (Gene Hackman) is aware that his General Counsel Scott Pritchard (Will Patton) is an old friend of Farrell's. Brice is attempting to cancel a white elephant \\"Phantom Sub\\" project that has powerful political backing. Brice decides that Farrell should act as his direct liaison to the CIA. The real purpose is to gather information about whether the Soviets really are working on such a project.Soon after, Farrell finds out that the other man in Susan's life is Secretary Brice. However, Brice in turn learns of Susan's infidelity. While demanding the name of her new lover, he slaps Susan in a jealous rage and fatally knocks her off an indoor balcony.Ready to turn himself in, Brice is persuaded by Pritchard to cover up everything and blame it on someone else. They concoct a story that claims Susan's other lover was in fact a KGB sleeper agent code-named \\"Yuri.\\" In the aftermath, they focus all attention on an attempt to capture him. Confident that \\"Yuri\\" doesn't exist, Director of Central Intelligence Marshall (Fred Dalton Thompson) dismisses the possibility of it being Pritchard having an affair with Susan, saying that Pritchard is homosexual.Brice appoints the unknowing Farrell to lead the investigation to find Susan's other lover; the KGB spy. Farrell is thus placed in the position of attempting to find evidence that could falsely implicate himself. The only forensic evidence in the case is a badly damaged Polaroid negative recovered from Susan's house, which requires lengthy computerized processing to become visible. Aware that it is his face on the blurred photo, Farrell pleads with systems analyst Sam Hesselman, an old friend, to slow down the processing and confides in him about his secret affair with Susan Atwell. While the processing takes place, Farrell sets about re-directing attention back onto Brice. He does this by searching government printouts for evidence that Brice gave Susan a present which was a government-registered gift from Morocco.Pritchard harasses Nina Beka, a close friend of Susan's, by threatening deportation back to South Africa. Then he sends covert assassins to \\"take care of\\" her. Farrell comes to Nina's rescue just in time.A suspicious Sam goes to Pritchard with concerns about what Farrell told him. Realizing that Sam can implicate Brice, Pritchard shoots him in cold blood.A race develops between two pieces of evidence: the processing of the picture implicating Farrell and a printout of the gift's registration implicating Secretary Brice. Farrell obtains the printout first and confronts Brice with the evidence. Brice shifts the blame to Pritchard, arguing that Pritchard was jealous of his relationship with Susan. A devastated Pritchard commits suicide with a pistol right there in his office. When the military police enter, the guilt-ridden Brice then turns himself in as being the one who killed Susan Atwell and that her KGB lover never existed.The film ends with a surprising plot twist. Several days later, Farrell is mourning at Susan's grave when two plainclothes men arrive and take him away for questioning to a local hotel where another man emerges from behind a two-way mirror. The interrogator is Farrell's landlord Mr. Schiller (Michael Shillo). After a few moments, he addresses Farrell in Russian and Farrell responds in kind. Farrell is, in fact, the real \\"Yuri,\\" and his landlord is his KGB supervisor and handler. Yuri/Farrell was planted in the U.S.A. as a teenager and became the \\"mole\\" in the Department of Defense this whole time. As the KGB was aware of Brice's affair, Farrell was assigned to seduce Atwell and gather intelligence from the Secretary of Defense's mistress. Although his handlers demand that he return to the Soviet Union immediately since his cover was nearly blown, Farrell refuses and leaves. The KGB agents are about to chase after him when Schiller stops them and tells them to let Farrell go for the time being. Schiller quips: \\"He'll be back.

Answer:","output":"Yes, Mervyn LeRoy and Nicholas Ray are both American film directors who have made significant contributions to the world of cinema during their respective careers, shaping the industry and inspiring many future filmmakers. Each director has a unique filmmaking style, and their work has left an indelible mark on the history of American cinema. Mervyn LeRoy (1900-1987) was an acclaimed American film director, producer, and occasional actor, who is best remembered for his work during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Born in San Francisco, California, LeRoy established himself as a prominent figure in the entertainment industry with an extensive career that spanned nearly five decades. He directed over 75 films, earning numerous accolades and earning a reputation as a versatile filmmaker who could adeptly handle various genres, from crime dramas and musicals to war films and biographies. LeRoy's most notable work includes the classic gangster film \\"Little Caesar\\" (1931), which starred Edward G. Robinson and helped solidify the genre's conventions. He also directed the highly successful musical \\"Gold Diggers of 1933\\" (1933) and the iconic drama \\"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\\" (1932), which challenged the injustices of the American prison system. Perhaps his most famous accomplishment, however, is the beloved film adaptation of L. Frank Baum's \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" (1939), which he produced. LeRoy's influence on the American film industry is undeniable, as his work helped shape the course of cinema and left a lasting impression on audiences worldwide. Nicholas Ray (1911-1979) was another influential American film director, renowned for his innovative visual style and distinctive storytelling techniques. Born in Galesville, Wisconsin, Ray studied architecture under the legendary Frank Lloyd Wright before entering the world of film. His background in architecture shaped his unique approach to filmmaking, in which he often manipulated spatial relationships to create tension and emotional impact. Ray's directorial career took off in the 1940s as he gained recognition for his film-noir classic \\"They Live by Night\\" (1948), which featured groundbreaking use of helicopter shots and atmospheric lighting. Known for his exploration of themes like alienation and rebelliousness, Ray went on to direct many influential films, including the noir thriller \\"In a Lonely Place\\" (1950) with Humphrey Bogart and the western \\"Johnny Guitar\\" (1954), starring Joan Crawford. Ray's most famous work is undoubtedly \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" (1955), which starred James Dean and Natalie Wood and became a cultural touchstone for its poignant portrayal of teenage angst and rebellion in postwar America. In conclusion, Mervyn LeRoy and Nicholas Ray were both American film directors who made significant contributions to the world of cinema. While their styles and thematic focuses varied, the impact of their work on the American film industry and the broader landscape of cinema cannot be overstated. Their careers, spanning nearly five decades each, showcase the breadth of their talents and solidify their places as influential figures in the history of American filmmaking."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

As the situation in Iraq escalates, the U.S. finds itself awkwardly aligned with a country once vilified as part of the \\"Axis of Evil.\\" While Iraq loses control of its western border to ISIS rebels, the U.S. decides to pragmatically turn to its geopolitical interests to calm this disaster. The unlikely result is Iran sending military weaponry and planes -- including Russian combat jets -- across the Iranian border to aid the Iraqi national army. This shift in alliance seemed implausible a few years ago, but since President Hassan Rouhani took office last year tensions between the U.S. and Iran have slowly and cautiously thawed. While Iraq plummets into further chaos and fragmentation -- the Kurds are expected to vote for full autonomy in an impending referendum -- improvement in U.S-Iran relations may be the only silver-lining in this otherwise catastrophic affair.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: Now that he's been formally sentenced to death, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will soon become a resident of federal death row, joining 61 other killers who've been condemned to die by lethal injection at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana.      There he will wait — likely for a very long time.      Just how long depends on a range of factors, mainly the strength of his legal appeals and the future of lethal injection drugs. But it's safe to assume that it will be several years before he is put to death.      Despite the name, there isn't much death on death row. ||||| At 21, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is about to become the youngest, most notorious inmate on federal death row.      After convicting the Russian immigrant last month in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, a jury on Friday voted to sentence him to death for his role in the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11.      When Tsarnaev is formally sentenced this summer, it may be the last time he is seen in public, but the legal battle over his case is certain to drag on for years before any execution is carried out.      For now he remains in the custody of U.S. marshals here in Boston. After sentencing, he will be turned over to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and eventually deposited at the death house in Terre Haute, Ind., on the banks of the Wabash River.      From there, over the next 10 years or more, his defense team will wage the final fight for his life.      His current defense lawyers, led by widely known anti-death-penalty advocate Judy Clarke, failed to persuade jurors to spare Tsarnaev from death row. The next legal battle will be with a new team of appellate lawyers who will try to win, at a minimum, a new hearing on whether life with no parole is the more appropriate punishment.      \\"It will be a very slow, torturous process,\\" said Charles Ewing, a University at Buffalo law professor.      Interviews with several attorneys and experts on capital litigation suggest there is little chance Tsarnaev will see his conviction set aside. In March, on the first day of his trial, Clarke conceded to the jury that Tsarnaev placed one of the two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line in April 2013 that helped kill three people and injure more than 260 others.      He and his older brother, Tamerlan, later shot to death an MIT police officer.      But experts say Tsarnaev does have a reasonably good chance of getting the death sentence set aside, based largely on his lawyers' repeated requests to move the trial out of Boston. The defense contended for months last year that the Boston community was too deeply scarred and that no local jury could give him a fair and impartial trial. The judge refused to hold a hearing on the matter, and a local appellate court declined to intervene.      It will easily be a decade before the death sentence is even carried out. People looking for closure are not going to get it. — Charles Ewing, University at Buffalo law professor      The Tsarnaev appellate team also may have a shot at vacating the death sentence if they can show the judge did not properly instruct the jurors, specifically in not telling them that if they deadlocked it would not result in a new trial. A deadlock would have meant a life sentence, but some jurors may not have understood that.      \\"The best would be to get him a new punishment phase,\\" said John Blume, a Cornell University law professor and director of the school's Death Penalty Project.      \\"There have been other cases that sometimes produce a death sentence because some jurors were leaning toward life and the other jurors beat them up [verbally] and said, 'If we don't do this, if we don't do our duty and give him death, another jury will have to listen to this brutal, gory testimony.'\\"      Tsarnaev's appellate lawyers also could challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and question whether his trial attorneys performed effectively. But most lawyers watching the case praised Clarke's decision to admit his guilt, saying such honesty was probably appreciated by the jury.      Because this is a federal death penalty case, an appeal is automatic. It begins with an initial request to the judge for a new trial. It ends years later, when the execution date is near, with a plea to the president for commutation.      The formal sentencing hearing is expected within about two months, and because the judge cannot reduce the sentence, much of that proceeding will be courtroom theater.      Prosecutors said they are reviewing lists of survivors and relatives of the dead to choose which ones will offer victim impact testimony. From the bench, Judge George A. O'Toole Jr. could have harsh words for Tsarnaev when he formally imposes the death sentence.      And Tsarnaev, who did not testify at his trial and has shown no public remorse, would have one last opportunity to speak. But whatever he would say would not change the outcome and could, experts said, harm his future appeals.      \\"It's up to him, but I don't recommend it,\\" said Andrew Flier, a Los Angeles-area criminal defense lawyer who earlier served as a prosecutor. \\"There's no benefit to it. If he's sorry, he should have said it sooner.\\"      According to the Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington-based policy group that tracks capital punishment, there were 61 inmates on federal death row as of March 24.      Since the reinstatement of the federal death penalty in 1988, 74 defendants have been sentenced to death, and three have been executed. Through legal appeals, 10 others have been transferred off death row.      Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh was convicted in 1997 and executed in 2001. He had a short time on death row because he dropped all appeals and asked to be put to death.      The last federal execution was in 2003, when decorated 1991 Gulf War veteran Louis Jones Jr. was executed for killing a young female recruit.      Three inmates — members of a violent Richmond, Va., street gang — have been on death row since 1993, another sign of the slow, winding process from the courtroom to the death chamber. The process is filled with legal appeals, psychological examinations, DNA testing, the search for new evidence and other twists as defense lawyers try anything to keep their clients from that trip to the chamber.      The process can be particularly difficult for victims who want to get past the constant reminders, and was one reason many in Boston preferred a life sentence over death. With a life sentence, they argued, Tsarnaev would be locked away and forgotten.      \\"It will easily be a decade before the death sentence is even carried out,\\" Ewing said. \\"People looking for closure are not going to get it. When it eventually happens, this will be way out of people's consciousness.\\"      richard.serrano@latimes.com      Twitter: @Rick.SerranoLAT ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A man named Dzhokhar Tsarnaev did something very bad when he placed a bomb at the Boston Marathon in 2013.

The elks walk on the riverbanks. They eat the new grass and roots of baby trees. The beavers   need the trees to build dams. The dams raise the water levels. Higher water levels put more water into the soil. Moist soil helps plants grow faster. The plants offer homes and food to other animals. Chase thinks that the park rules would work only in a park with natural settings. He believes that Yellowstone has had an artificial setting for a long time. The native people left.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.  Now, I have a new situation: Jennifer is currently looking for a new city to move to since she is looking to change her life and just do something different. Jennifer is a strong environmentalist and doesn't want to move to a city that contributes a lot to climate change since she feels it's every person's duty to take care of the Earth. She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity. Dapperton, the other city she is considering, has a neat hobby shop that Jennifer likes and the city uses nuclear power for its electricity needs.  Answer this question please: Which city is more likely to run out of the material used to generate electricity first? A:","output":"Based on the background and situation given, Dapperton, the city that relies on nuclear power for its electricity needs, is more likely to run out of the material used to generate electricity first. This is because radioactive elements used in nuclear power generation, such as uranium and plutonium, are relatively rare and limited compared to fossil fuels like coal. While both fossil fuels and radioactive elements are finite resources, the abundance and availability of coal is generally higher than that of radioactive elements. In the U.S., coal reserves are vast and can potentially last for many decades, if not centuries, with advanced mining technologies and efficient utilization. On the other hand, the global supply of radioactive elements necessary for nuclear fission is comparatively scarce, and their extraction and processing can be more complex and costly. However, it's essential to consider the environmental impact of both energy sources. While Dapperton may run out of nuclear fuel sooner, it does not release air pollution or contribute to other environmental issues like acid rain and global warming typically associated with burning fossil fuels, such as coal used in Jamestown. This aspect aligns with Jennifer's values as a strong environmentalist, and she may prioritize the city's energy source's environmental impact over its longevity. In conclusion, Dapperton is more likely to run out of the material used to generate electricity first due to the rarity and limited availability of radioactive elements. However, its environmental advantages over burning fossil fuels might make it a more appealing option for Jennifer, despite the potential issues with resource scarcity."},{"instruction":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Article:Half a century on, consumers are used to a range of convenient ways to pay, but back in 1966 there was a feeling of change when people tried to brandish their exciting new plastic cards. \\"When it arrived I didn't really know what it was,\\" admits Liz Hodgkinson, who was a fresh-faced 22-year-old just out of university. The company sent out some 1.25 million plastic cards to Barclays customers from 29 June 1966 and while some sent them back or never used them, many, like Liz, a writer, embraced the new way of paying. \\"There was an explanatory letter from Barclays which said it was issuing the cards to its best customers. It was a terrific revolution as far as women were concerned as previously you had to have a male guarantor to get credit.\\" At the time, the bank said: \\"[Barclaycard's] purpose is to reduce the use of cash in shopping and other transactions and the scheme is designed to appeal not only to those who must travel and spend a good deal of money in restaurants, but also to the everyday shopper throughout the country.\\" It also stressed the benefits to retailers and businesses by pointing out that the card would help in \\"reducing or eliminating the book-keeping now needed to maintain customers' credit accounts.\\" Once she'd worked out its advantages, Liz used her card as soon as possible. \\"I realised that I could buy something without having to pay for it there and then and could have three weeks' grace. It meant I didn't have to wait until payday. \\"It made me feel very special. My husband banked at Lloyds at the time so didn't get one.\\" In fact it took Barclays' High Street rivals six years to respond. By the time a group comprising Lloyds, NatWest and Midland (now HSBC) launched the now-scrapped Access card in 1972, there were 1.7 million Barclaycard holders. Today the company says it has 10.5 million consumer customers as well as many more business customers. In the intervening period, the world of plastic cards has changed completely. In 1966 Barclaycard charged an annual interest rate of 1.5% but expected payment by the end of the month. The idea of revolving credit, where a card can be used to maintain a longer borrowing, only started in 1967 when Barclaycard offered up to three months' credit. Now, of course, it's possible to be in debt to a credit card for a lifetime and the average interest charged on outstanding balances is 18.9%. The borrowing limits in 1966 were much more modest, too. Cardholders were offered up to £100 worth of credit. Now the average is around £4,000, the company says. Looking ahead, plastic cards will take over from cash to become the UK's most frequently used payment method by 2021, reckons Payment UK. The growth will be driven by \\"the next generation of account holders\\", says the UK Cards Association as \\"younger people are more likely to embrace new technologies such as contactless cards and mobile payments.\\" But the older generation is getting in on the act, too. Liz Hodgkinson, now 72, reveals: \\"I have an app on my phone to make contactless payments,\\" although she admits: \\"It was set up by my grandson!\\" While the introduction of plastic in 1966 may have given cardholders like Liz a feeling of confidence, the evolution of the credit card also meant the danger of getting into debt very much became a reality. \\"I was elated to get an Access card when I was aged 18,\\" says Karen Wake, 55, a pension expert. But her happiness didn't last. \\"By the age of 25 I had built up £30,000 worth of debt. \\"I worked hard to pay it off in five to six years and have had no debt since then,\\" she says. \\"Despite the fact I now work in the financial services industry, that didn't equip me to manage my finances at a young age.\\" Today, many people happily use credit cards for convenience - often earning rewards or cashback - while paying the balance off every month to ensure there are no charges. But overspending and building up long-term debt remain big problems. Mike O'Connor, chief executive of the debt charity Step Change, says: \\"The average credit card debt we see is £8,403 and last year we dealt with more than 200,000 people with £1.7bn of credit card debts.\\" He says the Financial Conduct Authority should reform the market to ensure that credit cards work better for consumers, especially those in financial difficulty. \\"Small changes to existing rules, such as increasing minimum payments from 1% to 2% of the balance or fixing minimum repayments so that they don't fall as the balance declines, could save people thousands of pound and cut years off repayment periods,\\" says Mr O'Connor. A summary of the above article is?","output":"A long time ago, in 1966, people only used cash to buy things. Then, a bank named Barclays introduced a plastic card called a credit card that allowed people to buy things without using cash right away. People could buy something and pay for it later. This was a big change and made many people excited. Today, there are many credit cards and people use them in different ways, like using their phones to make payments. Soon, it is believed that plastic cards will be used more than cash in the United Kingdom. However, credit cards have also caused some people to owe a lot of money, which can be a problem."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A Living Will is intended to convey your instructions for life-sustaining medical treatment in the event of a terminal illness or serious accident. It names someone to serve as your agent. This person, often a spouse or family member, consults the information provided in the documents and makes decisions about your care. Without a Living Will, you risk having decisions about your medical treatment made without consultation. This includes starting, maintaining, and ending life support systems, even if the person in control knows that the decision is against your wishes. Without a Living Will, your family members and loved ones may disagree about the right course of action in an emergency.  Often, it is easier for people to make life and death decisions when they are guided by your wishes in a Living Will. It also reduces the stress on loved ones at an already stressful time. Additionally, your wishes are more likely to be followed and respected by your loved ones if they have guidance in writing. A Living Will is not the same as a Last Will and Testament. The Living Will does not provide instructions for any disposition of your property after your death, with the exception of organ donation. Living Wills also do not cover every situation. For example, you may need treatment that is not contemplated by your Living Will. In this situation, you will need an agent appointed by a Medical Power of Attorney to make medical decisions for you when you are incapacitated. In addition to a Living Will, you should also create a Medical Power of Attorney (also called a “Healthcare Power of Attorney”). With this legal document, you will appoint someone to make medical decisions for you should you become incapacitated. Whereas a Living Will only applies if you are in a terminal condition, a Medical Power of Attorney will apply so long as you are incapacitated.  In the Medical Power of Attorney, you appoint an agent who can consent, refuse, or withdraw consent for any type of medical care or procedure. For more information on medical power of attorney, consult wikiHow’s How to Write a Medical Power of Attorney. POLST programs are designed to assure that the medical treatment wishes you express are honored by health care professionals as you move from one health care setting to another. They are available in about a dozen states. POLST programs are helpful if the health care workers do not have access to your Living Will, or if your Living Will is not specific enough to envision the different treatments that you may or may not want.  POLST can substitute for a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order. With a DNR, you can state that you do not want CPR. However, a POLST is much broader and also states your wishes with respect to intubation, antibiotic use, and feeding tubes.  Doctors sometimes will also ignore a Living Will. For this reason you should create a POLST, if one is available in your state. To make sure that your wishes are carried out, you will need a Living Will, a Medical Power of Attorney, and a POLST. All are necessary, especially if you are facing an imminent end-of-life situation. Summary:","output":"A Living Will is a special paper that tells people what to do if you get really sick and can't talk to them. It helps you pick someone, like a family member, who can make choices about how to take care of you when you can't do it yourself. This way, people know what you want, even if you can't tell them. There are other papers too, like a Medical Power of Attorney, that help with different choices if you get sick. Sometimes, there's another paper called POLST, which can tell doctors more about what you want if things get really bad. It's important to have these papers so that people know what to do and how to take care of you, just in case something happens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Image copyright AFP      Volkswagen has overtaken Toyota to become the world's best-selling carmaker, the first time the German company has held the position.      Japan's Toyota, which had topped sales for the past four years, sold 10.175 million vehicles globally in 2016.      That fell short of the 10.31 million sales which VW reported last week.      The milestone comes despite VW's scandal over emissions tests cheating, which sparked a global backlash and multiple lawsuits.      A spokesman for VW said: \\"2016 was a very challenging year for us.\\"      The company \\"made strides in resolving and overcoming the diesel crisis\\" and initiated fundamental change in the company's long-term strategy, he said.      \\"Nonetheless, we managed to stabilise operating business in difficult conditions: the fact that we handed over more than 10 million vehicles to customers last year bolsters the group and its brands as we head for the future,\\" he added.      Image copyright Reuters      Volkswagen, which makes the Audi, Porsche and Skoda brands, saw a 3.8% increase in sales buoyed by demand in China.      And it has been making inroads in other markets too. In Sweden for example, the Volkswagen Golf was the most popular new car in 2016 - the first time in more than half a century that a Volvo hadn't topped the country's sales.      Toyota's sales grew by 0.2% - though it appears to have suffered from a slowdown in the US car industry.      General Motors reports its figures next week, but it is expected to lag both the Japanese and the German firms.      GM was the world's third-largest carmaker in 2015. It held the number one title in 2011 after Toyota's production was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami in north-eastern Japan. ||||| Volkswagen AG dethroned Toyota Motor Corp. last year to become the world’s best-selling automaker for the first time, propelled by surging demand in China which has been largely unaffected by the diesel-cheating scandal.      Volkswagen sold a record 10.3 million vehicles in 2016, outpacing its rival with a 3.8 percent gain from a year earlier. Toyota’s global sales, including its Hino Motors Ltd. and Daihatsu Motor Co. units, rose 0.2 percent to 10.2 million vehicles in 2016, the Japanese automaker said on Monday.      Taking the global sales crown marks the bittersweet culmination of an aggressive expansion that former Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn kick-started 10 years ago. While surging demand in China and the popularity of the upscale Audi and Porsche brands’ lineups boosted worldwide deliveries, the VW marque lost market share in Europe, its second-biggest region, following revelations in 2015 that the company manipulated diesel engines to pass emissions tests.      VW group deliveries last year rose 12.2 percent in China, where the scandal is a non-issue because the automaker sells almost no diesel vehicles there. Sales in Europe gained 4 percent, less than the overall sector, while the crisis fallout hurt demand in the U.S. and recessions cut sales in Russia and South America.      The increase in sales tax on small-engine vehicles is set to weigh on deliveries this year in China, Volkswagen’s biggest national market, while in Germany, its home country, the namesake VW brand has started scaling back its large leasing fleet for employees, slowing growth. The marque accounted for almost 6 million of global group deliveries last year, and it’s targeting more than 3 million car sales in China this year.      Threat Looms      Toyota’s sales last year lagged behind Volkswagen mainly due to its performance in the U.S. and China, with demand for its flagship Camry sedan waning in the U.S. and sales in China expanding at a slower pace than the overall market. Looking ahead, Toyota must contend with possible trade tensions as U.S. President Donald Trump pressures foreign automakers to make more cars and trucks in the U.S.      “The development of the U.S. market is set to decide if VW can stay ahead of Toyota this year,” Sascha Gommel, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Commerzbank AG, said by phone. “If the Chinese and European markets continue to be solid and the U.S. market weakens as I expect, VW might stay first in 2017 as Toyota has a larger exposure to North America.”      Read more: Why Trump’s ‘Big Border Tax’ Gets Taken Seriously: QuickTake Q&A      Since his inauguration, Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord, reaffirmed a campaign promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement involving Mexico and met with automakers to persuade them to keep production within the U.S.      Toyota will invest 10 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, maintaining its pace of spending during the last half decade, joining other manufacturers with highlighting projects in response to pressure from Trump to create jobs in America. After criticizing Toyota’s plans to build a Corolla plant in Mexico, Trump rebuked Japan last week for sending the U.S. hundreds of thousands of cars from what he said were “the biggest ships I’ve ever seen.”      VW Restructuring      “Trump is a bigger risk for Toyota than for Volkswagen because the German carmaker has a small exposure to the U.S. market,” said Ken Miyao, an analyst at Tokyo-based market researcher Carnorama. “Toyota has made investment to build a new plant in Mexico and will have limited options to appeal to Trump.”      As part of a far-reaching overhaul under new division chief Herbert Diess, the VW brand has embarked on a restructuring push outside China and will boost its lineup of sport utility vehicles, the industry’s fastest-growing segment, where it lags behind Toyota and General Motors. Growth in China in recent years had masked weak returns in Europe and an ill-fated product strategy in Brazil, a former VW stronghold. In a U.S. comeback push, it’s rolling out the Atlas mid-size SUV and smaller Tiguan crossover with a longer wheelbase.      The VW brand in Europe still largely depends on the Golf hatchback and Passat sedan and station wagon, models in market segments that are being squeezed as customers shift to SUVs. It has revamped the Golf to stabilize sales, and that vehicle’s decline has been partly offset by surging demand for the updated Tiguan SUV.      VW executives have become tight-lipped about sales-volume targets as the company’s focus shifts toward safeguarding profits and preparing for a future where vehicle ownership becomes less relevant as ride-hailing and car-sharing gain in popularity.      “Our new strategy through 2025 doesn’t include any sales targets any more,” Dietmar Voggenreiter, sales chief at VW’s premium-car unit Audi said in an interview this month. “These times are over.”      — With assistance by Masatsugu Horie ||||| TOKYO—Toyota Motor Corp. is no longer the world’s largest car maker by vehicle sales, relinquishing a title held since 2012.

Here are possible answers to this question: - enjoyment - good sometimes - immobilize - feels good - good feeling  I believe the correct choice is \\"feels good\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"When a patient receives a sedative from a doctor, the primary purpose is to alleviate their pain or anxiety and help them feel more relaxed. Sedatives, which are medications that have a calming effect, can ease the symptoms of various ailments, making the patient feel more comfortable and at ease. Given the potential answers to the question, \\"feels good\\" is indeed the most accurate response for what a patient might say after being given a sedative. This response indicates that the sedative has effectively reduced their pain and provided them with a sense of relief. It is important to note that the patient's exact words may vary, but the sentiment of feeling better and experiencing relief from pain is the essential outcome. The other options you provided may not accurately represent the patient's experience after receiving a sedative: - \\"Enjoyment\\": While the patient might feel more relaxed, sedatives do not necessarily create a sense of enjoyment or pleasure on their own. - \\"Good sometimes\\": This response may suggest that the sedative is not always effective, which is not an accurate portrayal of their immediate experience. - \\"Immobilize\\": This term generally refers to being unable to move or being rendered motionless, which is not a direct result of sedative use. - \\"Good feeling\\": Although this response is similar to \\"feels good,\\" it may imply an overall sense of well-being rather than focusing specifically on relief from pain.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Electrical signals in the brain travel through nerves to muscles - Two types of proteins exist in filaments in the muscles - The filaments move when the brain instructs them to - The motion of the filaments cause the muscle to shorten and contract - Opposing pairs of muscles exist in order to provide the necessary range of motion.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more exercise occurs happens, how will it affect muscles contracting MORE INTENSELY.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you propose suggests that if more exercise occurs, it will affect the intensity of muscle contractions. To address this hypothesis, let's break down the process of muscle contractions and the potential impacts of increased exercise on this process. Muscle contractions occur through a series of steps: 1. Electrical signals in the brain are generated and then travel through nerves to muscles. 2. There are two types of proteins, actin and myosin, present in the form of filaments within muscle fibers. 3. When the brain sends a signal to the muscle, the myosin filaments \\"grab\\" onto the actin filaments using molecular \\"hooks\\" and then pull, causing the filaments to slide past one another. 4. This sliding action shortens the overall length of the muscle fiber, resulting in muscle contraction. 5. To achieve a full range of motion, muscles work in opposing pairs; when one muscle contracts, the opposing muscle relaxes, allowing for movement in the opposite direction. Now, let's discuss how increased exercise could impact the intensity of muscle contractions. Exercise can lead to several adaptations within muscle fibers, which can ultimately affect the process of contraction: 1. Hypertrophy: More exercise can cause muscle fibers to increase in size, known as hypertrophy. This means that there are more actin and myosin filaments within the muscle fibers, enhancing the force-generating capacity of the muscle during contraction. 2. Improved neuromuscular efficiency: With regular exercise, the nervous system becomes more efficient at activating motor units (group of muscle fibers activated by a single nerve). This improved efficiency results in better recruitment of muscle fibers, increasing the force of muscle contractions. 3. Increased capillary density: Exercise stimulates the growth of new blood vessels (capillaries) in the muscles. This increased capillary density helps deliver oxygen and nutrients to the muscle more effectively, improving muscle contraction efficiency and reducing muscle fatigue during exercise. 4. Enhanced metabolic capacity: Regular exercise increases the number of mitochondria in muscle cells, which are responsible for producing energy. This improves the overall metabolic capacity of the muscle, enabling the muscles to contract more intensely during exercise. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of increased exercise can directly and indirectly affect the process of muscle contraction. More exercise can lead to physiological adaptations within the muscle, which in turn improve muscle force generation and contraction intensity. This means that as a result of increased exercise, muscles will be able to contract more forcefully and efficiently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Music Man Context: The movie opens with a number of traveling salesmen in a railroad car in 1912, lamenting the things that are making their livelihood difficult--changes in society and the economy, and dishonest salesmen who give them a bad name. They are particularly scornful of a certain \\"Professor\\" Harold Hill (Robert Preston), who goes into a town, sells the kids musical instruments, instruction books, and band uniforms, under the promise that he will form a band for them, and then disappears. Someone mentions that \\"He don't know one note from another!\\". (This opening song has interesting musical accompaniment: the sound of the train's steam locomotive.) At the end of the song, just when the train is about to start up from a station stop in River City, Iowa, one of the people reveals that he is Harold Hill, and quickly escapes from the train before the others can catch him.Hill finds himself in a small turn-of-the-century Iowa town, full of taciturn people with small-town values. They sing him a song of welcome, explaining that Iowans are stubborn but good natured and generous. He is delighted to find an old friend and colleague from his earlier days as a crooked salesman, Marcellus Washburn (Buddy Hackett). Marcellus says that he is now making an honest living, has settled in River City, and that he likes the town and the people. The two friends reminisce about their shady dealings in the past, and that \\"Professor Hill\\"'s current racket is boys' bands. Marcellus says that it will be difficult to make headway on that front, because the town librarian and piano teacher, Marian Paroo (Shirley Jones), is quite smart and will expose him instantly. Harold takes that as a challenge, both professionally and romantically. Harold also mentions that he'll be in town longer than his usual stretch, a week, because not only will he con the town into buying the instruments, but also uniforms, which will take several weeks to arrive. Marcellus still sees the scheme as a very risky one.The mayor's wife, Eulalie Mackechnie Shinn (Hermione... Answer:","output":"Before Hill can disappear, he needs to successfully execute his con in the small town of River City, Iowa. This involves several steps: 1. Establish credibility: Hill must establish himself as a reputable and trustworthy figure, this is usually done by introducing himself as \\"Professor\\" Harold Hill and presenting himself as an expert in music. 2. Identify a problem and present a solution: Hill creates a sense of urgency regarding the lack of cultural and musical opportunities for the town's youth. He then proposes the formation of a boys' band as an avenue for personal development, promising that he will not only provide musical instruments and instruction books but also teach the children how to play and form a band. 3. Build interest and excitement: Hill generates enthusiasm among the townspeople for the idea of having a boys' band by elaborating on the benefits it will bring, both to the young members and the community as a whole. He uses persuasive tactics and catchy songs to rally support. 4. Collect money: Hill capitalizes on the excitement, collecting money from the townspeople to purchase the musical instruments, instruction books, and band uniforms. 5. Avoid suspicion: During his time in River City, Hill needs to navigate potential roadblocks and suspicions, particularly from the town librarian and piano teacher, Marian Paroo. He engages her both professionally and romantically to divert her attention and potentially discredit her should she raise doubts about his intentions. 6. Delay the delivery of uniforms: Hill makes it known that the uniforms will take several weeks to arrive, buying extra time for his con to play out and allowing him to stay in town longer without arousing suspicion. 7. Escape before being exposed: Once the money has been collected and Hill has achieved as much as possible from the con without being caught, he will ultimately plan to slip away from River City before the townspeople realize they have been swindled. By following these steps and successfully executing the con, Hill aims to deceive the people of River City before disappearing and moving on to his next target town."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which uncle doesn't take an inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis?  Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Answer:","output":"Uncle Sam is the one who doesn't take an inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. To provide a comprehensive understanding, let's first delve into the mechanism of statin drugs and their connection with HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins are a class of drugs that effectively reduce blood cholesterol levels by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase). This enzyme plays a crucial role in the production of cholesterol in the liver. By blocking HMG-CoA reductase, statins lower the production of cholesterol, which in turn reduces the amount of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. High levels of LDL cholesterol are strongly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease and stroke. Therefore, lowering LDL cholesterol levels is a key goal in managing high cholesterol. When statin drugs decrease the production of cholesterol, it results in an increased expression of LDL receptors in the liver. These receptors help in the uptake and clearance of LDL from the bloodstream, thereby reducing the amount of circulating cholesterol. This process ultimately reduces the risk of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the build-up of plaque in the arterial walls, which can lead to cardiovascular diseases. Now, it's important to understand that individuals respond differently to statin therapy due to their unique genetic makeup. Pharmacogenomics, the study of the interaction between drugs and genetics, can help explain such variation in response. The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are variations in the DNA sequence at a specific location, can affect the way a person responds to statin drugs. In some individuals, their genetic background may cause a significant reduction in cholesterol levels when using statins, while in others, the reduction may be moderate or negligible. This variation highlights the necessity to personalize treatment options by taking into consideration an individual's unique genetic profile. Through pharmacogenomics, healthcare providers can better understand how different people might metabolize and respond to statins, and consequently, make informed decisions about the appropriate medication and dosage to optimize treatment outcomes. In summary, based on the information provided, Uncle Sam is the uncle who doesn't take an inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, as he is not on statin drugs. Meanwhile, Uncle Tom, who is on statin drugs, benefits from the cholesterol-lowering effects of these medications. The differences in their responses to statins can be attributed to their genetic makeup and can be better understood through the study of pharmacogenomics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is determined to overcome racism and become the first black American Navy diver, even proclaiming that he will become a master diver. He eventually is selected to attend Diving and Salvage School in Bayonne, New Jersey, where he arrives as a boatswain's mate second class. He finds that Master Chief Sunday is the leading chief petty officer and head instructor, who is under orders from the school's eccentric, bigoted commanding officer to ensure that Brashear fails. Brashear struggles to overcome his educational shortcomings, a result of his leaving school in the 7th grade in order to work on his family's failing farm. He receives educational assistance from his future wife, a medical student who works part-time in the Harlem (New York City) Public Library. Brashear proves himself as a diver by rescuing a fellow student whose dive buddy abandons him during a salvage evaluation. Unfortunately, due to the racism of the commanding officer (Hal Holbrook), the student who fled in the face of danger is awarded a medal for Brashear's heroic actions. Likewise, during an underwater assembling task where each student has to assemble a flange underwater using a bag of tools, Brashear's bag is cut open. Brashear nevertheless finishes the assembly and graduates from diving school, earning the quiet and suppressed admiration of Master Chief Sunday and his fellow divers. Master Chief Sunday is later demoted to senior chief by the commanding officer for standing up for Brashear and allowing him to pass. The paths and careers of Brashear and Sunday sharply diverge.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A man is standing while playing a guitar with a microphone in front of him.\\" if \\"A man is playing at a concert with his band.\\"?","output":"It is not definitive to conclude that \\"A man is standing while playing a guitar with a microphone in front of him\\" just by knowing that \\"A man is playing at a concert with his band.\\" There are various factors and possibilities to consider before making such a conclusion. Firstly, it's important to explore the possible roles within a band: 1. Vocals: The man could be the lead singer, and he might not necessarily play the guitar. He could be singing while standing, sitting, or engaging in different stage activities. 2. Guitar: The man in question could be playing the guitar, which could involve playing an electric guitar or an acoustic guitar. However, the original statement does not specify if he is playing while standing up or sitting down. 3. Bass: He could be a bass guitar player, again playing either in a standing or sitting position. 4. Drums: The man might be the drummer of the band. In such a scenario, he'd likely be sitting down. 5. Keyboard: The man could be a keyboard or piano player, either standing or sitting while playing. 6. Other instruments: There are various other possibilities in which the man could be playing other instruments, such as saxophone, trumpet, or even percussion. In addition, the presence of a microphone is not guaranteed for every performer. Microphones could be used exclusively for vocalists or for specific musical instruments to enhance the sound. In some cases (e.g., for a drummer), a microphone might not be directly in front of them. Moreover, the man's position (either standing or sitting) while performing is also not conclusive in the given statement. Musicians have personal preferences and varying stage setups, which can lead to distinct ways of performing on stage. In conclusion, while it is possible that \\"a man is standing while playing a guitar with a microphone in front of him\\" given the information that \\"a man is playing at a concert with his band,\\" detailed information about his role within the band, instrument being played, and stage setup are essential to make a conclusive determination. The original statement provided is not enough to definitively conclude the specifics of the man's performance on its own."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the 2008 Olympiad  will start to recruit volunteers on August 28. The Olympics will need around 70,000 volunteers and the Paralympic Games  will need another 30,000. University students like Xue will make up the majority of the volunteers. But the Olympics also need other volunteers - ordinary citizens and foreigners, for example. Students in Beijing should apply through their universities. Other volunteers may apply online or submit a written application. The online application system and a hotline will be open next Monday. For applicants outside Beijing, the application process begins in December. There is plenty of work for volunteers to do. For example, there will be chances to help publicize the games over the next two years. During the games themselves, volunteers will clean, serve food, marshal or offer language help. The Sydney Olympics in 2000 was the first that placed special emphasis on the role of volunteers. It used more than 45,000 volunteers in different roles. In the 2004 Athens Olympics, around 45,000 volunteers were used.

Since they are like terms, we can combine them. 0 = (-1 - 3)*u - 4 By combining the coefficients -1 and -3, we get: 0 = -4*u - 4 Step 2: Isolate the variable u by adding 4 to both sides of the equation. We need to get rid of the constant term -4 on the right side.  0 + 4 = -4*u - 4 + 4 Simplifying the equation gives us: 4 = -4*u Step 3: Solve for u by dividing both sides of the equation by -4. To isolate u, we need to divide both sides by -4: 4 / -4 = (-4*u) / -4 Simplifying the equation yields: -1 = u The solution to the equation 0 = -u - 3*u - 4 is u = -1."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Risks Lie Ahead as EU Moves to Tackle Debt Crisis There is calm in the euro zone, but also a widespread, though not universal, expectation in the financial markets that more storms lie ahead. On the table at Friday's European Union summit is a package of measures that will expand available bailout funds and make them more useful to stem the onset of a crisis. The price is for the weaker economies to take further measures that over the medium term will reduce the risks of such debt crises emerging in the future. For now, governments are being given the benefit of the doubt: that these measures will deal with the main risks that confront the currency union. But what are these risks? Ireland's election, due on Feb. 25, has put it right back on the risk map. There are now widespread expectations that the terms for Ireland's tough €67.5 billion (93.2 billion) bailout package will be relaxed to give it a chance to repay its heavy debts. But the election has introduced once again the question of how a new government will deal with its battered banking system. Ireland's major opposition parties now say they want the holders of the banks' senior bonds to make a contribution to rescuing the country's banks, a position that contradicts that of the current government, which has pledged that these bondholders will be paid in full. Even though the opposition parties have pledged a negotiation over the bank bonds, such a position could, investors say, have an impact on Ireland's own banks and consequences for banks in the rest of the euro zone. The main danger here is a question of debt sustainability in the medium term, bringing down a sovereign-debt level that is rising past 150% of annual economic output. But official discussions now evidently under way could go a long way toward addressing these concerns—stretching out official debt over 30 years, reducing interest rates and providing the means for Greece to reduce its debts to private bondholders. Will it be enough? Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates insists his country doesn't need a bailout. Whether it takes the official money or not, Portugal may not change the trajectory of the crisis much one way or another. Here the issue is not so much central government debt—still below the euro-zone average despite its big budget deficits—but what the central government might have to do to resolve the problems of the banks. The Spanish authorities have been working hard to increase confidence that they have the problem of their savings banks, or cajas, in hand. A bill in the tens of billions of euros to replenish the capital of these banks looks manageable to some investors now. However, the government must avoid taking over the assets of the banks, in the way that Ireland did. For some euro-zone bears, the region's banks are the most worrying piece of the puzzle. Many are still addicted to European Central Bank funding, while for the region as a whole the banks are as dependent as ever on the wholesale money markets, meaning they are vulnerable to a loss in confidence. In some banks, particular among mutual institutions, capital is low. As in Ireland, the financial health of governments is tied inextricably to that of its banks. The problem is it's possible to believe almost anything because transparency is lacking. Hence, say officials at the European Commission and elsewhere, there is a need for tough and transparent stress tests this year, and credible financing programs to provide new bank capital if it's needed. Some investors say the market is set up for a battle between bears and bulls in the euro zone over the next few months. The outcome will hang on whether governments succeed in developing, without falling out, a package of credible measures to stave of the crisis even as they and the region's banks raise billions of euros in financing from the bond markets. According to Brian Yelvington, director of macro strategy of Knight Capital Americas, LP, a broker-dealer, euro-zone governments will have €315 billion of debt coming due and the region's banks more than €228 billion. The idea that euro-zone authorities could undertake official buybacks of government bonds—as now seems very likely in Greece—has generated anxiety among those buying insurance against possible losses in the market for credit-default swaps. Their concern is that governments could effectively restructure or reschedule their debts through buying bonds back at a discount or exchanging them voluntarily for other bonds with a lower net present value. Such voluntary arrangements wouldn't generate a \\"credit event,\\" says Mr. Yelvington, and so the payouts envisaged under the CDSs wouldn't be triggered. Triggering a CDS \\"event\\" would probably be regarded as \\"unpalatable\\" by euro-zone governments, he says. But one question raised by this minor scare is this: Should governments care?

A debt crisis is when countries have borrowed too much money and are struggling to pay it back. The European Union wants to help these countries by offering them more money and support, but this plan also requires weaker countries to make changes that will help them avoid getting into debt in the future. Some of the countries mentioned in the article, like Ireland, Portugal, and Greece, are facing difficult situations with their banks and debt. There is a concern that if these countries don't find a way to manage their debt, it could cause problems for other countries in the European Union. The article also discusses concerns about how some banks in the region are still relying on support from the European Central Bank and could be vulnerable if there is a loss of confidence in them. That's why the European Union wants to do \\"stress tests\\" on these banks to make sure they are strong and able to handle tough situations. In the end, the article is about the challenges that the European Union is facing in trying to fix the debt crisis and how their plan could affect both the countries in need of help and the countries that are trying to help them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If possible, your doctor will want to identify the cause of your chronic pelvic pain, as the preferable form of treatment is to identify and resolve the underlying cause directly. If no definitive cause can be identified, your doctor will focus on managing your symptoms to get your pain under control. Choices: (a). This means that if you are suffering from pelvic pain caused by something such as an injury to your abdomen, you can see your physician. One of the most common causes of your chronic pelvic pain is a sexually transmitted disease.; (b). If any of the methods help you, see how to do that. Be aware of common manifestations of chronic pelvic pain.; (c). Take over-the-counter painkillers. Over-the-counter (otc) painkillers can reduce levels of pain by interrupting the production of a certain chemical called prostaglandin which controls pain sensations.; (d). Talk to your doctor about selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are drugs that help to diffuse your serotonin when you urinate or eat.;","output":"(c). Take over-the-counter painkillers.  Over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers can help to minimize your discomfort by disrupting the production of a specific chemical called prostaglandins, which are responsible for managing pain sensations. Common OTC painkillers include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, but it's essential to follow the recommended dosage and consult with a healthcare professional to ensure you're taking the right medication for your situation. In addition to OTC painkillers, your doctor may recommend other therapies based on the underlying cause of your chronic pelvic pain. They might recommend physical therapy exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles and alleviate tension in your pelvic region. Heat therapy, such as using a heating pad or taking a warm bath, can also provide relief. If the pain is severe or persistent, your doctor might consider prescribing stronger pain medications, nerve blocks, or trigger point injections to target specific nerves and muscles in your pelvic region. These measures should only be used on a short-term basis and under the supervision of a healthcare provider to avoid dependency or potential side effects. Alternative and complementary medicine approaches, such as acupuncture, therapeutic massage, and biofeedback, might be explored alongside conventional medical treatments to address chronic pelvic pain. These methods may help you manage the pain more effectively and enhance your overall well-being. Addressing the emotional aspect of chronic pain is equally crucial. Chronic pelvic pain can negatively impact your mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and a reduced quality of life. Your healthcare team may suggest counseling, support groups, or other mental health interventions to help you cope with the ongoing pain and its impact on your daily life. This holistic approach ensures that your physical and emotional needs are addressed. In summary, the primary goal when treating chronic pelvic pain is to identify and address the underlying cause. If this isn't possible, healthcare professionals will work to minimize your discomfort, employing various pharmaceutical, physical, and mental therapies. Remember, communication with your healthcare provider is critical in determining the most appropriate treatment plan and ensuring your ongoing well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What are the full names of the people whose 12-minute \\"Acid Tracks\\" was recorded to tape? is inside the article: Deep house's origins can be traced to Chicago producer Mr Fingers's relatively jazzy, soulful recordings \\"Mystery of Love\\" (1985) and \\"Can You Feel It?\\" (1986). According to author Richie Unterberger, it moved house music away from its \\"posthuman tendencies back towards the lush\\" soulful sound of early disco music.Acid house arose from Chicago artists' experiments with the squelchy Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, and the style's origins on vinyl is generally cited as Phuture's \\"Acid Tracks\\" (1987). Phuture, a group founded by Nathan \\"DJ Pierre\\" Jones, Earl \\"Spanky\\" Smith Jr., and Herbert \\"Herb J\\" Jackson, is credited with having been the first to use the TB-303 in the house music context. The group's 12-minute \\"Acid Tracks\\" was recorded to tape and was played by DJ Ron Hardy at the Music Box, where Hardy was resident DJ. Hardy once played it four times over the course of an evening until the crowd responded favorably. The track also utilized a Roland TR-707 drum machine. Club play of house tracks by pioneering Chicago DJs such as Hardy and Lil Louis, local dance music record shops such as Importes Etc., State Street Records, Loop Records, Gramaphone Records and the popular Hot Mix 5 shows on radio station WBMX-FM helped popularize house music in Chicago. Later, visiting DJs and producers from Detroit fell into the genre. Trax Records and DJ International Records, Chicago labels with wider distribution, helped popularize house music inside and outside of Chicago. One 1986 house tune called \\"Move Your Body\\" by Marshall Jefferson, taken from the appropriately titled \\"The House Music Anthem\\" EP, became a big hit in Chicago and eventually worldwide. By 1986, UK labels were releasing house music by Chicago acts, and by 1987 house tracks by Chicago DJs and producers were appearing on and topping the UK music chart. By this time, house music released by Chicago-based labels was considered a must-play in clubs., can you guess it ?

Plot: The story begins when a disillusioned priest, Father Daniel, prays for a miracle to restore hope in a world plagued with corruption, war, and hatred. The Archangel Gabriel hears his plea and devises a plan to transform the human race and make them worthy of God's love once again. With the help of Father Daniel, Gabriel summons the gates of Hell to open, causing demons and lost souls to pour into the Earth. Gabriel believes that if people can witness their darkest fears become reality and confront them directly, they will acknowledge their sins and seek redemption through repentance and faith. As Hell slowly takes over the world, chaos, terror, and destruction ensue. Father Daniel and a group of individuals with wavering faith band together to survive the horrors unleashed upon humanity. Along their journey, they encounter various demonic entities that represent the worst characteristics of mankind, including greed, pride, jealousy, and lust.

This includes Rebecca, a materialistic woman who learns the true meaning of selflessness and empathy; Sarah, a skeptic and scientist who grapples with the existence of demons and her faith; and Michael, an ambitious lawyer who must confront the harm he caused in his pursuit of power. As Gabriel's plan takes effect, a revolution of faith and repentance spreads across the globe. People begin to truly repent for their sins, seek forgiveness, and find strength in their newfound faith. As humanity begins to transform, the demons are gradually banished back to Hell. The climax of the story unfolds during an epic battle between Gabriel, Father Daniel, and the group against the final demonic entity, known as The Adversary. The group's success, fueled by their unwavering faith and strength of character, seals the gates of Hell, restoring the balance on Earth. In the end, Gabriel's plan succeeds, as people around the world are transformed, their souls cleansed through repentance and faith – making them once again worthy of God's eternal love.

This meets the criteria because the entities, water and asparagus, are extracted, leaving out the quantities. Part 3: Identify the meaning of named entities (NER). Usage: Named Entities: \\"cream cheese\\", \\"horseradish\\", \\"beef slices\\" Explain: Named entities are the names of the items in the recipe without their quantity. Here, \\"cream cheese\\", \\"horseradish\\", and \\"beef slices\\" are the specific items, thus meeting the criteria. Part 4: Identify ingredients from directions. Usage: Directions: \\"In a small bowl, combine cream cheese and horseradish.\\" Ingredients (Output): [\\"cream cheese\\", \\"horseradish\\"]. Explain: In this part of the directions, two ingredients are mentioned: \\"cream cheese\\" and \\"horseradish\\". These named entities are extracted, leaving out the quantities, meeting the criteria. Part 5: Ignore quantities of ingredients. Usage: Given input: \\"Add asparagus; cover and boil for 2-3 minutes or until crisp-tender.\\" Output: [\\"asparagus\\"]. This meets the criteria because only the named entity, asparagus, is extracted without its quantity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Oboes are usually made of wood, but there are also oboes made of synthetic materials. A soprano oboe measures roughly long, with metal keys, a conical bore and a flared bell. Sound is produced by blowing into the reed and vibrating a column of air. The distinctive oboe tone is versatile, and has been described as \\"bright\\". When the term \\"oboe\\" is used alone, it is generally taken to mean the standard treble instrument rather than other instruments of the family, such as the \\"cor anglais\\" (English horn) or the oboe \\"d'amore\\".  - Thiruvananthapuram (\\"Tiruvaantapuram\\"), formerly known as Trivandrum, is the capital and the largest city of the Indian state of Kerala.

The definition of marriage varies according to different cultures, but it is principally an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually sexual, are acknowledged. In some cultures, marriage is recommended or considered to be compulsory before pursuing any sexual activity. When defined broadly, marriage is considered a cultural universal. Individuals may marry for several reasons, including legal, social, libidinal, emotional, financial, spiritual, and religious purposes. Whom they marry may be influenced by socially determined rules of incest, prescriptive marriage rules, parental choice and individual desire. In some areas of the world, arranged marriage, child marriage, polygamy, and sometimes forced marriage, may be practiced as a cultural tradition. Conversely, such practices may be outlawed and penalized in parts of the world out of concerns for women's rights and because of international law. In developed parts of the world, there has been a general trend towards ensuring equal rights within marriage for women and legally recognizing the marriages of interfaith or interracial, and same-sex couples. These trends coincide with the broader human rights movement.  - Kerala, historically known as Keralam, is an Indian state in South India on the Malabar coast.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Whistleblower's family believe animal charity is partly responsible for her death. Article:","output":"Title: Whistleblower's Death Engulfs Animal Charity in Controversy Introduction: In a tragic turn of events, whistleblower Miss Aubrey-Ward's family believe that an animal charity is partly responsible for her untimely death. Miss Aubrey-Ward had previously aided The Mail on Sunday in exposing the charity's malpractices, which included destroying thousands of animals.  Step 1: Presenting the Background Information on Miss Aubrey-Ward's Involvement  Miss Aubrey-Ward had heroically stepped forward to help The Mail on Sunday reveal the shocking practices within the animal charity organization. As a former employee, she was able to provide an insider's perspective on the appalling treatment of the animals, including the unnecessary destruction of thousands of creatures.  Step 2: Discussing the Impact of Her Revelations on the Charity Organization Her brave act of speaking up against the organization she had once worked for led to widespread outrage and repercussions for the charity. Public opinion quickly turned against them as people began questioning their motives and integrity. Consequently, the charity's reputation was tarnished, and they faced severe backlash.  Step 3: Delving into the Circumstances Surrounding Her Death While the specific circumstances of Miss Aubrey-Ward's death are still unclear, her family is convinced that the animal charity's actions contributed to it. They believe that the organization's unethical practices and subsequent fallout had an adverse effect on her emotional and mental wellbeing. It is important to consider the crucial role that whistleblowers can play in unveiling the truth, but the devastating impact it can have on their lives cannot be ignored. Step 4: Addressing the Importance of Accountability in Charitable Organizations This tragic story serves as a stark reminder of the significance of accountability and transparency in charitable organizations. The very purpose of these institutions is to work for the greater good, providing care and protection to those in need, including animals. It is imperative, therefore, that they maintain the highest standards of ethics and integrity in their operations to ensure the public's trust and support. Conclusion: As the case of the late Miss Aubrey-Ward unfolds, it is pertinent to recognize the courage displayed by whistleblowers like her who risk their lives to reveal the hidden truths. In light of this tragedy, it is crucial for all charitable organizations to take responsibility for upholding the highest ethical standards and ensuring that the rights and welfare of their beneficiaries are not compromised.

The whole industry is buzzing with excitement, and everyone wants to get their hands on the rights to his masterpiece. At the center of the race is Max Johnson, an ambitious but unscrupulous movie producer with a reputation for always getting what he wants. Max reaches out to Toby to buy the rights to his script, knowing that this could be the movie that pushes him to the top of the Hollywood food chain. In a bid to secure the deal, Max invites Toby to a lavish dinner at his mansion. During the dinner, Max is smitten by Toby's widowed mother, Diane, who is also present at the event. Diane is a charming woman in her 50s, but she has had her fair share of heartbreaks and has grown cynical about love and relationships. The next day, Toby agrees to sign the contract with Max on one daring condition - Max has to marry his mother, Diane. Max, who is desperate to secure the rights to Toby's script, agrees to the condition, fully intending to win Diane's heart and then end the marriage after the deal is signed.  Max begins courting Diane, pulling out all the stops in an attempt to charm her. Diane, skeptical of Max's intentions, retaliates with her wit and sarcasm every time he tries to win her over. Yet, as Max continues to pursue her, the pair gradually form a deep and genuine connection. As the nuptials loom closer, Toby continues to push harder for the couple to get married. Diane, slowly letting her guard down, starts to feel something for Max that she hasn't felt in a long time. At the same time, Max starts to question his motive behind the marriage. As his love for Diane grows, he starts to feel guilty about originally agreeing to the deal for the sake of Toby's script. On their wedding day, as Diane and Max are about to exchange their vows, Max comes clean about the real reason behind their marriage. Diane, heartbroken and betrayed, runs from the altar, and Toby, feeling like he's lost everything, refuses to sign the contract. But as the dust settles, Max realizes that he is genuinely in love with Diane and tries everything he can to win her back – this time not for the sake of the deal, but for a lifetime of love and happiness. Diane, having forgiven Max, gives their love a second chance, and the two find happiness in being together. In a twist of fate, Toby, realizing the reason Max willingly enters the contract, is touched by his genuine love for his mother. This prompts him to finally sign the contract, allowing Max to produce the movie he'd been dreaming about. The movie ends with a montage of Max and Diane's life together, filled with love, laughter, and companionship, while Max's film, written by Toby, goes on to become a critical and commercial success. Through love and honest intentions, Max, Diane, and Toby have discovered that life's unexpected challenges can lead to the most beautiful of stories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to jazz critic Gary Giddins, Misterioso is a hard bop record. The songs performed for the album were arranged by Monk, who reworked four of his earlier compositions. In the album's liner notes, Keepnews wrote of Monk's approach to arrangements: \\"It should be axiomatic that Monk is a constantly self-renewing composer-arranger-musician, that each new recording of an 'old' number, particularly with different personnel, represents a fresh view of it—almost a new composition.\\" In the producer's opinion, Monk played the piano more vividly and less introspectively than on his studio recordings in response to the enthusiastic crowds he drew nightly to the venue.On \\"Nutty\\", Griffin incorporated lines from \\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\\" and exhibited a frenetic swing that was complemented by counterplay from Haynes and Monk. \\"Blues Five Spot\\", a new composition by Monk for the album, is a twelve-bar blues homage to the Five Spot Café and featured solos from each player. Griffin and Monk transfigured chord structures and melodies throughout the performance. Griffin's solo vamp maintained the rhythm while quoting lines from other pieces, including the theme song for the animated Popeye theatrical shorts; he played \\"The Sailor's Hornpipe\\" at the end of \\"Blues Five Spot\\". The quartet began \\"In Walked Bud\\" with an eight-bar piano intro and thirty-two-bar form. Griffin began his solo a minute into the song with saxophone wails. In the third minute, Monk did not play, while Griffin played fast phrases at the top of his register with intermittently slower R&B and free jazz elements. Monk shouted approvingly throughout Griffin's solo before he resumed piano and played a two-minute theme. \\"Just a Gigolo\\", a standard, was the only song on the album not composed by Monk, who performed it in a brief, unaccompanied version. It was played as a single chorus repeated at length.The title track—first recorded for Blue Note Records in 1948 with vibraphonist Milt Jackson—is one of Monk's most influential recordings and is...

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of magma formation in the ground. Direct effects: 1. If the massive change in the crust leads to an increase in temperature, it could cause more rock to melt, resulting in an increased amount of magma production. 2. The change in the crust may also alter the composition or location of magma chambers, affecting where magma accumulates and how it rises through the crust. 3. If the perturbation causes a shift in tectonic plates, it could lead to increased volcanic activity as the plates interact and create new pathways for magma to rise to the surface. Indirect effects: 1. The perturbation may cause changes in the Earth's mantle, altering the rate at which the mantle material rises to the crust and forms magma. 2. Changes in the crust could also alter the strength or permeability of the rock, affecting how magma moves through the crust and potentially leading to more or less frequent volcanic eruptions. 3. Massive changes in the crust may lead to increased seismic activity, which can, in turn, have an effect on magma movement and eruption processes. Overall, a massive change in the Earth's crust has the potential to significantly impact the formation, movement, and eruption of magma, both directly and indirectly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: On the previous evening,--March 12th,--the monotony of the camp had been unexpectedly disturbed by the arrival, from the direction of Salt Lake City, of a horseman completely exhausted by fatigue and cold, who proved to be no other than Mr. Kane, whose mission to the Mormons by way of California was at that time totally unknown to the army. The next morning he introduced himself to the Governor, was received as his guest, and remained in conference with him throughout the day. What was the character of their communication is unknown, except by inference from its results. When presented to Judge Eckels, on the following day, Mr. Kane exhibited to him the letters he bore from the President, and other letters, also, from Brigham Young, accrediting him as a negotiator in the existing difficulties. To General Johnston he showed nothing; nor did the Governor, to the knowledge of the camp, acquaint either that officer or any other person with the purport of his business. It was evident to everybody, however, that the Mormon leaders, conscious of their inability to resist the force by which they would be assailed so soon as the snow should melt upon the mountains, were engaged in an effort, of which Mr. Kane was the agent, to secure through the Governor, if possible, indemnity for their past offences, in consideration of acknowledgment of his authority.

Alternatively, a \\"gameshow\\" can be a demonstrative program about a game (while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony). In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants. On some shows, contestants compete against other players or another team, while other shows involve contestants playing alone for a reward or a high score. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor prize suppliers, who in turn usually do so for the purposes of product placement. One of the reasons that television broadcasters make game shows is because they are substantially less costly than producing scripted drama shows.

Question: \\"What kind of living thing did he use to study inheritance?\\"  Context: \\"The existence of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Gregor Mendel used common edible pea plants (Pisum sativum) to study inheritance patterns.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\"?

The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, also called RodeoHouston or abbreviated HLSR, is the largest livestock exhibitions and rodeo in the world. It also includes one of the richest regular-season rodeo events. It has been held at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, since 2003. It was previously held in the Astrodome. Since 1952, traditional trail rides have been a part of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. As of 2017, there were 13 official trail rides, totaling over 3,000 riders. The trail rides range in size from a dozen to over one thousand people who ride on horseback or in horse-drawn wagons from various areas of the state to Houston. They make their way at about 3 miles (4.8 km) per hour, covering up to 17 miles (27 km) each day. Many of the routes take place in part along major highways and busy city streets, making safety a major concern.  The trail rides last from a few days to three weeks, depending on the distance they cover. Some of the participants are able to join only on weekends or at the end of the trip. The days start very early, and often end with live music or a small celebration. Many riders choose to camp in recreational vehicles rather than in the open. Each morning, they drive their vehicles and horse trailers to the next camping spot, then have a bus or convoy take them back so they can retrace their path on horseback. Participants can bring their own provisions, or, in some cases, purchase meals at a chuck wagon that is also following the trail.  The rides converge at Memorial Park in Houston on Go Texan Day, the Friday before the livestock show and rodeo begins. The city closes some roads downtown to allow the riders to reach their destination safely. The resulting traffic interruption cause annual complaints from those who work downtown.

The Duggars are returning to TLC. At least, some of them are.      Two months after the Discovery-owned cable channel canceled 19 Kids and Counting over Josh Duggar's sexual molestation admission, TLC has ordered several new specials centered on his two sisters Jessa Seewald and Jill Dillard.      Production is slated to begin soon for a targeted year-end premiere for at least one of the specials, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.      The untitled specials will center on Dillard, her husband, Derick, and their infant son as they prepare to move to El Salvador for missionary work, and Seewald, who is expecting her first child with husband Ben on Nov. 1. Two or three specials are currently planned.      Over 19 Kids and Counting's 15-season run, Jill and Jessa became two of the family's most famous members, appearing on magazine covers documenting their engagements, marriages and pregnancies.      The series, however, has not aired on TLC since it was canceled in July. The sisters most recently appeared on the channel in August in a special entitled Breaking the Silence that aimed to raise awareness of child sexual abuse nationwide.      In May, their brother confessed to having sexually assaulted several underage girls — including two of his sisters — 12 years ago. \\"Twelve years ago, as a young teenager I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret,\\" Duggar said in a statement at the time. \\"I hurt others, including my family and close friends. I confessed this to my parents who took several steps to help me address the situation.\\" He most recently checked himself into rehab in August amid infidelity allegations.      Before 19 Kids and Counting was pulled in May immediately following the controversy, it was one of TLC's most watched programs. ||||| Summary:","output":"Months after TLC's popular reality show \\"19 Kids and Counting\\" was cancelled following a scandal involving one of the Duggar family members, the network has announced that they are resuming their relationship with the Arkansas family by featuring daughters Jill and Jessa in two or more specials.

He didn't even own the bloody thing - Keane on the Rock of Gibraltar dispute. I knew Ronaldo would rule the world. Roy Keane has hit out at Manchester United's famous 'class of '92' by saying their importance to the club's dominance of English football has been overstated. United's legendary youth side that won the FA Youth Cup in 1992 contained the likes of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Phil Neville; all became vital to later success at Old Trafford. The group of players took their story to the silver screen, releasing a film last year on their rise to stardom. But Keane, in his new autobiographyThe Second Half, airs his distaste for the 'brand' of the group. He also uncovered a different side to Scholes, who has always been revered for his squeaky-clean image off the field. 'Scholesy was a top top player but I still don’t fall for the boy next door image,' Keane said. 'Or that he’s dead humble. He has more of an edge to him. Everyone thinks he lives in a council flat.' (Left to right) Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and David Beckham as the Class of '92, which Roy Keane says has 'become a brand' According to Keane's new autobiography, The Second Half, Paul Scholes (left) had 'more of an edge to him' than people thought. Keane celebrates with one half of the Class of '92 as Ryan Giggs gives United a 1-0 lead against Juventus in the Champions League in 2003. With almost 4,000 senior matches for United and close to 100 major trophies between them, Beckham and Co clearly delivered on their promise as the most talented set of Red Devils players since the Busby Babes in the 1950s, but Keane believes the Class of '92 'brand' has slightly overtaken the team's own success in that period. Keane adds: 'The Class of ’92 – all good players but their role at the club has been exaggerated. 'The Class of ’92 seems to have grown its own legs. It has become a brand. It’s as if they were a team away from a team and they are not shy of plugging in to it. However, the Corkman clearly still felt happy to be part of a team that included the most successful United youth graduates to date, 'But we all had the same aims. We all had the same hunger.' 'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No. 'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best. 'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'

Keane and the Class of '92 became the most successful side in the club's rich history as Ferguson's side completed the Treble in 1999, becoming the first English club to achieve such a feat. The Red Devils went undefeated for 33 games in all competitions before producing the most dramatic of Champions League comebacks against Bayern Munich - a final which Keane was forced to miss through suspension. Speaking about the talented generation, Ferguson said: 'I have been fortunate to work with many exceptional young players, but the Class of 92 was unique. For so many of them to stay together and succeed at the highest level is a great tribute to their talent and this club’s belief in the power of youth. 'I am convinced that no group of players will ever make such an impact on the English game as those boys have done – and continue to do.' Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

The Queen's Gallery is an art gallery at Buckingham Palace in London, England. It was established in 1962 and showcases art from the Royal Collection, which includes a variety of paintings, sculptures, and other artwork from various periods and artistic styles. This gallery is open to the public and offers guided tours and educational events. It is important to know the history of the site to better understand the context in which the Queen's Gallery was built. World War II had a significant impact on the United Kingdom, with air raids causing widespread destruction across many cities, including London. Many historical sites and buildings were damaged or destroyed during this time, including the chapel that once stood on the site where the Queen's Gallery is now located. In the aftermath of World War II, various reconstruction efforts were undertaken throughout the UK to rebuild and revitalize damaged cities and sites. The decision to construct the Queen's Gallery on the site of the destroyed chapel was likely influenced by the desire to create a space dedicated to the appreciation and preservation of art and culture, as well as to provide a lasting testament to the resilience and determination of the British people in overcoming the challenges of the war.

If the bike is too big, your child won’t be able to reach the pedals, so take her to pick out the bike when you purchase it. To determine if the bike is the right size: Help your child to get on to the bike. Have her stand above the top pipe of the frame with both feet on the ground. If she can do this comfortably, the bike is the appropriate size. Seat height is very important for proper pedaling. Begin by putting the bike seat at its lowest level so that your child can practice pushing the bike (rather than pedalling). Once your child is ready to start pedalling, adjust the seat so that it is consistent with your child’s height. To determine the seat height, make sure that your child can reach the pedal with her whole foot when the pedal is the lowest position. It is very likely that your child will tip over or fall off the bike while she learns how to pedal. Because of this, a helmet is of the utmost importance.  Fit the helmet so that when it is strapped to your child’s head, it doesn’t wiggle very much, but is also not glued to your child’s head. The helmet should also sit levelly across your child’s forehead.

Would \\"Tofu, also called bean curd, is a food made by coagulating soy juice and then pressing the resulting curds into soft white blocks.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, that would be a reasonable answer. Tofu, also called bean curd, is a food made by coagulating soy juice and then pressing the resulting curds into soft white blocks. The process of making tofu involves: 1. Soaking: Soybeans are soaked in water to soften them, which makes it easier to separate their components. This step also helps to hydrate the beans and increase their volume. 2. Grinding: The soaked soybeans are then ground into a smooth paste. This is usually done using a specialized grinder or blender for large-scale production. Smaller-scale tofu makers may use a mortar and pestle or a food processor to achieve a similar result. 3. Cooking: The ground soybean paste is then cooked, usually by boiling, to deactivate enzymes and eliminate any potential harmful components, such as lectins and trypsin inhibitors. This cooking process also helps to improve the flavor, texture, and digestibility of the final product. 4. Extracting Soy Milk: The cooked soybean paste is strained through a fine cloth or sieve to separate the liquid soy milk from the solid residue, known as okara. The resulting soy milk is then typically heated to further improve its quality. 5. Coagulating: Coagulating agents, such as magnesium chloride (nigari), calcium sulfate (gypsum), or glucono delta-lactone (GDL), are added to the heated soy milk. These agents cause the proteins in the soy milk to coagulate, forming curds. 6. Pressing: The curds are then transferred to a mould, usually lined with cheesecloth or a similar material, and pressure is applied to remove excess liquid, or whey. The duration and intensity of the pressing process help to determine the firmness of the final tofu product. 7. Finalizing: Once the desired firmness is achieved, the tofu is removed from the mould and, in some cases, briefly submerged in cold water to firm up its texture. It is then ready to be packaged, sold, and consumed. This entire process results in tofu, a versatile plant-based food product made from soybeans that can be used in a variety of culinary applications."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The mid-18th century saw an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive, and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet, or even into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.Hannah Beswick was born in 1688, the daughter of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed that he was still alive. John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.Jessie Dobson, Recorder of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, has said that there appear to be many \\"inaccuracies and contradictions\\" in accounts of the events following Beswick's death in 1758. Many suggest that she left £25,000 (equivalent to about £3 million as of 2019) to White, a pioneer of obstetrics and one of the founders of the Manchester Royal Infirmary, on the condition that her body was kept above ground, and that periodically she was to be checked for signs of life. Beswick's will however, dated 25 July 1757 (less than a year before her death), states only that White was to receive £100 (£13,000 as of 2019), and that £400 (£53,000 as of 2019) was to be allocated for funeral expenses.

Answer this question: when did pledge of allegiance added under god??","output":"The phrase \\"under God\\" was added to the Pledge of Allegiance on June 14, 1954, after being approved by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Pledge of Allegiance, originally written in 1892 by Francis Bellamy, has gone through a few revisions to reach the current version. The journey to adding \\"under God\\" in the Pledge began during the Cold War era when the United States was experiencing heightened tensions with the Soviet Union. There was a growing concern among Americans about the threat of communism and its impact on the nation's values. The United States wanted to reaffirm the importance of religion and the belief in a higher power as an essential element that separated the nation's value systems from communism, which promoted atheism. In 1951, an organization named Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal service group, began to include the words \\"under God\\" in their recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. This effort gained momentum with various religious and civic groups advocating that the Pledge should contain a reference to God. The Reverend George M. Docherty, a Presbyterian minister and pastor of the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., played a vital role in this movement. On February 7, 1954, Reverend Docherty delivered a sermon titled \\"A New Birth of Freedom\\" in the presence of President Eisenhower. The sermon emphasized the need to include \\"under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance to highlight the theological foundations of the United States. This idea resonated with Eisenhower, who agreed that the inclusion of \\"under God\\" would differentiate the American democratic system from atheistic communism. Subsequently, Congressman Charles Oakman introduced a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives on February 8, 1954, to amend the Pledge of Allegiance. A similar bill was proposed in the U.S. Senate by Senator Homer Ferguson. After a series of debates, both houses of Congress unanimously approved the amendment. President Eisenhower signed the bill into law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954, marking the official addition of \\"under God\\" to the Pledge of Allegiance. Since then, the Pledge of Allegiance reads as: \\"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\" While the addition of \\"under God\\" to the Pledge has been seen by many as a positive expression of American values and spirituality, it has also been the subject of debates and legal challenges. Critics argue that the phrase in the Pledge could be seen as a violation of the constitutional principle of separation of church and state. Nevertheless, the phrase remains a powerful and lasting part of the Pledge of Allegiance, reflecting a significant period in American history and societal values."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are however, areas of knowledge and human experience that the methods of science cannot be applied to. These include such things as answering purely moral questions, aesthetic questions, or what can be generally categorized as spiritual questions. Science has cannot investigate these areas because they are outside the realm of material phenomena, the phenomena of matter and energy, and cannot be observed and measured. The scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation. The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses. A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested. Hypotheses, or tentative explanations, are generally produced within the context of a scientific theory. A scientific theory is a generally accepted, thoroughly tested and confirmed explanation for a set of observations or phenomena. Scientific theory is the foundation of scientific knowledge. In addition, in many scientific disciplines (less so in biology) there are scientific laws, often expressed in mathematical formulas, which describe how elements of nature will behave under certain specific conditions. There is not an evolution of hypotheses through theories to laws as if they represented some increase in certainty about the world.

Running back Cadillac Williams returned as a starter, and rushed for 97 yards and one touchdown. Quarterback Byron Leftwich threw for 276 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions. The Buccaneer defense, however, gave up three big plays in the loss. Dallas quarterback Tony Romo threw for a career-best 353 yards. Three long touchdown passes (66, 80, 44 yards respectively) put the game out of reach. Early in the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay closed the deficit to 20-14, but Romo's 80-yard catch & run to Patrick Crayton put the Cowboys ahead for good. On specials teams, kicker Mike Nugent had one field goal attempt blocked, and shanked another. Who scored the longest touchdown of the game?","output":"The longest touchdown of the game was scored by Patrick Crayton from the Dallas Cowboys. He made an 80-yard catch & run, with the help of his quarterback, Tony Romo.

Schools are designed specifically for the purpose of learning and gaining knowledge. They provide a structured environment where students, teachers, and academic resources come together for the collective goal of education. In such an environment, using a computer as a tool for learning is highly encouraged and supported. At a school, computers are typically equipped with a wide range of educational software, digital textbooks, and e-learning resources that are vetted and curated by educators. This ensures that the content available on school computers is not only relevant and age-appropriate but also academically accurate and engaging. Additionally, schools often have designated computer labs and libraries where students can access computers and receive guidance from teachers or support staff when needed. These resources may not be available at home or in an apartment, where learners must rely on their own devices and internet connections for research and assignments. Moreover, schools facilitate collaboration and group projects where students can share their knowledge and learn from one another. In such cases, computers become invaluable tools for group research, communication, and documentation. The structured setting and support systems of a school environment ensure that a computer's potential for fostering learning is maximized. In summary, even though using a computer in the comfort of one's own home or apartment has its benefits, a school environment provides the resources, guidance, collaboration opportunities, and educational content necessary to enhance the learning experience while using a computer.

We clashed about something so important I can’t even remember what it was. We hadn’t really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can’t imagine life without the other. Well actually, there have been probably a couple of those days for my wife. She’s just too nice to say it. A great marriage isn’t built because it’s perfect.

Information:  - John Henry Bonham (31 May 1948  25 September 1980) was an English drummer, musician and songwriter, best known as the drummer of Led Zeppelin. Bonham was esteemed for his speed, power, fast bass-drumming, distinctive sound, and \\"feel\\" for the groove. He is considered by some publications to be one of the greatest drummers in rock.  - The gittern was a relatively small gut strung round-backed instrument that first appears in literature and pictorial representation during the 13th century in Western Europe (Iberian Peninsula, Italy, France, England). It is usually depicted played with a quill plectrum, as we can see clearly beginning in manuscript illuminations from the thirteenth century.  It was also called the guitarra in Spain, guiterne or guiterre in France, the chitarra in Italy and quintern in Germany. A popular instrument with court musicians, minstrels, and amateurs, the gittern is considered ancestral to the modern guitar; possibly other instruments like the mandore and gallichon.  - In Through the Out Door is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, and their final album of entirely new material. It was recorded over a three-week period in November and December 1978 at ABBA's Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and released by Swan Song Records on 15 August 1979. \\"In Through the Out Door\\" was the band's eighth and final studio release to reach the top of the charts in America, and was the last released by the band before the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980.  - ABBA (stylised ) are a Swedish pop group formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982. ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 at The Dome in Brighton, UK, giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest, and are the most successful group to ever take part in the competition.  - Swan Song Records was a record label launched by the English rock band Led Zeppelin on 10 May 1974. It was overseen by Led Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant and was a vehicle for the band to promote its own products as well as sign artists who found it difficult to win contracts with other major labels. The decision to launch the label came after Led Zeppelin's five-year contract with Atlantic Records expired at the end of 1973, although Atlantic ultimately distributed the label's product.  - Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums, has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music.  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\"  - \`\` Carouselambra '' is the fifth track on Led Zeppelin 's 1979 album In Through the Out Door . The name Carouselambra is a reference to the first section of the song sounding similar to carousel music . It is the second - longest song the band recorded in the studio ( after \`\` In My Time of Dying '' ) , clocking in at more than 10 minutes in length .

The studio was formed by ABBA musicians Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson and the band's manager Stig Anderson, owner of the Polar Music recording label.  - A carousel (American English: from French \\"carrousel\\" and Italian \\"carosello\\"), roundabout (British English), or merry-go-round, is an amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders. The \\"seats\\" are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts, many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping, to the accompaniment of looped circus music. This leads to one of the alternative American names, the galloper. Other popular names are jumper, horseabout and flying horses.  - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.  - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history.

Zeppelin's notions were first formulated in 1874 and developed in detail in 1893. They were patented in Germany in 1895 and in the United States in 1899. After the outstanding success of the Zeppelin design, the word \\"zeppelin\\" came to be commonly used to refer to all rigid airships. Zeppelins were first flown commercially in 1910 by Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-AG (DELAG), the world's first airline in revenue service.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Words are great, but pictures say much more.  Include as many pictures, graphs, tables, charts, diagrams, etc., as possible. Keep your backgrounds (i.e., whatever is behind your graphics and text) simple and subtle. Reading the text that is on top of a colourful or complex background can be difficult and distracting.  Try to print as many of your graphics in colour as possible, especially graphs and charts where the colour distinguishes between different items or variables. If you don't have access to a colour printer, you can use markers or crayons to add color to things like graphs and charts. Each visual item (graph, chart, table, diagram, picture, etc.) should have its own number (or letter), plus a descriptive caption. When the main text refers to a specific visual item, that number or letter should be used. The caption should accurately and quickly describe what is contained in the visual item, and can be printed in slightly smaller font (less than 16 pt). Your main text and captions should include the technical or scientific names, terms and jargon for the discipline your project is based on. If necessary, you can also include a glossary of terms on your display board or in your project report.  Using the proper terms is especially important if your project is being displayed in a science fair or event that is being judged by professionals. If your project is really complex, you can also include a 'layman's summary' as part of your display which sums up your project in language anyone can understand. This is particularly useful if your display board is also being viewed by fellow students, parents, or non-professionals. It can be tempting to get really creative and eccentric when creating a project display board, but try to avoid the temptation! A good project display board is one that is uncluttered, has easy-to-read and clear material, contains graphics that effectively explain your project, and colours that don't overwhelm the viewer.  Search the web for example display boards to get an idea of what works well, and what doesn't. Ask your teacher for advice on what to do and not to do, and for examples of project boards that previously received awesome grades. Display boards come in a standard size of 36” tall and 48” wide. You can buy or make larger (or smaller) boards, but make sure the size is not only appropriate for your display but also allowed by the event (if such rules exist). These display boards have three panels - the middle panel which is half the width of the whole board, and the two outside panels that are a quarter of the width each. The two outside panels can fold over the middle panel to close the board for transport. And the outside panels can be used to stand the whole display board upright on a table.  You can find display boards at online retailers like Amazon.com or at your local school supply store. Bigger is not always better. Boards that are really tall or really wide may be difficult to read and/or contain too much information.

To make butter in a mason jar, it's really easy! All you need is some heavy cream and a mason jar. Here's how you do it: 1. First, fill up the mason jar with heavy cream but not all the way - just about halfway. This will give enough room for the cream to move around when you shake it. 2. Now, put the lid on tight. Make sure it's closed really well so nothing spills out when you start shaking it. 3. Start shaking the jar! Shake it up and down, side to side, and all around. It might take a little while, so be patient and have fun with it. 4. After shaking it for about 5-10 minutes, you'll notice the cream starts to get thicker. Keep shaking until you see a solid lump of butter forming inside the jar. The liquid left behind is buttermilk, which you can use for other recipes or just drink it. 5. When you see the butter, open the jar and carefully pour out the buttermilk. Now, you can use a spoon or your clean hands to gather the butter and press it together into a ball. 6. Finally, you can wash the butter under cold water to rinse off any remaining buttermilk. Then enjoy your homemade butter on bread or in your favorite recipes!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: How to Increase Your Search Rank Using Social Media The rules of search have changed. In fact, they change on a daily basis. But never so dramatically has rank been uprooted since the explosion of social media. Social media sites, especially the power houses of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, have become backlink central for affecting organic search results. Social media’s influence on driving business via the web is expected to surpass search engine optimization (SEO) in 2013, according to eMarketer. Web marketers and PR professionals must pay attention to how social media affects search, and ultimately how it can change the rules of online visibility and (online) brand engagement. Prior to Facebook’s takeover of the online universe (800 million active users today), online visibility in natural search was a sum of several measurable components: SEO site compliance on site structure and meta tags/content, directory link submissions and qualified and relevant site/blog linking. In 2010 the game officially changed, with Google’s support of social media — author reputation, bookmarking, commenting, as well as a number of other social factors (Likes, tweets, retweets, shares, etc.) — as a major factor in how it ranks websites and blogs in its algorithm. Real-time search in Google meant that search was only as valuable as the latest blog post, social share and comment. Today, the line is blurring. And this causes some confusion for web marketers. Should they focus on optimizing and driving traffic to their social pages? To their website? Where does their online brand live? How do they communicate their brand value proposition, whether their personal or corporate brand? The good news is that technology has advanced so that web marketers can manage their content and sites through the use of simple and effective blogging tools. Further, those blog tool properties, such as WordPress, support integration of social plug-ins and necessary content for social sharing including video, effective product/service literature and tagged imagery. And so, marketers can use social and manage their web presence to support online brand consistency. So, how can you use social media to increase your SEO rank and ensure that the rank and ensuing traffic will convert to web business? First, you must create and understand a parallel social media optimization/search engine optimization strategy. All creators of content on your team (copy, social commenting, videos and imagery) need to be on one brand team. The approach must be holistic. A unified brand message must drive visibility across all content and all channels. To define a common strategy for execution across standard SEO practices as well as across social media content development and sharing, marketers must rethink keyword development. The questions become less about search visibility versus obvious competition and more introspective in terms of what the corporate and executive brand mean. Ask your team questions such as: What is our brand value proposition? What do we want our audience to say about us? How will we incent out audience? How will we be leaders? Why will people follow us? Answering these questions will help you to zone in on your top branded, broad-based and narrow-based keywords. 3. Create a Plan of Action Once these target keyword phrases have been developed, you will need an actionable task plan to follow and with which to measure effectiveness of your new blended social/SEO strategy. The strategy must contain: content types and frequency, such as a weekly webinar production and planned outreach per social channel and media (social) buys/ads with effective messaging and resulting goals. Determining success in social affects search visibility such that the quality of the author, relevancy of the topical content, number of followers, number of comments/retweets and number of shares of blog posts must be considered and followed for search visibility to pull from success in these metrics. 4. Don’t Forget SEO Basics When determining how you will rank in natural search for branded and business-driving keywords, first do the ABCs of SEO work in terms of on-site optimization wherever your online marketing plan calls for conversion. Once that has been completed, rein in your social and search teams to determine your custom strategy and measurable plan. Remember that, just like traditional SEO practices, social media optimization work must be consistent, authentic, managed daily and measured for success.","output":"This news article talks about how to use social media to help your website show up better on Google.

Trained by Basil Briscoe and ridden by several jockeys throughout his career, Golden Miller was an exceptional racehorse who created history by winning this prestigious steeplechase race five times in a row, solidifying his place in the annals of horse racing. Golden Miller's Cheltenham Gold Cup victories came in the following years: 1. 1932: Ridden by Ted Leader, Golden Miller's first Gold Cup win was marked by his incredible stamina and speed. At the age of six, he displayed great potential and gave an early indication of his future dominance in the racing world. 2. 1933: In his second appearance at the Gold Cup with Ted Leader again as his jockey, Golden Miller was unstoppable. He won with a remarkable performance, making him the third horse in history to claim back-to-back Cheltenham Gold Cup victories. 3. 1934: T.W. Hyde took over as Golden Miller's jockey for the 1934 Cheltenham Gold Cup. In this race, Golden Miller showed his incredible prowess by claiming his third consecutive Gold Cup win, setting a new record and ensuring his place in racing folklore. 4. 1935: With Gerry Wilson as his jockey, Golden Miller continued his winning streak at the Cheltenham Festival. His fourth consecutive Gold Cup win was a testament to his skill, determination, and sheer dominance in the steeplechase event. 5. 1936: Partnered with Evan Williams, Golden Miller secured his fifth and final Cheltenham Gold Cup victory. This feat remains unmatched in the history of the race, and Golden Miller's legacy as one of the greatest racehorses of all time is forever cemented. Golden Miller's achievement of winning five consecutive Cheltenham Gold Cups in the 1930s has not been replicated since, and he is always remembered as an iconic and beloved figure in the world of horse racing.

He is best known for writing and presenting, in conjunction with the BBC Natural History Unit, the nine natural history documentary series that form the Life collection, which form a comprehensive survey of animal and plant life on Earth. He is a former senior manager at the BBC, having served as controller of BBC Two and director of programming for BBC Television in the 1960s and 1970s. He is the only person to have won BAFTAs for programmes in each of black and white, colour, HD, 3D and 4K. Context: Attenborough has been featured as the subject of a number of BBC television programmes. Life on Air (2002) examined the legacy of his work and Attenborough the Controller (2002) focused on his time in charge of BBC Two. He was also featured prominently in The Way We Went Wild (2004), a series about natural history television presenters, and 100 Years of Wildlife Films (2007), a special programme marking the centenary of the nature documentary. In 2006, British television viewers were asked to vote for their Favourite Attenborough Moments for a UKTV poll to coincide with the broadcaster's 80th birthday. The winning clip showed Attenborough observing the mimicry skills of the superb lyrebird.  Attenborough was named the most trusted celebrity in the UK in a 2006 Reader's Digest poll, and in 2007 he won The Culture Show's Living Icon Award. He has also been named among the 100 Greatest Britons in a 2002 BBC poll and is one of the top ten \\"Heroes of Our Time\\" according to New Statesman magazine.  In September 2009, London's Natural History Museum opened the Attenborough Studio, part of its Darwin Centre development. In December 2013, he was awarded the freedom of the city of Bristol.  In 2012, Attenborough was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork - the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover - to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life. The same year, Attenborough featured in the BBC Radio 4 series The New Elizabethans to mark the diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. A panel of seven academics, journalists and historians named him among the group of people in the UK \\"whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands\\".  In May 2016, it was announced that a new British polar research ship will be named RRS Sir David Attenborough in his honour. While an Internet poll suggesting the name of the ship had the most votes for Boaty McBoatface, Science Minister Jo Johnson said there were \\"more suitable names\\", and the official name was eventually picked up from one of the more favoured choices. However, one of its research subs will be named \\"Boaty\\" in recognition of the public vote. Question: What recognition has Attenborough received for his efforts?. Whats the answer?","output":"Sir David Attenborough is a very important person who loves nature and has made many TV shows about animals and plants. People really like and trust him. He has received many awards, and some TV programs have been made about his work. A museum in London even named a special area, the \\"Attenborough Studio,\\" after him. There is also a big research ship that explores the ocean named after him, the RRS Sir David Attenborough. These recognitions show how much people appreciate his efforts in teaching everyone about the wonderful world of nature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: Lisa and the Devil Movie plot: [note: this synopsis is only for Mario Bava's true and original Lisa and the Devil (1973), not the re-shot, re-edited version 'The House of Exorcism' (1975)]Lisa Reiner (Elke Sommer) is a young American woman vacationing in Spain with some friends of hers. During a stop in a small town square with her tour group, Lisa grows to admire a fresco of the devil carrying a dead man's body which her tour guide describes as the devil carrying away lost souls back to Hell. As her group disperses, Lisa hears a beautiful piece of music. She leaves her companions and traces its source to an elaborate music box in a little antique shop just outside the main square. While inside the shop, she encounters a strange man (Telly Savalas) purchasing parts of a life-size mannequin. After making eye contact, Lisa is startled when the man bears an uncanny resemblance to the devil depicted in the painting. The man's peculiar behaviour distresses Lisa, so she flees from the shop to rejoin her friends.However, she becomes hopelessly lost in the maze of backstreets of the town. Though she has only walked a short distance beforehand, the back streets and alleyways seem totally alien to her. The locals refuse to give her directions, as side streets lead to dead ends. Lisa runs into the mysterious man a second time, though this time he is carrying a full-length, life-sized mannequin eerily similar to the painting depicted in the main square, as well as carrying the music box still playing the haunting tune. Introducing himself as Leandro, he gives Lisa some vague directions back to the main square, then walks around a corner and disappears. But the direction that Leandro points to the main square leads only to more unfamiliar streets. Next, Lisa encounters a strange man who looks a lot like the mannequin that Leandro was carrying. These bizarre coincidences begin to terrify Lisa, and the stranger acts as though she is his long-lost lover. Frantic, Lisa pushes him away and the man falls down a flight of stone steps, apparently dead. Lisa...

Whether he was escaping from a locked box or making things disappear and reappear, he surely was entertaining. People thought that he must truly have some supernatural powers, but in fact, what Harry really had was drive.  Harry was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874. His real name was Ehrich Weiss, the third of five children. His family moved to Wisconsin not long after his birth and when he was nine, he was tying ropes all over his backyard and learning amazing tricks to show his friends and neighbors. He visited the local locksmith, and when he had reached his teens he could pick almost any lock that was made. He also learned how to do card tricks. He and his brother, Theo, would often entertain at local parties and clubs for extra money.  When Ehrich was 16, he came across a book that would actually change his life: the biography of France's greatest magician, Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin. It showed Ehrich that his hobby of magic and tricks could also be a career. Immediately, he changed his name to Harry Houdini. He and Theo headed out to make a living as magicians. In 1893, they performed at the Chicago World's Fair, and after that they traveled around giving magic shows for anyone willing to listen and pay. Theo grew restless, however, as the jobs became scarce, so he left. His timing was perfect since Harry had just fallen in love with a lovely woman named Bess who was just the right size for slipping in and out of the trunk they used in their magic tricks. They married immediately and then off they went, traveling with circuses and other road shows. Harry learned more and more tricks and spent much of his time reading and studying all kinds of locks, especially handcuffs. However, no matter what tricks they did or how hard they tried, Bess and Harry were not doing well. They tried to sell their shows for seven years and finally, in desperation, they went to Europe.           It was the right move. Harry's persistence and...

Driver in Texas bus crash involved in fatal 1998 accident By Jason Morris and Lindsey Knight, CNN updated 12:50 PM EDT, Fri April 12, 2013 A charter bus turned over on the highway on Thursday, April 11 (CNN) -- The driver in Thursday's bus crash in Texas was investigated but not indicted in a fatal accident 15 years ago, according to court documents. Two people were killed and dozens rushed to hospitals after a charter bus bound for Oklahoma overturned on a Dallas-area turnpike Thursday morning. The driver is 65-year-old Loyd Rieve, the Texas Department of Public Safety said. He was investigated in a 1998 accident, but a grand jury declined to indict him on a charge of criminally negligent homicide. In that accident, Rieve was driving a bus that ran over a good Samaritan helping at an accident scene. 2 killed in Dallas-area bus crash The bus driver was injured in the Thursday accident, which occurred on the President George Bush Turnpike in Irving. It involved only one vehicle. Department of Public Safety spokesman Sgt. Lonny Haschel told CNN the bus went off the right side of the road, hit a barrier, swerved left across lanes of traffic and struck a concrete median in a grassy area. \\"It rode up on top of that concrete barrier, and then rolled on its right hand side, where it came to rest,\\" Haschel said. The bus, owned by Dallas-area charter company Cardinal Coach Line, was taking passengers to Choctaw Casino in Durant, Oklahoma, the department said. Haschel said it's too early to determine a cause. Investigators are looking at several factors, including the vehicle and physical evidence on the road. The National Transportation Safety Board said it has sent two investigators to the scene of the wreck. \\"It's going to be a lengthy investigation,\\" Haschel said.

Write an article based on this \\"The Syrian Arab Red Crescent estimates 2.5 million people have been displaced within Syria, doubling the previous figure used by aid agencies.\\"","output":"Title: Unprecedented Surge in Displacement: The Plight of 2.5 Million Syrians Introduction: (1) Introduce the topic of the article, stating recent updates on displacement figures from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC). (2) Explain the significance of these new figures in the context of the ongoing Syrian conflict and humanitarian crisis. The Syrian conflict has led to one of the largest humanitarian crises in recent times, with millions of Syrian citizens displaced within their own country and abroad. Recent estimates released by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) indicate that the displacement crisis has taken a drastic turn for the worse – with approximately 2.5 million people now displaced within Syria. This shocking new statistic doubles the previous figure used by aid agencies, painting an even bleaker picture of the ongoing situation and underscoring the need for immediate action. A Closer Look at Displacement: (1) Define displacement and discuss its impact on affected individuals and communities. (2) Present a brief history of the Syrian conflict, which has led to massive displacement. Displacement refers to the forced movement of individuals away from their homes due to conflict, violence, persecution, or human rights violations. Displaced persons often face significant challenges, including a lack of access to basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare. The Syrian conflict, which began in 2011, has been characterized by widespread violence, political instability, and human rights abuses. These conditions have driven millions of Syrians from their homes in search of safety and security. Growing Humanitarian Crisis: (1) Elaborate on the current state of the humanitarian crisis in Syria. (2) Discuss the role of international aid agencies in addressing the crisis, and the challenges they face in providing support due to the scale of the displacement. The updated displacement figures from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent provide evidence of an ever-growing humanitarian crisis within the country. Resources are being stretched thin as aid agencies struggle to provide adequate assistance to millions of displaced people. Access to healthcare, education, and other basic services remain severely limited, compounding the suffering of those affected. While international aid organizations continue to provide critical support, their efforts have been hindered by a lack of funding, bureaucratic obstacles, and the sheer magnitude of the crisis. Possible Solutions and the Way Forward: (1) Present potential solutions for addressing the displacement crisis, such as international intervention, diplomacy and ceasefire agreements, and increased humanitarian assistance. (2) Discuss the importance of a comprehensive and collaborative approach between governments, organizations, and the global community. Addressing the displacement crisis in Syria requires concerted efforts from various stakeholders. International intervention may be necessary to bring an end to the ongoing violence and facilitate the creation of safe zones for civilians. Additionally, diplomatic efforts should be intensified to broker ceasefire agreements and promote dialogue between conflicting parties. Moreover, increased funding and collaboration between humanitarian aid organizations can help provide much-needed assistance to those displaced by the conflict. In conclusion, the alarming displacement figures released by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent serve as a stark reminder of the devastating impact of the Syrian conflict on its population. As the crisis continues to unfold, it's crucial for the international community to act in solidarity and take decisive steps to alleviate the suffering of millions of displaced Syrians and find sustainable solutions to this harrowing humanitarian crisis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, we are going to talk about a big feeling that you might have sometimes - anger. We all feel angry now and then, but it's important to understand and manage it so we can stay happy and healthy. In this article, we will learn how to rate our anger, keep an anger journal, find out what makes us angry, and understand why sleep is important. 1. Rate Your Anger First things first, do you know that we can measure how we feel? Just like we can measure how tall we are or how much we weigh! When you feel angry, try to figure out how \\"big\\" your anger is. You can use numbers like 1 to 10, where 1 is a little bit angry and 10 is very, very angry. This helps you understand your feelings better and learn when you need to ask for help or be calm. 2. Keep an Anger Journal Get a notebook, and let's make an 'Anger Journal'! You can write in it or draw pictures of times when you felt angry. You can also write down or draw the things that made you angry and how big your anger was using the numbers we talked about earlier. This way, you can remember and understand what upsets you and find ways to make things better. 3. Identify Your Anger Triggers Now that we have our Anger Journal, we can start to see patterns - these are things that happen often and make us angry. These patterns can be called 'triggers.' For example, if you get angry every time you can't find your favorite toy, then not finding your toy is a trigger. It's good to know our triggers because then we can be prepared and find ways to stay calm or fix the problem. 4. Understand the Effects of Sleep Deprivation Do you sometimes have trouble sleeping or not get enough sleep? You might not know this, but when we don't sleep well, we can get more emotional and even angrier at small things. That's why it's important to make sure we get enough sleep every night. If you're having trouble sleeping, try talking to your parents, or maybe we can find some tips to help! Well, little friends, now we've learned some cool ways to understand and manage our anger. Remember, it's okay to feel angry sometimes, but it's important to know how to deal with it and make ourselves feel better. So, let's start rating our anger, keeping an Anger Journal, finding our triggers, and making sure we get enough sleep so we can stay happy and healthy!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My search ended when I stumbled upon the phenomenal org.quantumbadger.redreader app.  From the moment I installed it, its clean and user-friendly interface set the stage for a fantastic browsing experience. The app made getting accustomed to it incredibly easy for both newcomers and frequent Reddit users alike. Its seamless navigation capabilities allowed me to browse through endless posts and subreddits effortlessly.

This feature not only helps reduce eye strain but also contributes to a comfortable user experience. Additionally, the app offers font size customization, ensuring that everyone can select the most comfortable settings for their eyes. Speaking of customization, org.quantumbadger.redreader takes it to another level. With the helpful in-app settings, I could personalize my browsing experience by selecting custom themes and colors.

It's a comforting notion to know that I can explore Reddit without compromising my privacy. In conclusion, I rate the org.quantumbadger.redreader app a well-deserved 5 out of 5 stars.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: Avoid picking up your dog too frequently. Hold your small dog to the same standards as a larger dog. Reward positive behavior. Encourage your dog to relax around larger dogs. Inform others how to interact with your dog. Get help from a licensed trainer. Article:","output":"Title: Treat Your Little Dog Like a Big Dog: Tips for a Happier Pooch Did you know that little dogs need the same love, care, and training as big dogs? Yes, that's right! No matter if your dog is tiny like a Chihuahua or big like a Golden Retriever, they all need the same things. Here are some tips to help your small dog be even happier and healthier: 1. Don't Pick Them Up Too Much We know that little dogs are super cute and easy to lift. But carrying them around too much is not good for them. Think about big dogs; we don't pick them up, so we shouldn't do it to our little ones all the time. When your little dog is on the ground, they can explore, play, and be more independent. This makes them grow up to be confident and happy dogs. 2. Set Rules and Expectations Just like big dogs, little dogs need to follow the rules too. Teach your small dog not to bark too much, not to jump on the furniture, or not to beg for food. If you let them do whatever they want, they may become bossy and have bad manners. So, be a good friend and teach them how to behave well. 3. Praise and Reward Good Actions When your dog does something good, like sitting down or coming when you call them, make sure you praise them and give them a treat. This helps them learn that doing good things makes you happy, and they will want to keep doing it! 4. Help Them Make Friends with Big Dogs Sometimes little dogs can be scared of big dogs because they are much bigger than them. That's okay, but you can help your dog feel more comfortable around big friends. Let your little dog play with other dogs when you go to the park, and show them that there's no need to be afraid. Big dogs can be gentle friends too! 5. Teach People How to Treat Your Dog Your friends and family may not always know how to treat your little dog. Explain to them that they shouldn't carry your dog around, and that your dog needs to follow rules just like any other dog. This will help your dog become more respected and confident in the world. 6. Ask a Professional Trainer for Help If you need some extra help teaching your small dog good manners and behavior, you can ask a professional dog trainer. They have lots of experience working with all kinds of dogs - even small ones like yours! They can give you tips and tricks to make training your dog fun and easy. In the end, it's important to remember that little dogs and big dogs are more alike than you might think. Treat your small dog like you would a big dog, and they will grow up to be happy, well-mannered, and confident members of the family."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Inland waters may be grouped into two general classes: standing waters and flowing waters. As is often the case, the boundary between these two classes is not sharp and clear. A pond is an example of standing water. But most ponds are fed by springs or brooks and most have an outlet. Thus some current of changing water flows through them. On the other hand, a river is an example of flowing water. In some places, however, a river may have such a slow current that it is very difficult to detect. Standing inland waters differ in size, in age, and in many _ environmental characteristics. They range in size from roadside puddles to the Caspian Sea. Puddles may last for only a few days or weeks; ponds, for a few hundred to a thousand years. In general, lakes are older, though the waters of some tropical \\"lakes\\" disappear completely during each dry season. Standing waters vary from very shallow to very deep, from clear to muddy, from fresh to salty. In flowing waters we roughly distinguish between brooks, creeks, and rivers. The size and age of flowing waters are unimportant. Speed of flow, clearness, oxygen content, and other chemical characteristics are used by scientists in studying flowing-water ecosystems.

Information:  - A nebula (Latin for \\"cloud\\"; pl. nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.  - In astronomy and physical cosmology, the metallicity or Z is the fraction of mass of a star or other kind of astronomical object that is not in hydrogen (X) or helium (Y). Most of the physical matter in the universe is in the form of hydrogen and helium, so astronomers use the word \\"metals\\" as a convenient short term for \\"all elements except hydrogen and helium\\". This usage is distinct from the usual physical definition of a solid metal. The rationale for the astronomical usage is that in the high-temperature and pressure environment of a star, atoms do not undergo chemical reactions and effectively have no chemical properties, including that of being a metal as usually understood. For example, stars and nebulae with relatively high abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon are called \\"metal-rich\\" in astrophysical terms, even though those elements are non-metals in chemistry.  - AB Doradus Moving Group is a group of about 30 associated stars that are moving through space together with the star AB Doradus . A moving group is distinguished by its members having about the same age , composition ( or metallicity ) and motion through space . Hence they most likely formed in the same location . This group is located about 20 parsecs from the Earth and is the closest known co-moving group . The average space velocity of this group has components of U =  8 , V =  27 and W =  14 km / s. About 10 of these stars form a nuclear group within a volume roughly 10 parsecs across . The proximity of this moving group makes it useful for studies of shared stellar properties , as well as detection of companions through direct imaging . These can be used for refinement of young stellar models , for example .  - AB Doradus is a pre-main-sequence quadruple star system in the constellation Dorado. The primary is a flare star that shows periodic increases in activity.  - Dorado (English pronunciation: ) is a constellation in the southern sky. It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name refers to the dolphinfish (\\"Coryphaena hippurus\\"), which is known as \\"dorado\\" in Portuguese, although it has also been depicted as a swordfish. Dorado contains most of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the remainder being in the constellation Mensa. The South Ecliptic pole also lies within this constellation.    What is the relationship between 'ab doradus moving group' and 'dorado'? The answer to this question is:","output":"The relationship between the 'AB Doradus Moving Group' and 'Dorado' can be understood from various perspectives. Firstly, the AB Doradus Moving Group consists of stars that are moving through space together and share similar properties such as age, metallicity, and motion. The group's name, AB Doradus, is derived from the primary star in the group, which itself is part of a quadruple star system located in the constellation Dorado.  Dorado is a constellation in the southern sky, named after the dolphinfish or occasionally represented as a swordfish. It is one of the 88 modern recognized constellations and is an important region of the sky as it contains the majority of the Large Magellanic Cloud and the South Ecliptic pole.  The connection between the AB Doradus Moving Group and Dorado can be summarized as follows: 1. Location: The AB Doradus Moving Group, including its primary star AB Doradus, is located within the boundaries of the constellation Dorado. This means that when we observe the stars in the AB Doradus Moving Group from Earth, they appear within the projected area of the Dorado constellation in the night sky. 2. Astrophysical significance: Both the AB Doradus Moving Group and the Dorado constellation are significant for their unique astronomical features. The proximity of the AB Doradus Moving Group to the Earth makes it valuable for studying the properties of young stars and their formation process. On the other hand, Dorado is known for hosting a significant portion of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way and an important source of knowledge about galaxy formation and evolution. 3. Shared research interest: The presence of the AB Doradus Moving Group within the Dorado constellation makes it an important subject of study for astronomers observing the region. The constellation's unique features, combined with the presence of a co-moving group of young stars, provides valuable insight into various aspects of astrophysics, such as star formation, stellar evolution, and our understanding of the broader cosmos."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The first recording of L'incoronazione, with Walter Goehr conducting the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich in a live stage performance, was issued in 1954. This LP version, which won a Grand Prix du Disque in 1954, is the only recording of the opera that predates the revival of the piece that began with the 1962 Glyndebourne Festival production. In 1963 Herbert von Karajan and the Vienna Staatsoper issued a version described by Gramophone as \\"far from authentic\\", while the following year John Pritchard and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra recorded an abridged version using Leppard's Glyndebourne orchestration. Leppard conducted a Sadler's Wells production, which was broadcast by the BBC and recorded on 27 November 1971. This is the only recording of the opera in English.Nikolaus Harnoncourt's 1974 version, the first recording without cuts, used period instruments in an effort to achieve a more authentic sound, although Denis Arnold has criticised Harnoncourt's \\"over-ornamentation\\" of the score, particularly his use of oboe and trumpet flourishes. Arnold showed more enthusiasm for Alan Curtis's 1980 recording, live from La Fenice in Venice. Curtis uses a small band of strings, recorders and continuo, with a trumpets reserved for the final coronation scene. Subsequent recordings have tended to follow the path of authenticity, with versions from baroque specialists including Richard Hickox and the City of London Baroque Sinfonia (1988), René Jacobs and Concerto Vocale (1990), and John Eliot Gardiner with the English Baroque Soloists. Sergio Vartolo's production of the opera at Pigna, Corsica, was recorded for Brilliant Classics in 2004. A feature of this recording is the casting of a soprano Nerone in acts I and III, and a tenor Nerone in act II, to allow for the differing vocal requirements of the role in these acts.

Only one month ago, Lamu still thought it would be difficult. In the past Tibet had no railroad  . If Lamu took a bus, it would take her a long time to reach Beijing. And a plane ticket would cost lots of money. However, things changed for Lamu. She was able to buy a ticket to the world's highest railroad. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway had been completed! The 1,142-kilometer railroad runs on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau  . Lamu could reach Beijing by train in 48 hours! About 550 kilometers of the railroad are constructed on the frozen earth  . When the frozen earth warms in summer, it can move the track. But Chinese scientists have built a special structure to solve the problem. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway has been designed with the wild animals in the designers' minds. It also has special underpasses   for animals like Tibetan antelopes   to go through. \\"The new railroad greatly helps Tibet's tourism,\\"said Liu Yueqin, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  . As more tourists take trains to Tibet, there are more money for Tibetans. With the money, more kids can go to school. The railroad also makes things less expensive in Tibet. Now one can buy a TV set for about 1,500 yuan. It used to be much higher than that price. When there was no railroad, it had been difficult to send things in and out of Tibet.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Electric power transmission is the bulk movement of electrical energy from a generating site, such as a power plant, to an electrical substation. The interconnected lines which facilitate this movement are known as a transmission network. This is distinct from the local wiring between high-voltage substations and customers, which is typically referred to as electric power distribution. The combined transmission and distribution network is known as the \\"power grid\\" in North America, or just \\"the grid\\". In the United Kingdom, the network is known as the \\"National Grid\\".  - The coulomb (unit symbol: C) is the International System of Units (SI) unit of electric charge. It is the charge (symbol: \\"Q\\" or \\"q\\") transported by a constant current of one ampere in one second:   - Voltage, electric potential difference, electric pressure or electric tension (formally denoted or , but more often simply as \\"V\\" or \\"U\\", for instance in the context of Ohm's or Kirchhoff's laws) is the difference in electric potential energy between two points per unit electric charge. The voltage between two points is equal to the work done per unit of charge against a static electric field to move the test charge between two points and is measured in units of \\"volts\\" (a joule per coulomb).  - In physics, potential energy is energy possessed by a body by virtue of its position relative to others, stresses within itself, electric charge, and other factors.  Common types include the gravitational potential energy of an object that depends on its mass and its distance from the center of mass of another object, the elastic potential energy of an extended spring, and the electric potential energy of an electric charge in an electric field. The unit for energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule, which has the symbol \\"J\\".  - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is part of the Western United States, the Southwestern United States, and the Mountain States. Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 United States Census.  - A high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) electric power transmission system (also called a power super highway or an electrical super highway) uses direct current for the bulk transmission of electrical power, in contrast with the more common alternating current (AC) systems. For long-distance transmission, HVDC systems may be less expensive and suffer lower electrical losses. For underwater power cables, HVDC avoids the heavy currents required to charge and discharge the cable capacitance each cycle. For shorter distances, the higher cost of DC conversion equipment compared to an AC system may still be justified, due to other benefits of direct current links.  - Alternating current (AC), is an electric current which periodically reverses polarity, whereas direct current (DC, also dc) flows only in one direction with a single polarity either positive or negative. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electric energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" are often used to mean simply \\"alternating\\" and \\"direct\\", as when they modify \\"current\\" or \\"voltage\\".  - An electric potential (also called the \\"electric field potential\\" or the \\"electrostatic potential\\") is the amount of electric potential energy that a unitary point electric charge would have if located at any point in space, and is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from the arbitrarily chosen reference point (usually infinity) to that point without any acceleration.   - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function.  - The joule, symbol J, is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units. It is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or N·m). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule (18181889).  - An electric field is a vector field that associates to each point in space the Coulomb force that would be experienced per unit of electric charge, by an infinitesimal test charge at that point. Electric fields converge and diverge at electric charges and can be induced by time-varying magnetic fields. The electric field combines with the magnetic field to form the electromagnetic field.  - Electric potential energy, or electrostatic potential energy, is a potential energy (measured in joules) that results from conservative Coulomb forces and is associated with the configuration of a particular set of point charges within a defined system. An \\"object\\" may have electric potential energy by virtue of two key elements: its own electric charge and its relative position to other electrically charged \\"objects\\".  - Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern United States. The state is bordered by South Dakota to the north, Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River, Kansas to the south, Colorado to the southwest and Wyoming to the west. Its area is just over 77,220 sq mi (200,000 km) with almost 1.9 million people. Its state capital is Lincoln. Its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - The Great Plains is the broad expanse of flat land (a plain), much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, that lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie states and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. This area covers parts, but not all, of the states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming.  - The volt (symbol: V) is the derived unit for electric potential, electric potential difference (voltage), and electromotive force. The volt is named in honour of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (17451827), who invented the voltaic pile, possibly the first chemical battery.  - Electric power is the rate, per unit time, at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.  - Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel and unlike attract. An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C). In electrical engineering, it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and, in chemistry, it is common to use the elementary charge (\\"e\\") as a unit. The symbol \\"Q\\" often denotes charge. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that don't require consideration of quantum effects.  - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison.  - Sidney is a city and county seat of Cheyenne County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 6,757 at the 2010 census.  - An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization.  - The Missouri River is the longest river in North America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than half a million square miles (1,300,000 km), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system.  - Pressure (symbol: \\"p\\" or \\"P\\") is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed. Gauge pressure (also spelled \\"gage\\" pressure) is the pressure relative to the ambient pressure.  - Direct current (DC) is the unidirectional flow of electric charge. Direct current is produced by sources such as batteries, power supplies, thermocouples, solar cells, or dynamos. Direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC). A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current.  - The Midwestern United States, also referred to as the American Midwest or simply the Midwest, is one of the four geographic regions defined by the United States Census Bureau, occupying the northern central part of the United States of America. It was officially named the North Central region by the Census Bureau until 1984.  - The ohm (symbol: ) is the SI derived unit of electrical resistance, named after German physicist Georg Simon Ohm. Although several empirically derived standard units for expressing electrical resistance were developed in connection with early telegraphy practice, the British Association for the Advancement of Science proposed a unit derived from existing units of mass, length and time and of a convenient size for practical work as early as 1861. The definition of the ohm was revised several times. Today the definition of the ohm is expressed from the quantum Hall effect.  - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city.  - Capacitance is the ability of a body to store an electric charge. There are two closely related notions of capacitance: \\"self capacitance\\" and \\"mutual capacitance\\", that are usually both designated by the same term \\"capacitance\\". A material with a large self capacitance holds more electric charge at a given voltage, than one with low capacitance. Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance. The notion of mutual capacitance is particularly important for understanding the operations of the capacitor, one of the three fundamental electronic components (along with resistors and inductors).  - Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the western United States. The state is the tenth largest by area, the least populous and the second least densely populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city in Wyoming, with a population estimate of 63,335 in 2015. The state population was estimated at 586,107 in 2015, which is less than the population of 31 of the largest U.S. cities.  - Virginia Smith Converter Station is a High - voltage direct current ( HVDC ) back - to - back station near Sidney , Nebraska at 41 ° 09  51 \`\` N 102 ° 59  15 '' W named for former Congresswoman Virginia Smith , a Nebraska Republican who represented Nebraska 's 3rd congressional district from 1975 to 1991 . Virginia Smith Converter Station was built by Siemens and began service in 1988 . The station can transfer a maximum power of 200 megawatts ; the voltage used by the station is 55.5 kV . Timing differences in continental - sized nations make national power grids based solely on conventional alternating current impossible . However , power can be transferred over longer distances and between separate AC grids by conversion to direct current during transmission , and conversion to alternating current in phase with the local line frequency at the delivery point . By the early 21st century , high - power semiconductors began to make the more difficult DC - to - AC conversion technically and economically possible at the high power levels needed in power grids . The Virginia Smith Converter station is significant for being the first interchange between eastern and western United States electrical grids .  - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - Nebraska's 3rd congressional district seat encompasses the western three-fourths of the state; it is one of the largest non-at-large Congressional districts in the country, covering nearly , two time zones and 68.5 counties.

Context: Young undocumented immigrants seeking permanent status in the United States received an unexpected boost Thursday on Capitol Hill as a small group of House Republicans mounted a last-minute effort to bring up an immigration vote in Congress. The group of eight Republicans — some freed from political considerations by upcoming retirements and others facing tough re-elections races — defied their own party leadership, quickly persuading 10 more Republicans to sign on to a petition that would force debate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. With all 193 Democrats expected to sign on, Republicans will have to persuade just seven more members of their own party to join the petition to trigger a vote on several immigration bills on the House floor. But Republican leadership said the effort would be wasted if the end result is a presidential veto. \\"I think it's important for us to come up with a solution that the president can support,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action. \\"It's better to use the legislative process,\\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. But that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year. The growing group of House Republicans are joining Democratic colleagues who have long criticized Ryan for not bringing immigration bills up for a vote. \\"This is about making sure we're not consolidating power in the White House,\\" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican from Utah and one of the first lawmakers to sign petition. The immigration issue had all but died after an effort to pass a DACA fix collapsed in the U.S. Senate earlier this year.

Act 1: The story begins in the bustling city of Los Angeles, where Ramone, a charming and talented exotic dancer, is the star attraction at the nightclub called \\"Midnight Dreams.\\" With his perfect physique and unmatched dancing skills, Ramone is adored by many, yet understood by few.  Having weathered a tough childhood in a small town, Ramone dreams of making it big in the entertainment capital of the world – but first, he must confront his troubled past and conquer his inner demons. Enter Lidia, a young and ambitious investigative journalist who is assigned to expose the secrets of the sultry underworld of exotic dancing while interning at the LA Times. Lidia goes undercover at Midnight Dreams to perform research for her story, and it is here that she is mesmerized by Ramone's breathtaking performance. Act 2: As Ramone and Lidia cross paths and start to establish a friendship, their worlds collide in powerful and stirring ways. Lidia, whose troubled past has left her with a cynical outlook on life, initially holds her own secrets but is soon won over by Ramone's genuine personality and drive to succeed. In return, Ramone finds solace and a confidante in Lidia, as he struggles with the darker sides of the exotic dancing scene, including the damaging influences of drugs, human trafficking, and corruption.  Soon enough, Ramone and Lidia develop feelings for each other. However, their love story is short-lived, as a mysterious club patron named Isaac appears with dark intentions.

Torn between the dangerous allure of Isaac's world and his growing love for Lidia, Ramone faces the most daunting decision of his life. Act 3: As the stakes rise, Lidia makes a shocking discovery that exposes the criminal underworld that lies beneath the glamorous surface of Midnight Dreams and threatens to tear her and Ramone apart forever. Isaac's true identity as a human trafficker is revealed, and he kidnaps Ramone as part of a scheme to expand his criminal empire. In a high-stakes race against time, Lidia leverages her journalistic skills and resources to track down the criminals and save Ramone. With help from their trusted friends, Lidia puts her career and personal safety on the line as she uncovers Isaac's real motives and the intricate web of organized crime that has taken hold of the exotic dance world in Los Angeles.

(Financial Times) -- Eurozone governments are looking to the European Central Bank and national central banks to help pare back the cost of a second rescue package for Greece which would otherwise amount to €170bn. Figures seen by the Financial Times reveal Greece needs €136bn in fresh bail-out funding from the European Union and International Monetary Fund -- in addition to the €34bn left over from Greece's first bail-out. This is €6bn more than EU leaders agreed in October. Germany, the Netherlands and Finland have insisted on paying no more than €130bn. Eurozone finance ministers, who meet in Brussels on Monday to hammer out a deal to save Greece from default, hope the ECB can contribute by forgoing some of the future profits it would earn on its Greek bondholdings, which it has said it is willing to do. Of that, €30bn is expected to come in a direct payment to bondholders in cash or bonds issued by the eurozone's rescue fund in exchange for writing off €100bn in OPTIONS: - Brussels debt. - ECB debt. - EU debt. - European Central Bank debt. - European Union debt. - Eurozone debt. - Financial Times debt. - Finland debt. - Germany debt. - Greece debt. - Greek debt. - International Monetary Fund debt. - Netherlands debt.","output":"Of that, €30bn is expected to come in a direct payment to bondholders in cash or bonds issued by the eurozone's rescue fund in exchange for writing off €100bn in Greek debt, marking a significant and arduous compromise for all parties involved, as they worked tirelessly to navigate the complex economic landscape and ultimately ensure the financial stability of both Greece and the Eurozone as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: Between 301 and 219 BCE the Ptolemies ruled Judea in relative peace, and Jews often found themselves working in the Ptolemaic administration and army, which led to the rise of a Hellenized Jewish elite class (e.g. the Tobiads). The wars of Antiochus III brought the region into the Seleucid empire; Jerusalem fell to his control in 198 and the Temple was repaired and provided with money and tribute. Antiochus IV Epiphanes sacked Jerusalem and looted the Temple in 169 BCE after disturbances in Judea during his abortive invasion of Egypt. Antiochus then banned key Jewish religious rites and traditions in Judea. He may have been attempting to Hellenize the region and unify his empire and the Jewish resistance to this eventually led to an escalation of violence. Whatever the case, tensions between pro and anti-Seleucid Jewish factions led to the 174–135 BCE Maccabean Revolt of Judas Maccabeus (whose victory is celebrated in the Jewish festival of Hanukkah).

To combine the terms with the variable b, add the coefficients of these terms: 153 * b + 427 * b = (153 + 427) * b = 580 * b Now the equation becomes: 6829 = 580 * b - 7671 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable b In order to isolate the term with the variable b, we will move the constant term to the other side of the equation.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the work in which Robert Christgau found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated?  Of Human Feelings received considerable acclaim from contemporary critics. Reviewing the album for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark recording from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmute conventional polyphony and may be the most challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and \\"let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center\\". Giddins also highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk\\", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displays expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record \\"a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness\\". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau called its \\"warm, listenable harmolodic funk\\" an artistic \\"breakthrough if not a miracle\\". He found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated, writing in The Village Voice, \\"the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian.\\"Purist critics in jazz complained about the music's incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar. In Stereo Review, Chris Albertson deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused. Dan Sullivan of the Los Angeles Times believed the album's supporters in \\"hip rock circles\\" had overlooked flaws, arguing that Tacuma and Coleman's playing sound like a unique \\"beacon of clarity\\" amid an incessant background.

Background: Chayefsky was born in The Bronx, New York City to Russian Jewish immigrants Harry and Gussie Stuchevsky Chayefsky who came from Moscow to New York in 1907. He had two older brothers, William and Isidor. He spent part of his youth in Mount Vernon, New York. Context: He moved into television with scripts for Danger, The Gulf Playhouse and Manhunt. Philco Television Playhouse producer Fred Coe saw the Danger and Manhunt episodes and enlisted Chayefsky to adapt the story It Happened on the Brooklyn Subway about a photographer on a New York subway train who reunites a concentration camp survivor with his long-lost wife. Chayefsky's first script to be telecast was a 1949 adaptation of Budd Schulberg's What Makes Sammy Run? for Philco.  Since he had always wanted to use a synagogue as backdrop, he wrote Holiday Song, telecast in 1952 and also in 1954. He submitted more work to Philco, including Printer's Measure, The Bachelor Party (1953) and The Big Deal (1953). One of these teleplays, Mother (April 4, 1954), received a new production October 24, 1994 on Great Performances with Anne Bancroft in the title role. Curiously, original teleplays from the 1950s are almost never revived for new TV productions, so the 1994 production of Mother was a conspicuous rarity.  In 1953, Chayefsky wrote Marty, which was premiered on The Philco Television Playhouse, with Rod Steiger and Nancy Marchand. Marty is about a decent, hard-working Bronx butcher, pining for the company of a woman in his life but despairing of ever finding true love in a relationship. Fate pairs him with a plain, shy schoolteacher named Clara whom he rescues from the embarrassment of being abandoned by her blind date in a local dance hall. The production, the actors and Chayefsky's naturalistic dialogue received much critical acclaim and influenced subsequent live television dramas. Chayefsky had a unique clause in his Marty contract that stated that only he could write the screenplay, which he did for the 1955 movie.  Chayefsky's The Great American Hoax was broadcast May 15, 1957 during the second season of The 20th Century Fox Hour. This was actually a rewrite of his earlier Fox film, As Young as You Feel (1951) with Monty Woolley and Marilyn Monroe. The Great American Hoax was shown on the FX channel after Fox restored some The 20th Century Fox Hour episodes and telecast them under the new title Fox Hour of Stars beginning in 2002. Question: Was any of his scripts written successful? Answer:","output":"Yes, several of Chayefsky's scripts were successful. His script for Marty, which premiered on The Philco Television Playhouse in 1953, received critical acclaim, and he went on to write the screenplay for the 1955 movie version of Marty. The success of Marty's television production and its naturalistic dialogue earned praise and influenced subsequent live television dramas. Additionally, other scripts such as Printer's Measure, The Bachelor Party (1953), and The Big Deal (1953) were submitted to Philco, demonstrating his continuous involvement in television at the time. His 1949 adaptation of Budd Schulberg's What Makes Sammy Run? for Philco also marked an important milestone as his first script to be telecast."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What is the camp police chief's name? Movie title: King Rat Movie plot: George Segal plays Corporal King, an American soldier in a Japanese prison camp who manages all the black market operations amongst the enforced holding of a group of English and Americans. His demeanor and bearing stand out in contrast to the rag tag prisoners he shares the camp with in part because of his willingness to ostensibly advance on the needs of others. He is constantly scrutinized by Lieutenant Grey (Tom Courtenay), the camp police chief, as he has gotten reports that King has robbed fellow prisoners in a poker game. It is clear that King takes pleasure in living on what would be considered a clear example of the American Capitalist version of supply and demand. He seeks ways to increase his organization by recruiting talented men like Peter Marlowe (James Fox), an English soldier who speaks fluent Malay, but refuses King's offering of money for his services. Marlowe attempts to live by a code that bonds men in a way that transcends any financial gain, and in fact considers King an actual friend because he and the American are interned together under Japanese rule. King extends his operation to include trading valuables to the Japanese and breeding rats to sell as food to the officers as a delicacy, activities that Marlowe is happy to aid in because of the smart commercial way that the schemes are launched. The ability to gain valuable items including medical supplies becomes important when Marlowe injures himself and faces serious physical danger. As Lieutenant Grey closes in to mete out the camp law enforcement, his code of conduct conflicts with Marlowe, his cabin mate. Theirs is a philosophy differing slightly and both based on survival with the most reaffirming respect for fellow man they can develop under these war conditions. As Grey attempts to arrest King and Marlowe for their criminal activity it becomes clear that the commanding officers live by a fractured value system.

The Interview: Thomas Manning, America’s First Penis Transplant Recipient      He has a lot to say.      Four years ago, Thomas Manning received devastating news: He had cancer and needed to have his penis amputated. This, of course, took a toll on him both psychologically and physically. Manning, though, was undeterred and later became just the third person—and the first American—to receive a penis transplant. The pioneering surgery, performed at Massachusetts General Hospital in May, lasted for 15 hours and has since been heralded as a major medical breakthrough. Today, Manning, 64, is cancer-free and waiting for doctors to tell him it’s safe to pop a Viagra. Talking with him at his home in Halifax, one thing becomes remarkably clear: Manning is not shy about anything.      What were the circumstances that led you to volunteer for this experimental surgery?      Let’s start four years ago when I had an accident. I had slipped on some black ice while working. I was pushing a cart that carries moving boxes. It went up in the air, too, and landed on me—on top of my stomach—and pushed 30 percent of my colon down into my groin. While I was being treated at Mass General, doctors performed all of these tests on me. At first, they couldn’t find anything. But then one doctor was examining my groin and all of a sudden said, “You have cancer.” They biopsied a piece of my penis and confirmed I had cancer. They said the only treatment available was that the entire penis had to be removed. They were worried it was in my lymph nodes. More than a week later, the doctor amputated my penis.      What were the psychological consequences and the physical challenges of having the amputation?      It was a real kick in the chops. I actually thought I was going to die. Then I thought I was going to have tubes forever hanging off of me. I wondered how I was going to go to the bathroom. The doctor told me not to jump to conclusions. When I woke up from the surgery, my penis was gone and they had put in a catheter. I didn’t look at it for a few days—maybe three days. I didn’t have the courage to look at myself.      Were there physical complications?      One after another. One of my testicles blew up to the size of a basketball. All of this fluid had built up in it. So here I am with my penis chopped off and my testicles blown up. They had to operate again. I was thinking what everyone else probably would be thinking: What kind of guy am I going to be? Am I going to be disabled for the rest of my life? I confronted it. How was I supposed to feel? You’re never the same after something like this.      How did you pee?      They sent me home with a catheter and I became rather comfortable with it. I think it made it easier for me to learn to accept the position that I was in. Without the catheter, I just had a wound, and you couldn’t expose that wound. The only way to deal with it was with a catheter.      Did you still think about sex?      I didn’t think there was going to be any more of that. I just came to terms with it. I didn’t dwell on it.      Were you resigned to living the rest of your life without a penis?      Oh, yeah. I wasn’t getting anywhere with the doctors for a long time. Your whole life is upside down. I was dealing with it, but I kept thinking there were [other patients in the hospital] all around me who were much worse.      So how did you end up consulting a medical team about a penis transplant?      I didn’t sit around and wait. I wanted this and kept pushing my doctors to ask about it. They initially told me I wasn’t a candidate for it because I had a heart condition. So they put me on the inactive list. Right away, I called my doctors to get a cardiologist appointment so that I could limit the risk [from my] heart condition and be considered a better candidate for the transplant and surgery.      What did your doctors tell you about the realities of having a transplant? Were there major risks?      Yes. It was a 16-hour-long surgery, so they were concerned about my heart condition. The real tough part of this, though, was the medication that I would need to take to stop the body from rejecting the transplant. They told me it would knock years off my life because of the stress it puts on your body and kidneys. I was initially very concerned about that.      Was there any talk about the size, girth, and skin tone of the donor’s penis?      The only concerns were about skin tone and blood type. Those were the two things they look to match up. Everything else is hit or miss.      How did they find a donor?      I went on a list, the donor list.      Were there challenges in finding a consenting donor?      I had type B blood, and that’s pretty rare. I was pretty lucky that they found a donor. I was lucky because I was ready, they were ready, and we found a donor within our time frame. Everything just came together.      Do you know anything about your donor?      They didn’t give us much information at all. This person had died in Maine. Eight people received organs from this donor. The doctors were there [just before he died] and had a religious service. All of the family members were with the doctors and said prayers. He was kept on the machine while they said their prayers and then they [removed] the organs, and he was taken off the machine. ||||| The Interview: Thomas Manning, America’s First Penis Transplant Recipient      He has a lot to say.      You kept the fact that you were planning to undergo transplant surgery a secret from your family until just before the procedure. Why is that?      I initially had told some people, but then the doctors canceled plans for the procedure. I didn’t want to tell my family again that I was going to do it, and again have it not happen. I wanted to wait, and for them to know that it was really happening. I had been telling them for four years how I wanted a transplant and I think many thought I was just blowing smoke. I just didn’t want it to be a false alarm. That would’ve been a huge disappointment for me. I knew this was going to be a big deal.      What was your family’s reaction?      Some of them didn’t find out until they saw me on TV talking about it. I don’t know how they all feel about it. Some of them came to the hospital.      Were you concerned about being stigmatized, given that this is such a rare procedure and such a socially sensitive part of the anatomy?      Any time you’re dealing with the penis, vagina, or breasts, it’s sex, sex, sex. Everything gets blown out of proportion and becomes “dirty.” When you’re dealing with this straight up and bluntly, it’s really just life itself. Life is dirty sometimes. I really wasn’t concerned with it too much.      Walk me through the first time you looked at your new penis. What was going on in your head and what was your initial perception?      It was tough. It was black and blue—and I mean black and blue. I was all cut up—I had stitches everywhere. I took one look at it three days after the surgery, and I was in shock. It knocked me down and I couldn’t believe it. I looked at it a couple of times and then I didn’t want to look at it anymore. I wanted it to heal and do what it’s supposed to do. If I were to keep looking at it and dwelling on it, it would’ve gotten to me and I didn’t want it to. So I gave it time, and when it was ready, it would be ready. I didn’t look again until a week later.      Where are you in terms of recovery? Is there still a chance that your body could reject the transplant?      It’s not like you’re dealing with a kidney or liver. You can see if it’s working or not. My doctors tell me your body can reject it at any point. But so far, so good. The doctors tell me I’m doing well.      So is the team of surgeons closely monitoring you and documenting your progress?      I won’t have full feeling there until March, but they think I’m ahead of schedule. I’m at the hospital frequently.      Many people would shy away from talking about this. Why are you so candid, and what has the response been?      I have a choice. I can be up front or I can hide. If I lie about it, then it turns into another lie after another lie. I’m just not in the mood to cover up something that I just don’t have to. If other people can’t deal with it, they can’t deal with it. I mean, it’s always going to be there, so what am I going to do?      What was it like to go on national television to discuss your experience?      I was on The Dr. Oz Show, and people still stop me and ask about it. You get so many different responses. The majority of people are pretty intrigued and don’t give me grief about it. I know people have jokes, but I won’t let anyone joke about the donor. I won’t tolerate that. That donor can’t fight for himself, so I have to stand here and be his surrogate and speak for him.      Is there any type of physical therapy that you have to go through?      No. The only physical therapy I had was initially getting out of the hospital, and whether I could walk up the stairs. There’s not a lot of physical therapy you can do for this, if you know what I mean.      How does it work? What is a successful outcome in the eyes of your doctors, and what is a successful outcome in your eyes?      The first milestone was, could I use the toilet? They didn’t think that would happen for a while, but they were very, very happy with the progress because it happened so fast. They say I’ll be able to do everything I’m supposed to do—go to the john, have a sex life, and regain full sensation. In my eyes, if I have to live without one of those things, then I learn to live without. I’ll learn to live with what I have. I expect to be in and out of the hospital for a long time. There are so many things involved here.      Based on what you’re telling me, I assume you’re not able to masturbate or have sex with your new penis?      Not yet, and I’ll tell you up front, I’m not even going to attempt to do that until March, maybe longer.      Are you nervous about that?      I’m not dwelling on it. You know, it’s important to me that I can do that. If [sex or masturbation] does happen, it would be a miracle, if you really think about it. I mean, when you think about what I had four years ago compared to what I have now—that’s a lot. It’s emotional for me. I get emotional about this. I sometimes want to be alone to think about how I really feel about this. I belong to a very exclusive club. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Thomas Manning, America's first penis transplant recipient, openly discusses his journey from amputation due to cancer to the successful 15-hour transplant surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital.

It influences health, intelligence   and feelings. In August, it is very hot and wet in the southern part of the United States. People there easily have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is hot at some times and very cold at other times. People in those states will have heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March. The weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists, the IQ scores of some college students were very high during storm, but after the storm, their scores were low. Storms can increase intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can decrease  it. Students in many schools of the United States often do badly in exams in the hot months of the year(July and August). Weather also has a strong effect on people's feeling. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold during these months. They might feel depressed during cold weather. In hot summer weather, on the other hand, fat people may feel unhappy. At about 65F, people become stronger. Low air pressure  makes people feel free, but it also increases forgetful- ness. People leave more bags and umbrellas on buses and in stores on low pressure days. There is a\\"perfect weather\\"for work and health.

Article: A book review tells not only what a book is about, but also how successful it is at what it is trying to do. Professors often assign   book reviews as practice in careful analytical   reading. As a reviewer, you bring together the two parts of accurate, analytical reading and strong, personal response when you indicate what the book is about and what it might mean to a reader. In other words, reviewers answer not only the WHAT but the SO WHAT question about a book. Thus, in writing a review, you combine the skills of describing what is on the page,analyzing how the book tried to achieve its purpose, and expressing your own reactions. Most book reviews start with a heading that includes all the basic information about the book, like: Title. Author. Place of publication, publisher, date of publication. Number of pages. The review usually begins with an introduction that lets your readers know what the review will say. The first paragraph usually includes the author and title again, so your readers don't have to look up to find this information. You should also include a very brief description of the contents of the book, the purpose or audience for the book, and your reaction and evaluation. Then you move into a section of background information that helps place the book in context and discusses how to judge the book. Next, you should give a summary of the main points, quoting   and explaining key phrases from the author. Finally, you get to the heart of your review -- your evaluation of the book. In this section, you might discuss some of the following issues: *How well the book has achieved its goal. *What possibilities are suggested by the book. *What the book has left out. *How the book compares with others on the subject. *What personal experiences you've had related to the subject. It is important to use labels   to carefully distinguish your views from the author's, so that you don't confuse your readers. Then, like other essays, you can end with a direct comment on the book, and tie together issues... Question: Readers will get puzzled if   _  .

Given the question \\"What will Bailey want to do next?\\", is \\"Rinse it off\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"Yes, \\"Rinse it off\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"What will Bailey want to do next?\\" after washing Riley's face with medical soap. To provide more context to this situation, let's consider the whole process of washing someone's face with medical soap - which is typically used as an antiseptic or for medical purposes like pre-operative skin preparation or wound cleansing. 1. Preparation: Bailey must have ensured that both their hands and Riley's face are clean prior to using the medical soap. Preparation usually involves removing any dirt, debris, or makeup on the face and ensuring that the environment is clean and hygienic. 2. Applying the medical soap: Bailey would have dispensed an appropriate amount of the medical soap in their hands and started gently applying it to Riley's face. This could involve circular motions with the fingertips, focusing on areas that require thorough cleansing or treatment. 3. Creating lather: If the medical soap is meant to be lathered up, Bailey would then work it into a foam-like consistency to ensure that all areas of the face are adequately covered. 4. Treatment time: Depending on the instructions provided with the medical soap, Bailey may have needed to leave it on Riley's face for a specific duration. This ensures that the soap has ample time to perform its intended function, such as killing bacteria or providing antiseptic benefits. 5. Rinsing off the medical soap: After the recommended time has elapsed, the next step would be to rinse off the soap from Riley's face. Using clean water, Bailey would gently splash or wipe away the soap, ensuring no residue is left behind. 6. Drying and aftercare: Once the soap has been completely rinsed off, Bailey should pat Riley's face dry using a clean towel and, if necessary, apply any additional aftercare products like moisturizer or wound dressings. Given this detailed process of washing a face with medical soap, it is clear that \\"Rinse it off\\" is a crucial and valid step in the procedure. This ensures that the face is clean, free of soap residue, and ready for any subsequent aftercare treatments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: In tough economic times, school counselors   don't just wait for students to come to their offices in search of college brochures, health pamphlets or other help. These days, they are looking for at-risk kids to prevent personal or academic troubles before they arise. Nowadays, students and families need the guidance more than ever.  Counselors play a steadying role in schools as the economy weighs on families, college admission becomes even more competitive, immigration continues to reshape the population and state-testing pressures many students. They use computers to search through attendance data, grades and standardized test scores for kids who might need extra help.  Schlatter, director of guidance and counseling at Prince William County's Woodbridge Senior High School, has checked attendance records against grades and test results to start peer groups   for students who are failing classes but not skipping them. She said group counseling is another way to reach more students though it can be difficult. \\"Kids really do start helping and sharing with each other.\\"  At Fairfax High School, counselors found through surveys that students who transferred   to the school after ninth grade enjoyed school significantly less than those who had been there all four years. The counseling staff set up a special program and group for new arrivals in response, said Marcy Miller, the school's director of student services. Counseling staff members also have started small study groups for students to prepare for state Standards of Learning exams, which Miller said have helped raise test scores.

The keyword \\"due to\\" indicates a reason or cause for this contrast. Now let's examine the options: (I). Elena hating vegetables. (II). Betty hating vegetables. Option (I) provides a reason for Elena to refuse eating a salad, which fits well with the context. The sentence would be: \\"Elena always refused to eat a salad as opposed to Betty, due to Elena hating vegetables.\\" Option (II), on the other hand, is inconsistent with the context. If the sentence implied that Betty hated vegetables, this would not explain why Elena is in contrast to her by refusing to eat a salad. This would make the sentence unclear.

Simultaneously, other members of the group are focused on different tasks, such as pruning dead or overgrown branches, removing invasive weeds, and placing protective barriers for the tree against potential insects or pests. They work together, communicating effectively, and exchanging tools and ideas to achieve their shared goal of maintaining the tree and its surrounding landscape. As the work progresses, one member of the group skillfully captures the efforts on camera, documenting the process and occasionally directing others to provide the best angles and moments for their video or photo collection.

Q: Abstract: The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks underlying cell differentiation from high-throughput gene expression and chromatin data remains a challenge. Here, we derive dynamic gene regulatory networks for human myeloid differentiation using a 5-day time series of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. We profile HL-60 promyelocytes differentiating into macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages. We find a rapid response in the expression of key transcription factors and lineage markers that only regulate a subset of their targets at a given time, which is followed by chromatin accessibility changes that occur later along with further gene expression changes. We observe differences between promyelocyte- and monocyte-derived macrophages at both the transcriptional and chromatin landscape level, despite using the same differentiation stimulus, which suggest that the path taken by cells in the differentiation landscape defines their end cell state. More generally, our approach of combining neighboring time points and replicates to achieve greater sequencing depth can efficiently infer footprint-based regulatory networks from long series data..

In 1841, Léon Escudier wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, \\"One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\\" Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his Projet de méthode he wrote: \\"Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.\\" He further stated: \\"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\\" The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What writing of Chopin talks about everything about piano playing has to do with proper fingering?","output":"Chopin discussed the importance of proper fingering and its relation to piano playing in his unfinished work \\"Projet de méthode\\" (Project for a Method).

Context: I was introduced to the amazing range of handmade products from Okoii back in July and intended to post reviews in early September; however, was struck down with a particularly potent uterine parasite that left me comatosed on the couch each evening by about 8.00pm, so blogging had to take a massive back step. Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!).

(CNN) -- A New Jersey police officer plead not guilty on Friday, a day after he was arrested and charged with setting fire to the house of an Edison police captain and his family.  Michael A. Dotro was arrested on Thursday at his home in Manalapan, New Jersey, after an investigation by the Middlesex County prosecutor's office and the Monroe Township Police Department. That investigation determined that a fire at the police captain's home early on May 20 had been intentionally started outside the house.  Police, EMT personnel and firefighters were called to the two-story, colonial-style home of police Capt. Mark Anderko shortly before 4 a.m. on May 20. Anderko was in the house with his wife, two children and 92-year old mother.  The fire was extinguished within 10 to 15 minutes and there were no injuries, but the house was damaged.  \\"The investigators described it as considerable, one part of the house had damage on the first and second floor of the home, \\" said Jim O'Neil, spokesman for the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office.  Dotro, 35, was charged with five counts of attempted murder and one count of aggravated arson, authorities said. A nine-year veteran of the Edison police department, he was suspended from his job with pay.  Dotro's lawyer, Lawrence Bitterman, said that his client is \\"in shock\\" and had told Bitterman that \\"he can't believe he's being arrested.\\"  Superior Court Judge Bradley Ferencz on Friday upheld previously set bail conditions on Friday, which included a 5 million bail.

It provides a delightful and relaxing setting while offering a glimpse into the lives of beautiful and unique aquatic creatures. However, maintaining and cleaning an aquarium can be a daunting and time-consuming task, as it is essential to ensure the well-being of your fish. Fortunately, with the right tools and techniques, cleaning your fish tank can become an easy and straightforward process. In this article, we will guide you step-by-step to clean your aquarium effectively using a shop vac, vinegar, and bottled water. Step 1: Suck Up Dirt and Waste with a Shop Vac The first step in cleaning your aquarium is removing dirt and waste from the tank using a shop vac. Before you begin, it is essential to unplug all electrical devices in the tank and remove any decorations, plants, and fish from the bowl for their safety. A shop vac, also known as a wet/dry vacuum cleaner, is specifically designed to deal with large amounts of debris in a short amount of time. Follow these steps to clean the tank using a shop vac: 1. Remove any aquarium accessories, plants, and decorations before vacuuming. 2. Carefully suction out all visible dirt, waste, and debris from the tank. Be cautious of gravel or small stones, as you may need to adjust the suction strength of the vacuum accordingly. 3. Regularly check and empty the shop vac's collection container, ensuring that it does not overflow. Step 2: Wipe the Bowl with Vinegar and a Cloth Once you have removed the majority of dirt and waste from your aquarium, you must clean the glass and other surfaces thoroughly. Vinegar is an excellent natural cleaning agent that can effectively remove stains, algae, and dirt without harming your aquatic pets. To clean the aquarium glass with vinegar, use a soft, non-abrasive cloth and follow these steps: 1. Mix equal parts of distilled white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. 2. Generously spray the aquarium surfaces, avoiding any live plants or decorations that may be sensitive to vinegar. 3. Gently scrub the glass and other surfaces of the tank with a cloth, paying close attention to crevices and corners where dirt and algae may accumulate. 4. Once the surfaces are clean, use a separate cloth soaked in clean water to remove any residual vinegar from the tank. Step 3: Rinse and Dry the Bowl Thoroughly After cleaning the aquarium with vinegar, ensure that it is thoroughly rinsed and dried to remove any leftover debris, cleaning solution, or mineral deposits from the water. To do this: 1. Fill the empty aquarium with clean water and swirl it around to rinse off the glass and other surfaces. 2. Dispose of the rinsing water and repeat the process until the tank is completely free of vinegar or any other contaminants. 3. Wipe and pat dry the aquarium with a clean cloth or paper towels before proceeding to the next step. Step 4: Put Everything Back into the Bowl and Top It Off with Bottled Water Reassemble your aquarium by returning the plants, decorations, and fish to their respective places inside the tank. It is essential to ensure that your fish have a comfortable and stable environment after cleaning, which is why we recommend topping off your aquarium with bottled water. Bottled water typically has fewer impurities and contaminants than tap water, ensuring that your fish thrive in a healthy environment. To complete this step: 1. Carefully place the plants, decorations, and accessories back into the cleaned aquarium. 2. Reintroduce your fish to the aquarium, taking care not to shock them by gradually acclimating them to the new water. 3. Fill the aquarium with bottled water, ensuring that there is enough space for your fish to swim comfortably and the water level is suitable for your aquarium's filtration system. Conclusion Cleaning your aquarium may seem like a daunting task, but by following this step-by-step guide, you can easily maintain a clean and healthy environment for your fish. Using a shop vac, vinegar, and bottled water to clean and refill your tank not only ensures the well-being of your aquatic friends but also guarantees a stunning and thriving aquatic display in your home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Joan Agnes Theresa Sadie Brodel was born on January 26, 1925, in Highland Park, Michigan, the youngest child of John and Agnes Brodel. John was a bank clerk and Agnes was a pianist. Joan's two older sisters, Betty and Mary Brodel, shared their mother's musical interest and started to learn how to play instruments, such as the saxophone and the banjo, at an early age. They began performing in front of audiences in acts that included singing and dancing. In 1936, Leslie caught the attention of a talent scout from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) when the three Brodel sisters were performing in New York. She was given a six-month contract with the studio, earning 200 per week. While working at the studio, she attended MGM's Little Red Schoolhouse with other child actors like Mickey Rooney and Freddie Bartholomew.  Her first film role was in Camille (1936), a romantic drama starring Greta Garbo and Robert Taylor. She played Taylor's younger sister Marie Jeanette, but her speaking scenes were deleted and she was uncredited. MGM had trouble finding suitable roles for her, and she was let go by the studio along with Deanna Durbin. Leslie returned to New York, working on the radio and as a model. During this time, her older sister Mary was signed to Universal Studios. Leslie returned to Hollywood with the rest of her family, working for different studios as a freelancer. She mainly worked for RKO Pictures.  Leslie was selected to play a small role in Men with Wings (1938). While shooting the film, director William A.

The modern scientific or polite words \`\` vulva '' and \`\` vagina '' both stem from Latin , but originally they had different meanings . The different words '' Vulva \`\` and '' Vagina \`\` are both from Latin , but originally they had modern scientific or polite meanings .","output":"First, let's break down the sentences and analyze their components to compare their meanings: Sentence 1: - The modern scientific or polite words \\"vulva\\" and \\"vagina\\" both stem from Latin - Originally, they had different meanings Sentence 2: - The different words \\"Vulva\\" and \\"Vagina\\" are both from Latin - Originally, they had modern scientific or polite meanings Now let's analyze and compare the sentences: 1. Both sentences mention that \\"vulva\\" and \\"vagina\\" are from Latin, which indicates that the words have a common linguistic origin. 2. Sentence 1 states that the words had different meanings originally, which implies that these terms have evolved to relate to similar concepts in modern times. Sentence 2 also mentions that the words are different but does not refer explicitly to the shift or evolution in their meanings. It can be inferred but is less explicit. 3. Sentence 1 describes the terms as modern scientific or polite words, emphasizing the contemporary usage and context for these terms. Sentence 2, however, states that the terms originally had modern scientific or polite meanings, which seems to be contradictory since it refers to their original (i.e., non-modern) meanings. This part is unclear and possibly incorrect. In conclusion, the two sentences do not have the same meaning. While they both reference the Latin origin of the words \\"vulva\\" and \\"vagina,\\" the first sentence focuses on how the words have evolved over time and become modern scientific or polite terms, while the second sentence has an unclear and possibly incorrect reference to the original meanings of the terms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Raven Context: After Jean Thatcher (Ware) has been injured in a car accident, her father, Judge Thatcher (Hinds) and beau Jerry (Matthews) implore retired surgeon Dr. Richard Vollin (Lugosi) to perform a delicate operation to restore her to health. Vollin agrees and is successful; he befriends the spirited and grateful Jean, in the process revealing his passion for all things related to Edgar Allan Poe, including his homemade collection of torture devices inspired by Poe's works (such as a pit, pendulum with crescent razor, shrinking room, etc.), and identifying the raven as his talisman. After Vollin reveals his growing love for Jean to her father, the Judge quickly discourages him from the affair. Angered, Vollin hatches a plan when Edmond Bateman (Karloff), a murderer on the run, comes to his home asking for a new face so he may live in anonymity. Vollin admits to not being a plastic surgeon, but says he can help Bateman, and asks him to help in exacting revenge on the Thatchers, which he refuses. Bateman explains that he feels his antisocial behavior is a result of having been called ugly all his life, and he hopes a new face may gave him a chance to end it. Vollin performs the surgery, but instead turns Bateman into a disfigured monster, promising only to operate again on Bateman when Vollin's revenge is exacted. Bateman finally reluctantly agrees. Vollin hosts a dinner party, among which Jean, Jerry, and the Judge are guests. One by one, the guests are caught in the Poe-inspired traps. Ultimately, Bateman is shot by Vollin as he rescues Jean and Jerry, but throws Vollin into the shrinking room where he perishes, and the guests escape.

This will be the first time the prestigious international football tournament will be held in the Middle East and the Arabic-speaking world. The competition will take place from November 21 to December 18, 2022, which is a deviation from the usual June-July schedule to avoid the extreme summer heat in the region. The tournament will feature 32 teams from around the globe competing in a total of 64 matches across various locations within Qatar. Qatar's successful bid for hosting the World Cup was announced on December 2, 2010, marking a historic moment for the nation as it became the first Middle Eastern country to be chosen for this prominent sporting event. The 2022 World Cup comes with the vision of connecting the East and the West and promoting a message of unity, peace, and understanding through the medium of football.

Foster) cases a local payroll delivery van for a holdup he takes into account the schedule of Rolfe and his deliveries as he plans his getaway. Foster contacts three crooks to help with the crime while keeping his own identity secret he blackmails them with past crimes and a guarantee of a 300 thousand-dollar payout for each. Pulling in Peter Harris (Jack Elam), Boyd Kane (Neville Brand), and Tony Romano (Lee Van Cleef), Foster pulls off a robbery of a bank next to one of Rolfe's deliveries and then by using a duplicate flower van points the police to Rolfe who is arrested and brutally interrogated by the police. Eventually cleared Rolfe is determined to clear his name and sets out to find the crew that set him up. He tracks Harris to a gambling joint in Mexico and takes on his identity and travels to a resort town in Tijuana to confront the rest of the crooks. Once there he meets Foster's daughter Helen (Coleen Gray) who has come to surprise her father. Rolfe and Helen develop an immediate attraction for each other and Foster attempts to keep them apart, as he plans to frame Rolfe for the bank job. As the time for splitting up the money draws near Kane and Tony discover Rolfe's true identity and a dangerous confrontation with Foster appears inevitable. My question: How does Foster get crooks to participate? A:","output":"Foster gets the crooks to participate in the heist by leveraging their past crimes and promising them a substantial monetary reward. He carefully selects three crooks: Peter Harris (Jack Elam), Boyd Kane (Neville Brand), and Tony Romano (Lee Van Cleef), who have criminal records and would be interested in a high-paying job.  To ensure their cooperation, Foster uses a combination of blackmail and incentive. He gathers information about their past criminal activities, which can be used against them if they refuse his proposal. By holding this information over their heads, Foster forces the crooks into a situation where they feel compelled to participate in the heist. Additionally, Foster entices the crooks with the promise of a significant payout. He guarantees each of them a share of 300,000 upon the successful completion of the robbery. This large sum of money serves as a strong motivation for the crooks to join Foster's plan and put their criminal skills to use. Moreover, Foster maintains his anonymity in the beginning, allowing the crooks to focus on their roles in the heist without becoming suspicious of his true intentions. This adds another layer of security to Foster's plan, ensuring that the crooks are committed to the job without realizing that they are being manipulated. In summary, Foster gets the crooks to participate in the Kansas City Confidential heist by employing blackmail based on their past crimes, providing the allure of a substantial financial reward, and maintaining his anonymity for added security. This combination of tactics ensures the crooks' cooperation and keeps them focused on the task at hand, ultimately setting the stage for the unfolding events in the movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Mary of Teck (Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes; 26 May 1867  24 March 1953) was Queen of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions and Empress of India as the wife of King-Emperor George V.  - Saint Helena is a volcanic tropical island in the South Atlantic Ocean, east of Rio de Janeiro and west of the Cunene River, which marks the border between Namibia and Angola in southwestern Africa. It is part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. Saint Helena measures about and has a population of 4,534 (2016 census). It was named after Saint Helena of Constantinople.  - A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king (or an empress consort in the case of an emperor). In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch.  - Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha is a British Overseas Territory located in the South Atlantic and consisting of the island of Saint Helena, Ascension Island and the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha.   - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\".  - Bulgaria (tr. '), officially the Republic of Bulgaria (tr. '), is a country in southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. With a territory of , Bulgaria is Europe's 16th-largest country.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Brunei, officially the Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace (Jawi: ), is a sovereign state located on the north coast of the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. Apart from its coastline with the South China Sea, the country is completely surrounded by the state of Sarawak, Malaysia. It is separated into two parts by the Sarawak district of Limbang. Brunei is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo; the remainder of the island's territory is divided between the nations of Malaysia and Indonesia. Brunei's population was 408,786 in July 2012.  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: “If I close my eyes,” Jennifer Hudson says, closing her eyes, “I can almost remember what it was like, what I was like, 15 years ago. I was at home in Chicago, still in high school, singing in church, living with my family.” She opens her bright brown eyes again, stares straight at me to answer my question. “But generally, no, it feels like another Jennifer life. I don’t look the same. I’m a mother now. So many things have changed. I sometimes think the only constant is my voice. That hasn’t gone away.” In those 15 years, Hudson has lived more than a few American dreams and nightmares. Having taken her chances at manufactured fame on Simon Cowell’s American Idol (she was a losing finalist in series 3) she discovered it for real with her unforgettable debut acting performance in Dreamgirls, in which she played spurned Motown diva Effie White, stealing the show from Beyoncé Knowles, Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx and winning a best supporting actress Oscar. She followed that with a Grammy award-winning album that saw her bracketed, naturally, with Aretha and Whitney. The talk then was that she had an old soul voice, a seen-it-all voice (the authentic sound of a “religious, transcendent experience” Oprah Winfrey said). As it turned out, she hadn’t seen anything yet. In October 2008, while on tour, Hudson received a call from her sister Julia that changed the narrative of her life forever. Hudson had been trying to reach her mother by text that morning and was worried that she did not get a reply (they contacted each other first thing every morning when she was on the road, so the silence was odd). The silence was explained by Julia’s hysterical call that told her their mother, Darnell, and brother, Jason, had been shot and murdered at home, and that Julia’s seven-year-old son, Julian, was missing. Hudson later recalled in the trial of her former brother-in-law, William Balfour, that she had gone straight back to Chicago and holed up with her sister in a hotel room, holding each other and waiting for news. After three days, Julian’s body was discovered in the back of a stolen pick-up truck. Balfour was eventually convicted of the three murders in 2012 and received three life sentences. Hudson is still finding ways to talk about those years. “I have definitely seen the highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows,” she says. “You don’t know how strong you are until you are placed in that kind of moment.” She pauses. “I don’t really know what else to say.” Her mother had been the secretary of the local church, where Hudson had led the gospel solos in the choir. Was her religious faith a help to her? “It was the ultimate help to me,” she says. “We always said: ‘If He brings you to it, He will bring you through it.’ There would be no point in faith if it wasn’t tested. My mother always told me no matter how negative your life seems to be, you must always look for a positive. That is what I believe a woman of faith should do.” In hudson’s early years her father was mostly absent from the family and she shared a bed with her mother until she was 16. There is a kind of primal scream of human separation that her voice seems created for. It was there already in her extraordinary performance of Dreamgirls’s signature lament – “And I am telling you I’m not going” – and it is there throughout her second album, on tracks like “I Remember Me”. Her third album, JHUD, which is released in September, includes a song that she has written in her mother’s memory called “Moan”. The lyric runs: “My momma taught me everything I know, and I will take it everywhere I go, if you think you’ve seen it all, just keep on living, live long”. I imagine the act of singing that song has been very tough. “Yes,” she says, “but Mom would always tell us if you are hurting, moan and you will feel better. That’s the title of the song. There is not a day that goes by when I don’t repeat the things she said. She was very quiet. The complete opposite of us kids. Now she has gone, I realise she had a lot to say. My brother, too, I hear him, too. When we were kids any time my brother saw me crying he would be like, ‘Jenny, knock it off.’ And that’s what I hear him say when I cry now.” In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, Hudson was in something of a daze. She was in something like that state, too, she recalls, when she walked out at the Super Bowl in 2012 to sing “Star-Spangled Banner” beside the children of Sandy Hook High School who had lately suffered their own immeasurable loss. The performance came a few weeks after the long process of justice that culminated in the conviction of Balfour. “In many ways the trial was the most dreadful part of it all,” Hudson says. “But again I know my mother would not have wanted us to miss a beat, so we were there every day. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone to have to experience anything like that, but that is what you do for your family, so that is what we did…” What was in her head when she stepped out to sing the national anthem? “I was not very present at all any of that time,” she says. “It felt like a dream. I haven’t watched it back, because those moments send you back to a certain place and that’s a place I don’t want to go back to.” To avoid that constant return to grief, Hudson has worked on ways to live in the present and future. “That is where the Julian D King Foundation came from,” she says, of the charity created in her nephew’s name. “I was thinking how could I find something in all this that would make my mother proud of me. My sister and I lost three family members and we both wanted to find a way that we would not dread every birthday and holiday and family occasion again. I wanted my sister to celebrate Julian’s birthday again, so we created Hatch Day, where we go around together giving local schools supplies that they need. And she looks forward to shopping for that, like she used to look forward to shopping for his birthday presents. My nephew was super into education – he used to call himself Dr King. She can pour his blessings on to these kids and keep his memory alive.” It is often said of great soul singers that all the grief of the ages is embedded in their voices; have those awful experiences, I ask, changed the way she feels about her own vocal expression? She thinks for a moment. “No,” she says. “Certainly there is a lot of emotion there, but I think I have always been in that kind of space. What do they say in church? Sing from your heart, because you are singing to God. You know, when I used to sing those solos in church I would go through every line and ask the director: ‘What does this mean? What are we trying to convey here?’ If you can’t feel the emotion of a song, how do you expect anyone else to? It’s like a testimony in that way.” She believes that testimony has become more personal on her new album, which is more upbeat than her previous ballad-led work. “I think this album is more my personality coming through,” she says. She has been writing on some of the tracks and is involved in production, with the help of friends like Timbaland and R Kelly. “It’s been a completely different experience,” she says. “I’ve never stayed in the studio all night long, but this time I had a three-song set to do with Timbaland and we did all three songs in one night. I was writing, guiding my own vocals, just being creative. I never used to love going into the studio. Now I can’t wait to get there.” Writing is a new challenge, but the gift of singing has been with her as long as she can remember. When did she first realise she could communicate it? “When I was 13, 14. It was my other classmates or people in the choir who kind of made me realise,” she says. “They would say the adults listened differently when I sang. And that made me take notice. I started to go and sing at various places and all these people would show up – my teachers, people from church, friends. After that I would be making music videos in the mirror, practising my acceptance speeches. I would sing in the hallway of our home, where the acoustics were good, and neighbours would stop me next morning and say: ‘I heard you singing last night.’ The line was always the same: ‘She’s a little girl but she sounds like a grown woman…’” There had been a lot of music at home. Her grandmother, who lived with the family, had been a soloist in her time, and taught Jennifer and Julia (“though my sister is not a singer,” Hudson says of her elder sibling, with a rivalrous giggle. “Not at all! She’s hilarious!”) It was her mother who pointed her in the direction of American Idol. “The first series, I wasn’t so interested. It was summer, I wanted to be outside. But my mother was on at me: ‘You should watch this.’ To start with I was like, ‘Whatever’, but when Kelly Clarkson won the first series I was literally nauseous. I realised it could be for real. I was beating myself up that I didn’t go and audition. When season two came around I had started working for the Disney Cruise Line and that was a given, whereas Idol was a gamble. So I stuck with what I had. I used the ship experience to test myself. When I got off the ship two days later I went to audition for American Idol. That’s when the ball started rolling.” She must have been surprised not to win. “It was better to lose, in some ways. When I went to audition for Dreamgirls, I was still in that ‘I am not going to let anything stop me’ kind of mood.” Was it terrifying to turn up on the first day on set with Foxx and Murphy and Beyoncé, without a day’s acting experience? “It was like I had blinders on. I had no time to be scared. I didn’t really realise how important my character, Effie, was to the film until it finished, somehow. I just wanted to keep up, make sure I did my best.” That spirit seems to have been pretty near to the surface throughout Hudson’s life. There is something cheerfully indomitable about her, something you guess will never take no for an answer, and not just because you know what she has come through. When I ask her about her father she says that he wasn’t really present in her childhood, but when she was 14 she thought “enough was enough and went with my siblings to find him. And after that he was around for us until he passed. I was always one for having people get along. So I was a bit like: ‘Let’s go and get Dad and tell him we are all going to live together’ and after that we did. It was kind of weird.” In 2010 Hudson dramatically changed her appearance, losing 4st and becoming a face of Weight Watchers. I ask if that change in body shape has further changed her sense of self. “I have a lot more fun with clothes and shopping these days,” she says. “But as far as sense of self I have always had a lot of confidence. There were several reasons for it. One was preparing for an acting role. The other was that my fiancé [WWE wrestler-turned-lawyer David Otunga] and I realised that when we were growing up neither one of us had good health examples. We were always told to finish your food, clear your plate. We were never taught the proper way to eat. We grew up around a lot of eating, fish fries on Fridays, all that. When I was ready to have my son we wanted to teach him right. It was not until I went to Hollywood that I realised people might watch what they eat. I was like, ‘Wow!’ And then I thought ‘OK, I can do that.’” Have people treated her differently? “Definitely. People I knew 10 years ago, 50lb ago, will be really strange around me. I have to remind them it is me, Jennifer, honestly.” The birth of Hudson’s son, David Jnr, in 2009, followed quite closely on the tragedy and presented her with a new set of challenges, as well as an ever-present antidote to her grief. She has travelled to London alone when we meet but hates to be away from him. “He’s nearly five, a big boy now at home with his dad. He will click his fingers when I leave and say, ‘Mum you will be home this quick?’ He’s into superheroes, so I tell him I’m going to fly away like Superman and do my work and fly right back to him. Which works for a while…” One of the things her experience of being a daughter and mother have taught her is that maybe there are more things to sing about than the songs that tend to come her way. She once expressed her regret, at 30-something, about still being expected to sing exclusively about clubland chemistry. I wonder how strongly she feels that. “Something I said got a bit exaggerated,” she says, “but there are an awful lot of songs about sex, and it’s more like, as I say to my sister Julia sometimes, does everything have to be about that one thing? The world is a broad place. Even on my first album I was like, ‘Isn’t there more to sing about in the world? Or to talk about? There is so much more out there to portray…’” As she talks, she uses her sister, with whom she has been through so much, as a kind of touchstone, or ever-present confidante. “We have always been very close,” she says. “She works with me now – although she doesn’t do all that much work! She bosses me around, she’s a tough cookie. We don’t live together or anything, she likes being Julia and I like being Jennifer, but she never stops being my big sister. It’s like, ‘Jennifer go get this!’ and I’m like, ‘Hey, I’m the boss!’” That mixture of tenderness and stubborn will seems ever present in Hudson’s voice. When she was making JHUD her more assertive alter ego was christened with a name – Jones – the part of her that, however broken or vulnerable, is always ready to take on the world. Where, I ask, before our time is up, did that moniker come from? “It came from doing the shoot for the album,” she says. “The image was coming together photo by photo, but I’d look at it and think: ‘Who is that? It’s not me!’ It took on a whole other persona. It looked more like Grace Jones. Since then I call her Jones, ‘boss lady’, she’s always around.” Hudson laughs. “I don’t think she’s going away any time soon.” Jennifer Hudson’s latest single, Walk It Out, is out now. The new album is released later this year Write a title for it.","output":"Jennifer Hudson: Reflecting on Her Life, Tragedies, and Career"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sutcliffe was born in Bingley in the West Riding of Yorkshire to a working-class family. He was given a Catholic upbringing by his parents, John William Sutcliffe and his wife Kathleen Frances (nee Coonan). Reportedly a loner, he left school aged fifteen and had a series of menial jobs, including two stints as a gravedigger in the 1960s. Between November 1971 and April 1973, Sutcliffe worked at the Baird Television factory on a packaging line. West Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale. It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents.  Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside background, and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the FBI, plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis, whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that \\"Wearside Jack\\" was a blatant hoaxer. The investigation used it as a point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The \\"Wearside Jack\\" hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact he had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services.  In response to the police reaction to the murders, the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group organised a number of 'Reclaim the Night' marches. The group and other feminists had criticised the police for victim-blaming, especially the suggestion that women should remain indoors at night. Eleven marches in various towns across the United Kingdom took place on the night of 12 November 1977. They made the point that women should be able to walk anywhere without restriction and that they should not be blamed for men's violence.  In 1988, the mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, during action for damages on behalf of her daughter's estate, argued in the High Court that the police had failed to use reasonable care in apprehending the murderer of her daughter in Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire. The House of Lords held that the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire did not owe a duty of care to the victim due to the lack of proximity and therefore failing on the second limb of the Caparo test. What did her mother do?","output":"The mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, went to the High Court in 1988 to argue that the police had failed to use reasonable care in catching the person who killed her daughter.

We waited for half an hour, watching the smoke curling over the house, and then, judging that the Indians had made off for fear of being ambushed, we crossed the clearing.  It took but a glance to read the story.  The women had been washing by the little brook before the cabin, with the children playing about them, when the Indians had come up and with a single volley killed them all except the child we had heard crying.  They had swooped down upon their victims, torn the scalps from their heads, looted the house, and set fire to it.  We dragged out the body of the woman which had been thrown within, in the hope that a spark of life might yet remain, but she was quite dead.  Beneath the warrior Spiltdorph had shot we found the child.  It was a boy of some six or seven years, and so covered with blood that it seemed it must be dead.  But we stripped it and washed it in the brook, and found no wounds upon it except in the head, where it had been struck with a hatchet before its scalp had been stripped off.  The cold water brought it back to life and it began to cry again, whereat Spiltdorph took off his coat and wrapped it tenderly about it.

He also included some money with his message, asking whoever found it to use the money to post the letter to his family. Seventeen days later he reached his destination, having survived the dangerous seas, but he assumed his message in the bottle had not -- until it was found on shore, 11 years later! Recently, American woman Katherine Ginn and her friend came across the bottle on a deserted beach in the Bahamas. \\"Alongside it they'd found a life jacket and, assuming the worst, opened the bottle and spent 24 hours drying it out so they could read my story and write to my family as I requested,\\" says Peter, 44. \\"I couldn't believe it -- that after all these years my bottle had turned up with its contents, still undamaged.\\" Overjoyed, he wrote to the pair, saying he was alive and living in Australia with his family. Katherine posted him his letter, money and some broken glass of his bottle placed in a tiny box as a special souvenir. These special items now share pride of place among photos of Peter's Atlantic voyage. \\"I can't express what this old letter means to me,\\" Peter says. \\"It gives me a sense of hope and belief. It's something special to share with my children as they grow up.\\" Question: Why did Peter have the idea of a message bottle? - He missed his family very much then. - He hoped to share his experience with his family. - He regretted taking a risk on the ocean. - He thought he might lose his life on the voyage. Answer:","output":"Peter had the idea of a message bottle because he thought he might lose his life on the voyage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: It probably goes without saying because the goal is always to make your first meeting with a new person positive, but it's especially important with college girls, who probably have plenty of date options on campus. That's why you want to take care with your appearance and be polite and attentive when you first make contact. If you're talking to a girl at party, make sure you haven't had too much to drink. While liquid courage may make it easier to approach her, she probably isn't going to be impressed if you're slurring your words and having trouble staying on your feet. To show that you have genuine interest in a girl, you should want to learn more about her. Asking open-ended questions, rather than simple yes-no inquiries, usually works best because it gives her a chance to really share her experiences, feelings, and opinions with you. Be more creative than simply asking her what her major is or which dorm she lives in. She probably hears those questions a lot. Instead, try to build off of what she says. For example, if she tells you that she loves traveling, ask her what her favorite trip was and why. If you want a girl to take your interest in her seriously, it helps to show that you're still thinking about her when you're not together. Phone calls or texts can help establish a rapport that makes her feel comfortable with you, so she's more willing to say yes when you ask for a date.  If you're not sure what to stay in your phone call or text, ask a follow-up question to your last conversation, share an inside joke about the last time you saw her, or tell her that you saw something that reminded you of her. Don't just call or text late at night -- she might get the wrong idea. Once you feel like you've gotten to know her, there's nothing left to do but ask her out. You don't have to be formal, though. Ask her if she'd like to hang out sometime, and if she says yes, suggest a day and time. It's normal to be nervous before you ask a girl out. Give yourself a little pep talk before you do it, reminding yourself of all your positive qualities. You don't have to take her out for a candlelit dinner right out of the gate. In fact, it's usually best to make your first outing a low pressure situation, such as grabbing a cup of coffee or having lunch at the student union. However, you should choose a venue that allows for quality conversation, so a movie or noisy bar probably isn't the best option. Once you've gone on a few casual dates, you can progress to more typical outings, such as dinner at a nice restaurant. When you're in college, you usually don't have too much money. That doesn't mean you can't take a girl on memorable dates. Some inexpensive date ideas include a school sporting event, a picnic in a local park, or a movie marathon at home. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of making a positive first impression while meeting college girls and offers advice on how to achieve this. Key points include maintaining a good appearance, being polite and attentive, engaging in meaningful conversations through open-ended questions, establishing rapport through phone calls or texts, and eventually asking the person out.

Review: When I was a kid it was Lex Barker's time as Tarzan. I often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller \\"was\\" Tarzan and I wouldn't understand why since I saw a couple of Weismuller's last films in the character and I thought he was sort of out of shape. It wasn't after many years that I came across \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\", and then I understood. Weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other Tarzans such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. As for this film I was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan a strong, self minded, active and \\"no-inhibitions\\" woman as Jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made (Tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused; one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn't kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it); such behaviors were unthinkable with the \\"Janes\\" to come such as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart, all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the African jungle. O'Sullivan character's sparkling personality steals the show out of Tarzan himself, except of course when it comes to action and Weismuller takes the lead easily; the combination is perfect. Another highlight in the movie is Cheeta's secondary role and not as the main lead like in later Tarzan pictures where she often saves the day. \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\" stands as a fine product in its genre (Tarzan films) and perhaps as the best, though I have to admit that I also enjoyed \\"Tarzan's Greatest Adventure\\" (1959) made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast (and in spite of the just acceptable Gordon Scott in the leading role with his too perfect \\"all gymnasium\\" physical looks that doesn't fit for a rustic ape man).

Plot title: This Happy Breed Movie plot: Opening in 1919, shortly after the end of the First World War, the film focuses on the middle class Gibbons family after they settle in a house in Clapham, South London. The household includes Frank, his wife Ethel, their three children â Reg, Vi and Queenie â his widowed sister Sylvia and Ethel's mother. Frank is delighted to discover that his next-door neighbour is Bob Mitchell, a friend from his days in the army. Frank finds employment in a travel agency run by another old army chum. As the children grow up and the country adapts to peacetime, the family attend a number of events, such as the British Empire Exhibition held at Wembley in 1924. Reg becomes friendly with Sam, a staunch socialist, who is attracted to Vi. Queenie is pursued by Bob's sailor son Billy, but she longs to escape the suburbs and lead a more glamorous life elsewhere. During the General Strike of 1926, Reg is injured in a brawl in Whitechapel Road. Vi blames Sam, who had brought her brother to the area, but eventually her anger dissipates and she marries him. In 1928, Charleston dance mania arrives in England; Queenie exhibits her fancy steps at the local dance hall and wins a dance contest. As all of London is swept up in the Jazz Age, news of new German chancellor Adolf Hitler begins to appear in the newspapers. Reg marries Phyllis. Billy proposes to Queenie, but she confesses she is in love with a married man and soon after runs off with him. Her mother says she cannot forgive her and never wants to see her again. As time passes, Aunt Sylvia discovers spiritualism, Reg and Phyllis are killed in a car crash, and the British Union of Fascists tries to stir up anti-Semitic sentiment in the city. Stanley Baldwin becomes Prime Minister, King George V dies, and Ethel's mother passes away. When Neville Chamberlain returns from Munich with the promise of \\"peace in our time\\", Frank is disgusted by people's enthusiastic response.

Students and families from Parkland, Fla., were transported to Washington, D.C., ahead of the “March for Our Lives” against gun violence this Saturday with the help of the New England Patriots.      On Thursday, team owner Robert Kraft provided the team’s official plane to fly the families of the 17 victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and some of the students who were injured to the nation’s capital for the event, Patriots spokesman Stacey James said.      James said Kraft decided to lend the plane to those affected by the shooting after former Arizona representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, reached out to him and asked for the favor.

He was not aware of any Patriots players on the flight. Kraft was not with them.      “No report other than they took off and everyone was happy,” James said.

It’s one of two that the team owns.      Some of the most prominent student activists from Stoneman Douglas were in Cambridge earlier this week to participate in a panel at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government about the gun-control movement building across the country.      Thousands of people are expected to participate in the march in Washington to call for stricter gun control measures Saturday, according to event organizers. Similar protests are taking place around the country the same day, including in Boston.      Students shared photos on social media Thursday of themselves getting ready to board the plane.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who marched with Besant? ?  Fuller's time at Adyar was eventful. Leadbeater arrived around the same time as Fuller, and soon afterward he \\"discovered\\" the person he believed would become a global teacher and orator, Jiddu Krishnamurti (then in his teens). Leadbetter and others tutored Krishnamurti. Fuller may have taught him photography. She also had a small studio built in the grounds, and painted. Her works from the period include a portrait of Leadbeater and Portrait of the Lord Buddha. McFarlane emphasises the significance of the latter work, pointing out that it is \\"strikingly modern\\" in comparison to all of Fuller's other work, and more radical than compositions created by Grace Cossington Smith and Roland Wakelin, half a decade later. The painting owes much to theosophy's emphasis on seeing the subject \\"through a psychic, visionary experience\\". Sources describing Fuller's movements after her time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but found it difficult to realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, and I can only write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.

To combine them, simply add their coefficients: -580*u + 358*u = (-580 + 358)*u = -222*u The equation now becomes: -222*u + 19422 = 857*u Step 2: Move the term with the variable (u) to one side of the equation. To get all the terms involving u on one side and the constants on the other side, add 222*u to both sides of the equation:  -222*u + 222*u + 19422 = 857*u + 222*u Simplifying this gives: 19422 = 1079*u  Step 3: Isolate u by dividing by the coefficient. Now, we have an equation with u on one side and a constant on the other side. To isolate u, divide both sides by the coefficient of u (which is 1079): 19422 / 1079 = 1079*u / 1079 This simplifies to: u = 19422 / 1079 Step 4: Calculate the value of u. Now we have the value of u in a fraction form. To get its exact value, divide 19422 by 1079: u = 18 Thus, the solution to the equation -580*u + 358*u + 19422 = 857*u is u = 18."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Instructions: Given a scientific question and its correct answer, generate supporting facts for the answer. This supporting fact can be an explanation for the answer to the given question. Input: Question: Viruses were assumed to exist before they were first seen with an electron microscope in which decade? Answer: 1930 ' s Output:","output":"Supporting Fact 1: Prior to the 1930s, scientists had observed negative effects on organisms, such as diseases, but could not directly visualize the causative agents due to the limitations of light microscopes, which had a resolution of only 0.2 micrometers. They presumed these agents to be viruses, which are much smaller than bacteria. Supporting Fact 2: The discovery and use of the electron microscope, developed in the early 1930s by Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll, allowed for much higher resolution (50 picometers) and magnification, enabling scientists to finally visualize these extremely small particles. Supporting Fact 3: After the electron microscope's invention, researchers in the 1930s managed to visualize the tobacco mosaic virus's structure, which provided substantial evidence for the existence of viruses. This discovery was significant because it helped to solidify the understanding that viruses cause specific diseases in organisms. Supporting Fact 4: The existence of viruses was further supported by the development of new laboratory techniques that allowed researchers to isolate, cultivate, and study the characteristics of these infectious particles. Methods such as viral cultivation in host organisms and filtration techniques provided further evidence, even before their visualization under the electron microscope. Supporting Fact 5: During the 1930s, significant advancements were made in virology as well, including the concept of virus-host interactions, mechanisms of infection, and the identification of specific viral strains. These scientific developments strengthened the understanding of viral existence and their role in causing diseases in the living organisms."},{"instruction":"Two brothers got sick and weren't feeling well.

It consists of a linear scale marked with units like centimeters, millimeters, or inches. Using the evidence that a ruler is used for measuring the length of an object, we can analyze each of the available choices and determine the most appropriate answer: (A) Distance between cities: Rulers are not suitable for measuring extensive distances like the distance between cities. Such large distances are typically measured in units like kilometers or miles. While a ruler can be useful for calculating such distances on a map with a specific scale, it is not practical to use a ruler directly to measure the distance between cities in real-world conditions. (B) Air: Air is a mixture of gases that make up the Earth's atmosphere. It does not have a specific measureable length, as it is composed of individual molecules that occupy space in a non-linear manner. As such, a ruler would not be an appropriate tool for measuring air. (C) Stuff: This option is broad and vague. A ruler can be used to measure the length of various 'stuff' or objects that have linear dimensions such as notebooks, fabric, or wood. Since this choice aligns with the evidence – that a ruler is used for measuring the length of an object – this is the most appropriate answer based on the information provided. (D) Motivation: Motivation is a psychological and emotional state and does not have a physical length or dimensional attribute. A ruler cannot measure motivation, as it is not a tangible concept. In conclusion, based on the evidence that a ruler is used for measuring the length of an object, the best-suited answer among the available choices would be (C) stuff.

Please answer the following question: The majority of Indian women wear a red dot   between their eyebrows. While it is generally taken as an indicator of their marital   status, the practice is primarily related to the Hindu religion. The dot goes by different names in different Hindi dialects, and \\"bindi\\" is the one that is most commonly known. Traditionally, the dot carries no gender restriction: Men as well as women wear it. However, the tradition of men wearing it has faded in recent times, so nowadays we see a lot more women than men wearing one. The position of the bindi is standard: center of the forehead, close to the eyebrows. It represents a third, or inner eye. Hindu tradition holds that all people have three eyes: The two outer ones are used for seeing the outside world, and the third one is there to focus inward toward God. As such, the dot serves as a constant reminder to keep God in the front of a believer's thoughts. Red is the traditional color of the dot. It is said that in ancient times a man would place a drop of blood between his wife's eyes to seal their marriage. According to Hindu beliefs, the color red is believed to bring good fortune to the married couple. Today, people go with different colors depending upon their preferences. Women often wear dots that match the color of their clothes. Decorative or sticker bindis come in all sizes, colors and variations, and can be worn by young and old, married and unmarried people alike. Wearing a bindi has become more of a fashion statement than a religious custom. What is the importance of the third eye in Hindu tradition? A) To pay respect to God. B) To stay in harmony with nature. C) To see things with a subjective view. D) To observe the outside world more clearly. Answer:","output":"A) To pay respect to God. The concept of the third eye in Hindu tradition holds significant importance in both religious and spiritual contexts. The third eye, also known as the inner eye or the \\"ajna chakra,\\" is considered a source of spiritual insight, intuition, and wisdom. It symbolizes the ability to see beyond the material world and connect with the divine, thereby playing a crucial role in one's spiritual journey towards self-realization and enlightenment. The third eye is believed to help individuals perceive and understand aspects of reality beyond ordinary sensory perception. It allows them to look inward, beyond the realm of dualities and illusions, and attain a higher state of awareness and consciousness. This transcendent vision enables Hindus to acknowledge and pay respects to God in their everyday lives by invoking His presence and guidance. By wearing a bindi, which symbolizes the third eye, believers are reminded to keep God at the center of their thoughts, actions, and decisions. This helps them stay aligned with their spiritual purpose, foster a deeper connection with the divine, and ultimately leads them towards spiritual growth and realization. In summary, the importance of the third eye in Hindu tradition is to pay respect to God and maintain a strong spiritual connection with the divine, enabling believers to attain a higher state of awareness and wisdom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I found the following answer on Google: However, the chance that a given atom will decay is constant over time. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","output":"No, the information you found does not directly answer your question about which form of decay does not change the atomic number of the decaying atom. The correct answer to your question is that beta decay, specifically beta-plus decay (positron emission) and electron capture, does not change the atomic number. In beta-minus decay, a neutron in the nucleus is converted into a proton, and an electron (beta particle) is emitted. This increases the atomic number by 1. However, in beta-plus decay (positron emission), a proton in the nucleus is converted into a neutron, and a positron (antiparticle of the electron) is emitted. In electron capture, a proton in the nucleus captures an electron from an inner shell of the atom, converting the proton into a neutron. In both cases, the atomic number decreases by 1. The statement you found about the chance of decay being constant over time refers to the probability that a given radioactive atom will decay over time, which is a separate concept."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: Even when Realpolitik led the United States to side with dictators and oppressors, it was in the service of maximizing democracy and human rights in the world at large--a goal we in fact achieved. Here is a hypothesis:  Realpolitik encouraged people to side with the dictators through an elaborate ad campaign. Here are the options: OPT: (I) yes. (II) it is not possible to tell. (III) no. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Option III: No. Given the provided premise and hypothesis, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. In order to determine this, it is important to analyze the premise and hypothesis individually and in relation to each other. The premise states that even when Realpolitik led the United States to side with dictators and oppressors, it was in the service of maximizing democracy and human rights in the world at large, with the ultimate goal being achieved. This premise focuses on the intent and outcomes of Realpolitik in terms of promoting democracy and human rights. The actions brought on by Realpolitik may have had various motivations and strategies, which might have included siding with dictators or oppressors for the greater good as described in the premise. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that Realpolitik encouraged people to side with dictators through an elaborate ad campaign. This statement provides a very specific and narrow approach to how Realpolitik may have influenced people's opinions and alliances. This hypothesis seems unrelated to the overall goal of promoting democracy and human rights mentioned in the premise. To establish a link between the truth of the premise and the truth of the hypothesis, it would be necessary for the hypothesis to logically follow from or be supported by the premise. In this case, there is no clear connection between them. The premise focuses on the overall intentions and outcomes of Realpolitik in terms of democracy and human rights, whereas the hypothesis describes a very specific method - an ad campaign - for encouraging people to side with dictators. This method is not mentioned or implied by the premise, so it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. In conclusion, the correct answer is Option III: No. The premise and hypothesis do not share a logical or relational connection, making it impossible to validate the hypothesis's truth based on the premise's truth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Identify the words and their meanings: - 'I'll' is a contraction of 'I' (first-person pronoun) and 'will' (auxiliary verb, indicating intention or future action) - 'start' (verb) means to begin - 'again' (adverb) means to repeat an action Step 2: Find the corresponding Czech words: - 'I will': (já) budu - 'start': začít (infinitive form) - 'again': znovu Step 3: Combine words and adjust grammar: In Czech, the pronoun 'já' is often omitted, since the verb form already indicates the subject.

Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both.

Answer the following question. \\"The pasta called \\"\\"conchiglie\\"\\" is in the shape of what?\\"","output":"Conchiglie is a well-known Italian pasta variety that is named after its distinctive shape, which closely resembles seashells. These shell-shaped pasta pieces come in various sizes ranging from small (conchigliette), medium (conchiglie), to large (conchiglioni) and are usually made from durum wheat semolina, like most traditional Italian pasta. The unique seashell-shaped design of conchiglie not only makes them visually appealing but also provides functional advantages when it comes to combining with sauces and other ingredients in various pasta dishes. The concave structure of these shells makes them excellent for capturing and holding different types of sauce. The combination of smooth exterior and textured interior surfaces also helps to grip onto the sauce, leading to a more delicious and flavorful dish. Conchiglie is quite versatile and can be used in a wide range of Italian dishes, such as pasta salads, soups, and casseroles. They are particularly suitable for chunkier sauces that contain vegetables, meat, or seafood, as their shell structure allows for these ingredients to become lodged inside, enhancing the flavor and texture of the final dish. Furthermore, the larger conchiglioni are ideal for stuffing with various fillings such as ricotta cheese and spinach. Once filled, the stuffed shells can be baked with more sauce and cheese to create a delectable, savory meal. In conclusion, conchiglie is an Italian pasta variety that is named after and shaped like seashells. Made from durum wheat semolina, this unique pasta is valued for its ability to capture and hold sauces, making it an excellent choice for numerous dishes, whether enjoyed hot or cold. The intricate design works exceptionally well with chunky sauces and ingredients, ensuring a perfect harmony of flavors in every bite."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now I'm ready to write this letter to you. For a long time after Mom died, I thought I liked her more because I didn't like your attitude and I thought that her softer side was more desirable. In my 15-year-old's mind, I thought you could have stopped my mother from drinking herself to death. Instead, you were off playing tennis and working. Later, I realized that no one could make someone stop drinking. Support is important, but at the end of the day, it is a choice. You were just doing your best. What I have learned is that I am much like you. You taught me self-confidence. I know if I am prepared to work hard enough for something, I will be successful. This is no small thing. What I've realized since you died is that you were always there for me. You fought to ensure that I got my place on the Quebec badminton team that I had earned. When I got divorced  , you came up to see if I had what I needed to take care of the boys and you paid off my car. You taught me not to spend money I don't have. I've always kept to that rule. It has served me well. We always had a good home to live in, nice vacations, and everything we needed and most of what we wanted. You were not a perfect parent and neither am I. My children are much more thankful than I ever was. I am thankful that I had you as my dad. I am still Daddy's girl and I am proud of it. Question: What can we infer from the letter?

Information:  - Charing Cross denotes the junction of Strand, Whitehall and Cockspur Street, just south of Trafalgar Square in central London. It gives its name to several landmarks, including Charing Cross railway station, one of the main London rail terminals.  - Hampstead (or ), commonly known as Hampstead Village, is an area of London, England, northwest of Charing Cross. Part of the London Borough of Camden, it is known for its intellectual, liberal, artistic, musical and literary associations and for Hampstead Heath, a large, hilly expanse of parkland. It has some of the most expensive housing in the London area. The village of Hampstead has more millionaires within its boundaries than any other area of the United Kingdom.  - 2 Willow Road is part of a terrace of three houses in Hampstead , London designed by architect Ern Goldfinger and completed in 1939 . It has been managed by the National Trust since 1995 and is open to the public . It was one of the first modernist buildings acquired by the Trust , giving rise to some controversy . Goldfinger lived there with his wife Ursula and their children until his death in 1987 . 1 -- 3 Willow Road was constructed using concrete and a facing of red brick . A number of cottages were demolished to allow for the construction , which was strongly opposed by a number of local residents including novelist Ian Fleming ( this was said to be his inspiration for the name of the James Bond villain Auric Goldfinger ) and the future Conservative Home Secretary Henry Brooke . No. 2 , which Goldfinger designed specifically as his own family home , is the largest of the three houses and features a spiral staircase designed by Danish engineer Ove Arup at its core . The building is supported by a concrete frame , part of which is external , leaving room for a spacious uncluttered interior , perhaps inspired by the Raumplan ideas of modernist architect Adolf Loos . Goldfinger himself designed much of the furniture in No. 2 , and the house also contains a significant collection of 20th - century art by Bridget Riley , Marcel Duchamp , Henry Moore and Max Ernst . Entry is by timed ticket , and facilities are very limited . Nos. 1 and 3 remain private homes .  - A tower block, high-rise, apartment tower, residential tower, apartment block, block of flats, or office tower is a tall building or structure used as a residential and/or office building. In some areas it may be referred to as an \\"MDU\\", standing for \\"Multi Dwelling Unit\\". In the United States, such a structure is referred to as an apartment building or office building, while a group of such buildings is called an apartment complex or office complex.  - Ern Goldfinger (11 September 1902  15 November 1987) was a Hungarian-born architect and designer of furniture. He moved to the United Kingdom in the 1930s, and became a key member of the Modernist architectural movement. He is most prominently remembered for designing residential tower blocks, some of which are now listed buildings.  - Hampstead Heath (locally known as \\"the heath\\") is a large, ancient London park, covering . This grassy public space sits astride a sandy ridge, one of the highest points in London, running from Hampstead to Highgate, which rests on a band of London Clay. The heath is rambling and hilly, embracing ponds, recent and ancient woodlands, a lido, playgrounds, and a training track, and it adjoins the former stately home of Kenwood House and its estate. The south-east part of the heath is Parliament Hill, from which the view over London is protected by law.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Oan, angered by the BBC's incorrect reporting of his demands the previous evening, contacted the police negotiators shortly after 06:00 and accused the authorities of deceiving him. He demanded to speak with an Arab ambassador, but the negotiator on duty claimed that talks were still being arranged by the Foreign Office. Recognising the delaying tactic, Oan told the negotiator that the British hostages would be the last to be released because of the British authorities' deceit. He added that a hostage would be killed unless Tony Crabb was brought back to the embassy. Crabb did not arrive at the embassy until 15:30, nearly ten hours after Oan demanded his presence, to the frustration of both Oan and Sim Harris. Oan then relayed another statement to Crabb via Mustapha Karkouti, a journalist also being held hostage in the embassy. The police guaranteed that the statement would be broadcast on the BBC's next news bulletin, in exchange for the release of two hostages. The hostages decided amongst themselves that the two to be released would be Hiyech Kanji and Ali-Guil Ghanzafar; the former as she was pregnant and the latter for no other reason than his loud snoring, which kept the other hostages awake at night and irritated the terrorists.Later in the evening, at approximately 23:00, an SAS team reconnoitred the roof of the embassy. They discovered a skylight, and succeeded in unlocking it for potential use as an access point, should they later be required to storm the building. They also attached ropes to the chimneys to allow soldiers to abseil down the building and gain access through the windows if necessary. The answer is:","output":"Tony.

Would the answer to the question \\"What does the \`\` blue ribbon '' stand for ?\\" be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","output":"The answer to the question \\"What does the 'blue ribbon' stand for?\\" is primarily a description but may also be related to an entity, an abbreviation, a human, or a location depending on the context in which it is used. Description: In general, a blue ribbon represents excellence and serves as a symbol of high-quality or first-place achievements in various fields, such as academics, sports, arts, and more. It is often awarded to winners or champions in competitions, meets, and contests as a sign of recognition for their outstanding performance or superior quality. The concept of the blue ribbon dates back to its use as a badge or piece of clothing only to be worn by those identified as the best. Entity: In some cases, a blue ribbon may refer to an entity like a group or an organization dedicated to a specific cause. For example, the Blue Ribbon Foundation, which aims to raise awareness about men's health, or the Blue Ribbon Campaign against censorship, which was created in response to the Communications Decency Act. Abbreviation: Although not an abbreviation itself, the term blue ribbon is sometimes associated with abbreviations. For example, Blue Ribbon Panel, Blue Ribbon Task Force, or Blue Ribbon Committee, which are often used to represent a special group comprised of carefully selected experts or authorities, meant to investigate or solve a specific issue or problem. Human: When it comes to linking a blue ribbon to humans, it is usually in their capacity as recipients of the award or as committee members that create or oversee the blue ribbon initiatives, panels, or campaigns. Location: In rare cases, the blue ribbon may be linked to a location or establishment that promotes or supports the blue ribbon initiatives, events, or causes. For instance, a Blue Ribbon school exemplifies excellence in its teaching methods and student achievements. Similarly, it can also be incorporated into the name of a business, like a restaurant, to emphasize its exceptional quality. In summary, the answer to what the blue ribbon stands for is primarily a description but can extend to various other aspects depending on its use, such as an entity, human, location, or being related to an abbreviation. However, it is not a numeric value."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The train was travelling to an army camp in Cairo when it came off the tracks in the Badrashin area of Giza. It is not yet known what caused the accident. Egypt's roads and railways have a poor safety record. Last November 50 children died after a train crash into their school bus. Both the transport minister and the head of the railway authority were forced to resign   as a result  of the crash, which took place in November near Manfalut, 350km south of Cairo. Investigations later showed the barriers   at the crossing were not closed because the signal operator had fallen asleep. Monday's incident occurred as the army train was heading from Upper Egypt into Cairo.  Reports say more than 1,300 passengers were aboard the train when the accident happened shortly after midnight. The passengers wounded in the accident have been taken to hospitals, the governor of Giza said.  An eyewitness told BBC Arabic that he saw two dozen dead bodies at the scene of the accident. The latest incident could increase the pressure on the government to deal with the safety of trains, the BBC's Said Shehata reports from Cairo. Four years ago, some 18 people were killed and dozens injured in an accident crash between two passenger trains in the Giza area. And in 2002, a train caught fire in Cairo, killing 373 people.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Thank you for trusting me. I enjoy exchanging my ideas with yours The first thing I want to tell you is that if the boys are calling you names it is their fault, not yours. Boys, at your age, are different from girls. They are trying to prove that they are manly and then often do this by picking on someone who can't really fight back. This is, of course, wrong but it happens. In general, the boys know they are bigger and stronger than you are, so they can make fun of you and make you cry and then laugh about it. If you let them see that they are hurting you, they will only do it more. It isn't that they want to hurt you; they simply want to make themselves feel superior . It's stupid, but it is common. In English we say \\" sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me.\\" Canadian children learn this from their mothers because the same thing that is happening to you in China also happens here. The best ways of getting the boys to stop calling your names is to simply ignore them, knowing that the names can't hurt you and that the boys are being stupid. If you can laugh at them they will get tired of trying to make you cry and they'll give up. It won't be easy, but, trust me, it will work. There is also something else working in your favor and that is that you are growing up and the boys are beginning to notice you as a young woman. I suspect some of them actually like you and are making fun of you just to get your attention. Again, it's stupid but it happens. In reality, you can control this situation by not letting them see you getting hurt. Laugh at them, tell them they're acting like children and they should grow up and then walk away with your head held high. One more thing, Nancy. It is very important that you stop hurting yourself. If someone else hurts you, it is bad enough but you should't make it worse by then hurting yourself.

She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that? She thought he had been falling in love with her. How could she have been so wrong? But it could still happen--if that woman would just go away. Elmo said, \\"Yeah.

Article: SF’s landmark tower for rich and famous is sinking and tilting      The Millennium Tower in San Francisco has sunk 16 inches and tilted 2 inches since it opened in 2008. The Millennium Tower in San Francisco has sunk 16 inches and tilted 2 inches since it opened in 2008. Photo: Michael Noble Jr., The Chronicle Photo: Michael Noble Jr., The Chronicle Image 1 of / 63 Caption Close SF’s landmark tower for rich and famous is sinking and tilting 1 / 63 Back to Gallery      The Millennium Tower, a leading symbol of San Francisco’s new high-rise and high-end living, is sinking — setting the stage for what could be one of the most contentious and costly real estate legal battles the city has ever seen.      Rated by Worth magazine as one of the top 10 residential buildings in the world, the Millennium at 301 Mission St. is home to such A-listers as Joe Montana and Hunter Pence. Until his recent death, it’s where venture capitalist Tom Perkins owned a penthouse. Condos sell for anywhere from 1.6 million to north of 10 million.      However, since its completion in 2008, the 58-story building has sunk 16 inches, according to an independent consultant hired to monitor the problem. It has also tilted 2 inches to the northwest.      “That’s significant ... and of concern,” said Professor Greg Deierlein, director of the John A. Blume Earthquake Engineering Center at Stanford University, who has been called in to evaluate the designs of a couple of San Francisco’s newer downtown high-rises.      Deierlein noted that the 88-story Petronas Twin Towers in Malaysia — which were the world’s tallest buildings when they opened in 1998 — have sunk less than 3 inches. Their tilt, or “differential settlement,” is less than half an inch.      This isn’t just an issue for the Millennium’s owners and wealthy inhabitants: It could be a headache for taxpayers as well. There are potentially big public dollars at stake, with the owners alleging that the massive hole dug next door for the new Transbay Transit Center is to blame for the building’s issues.      The problem first came to light in 2010 when the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, the public agency constructing the transit center, hired the consulting firm Arup to gauge how the excavation could affect the tower.      According to the consultant’s initial report, by the time excavation began — two years after the 350 million Millennium was completed — the tower had already settled 10 inches. That was 4 inches more than its builders had predicted for the life of the high-rise.      Since then, “the building has continued to settle vertically, now 16 inches,” representatives of the Transbay Joint Powers Authority said in a statement in response to questions from The Chronicle.      At the same time, geotechnical reports show that since 2009, the settling has been uneven — resulting in the 2-inch tilt.      And while Stanford’s Deierlein doesn’t consider the sink or tilt a safety issue, he did say, “I would be concerned for my investment.” That’s because a shifting building can cause walls to crack, elevators to malfunction and all manner of other annoyances.      P.J. Johnston, spokesman for tower builder Millennium Partners and its principal owner, Sean Jeffries, said a nine-month, independent structural safety review in 2014 “determined the settlement has not significantly affected the seismic performance of the building, and does not represent a safety risk.”      An attorney for the Millennium homeowners association’s board, John Gill, recently sent a confidential letter to some of the more than 400 residents saying the board was “actively engaged in negotiations with Millennium Partners to resolve building settlement issues.” The letter also said the association was “sensitive to the concerns of everyone about any issue which could impact the value of their units.”      In a statement Friday, homeowner representatives said they had “retained a number of engineering consultants to investigate the causes and long-term impact of these settlement conditions” and were evaluating their legal options. They cited any number of parties that could be held “legally accountable” — including the developer, the high-rise’s designers, the contractors and the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, which is run by San Francisco, AC Transit, Caltrans and the agency that operates Caltrain.      For his part, Millennium spokesman Johnston wasted no time blaming the transit center authority. He insisted that the tower’s settling had been within normal range until excavation began on the bus and rail center next door.      “They built a half-mile tunnel 60 feet underground and next to our building, and they were supposed to (protect the Millennium) — and they didn’t,” Johnston said.      The authority also signed an agreement with the Millennium developer in 2008 “to repair, at its own cost and expense ... any damage to the development substantially caused by TJPA’s construction activities,” according a copy of the agreement on file at San Francisco City Hall.      Records show the Transbay Joint Powers Authority pumped more than 58 million into an underground buttressing system to shore up the Millennium before beginning excavation in 2010. That’s one of the many reasons for the new transit center’s spiraling costs, which are now at 2.4 billion and counting.      In its statement, the transit center authority said it “bears no responsibility for the tilt and excessive settlement.”      Unlike some downtown high-rises, the Millennium isn’t steel-framed. Instead, the developer chose a concrete design more common to residential buildings. It relies on huge columns, shear walls and beams, and it’s much heavier than steel. What’s more, the building is located on unstable mud-fill, just off the bay’s original shoreline.      The Millennium’s engineers anchored the building over a thick concrete slab with piles driven roughly 80 feet into dense sand. “To cut costs, Millennium did not drill piles to bedrock,” or 200 feet down, the transit center authority said in its statement. Had it done so, the agency said, “the tower would not be tilting today.”      Johnston countered that “virtually all other buildings in that part of the city have their foundations at the same subterranean level,” citing skyscrapers that include the St. Regis and Intercontinental hotels.      He added that the Millennium’s design was state of the art for residential buildings and that concrete can be preferable to steel for several reasons, including sound insulation.      “In any case, this was not a cost-saving decision, but the preferred design,” Johnston said.      While there have been reports of cracks appearing in the Millennium’s underground garage, there’s no word of residents complaining about damage to their condos. Instead, the shifting and sinking of the concrete platform beneath the building has necessitated what Johnston called “minor repairs to sidewalks and connections at the ground level.”      Experts tell us it’s uncertain exactly what, if anything, can be done to fix the problem or straighten the tower. There has been talk of pumping cement underneath the base and drilling new piles — complicated and expensive undertakings.      An assessment, no doubt, that offers little comfort to those living in the building.      San Francisco Chronicle columnists Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross appear Sundays, Mondays and Wednesdays.

It has been voted by some as one of the top 10 residential buildings in the world According to an independent consultant hired to monitor the problem, the residential building has sunk 16 inches since its completion in 2008. It has also tilted 2 inches. \\"There are some cracks in the wall in the parking garage and there's been some settling on the club level floor,\\" said Pat Dodson, a Millennium Tower homeowner.One Yelp review noticed windows and a dishwasher getting harder to open and bubbles appearing in the floor.In July, the homeowners' association brought in an engineer. \\"Why the building is sinking and tilting. It's very clear after listening to him and doing a lot of research, which my husband and I have done, that Millennium Partners did not build to bedrock, and that's the cause of the problem,\\" explained Dodson.The owners are pointing the finger at their neighbor. They allege the massive hole dug next door for the new Transbay Transit Center is to blame for the building's issues.A spokesman for Millennium Partners issued a statement saying: \\"All buildings settle over time. 301 Mission has settled more than originally anticipated because it was affected by subsequent construction by others.\\"The Millennium Tower association released a statement saying: \\"It will take all necessary steps to ensure that the buildings are fully repaired and that all parties that caused or contributed to the settlement conditions are held legally accountable.\\"The Transbay Joint Powers Authority responded by saying residents' claims against the TJPA are \\"misplaced\\" as demonstrated by data collected over more than seven years.They went to say, \\"full responsibility for the tilting and excessive settlement of the building lies with Millennium Partners, the developer of the Tower.\\"The TJPA says the 60-story Millennium Tower is made of concrete rather than steel, \\"resulting in a very heavy building. This heavy structure rests on layers of soft, compressible soil. The foundation of the Tower, however, consists only of a concrete slab supported by short piles that fail to reach the bedrock below. That foundation is inadequate to prevent settlement of a building with the weight of the Tower.\\"Instead of steel anchored on bedrock more than 200 feet down, it's made of concrete, sitting on a slab with pilings just 80 feet into the soil.The Transbay project environmental document was approved in 2004. When Millennium Partners started construction of the Tower in 2006, they knew that the TJPA intended to excavate adjacent to their building, according to the TJPA. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring counties used different agricultural methods on their farm fields. Cook county used many fertilizers and pesticides, while Dane county used only organic methods and no pesticides. As a result, the waters in Dane county were cleaner.  Answer this question please: Which county used more chemicals that were picked up by rainwater? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Cook county used more chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, on their farm fields compared to Dane county. Dane county, on the other hand, applied organic agricultural methods and did not use any pesticides. The use of synthetic chemicals like fertilizers and pesticides can have significant consequences on the environment, as described in the background. When these chemicals are applied to farm fields, rainwater can pick up these substances and transport them through runoff to nearby rivers or lakes. This can result in a noticeable increase in the growth of water plants and algae, leading to dead zones where life cannot thrive due to high nutrient concentrations and oxygen depletion. Moreover, these chemicals can sometimes infiltrate the groundwater, contaminating water wells that are used for drinking. Consumption of polluted water may lead to various health issues for people who rely on these water sources. In contrast, Dane county practiced organic farming methods that do not involve the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Organic agriculture typically relies on natural processes and substances to maintain soil fertility, control pests, and promote ecological balance. As a result, the waters in Dane county were reported to be cleaner compared to those in Cook county. To answer your question, Cook county used more chemicals on their farm fields that could be picked up by rainwater, resulting in potential water pollution and other environmental issues. In comparison, Dane county's adoption of organic farming practices led to cleaner waters and a lower risk of chemical pollution in their water sources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lech Walesa helped found the Solidarity trade union movement in 1980. He is being treated in the same hospital as an old communist nemesis. General Czeslaw Kiszczak played a key role in imposing martial law in 1981. Hospital doctors are examining Kiszczak to see if he is fit to stand trial. Article:","output":"Title: Poland's Nobel Peace Prize Winner Bedridden Alongside Infamous Foe Polish icon and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Lech Walesa, has been confined to a hospital bed following a broken leg. Sharing the same medical facility with him is his one-time arch enemy from the communist era, General Czeslaw Kiszczak. Notably, these two historical figures find themselves under the same roof, temporarily united albeit in contrasting circumstances. Lech Walesa, the former Polish President who came to global fame after helping to establish the Solidarity trade union movement in 1980, is recuperating from a broken leg in a hospital in Gdansk, Northern Poland. The tireless activist, who has for decades fought for workers' rights and the betterment of society, now finds himself facing an unexpected adversity. Meanwhile, General Czeslaw Kiszczak, now in his 90s, was once a defining figure in Poland's authoritarian regime. He played a pivotal role in implementing martial law back in 1981, a decision that aimed to suppress the burgeoning workers' movement led by Walesa. As Kiszczak is currently under medical examination, doctors at the hospital are deliberating whether he is fit to stand trial for his past actions.  As fate would have it, these two historical adversaries now lie bedridden within the same institution, reminiscent of a time when their actions and ideals stood in stark contrast to one another. On one hand, there is the celebrated Nobel Peace Prize winner, Lech Walesa, a testament to his dedication to the cause of freedom, democracy, and social justice. While on the other, General Czeslaw Kiszczak, a key agent of a regime whose influence strangled the voice of an entire nation. The 1980 foundation of the Solidarity movement marked a turning point for Poland, as the independent trade union stood fearlessly against the might of the communist state. Under Walesa's guidance, the movement sowed the seeds of democracy, which would come to full bloom years later. Even after the imposition of martial law in 1981, it was this movement led by Walesa that would help usher an era of significant reforms in Eastern Europe. It is a poignant reminder of the power of ordinary people to enact change, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. These two figures, with their intertwined histories, represent both sides of a struggle for freedom and democracy. Years on, the echoes of their rivalry resurface in a shared hospital ward - an irony that seemingly underscores the resilience of the human spirit. Lech Walesa's journey from electrician to the first democratic President of Poland showcases the power of individual conviction and unwavering dedication. As he recovers from his injury at the Gdansk hospital, it is without doubt that his struggle for a better future will continue. On the other hand, the fate of General Czeslaw Kiszczak lies in the hands of doctors and the judicial system, his past actions under scrutiny for their roles in suppressing an entire nation's cry for democracy and social justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Robert Schumann (; 8 June 1810 - 29 July 1856) was a German composer and an influential music critic. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era. Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a virtuoso pianist. He had been assured by his teacher Friedrich Wieck, a German pianist, that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. During Eastertide 1830, he heard the Italian violinist, violist, guitarist, and composer Niccolo Paganini play in Frankfurt. In July he wrote to his mother, \\"My whole life has been a struggle between Poetry and Prose, or call it Music and Law.\\" By Christmas he was back in Leipzig, at age 20 taking piano lessons from his old master Friedrich Wieck, who assured him that he would be a successful concert pianist after a few years' study with him.  During his studies with Wieck, it has been claimed that Schumann permanently injured a finger on his right hand. Wieck claimed that Schumann damaged his finger by the use of a mechanical device designed to strengthen the weakest fingers, a device which held back one finger while he exercised the others. This claim has been discredited by Clara Schumann, who said that the disability was not due to a mechanical device, and Robert Schumann himself refers to it as \\"an affliction of the whole hand\\". Some have argued that, as the disability appeared to have been chronic and have affected the hand, and not just a finger, it was unlikely to have been caused by a finger strengthening device.  Schumann abandoned the idea of a concert career and devoted himself instead to composition. To this end he began a study of music theory under Heinrich Dorn, a German composer six years his senior and, at that time, conductor of the Leipzig Opera. About this time Schumann considered composing an opera on the subject of Hamlet. Why did he abandon the idea of a concert career?","output":"Robert Schumann abandoned the idea of a concert career due to a hand injury that affected his ability to play the piano at the level required for a virtuoso pianist. This injury, whether caused by a mechanical finger-strengthening device or \\"an affliction of the whole hand\\" as Schumann himself described it, led to chronic issues with the hand, not just a single finger. As a result, he could no longer pursue the demanding career of a concert pianist, so he decided to focus on composing music instead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: He was practicing deep breathing techniques, he had to have great control of his what? Possible A: bringing air into body bringing air into lungs, abdominal muscles, bringing air into lungs, air, oxygen  Why is \\"abdominal muscles\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"Deep breathing techniques often involve manipulation and control of various muscles involved in the respiratory process, especially the diaphragm and abdominal muscles. When a person breathes, air is drawn into the lungs as a result of a decrease in pressure caused by the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles (muscles between the ribs).  In deep or diaphragmatic breathing, which is a form of slow, deep breathing, one consciously slows the breath and uses the diaphragm, rather than the chest, to breathe. The diaphragm is a large, dome-shaped muscle at the base of the lungs. When the diaphragm contracts, it inflates the lungs, causing you to inhale. Abdominal breathing is facilitated by the movement of the diaphragm which pushes the abdominal organs downward, thus expanding the belly. By exerting control over these muscles, and by controlling the speed and depth of breaths, an individual can achieve deep breathing. That's why \\"abdominal muscles\\" are proposed as an answer aligned with human common sense for someone practicing deep breathing techniques. In essence, their practice involves exercising great control over their respiratory muscles, particularly their diaphragm and abdominal muscles, to regulate their breathing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fletcher is indeed a musician, known for being a founding member of the pop rock band McFly, where he serves roles as lead vocalist, guitarist, and songwriter. Concurrent to his musical career, Fletcher has also made a mark on literature. He co-authored the children's book \\"The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas\\" with his bandmate Dougie Poynter, which became a bestseller. This initiated his writing career that further led to a series of successful children’s books mainly based on the \\"The Dinosaur that Pooped\\" series.  Moreover, Fletcher served a brief stint as a YouTube vlogger. In 2012, he started his own YouTube channel and gained popularity through it by posting his personal life vlogs and music videos. His wedding speech video, which he shared on this platform, went viral and amassed millions of views. Furthermore, Fletcher explored acting early in his life. Before forming McFly, he had a small role in the movie 'The Hunted'. Also, he made it onto the stage in the musical version of 'Back to the Future' in 2020, playing the role of George McFly.

Review: otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This movie review sentence is negative. The sentence \\"otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés\\" implies that the movie in question exhibits an overabundance of unoriginal or overused visual and verbal elements. To say that a movie \\"drowns\\" in clichés suggests that these repetitive elements may diminish its overall quality and detract from the viewing experience. Clichés, especially in the domain of film, are often perceived as uninspired or lazy; they can make the movie appear formulaic or predictable. As a result, the use of clichés can cheapen a film's impact on its audience, creating an impression that the filmmakers have not been innovative or ambitious in the development of the story, characters, or dialogue. In the context of a movie review, a negative sentiment like this may lead potential viewers to question whether the movie is worth their time and money. Consequently, a movie review that criticizes a film for drowning in clichés could discourage people from seeing the film, thus having a negative effect on its commercial and critical success."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The ethnic group mentioned here is the Zamboangans, who reside in the Zamboanga Peninsula region of Mindanao. They are key contributors to the country’s cultural diversity and play a significant role in shaping the sociocultural fabric of the Philippines. In terms of language, this dataset highlights Philippine Spanish, a variant of standard Spanish that is spoken in the Philippines. Even though Filipinos primarily speak Filipino and English, Spanish was deeply ingrained in the country’s history due to the Spanish colonization, leading to this unique variant. The influence of Spanish is still visible in different aspects of Filipino culture, including language and place names. As for cuisine, the data points towards Batchoy, a popular Filipino soup that originated from the Philippine Islands. This dish, typically native to the Visayas region, is a symbol of the country's rich gastronomic heritage that is shaped by several internal and external influences. The locals commonly serve batchoy with egg noodles garnished with pork organs, crushed pork cracklings, chopped vegetables, and occasionally a raw egg.

If I tell you that Burning coal, oil, and natural gas increases carbon in the atmosphere, and ask you the question \\"what enters the atmosphere when coal, oil, and natural gas is burned?\\", is the correct answer \\"heat\\"? OPTIONS: [i] Yes [ii] No","output":"[ii] No The answer is not simply \\"heat.\\" What primarily enters the atmosphere when coal, oil, and natural gas are burned are greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), along with a range of other pollutants. When fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas are combusted, the primary byproduct is carbon dioxide (CO2). This is due to the fact that these fuels are hydrocarbons, which means they are made up of hydrogen and carbon. During combustion, the carbon in these fuels combines with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a potent greenhouse gas and the primary driver of climate change because it absorbs heat in the atmosphere and prevents it from escaping out into space, leading to the greenhouse effect—an increase in the Earth’s surface temperature. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been increasing dramatically since the Industrial Revolution due to human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Besides carbon dioxide, burning fossil fuels also emit other pollutants. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a byproduct of burning coal, which can contribute to acid rain and respiratory illnesses. Nitrogen oxides (NOx), primarily nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), are also released, which combine with other substances in the air to form smog and acid rain. Particulate matter, small particles of pollutants, is also released. These particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause a range of health problems, including heart and lung diseases. In the process of combustion, heat is indeed released. This heat is used to create steam that turns a turbine to generate electricity in power plants. But while heat is a product of burning fossil fuels, it is not what enters the atmosphere. Rather, it is the greenhouse gases and other pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. Therefore, to the question \\"What enters the atmosphere when coal, oil, and natural gas are burned?\\", the most accurate response would include greenhouse gases (mostly carbon dioxide), as well as other pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who persisted in his proposal of marriage, which was eventually accepted by Susana? from the following article ?  In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year.  While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

Given the question: Who does the commander of the Sacred guard fall in love with?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The story is set in 490 BC, the time of the Medic Wars, during which Persian armies sweep through the Ancient world. Having brought home to Athens the Olympic victor's laurel crown, Phillippides becomes commander of the Sacred Guard, which is expected to defend the city-state's liberty, a year after the expulsion of the tyrant Hippias. Athenian supporters of Hippias conspire, hoping to sideline Phillippides with a marriage to Theocrites' expensive servant Charis, and thus neutralize the guard. She fails to seduce him, as his heart is already taken by a young girl before he learns her name is Andromeda, daughter of Creuso. Everything personal is likely to be put on hold when the news breaks that the vast army of Darius, the Persian King of Kings, is marching on Greece, hoping that its internal division will make its conquest a walk-over. Theocrites instructs Miltiades to hold back the Sacred Guard to defend the temple of Pallas after a likely defeat, and proposes instead to negotiate terms with Darius, but is told an alliance with Sparta could save the Hellenic nation. Phillippides makes the journey and survives an attempt on his life by conspirators; he returns with Sparta's engagement during the Persian attack in far greater numbers on Militiades valiant troops. Charis, left for dead after overhearing Darius's orders, reaches the camp to tell that the Persian fleet, now commanded by the traitor Theocrites, is heading for the Piraeus to take Athens. Miltiades sends Phillippides ahead to hold out with the Sacred Guard until his hopefully victorious troops arrive, and after his perilous journey back they successfully beat back the Persians. The answer is:","output":"In the story set in 490 BC during the Medic Wars, the commander of the Sacred Guard, Phillippides, falls in love with a young girl named Andromeda. Andromeda is the daughter of Creuso, and Phillippides' affection for her is revealed before he even learns her identity. As his heart is already taken by Andromeda, Phillippides remains unaffected by the attempt to sideline him through a marriage to Charis, Theocrites' expensive servant. Amidst the political turmoil and looming threat of Darius, the Persian King of Kings, Phillippides must navigate various challenges while staying true to his love for Andromeda. Eventually, his devotion to both Andromeda and his city-state pushes him to seek an alliance with Sparta, ensuring Greece's united front against the Persians. As the Athenians face the Persian army and the traitor Theocrites, Phillippides manages to defend Athens with the help of the Sacred Guard and the Spartan forces, successfully repelling the Persian attack. In doing so, he also secures his love for Andromeda, further intertwining their fates as they face the trials and tribulations of their time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"A financial instrument whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset is called a derivative. Derivatives are financial contracts that provide a way to manage various types of risk associated with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying assets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market indices. These financial instruments allow investors and traders to hedge or speculate on the future price movements of the underlying assets without necessarily owning or directly trading the assets themselves. Derivatives can be broadly categorized into four types: 1. Forwards: Forwards are customized, non-standardized contracts between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified future date at a price that is agreed upon today. Forward contracts are traded over-the-counter (OTC) and are often used to hedge against risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. 2. Futures: Futures are standardized, exchange-traded contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase (or the seller to sell) an asset at a specified future date and price. Similar to forwards, futures contracts allow market participants to hedge against risks or speculate on potential price movements. However, unlike forwards, futures are traded on regulated exchanges, providing greater transparency, liquidity, and risk management through margin and clearing mechanisms. 3. Options: Options are contracts that provide the buyer with the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a specified price (exercise or strike price) on or before a specific date (exercise or expiration date). Options can be used for various purposes, including hedging, income generation, and speculation. They are traded both on exchanges and over-the-counter and can be more complex than other types of derivatives, depending on the particular contract and strategy being used. 4. Swaps: Swaps are contracts in which two parties agree to exchange cash flows derived from different financial instruments, typically to hedge against or gain exposure to interest rate, currency, or commodity risks. The most common types of swaps are interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and commodity swaps. These contracts are usually traded over-the-counter. Derivatives can be very useful financial tools for both investors and businesses, enabling them to manage risk, diversify their portfolios, and optimize their capital allocation. Nonetheless, the use of derivatives can also lead to significant financial losses if not managed properly, as demonstrated by various financial crises and scandals throughout history. It is crucial for those involved in the trading and management of derivatives to have a deep understanding of the characteristics and risks associated with these financial instruments, as well as the appropriate risk management strategies to employ."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Hypothesis: Patients have the right to be informed about decisions affecting their coverage Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. In the given statement, it is evident that patients' rights are being prioritized, especially concerning their knowledge and involvement in decisions pertaining to their coverage and payment. The statement explicitly states that patients have the right to be fully informed about these decisions, which may have significant consequences on their healthcare experience. To further elaborate on the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let us break down the key components: Premise: 1. Patients have rights to be informed. 2. Decisions affecting their coverage or payment are important. 3. Patients have the right to know about their appeal rights. Hypothesis: - Patients have the right to be informed about decisions affecting their coverage. Analyzing these components, we can observe a clear connection between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise establishes the patients' rights to be informed as a crucial element, which corresponds with the main assertion of the hypothesis. Furthermore, the premise specifically mentions \\"decisions affecting their coverage or payment,\\" which is in alignment with the focus of the hypothesis on \\"decisions affecting their coverage.\\" In addition, the premise additionally states that patients have the right to be informed about their appeal rights. This serves to strengthen the hypothesis because it not only guarantees their right to be informed about coverage decisions but also empowers them to exercise their appeal rights to contest those decisions if necessary. In conclusion, the premise provided entails the hypothesis, as it explicitly states that patients have the right to be fully informed about decisions affecting their coverage or payment. This reveals a direct relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, and it is befitting to say that the premise supports the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two men: This element remains unchanged in both scenarios, signifying the presence of two individuals, specifically men, who play a significant role in the situation. 2. A projector screen: While the first description mentions \\"a project screen\\" explicitly, it is very likely it is just a typo, and \\"projector screen\\" was meant. In the second description, \\"a projector screen\\" is explicitly mentioned. In each case, the projector screen is an essential prop or device used in the scene, indicating that a presentation or discussion is taking place. 3. Group of people or group: The original description refers to \\"a group of people,\\" while the rephrased description shortens it to \\"a group.\\" Both phrases convey the same meaning - that there is more than one person (a collective) present during the scene. The men's interaction with this group of people suggests a presentation or discourse involving the projector screen. In addition, the spatial arrangement of the elements is implicitly consistent. In the original description, the two men are \\"in front of\\" the projector screen, which puts the screen behind them. The rephrased description explicitly places the projector screen \\"behind\\" them, making no change to the original scene's spatial configuration.

Q:Question: Who does Lestat fall in love with? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Queen of the Damned Context: The vampire Lestat is awakened from decades of slumber by the sound of a heavy metal band which he proceeds to take over as the lead singer. Achieving international success and planning a massive live concert, Lestat is approached by Marius, and warned that the vampires of the world will not tolerate his flamboyant public profile. Jesse Reeves, a researcher for the paranormal studies group Talamasca, is intrigued by Lestat's lyrics and tells the rest of the group her theory that he really is a vampire. Her mentor, David Talbot, takes her aside and tells her they know he is and that a vampire called Marius made him. He also shows her Lestat's journal that he recovered and is now in the Talamasca library. In a flashback to his origins, Lestat recalls how he awoke Akasha, the first vampire, with his music. Jesse tracks him down to a London vampire club where he saves and confronts her. She later goes to Los Angeles for the concert and gives him back his journal. The two spend some time together and Lestat shows her both the horrors and the perks of being a vampire. Showing him that she's not scared of him Jesse stays with Lestat as she sees how lonely and miserable he is. She asks him to turn her as she reveals that it's her dream to be a vampire, but he refuses as he won't do it to her. The more time they spend together, the closer they become and soon Lestat and Jesse start to fall in love. Meanwhile, Akasha is awakened by Lestat's new music. She arrives and torches the club, and all the vampires inside, who want Lestat dead. At the concert in Death Valley, a mob of vampires attack Lestat and Marius. Akasha bursts through the stage and takes Lestat with her as her new King. The two vampires then proceed to have a sort of sexual intercourse in Akasha's home where they mutually feed on one another, during which time Lestat becomes spellbound by Akasha and is forced to obey her.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who talks about the marble?, using the article: Detective Mike Hoolihan is investigating the murder of Jennifer Rockwell, an astrophysicist at an observatory in New Orleans. She had presented a talk on black holes in the evening, but was found dead in the morning by the manager of the observatory. She had been shot in the face, but there was no weapon. There is a sock and a jar of moisturizing cream found at the scene. The manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old nick-nacks. Mike passes out when she picks up a Florida snow globe, and imagines unique blue marbles similar to one that is on a string around her neck. When she comes to, she talks about the marble, and how she doesn't remember where it came from. She was an orphan, and has always had it. Her co-investigator and supervisor suggest that this looks like \\"The .38 Caliber Killer\\", who killed young women, but hadn't struck in many years. The murderer always exchanged nick nacks with his victims. While doing a more detailed search of the area, Mike finds a gun in a case, and a red scarf she had been having dreams about.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Keep your plans secret from your spouse. Hide or lock up anything that might let them know you want to get away. If your spouse goes through your things, store your personal items at a friend or family member’s house. Your spouse may sabotage your plans or become more dangerous if they know you are about to leave. Confide in a family member, neighbor, or friend about your spouse’s abuse and your plans to leave. Tell them when you are planning to escape and where you will go. Ask them to check in on you afterwards to ensure you got out safely.  If you decide to talk to a family member, choose carefully. Family members sometimes tip off spouses before a planned escape. Only confide in those you trust deeply. If your neighbors are trustworthy, you can also ask them to call the police if they hear your spouse abusing you or your kids before you leave. Change your phone number or get a new phone when you leave your spouse. Create new passwords and PIN numbers for your online accounts, including your bank account, email account, and social media accounts.  If your spouse harasses you over the phone or online, block them. If you think there is any chance your spouse might have installed a keylogger or other tracking software on your computer, don’t use it. Use a computer at a public library or internet café until you can get a clean computer of your own. Be cautious when you go anywhere by yourself, especially at night. Park close to buildings and avoid using headphones. Stay away from places where your spouse might look for you, and change your route to work, school, and anywhere else you go often. If you feel unsafe, ask somebody to accompany you or call 911 or emergency services. If you’re concerned that your spouse may stalk or harass you, consider asking your boss if you can change your hours at work or work from home. If you have kids, discuss potential safety risks with them. Explaining the situation as best you can may help avoid trauma. Teach them how to leave the house safely and call 911, and have them come up with a list of people they can trust if something happens.  For example, you might pinpoint a nearby area they can go to if you are in danger, such as a park or neighbor's house. If you have an older adolescent or teen, you might also give them a list of phone numbers of shelters or organizations for abuse victims in case they need to make calls. If you feel threatened by your spouse, you can speak to someone anonymously by calling a hotline. They can help you stay safe and advise you on developing an escape plan. For those in the U.S., you can get support by calling the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE. For those in the UK, call 0808 2000 247 to reach a 24-hour helpline. If your spouse threatens to harm you or your children, you may need to file for an order of protection against them. You may file a restraining order against a current or former spouse, even if you left some time ago. Reach out to your city's courthouse to find out the protocol in your area.  This order can help you keep your children in your care and away from an abusive spouse. It also may help you stay in your family home temporarily (and have your spouse removed) until the hearing date. Usually, no fees are associated with filing a restraining order.","output":"It's important to keep your plans secret when you want to get away from a spouse who is not nice to you.

Question: President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. Based on the article, the tax plan is likely to:  A.

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  and the situation: The underwater fishing teams picked their spots early. Team Bob went at the mouth of the river, where the freshwater met the salty seawater in the hope that more turbidity from the river and more nutrients will attract more fish. Team Dan went south where they knew there was less of a thermocline, so they could catch fish without taking risks.  Answer the following question: Which team had their crew members to fewer risks than necessary? A:","output":"Team Dan had their crew members take fewer risks than necessary. This is because they chose a location where there was less of a thermocline, which implies lesser changes in water temperature as they dive. Sudden temperature changes, or thermoclines, can be risky for divers as they can affect their physiological and physical comfort levels underwater, thus affecting their ability to perform tasks like fishing efficiently. Moreover, in areas of significant thermoclines, the temperature change can impact the distribution and presence of fish, making fishing potentially more challenging. Therefore, by choosing an area with a less pronounced thermocline, Team Dan has tried to minimize the inherent risks associated with their underwater fishing activity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Foster and Farrington  for the following movie plot:  A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination. Obtaining Ferguson's approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind. Ferguson, meanwhile, watches news reports and becomes highly concerned at Kennedy's increasingly \\"liberal\\" direction: action on civil rights, Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, nuclear disarmament.

This can be great if you're a nervous traveler, or if you haven't traveled by yourself before.If you're in a country where you don't speak the language, sometimes there's nothing better than getting into a taxi and opening up a guidebook.You simply point to a map that directs the taxi driver to a hostel that's cheap and clean, with friendly staff and cold beer. But others criticize Lonely Planet and other travel guide publishers like them.They say guidebooks take the fun and spontaneity   out of traveling, and that part of the enjoyment of travel comes from the fact that anything can happen.They also regret that if you follow a guidebook, you'll end up doing the same thing and having the same experience as everyone else.You might end up seeing the same group of people over and over, because everyone is reading the same book and following the same route. Another criticism of travel guides is that they have a large impact on local communities.For example, some locals devote their lives to behaving in ways that attract tourists.They pretend to live a traditional lifestyle, wear traditional clothes and live in traditional houses in order to attract the tourist dollar.

I went the relaxed route and got (A). casual. This decision allowed me to maintain a sense of comfort while still looking professional and presentable in my new work environment. Casual work attire usually includes more relaxed pieces like jeans, khakis, skirts, and casual blouses. Taking the casual route gave me the flexibility to mix and match different outfits, allowing me to express my personality and individual style while staying within the boundaries of the workplace dress code. One of the features I appreciated about casual wear is that it can transition seamlessly from the office to after-work events, such as happy hour or dinner out with colleagues. By opting for a casual look, I found that I was saving time and effort by not having to change completely between work and social settings, which in turn helped me create a balanced work-life style. As I planned my new casual work wardrobe, I considered several key factors to ensure that I made the best choices. Firstly, I took into account the dress code stipulated by my employer, as every workplace has varying rules and expectations. This meant selecting clothes that were comfortable and stylish, yet still presented a polished, professional image. In addition, I paid close attention to the versatility of each item I purchased. I made sure that I could create multiple outfits with minimal pieces, which helped to simplify my morning routine and saved me money overall. Furthermore, I focused on selecting high-quality items made from durable materials to ensure that they would last for a reasonable period. Lastly, I thought about how I could incorporate some of my existing wardrobe into my new casual work attire. For example, I had a few blouses and light jackets that could be easily paired with jeans or khakis to create a relaxed yet professional look. This not only made the transition to a casual wardrobe more affordable but also allowed me to utilize some of my favorite pieces that I already owned. In conclusion, by choosing casual work attire, I was able to prioritize comfort and maintain a sense of individual style while adhering to the expectations of my workplace. In doing so, I found that I was more relaxed and happier during my working hours, and experienced improved work-life balance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Doomsday Movie plot: In 2008, an unknown killer virus, dubbed \\"The Reaper Virus\\" infected Scotland. Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, The UK government built a massive 60-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of Britain. The quarantine was deemed a success; however, the extreme method employed by the government destroyed diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world. This led to massive unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil, causing the UK to collapse into a dystopia. In 2035, 27 years after the quarantine, during a raid, police discover several people infected with Reaper Virus. The Prime Minister John Hatcher shares with domestic security chief Captain Nelson satellite footage of survivors in Scotland. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses Major Eden Sinclair to lead the team. Sinclair's team crosses the wall and goes to Glasgow, Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals.

Relevance: Among the given options, \\"home or office\\" is the most relevant to the context of installing new carpeting. Carpets are generally used as floor coverings in both residential and commercial spaces, providing comfort and improving aesthetics. 2. Suitability: Carpets are commonly installed in homes and offices, primarily to enhance the appearance and feel of living or working spaces. Installing carpets in these locations can improve insulation, reduce noise levels, and provide a comfortable surface for walking or sitting. 3. Practicality: It is practical to install new carpeting in a home or office, as these environments are well-suited for this type of floor covering. It's reasonable to assume that someone looking for new carpeting would be intending to install it in a location that would benefit from its properties. 4. Comparing with other options:    a. Gym: Carpets are not typically installed in gyms, as they are not well-suited for absorbing the high levels of wear and impact caused by athletic activities. Moreover, carpets can be difficult to maintain in such an environment, due to the higher probability of staining and damage.    b. Cub: It is unclear what \\"cub\\" refers to; thus, it is not a valid answer.    c. Istanbul: This option mentions a geographic location rather than an installation area.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: Carson is a construction worker that operates a jack hammer on the construction site for a new building. The jack hammer is often incredibly loud and generates a high amount of noise. Carson wants to protect himself from this noise, but he also needs to be able to hear the orders given to him by his boss on the site.  and a hint : Electronic ear protectors work differently. They identify high-amplitude sound waves and send sound waves through them in the opposite direction. This causes destructive interference with the waves, which reduces their amplitude to zero or nearly zero. This changes even the loudest sounds to just a soft hiss. Sounds that people need to hear, such as the voices of co-workers, are not interfered with in this way and may be amplified instead so they can be heard more clearly. This type of hearing protector is recommended for higher noise levels and situations where it’s important to be able to hear lower-decibel sounds.  Please answer this question : Would electronic ear protectors be appropriate for Carson, yes or no?","output":"Yes, electronic ear protectors would be an appropriate solution for Carson in his situation. As a construction worker operating a jackhammer, he is exposed to high levels of noise that may potentially harm his hearing. The use of electronic ear protectors would not only help to protect his ears from the loud noise but also allow him to hear important lower-decibel sounds, such as instructions from his boss or conversations with co-workers. The primary advantage of electronic ear protectors is their ability to identify and selectively block out high-amplitude sound waves while allowing lower-amplitude sound waves to pass through. This is achieved through the use of destructive interference, where opposing sound waves neutralize each other, reducing the overall noise level. As a result, sounds like the jackhammer's noise will be significantly reduced, while voices and other necessary sounds will be maintained or even amplified for improved communication. In Carson's line of work, effective communication is crucial, as misunderstandings or lack of information can lead to accidents or delays in work progress. Electronic ear protectors would enable him to maintain a safe working environment by ensuring he can clearly hear his co-workers and supervisors, without sacrificing his long-term hearing health. Additionally, electronic ear protectors are recommended for use in high-noise environments and situations where it is essential to hear lower-decibel sounds. A construction site, particularly one where heavy machinery such as jackhammers is in use, represents an environment that exactly fits this description. Therefore, electronic ear protectors would be an ideal choice for Carson to protect his hearing and maintain effective communication on the job site."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I think my husband and I embarrass our daughter now practically no matter what we do just because we’re parents and maybe because we’re older in our 60’s and too happy to see her and too eager to please and we inadvertently treat our daughter like she is still a kid although she will be 22. I’ve never had a deliberate favorite thing to do except maybe by accident when I used to share too many photos of the cats when I used to be on FB? Parents can’t help but embarrass their children beyond a certain age maybe? I can picture if we had an in the ground pool and my husband and I were continually doing silly moves and cannon ball jumping in I think or even simply lazing around in ridiculous color and style too teeny bathing suits for our age that too would embarrass my daughter. When push comes to shove parents like myself don’t have to be too inventive or think much to come up with things they might do that embarrass their kids. My daughter told me she could not stand to go to the movies with me because I used to cry during movies. She never forgets one time I got emotional during a movie “Spirit” my husband and I took her to when she was little. I tried to hide this but my husband blurted out “You aren't crying, are you” like it was the dumbest thing to do and for the entire movie going audience to hear. Sheesh! Question: Why did the daughter stop seeing movies with her mom? Options: - She brings over too many groceries - not enough information - She wears teeny bathing suits - The mom gets too emotional and cries The answer is:","output":"The mom gets too emotional and cries"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea and its neighbors in the region reacted with caution to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision Thursday to cancel the U.S.- North Korea nuclear summit. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said in a statement released by the North’s central news agency (KCNA) that his country remains open to resolving problems with the United States “whenever and however,” and offered praise for President Trump’s diplomatic engagement efforts. “We had held in high regards President Trump’s efforts, unprecedented by any other president, to create a historic North Korea-U.S. summit,” said the vice foreign minister in a statement released Friday by KCNA. The conciliatory tone that came from Vice Foreign Minister Kim stands in sharp contrast to earlier criticisms, insults and threats made by another North Korean official that prompted Trump to cancel the June summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. On Thursday North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui called U.S. Vice President Mike Pence a “political dummy” and threatened a “nuclear-to-nuclear showdown” with the U.S. over comments made by Pence calling for North Korea to follow the Libya denuclearization model. The Libya model refers to the rapid and complete dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program in 2003 and 2004, before the easing of any sanctions. But North Korea is acutely aware that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown and killed by his own people a few years later, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the United States. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until its undefined security demands are met. Trump blamed the “tremendous anger and open hostility” from Pyongyang for forcing the cancelation of the summit, but many analysts say the issue was more about substance over tone and the unbridgeable gap between the two denuclearization positions. But... Question: What is the U.S. trying to obtain from North Korea? Answer: The answer is:","output":"The U.S. is trying to obtain the denuclearization of North Korea, which involves the dismantlement of the country's nuclear program. They are seeking a complete and rapid denuclearization, similar to the Libya model, before easing any sanctions imposed on North Korea."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Everybody raised a drink and cheered, they were doing what?

Treasury Select Committee MPs raised concerns that banks fined millions for wrongdoing may be exploiting loopholes and \\"unclear\\" rules to pay less tax. It is important taxpayers do not \\"bear the burden\\", committee chairman Andrew Tyrie told the chancellor in a letter. The Treasury said it would respond to the letter in due course. Under UK law, banks are not allowed to log fines they are forced to pay for mis-selling and other misconduct as a cost in order to reduce their profits and, in turn, the amount of tax they pay. There are also tight restrictions about off setting compensation payments to customers against tax. However, Mr Tyrie said it appeared in some circumstances banks were able to claim fines they paid to the regulator were tax deductable. He called on Mr Osborne to confirm this was not allowed, as there appeared to be \\"some doubt\\" about the rules. By Joe Lynam, business correspondent In the early 1990s some firms had been deducting from their tax bill - i.e. treating as a legitimate expense - protection money paid to the Provisional IRA. The then Prime Minister John Major intervened and banned the practice.  But there still remains no clarity on the issues of what can and cannot be deducted. HMRC has issued guidance on the matter but, as you can see, the section under fines imposed by regulators still says (words to the effect of) on the one hand you can but on the other you cannot. Even for tax experts, the question of whether mis-selling or fines imposed by the government or independent watchdogs can be considered a legitimate cost of business is unclear. The Chartered Institute of Taxation has called for clarity from the government, which is exactly what the Treasury Select Committee also hopes to get in its letter to the chancellor today. Mr Tyrie said it was \\"not just appropriate, but essential\\" that fines were not tax deductable. \\"It is important that taxpayers are not required to to bear any part of the burden of any payment import by the FCA or overseas regulators. The bill should be picked up by the bank's shoulders.\\" If banks were \\"not happy about it\\", they had a number of possible remedies, including controlling employees salaries and bonuses, he said. He also raised concerns that settlements reached with foreign governments were sometimes structured in a way that allowed payment to be offset against British tax. He did not know whether this suggestion was well-founded, but if it was true it would be \\"alarming\\", he said. In recent years, banks including HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and Clydesdale Bank have been fined by the FCA over misconduct. What was that article about?","output":"This article is about concerns that some banks, which were fined millions for wrongdoing, might be using loopholes and unclear rules to pay less tax.

Berlin sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld published a scheme in 1896 that measured the strength of an individual's sexual desire on two independent 10-point scales, A (homosexual) and B (heterosexual). A heterosexual individual may be A0, B5; a homosexual individual may be A5, B0; an asexual would be A0, B0; and someone with an intense attraction to both sexes would be A9, B9. What were the two scales defined as?","output":"Alright, in simpler words, the article talks about how people thought that there are more ways humans can feel attracted to other people than just two or three. Magnus Hirschfeld, a really smart person who studied about this topic, made a system back in the year 1896 to understand these attractions.  He created two scales, like two measuring sticks. Each of them goes from 0 to 10. One scale is named \\"A\\", which measures how much a person is attracted to people of the same gender (homosexual attraction). The other scale is named \\"B\\", which measures how much a person is attracted to people of the opposite gender (heterosexual attraction). Using these scales, we can describe how a person feels attracted to others. For example, if someone is very attracted to the opposite gender, they would have a high number on the \\"B\\" scale, but a low number on the \\"A\\" scale."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Three Days of the Condor Movie plot: Joe Turner (Robert Redford) is an employee of the CIA. He's not a secret agent, his job is to read, and he and his co-workers at the American Literary Historical Society read everything; books, comics, magazines, and they scan everything into a database to be cross-checked against real CIA operations. On a rainy December morning it's business as usual, so no one notices the non-descript man sitting in plain sedan across the street from Joe's building, checking off names of every employee as they enter.Inside, Joe looks for an answer to a letter he'd sent to the main CIA office at Langley. He has a theory about connections he's noticed between operations in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and other locations around the world, but so far there's no response. Noon approaches, and it's his turn to go out for lunch. Since it's still raining, he ducks out the basement door (which is against regulations) and cuts through several back alleys to the deli. Meanwhile, the sedan out front quietly pulls away after signaling to 3 men (one is a mailman) waiting in the street. They move in with quiet determination and knock on the front door. The mailman stands in view of the camera while the other two wait behind him.At the deli around the block, Joe picks up lunch for the others and then runs back. Since the rain has stopped, he goes to the front door, and buzzes the security intercom to be let in, but gets no answer. Pushing on the door, he finds it is unlocked, which it never is. Inside he finds a scene of carnage. Everyone has been murdered, shot to death in the few minutes he has been gone. Fighting down his shock and horror, he grabs a pistol from the receptionist's desk and flees.Suddenly, everyone on the street looks suspicious, and Joe realizes that whoever killed his coworkers is probably still looking for him. He finds a payphone and calls an emergency contact number at the CIA. \\"This is...uh...'Condor'\\" Joe says, fighting through the shock to remember his code name. \\"The section's been hit.

The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film – but with them as stands in – just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of...

Given the two facts above, what has special structures for penetrating a host?","output":"Given the two facts: Fact 1 - Fungi have special structures for penetrating a host, and Fact 2 - Fungi include yeasts, molds, and fleshy fungi, we can deduce that yeasts, molds, and fleshy fungi possess specific structures that enable them to penetrate their respective hosts. Fungi are a diverse group of eukaryotic microorganisms that play various roles in nature, including decomposers, symbionts, and parasites. They have evolved a range of specialized structures for penetrating and interacting with their hosts, which include plants, animals, and even other fungi. 1. Yeasts: Yeasts are single-celled fungi found in a wide range of habitats, including soil, plants, and animal hosts. They reproduce asexually through budding or fission. Some yeasts, such as Candida species, are opportunistic pathogens that can cause infections in humans. A key structure for host penetration in yeasts is the secretion of extracellular enzymes, such as proteases and lipases, that break down complex molecules in host tissues. This process allows yeasts to invade tissues, access nutrients, and survive within host cells. 2. Molds: Molds are multicellular fungi that typically grow in the form of filamentous hyphae. They can be saprophytic, parasitic, or mutualistic, depending on the species and environmental conditions. Molds use specialized structures called appressoria to penetrate their host. An appressorium is a swollen, infection-specific hyphal tip that forms directly over the host surface. It produces a high level of internal pressure, which forces a thin penetrating hyphal peg into the host tissue. Appressoria-mediated penetration is a common strategy among many plant pathogenic molds, such as Magnaporthe oryzae, which causes rice blast disease. 3. Fleshy fungi: Fleshy fungi, which include mushrooms, puffballs, truffles, and morels, are a diverse group of fungi characterized by their spore-bearing fruiting bodies. Most fleshy fungi form mycorrhizal associations with plants, wherein the fungus exchanges nutrients for plant-derived sugars. To establish these symbiotic relationships, mycorrhizal fungi produce specialized infection structures, such as hyphal coils or arbuscules, which help them penetrate plant root tissues without damaging them. Some fleshy fungi also develop haustoria, specialized hyphal structures that allow them to extract nutrients from the host, while others use the same enzymatic degradation seen in yeasts to enter their host. In summary, given the two facts presented, yeasts, molds, and fleshy fungi possess specialized structures for penetrating a host. These structures vary among the different groups of fungi and are crucial for their successful colonization, nutrient acquisition, and survival within their hosts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.  Brad and Frank are two cousins. they both own land in the same county.

How about starting a new country? Patri Friedman is planning to do just that. He left Google years ago to set up the Seasteading Institute. And his dream is to build seasteads-----floating micro-nations in the middle of the ocean. So, what will life on a seastead be like? Probably a bit like life on a cruise liner  , but much larger, with shops, gyms, swimming pools, schools and other areas. In fact, the early seasteads may actually be specially-rebuilt cruise liners. But as science advances, Friedman believes they'll become more like floating cities, with several hundred people. Seasteading raises a lot of questions. First of all, how will the new countries make money? The Seasteading Institute has suggested several money-making ideas, including ocean-based theme parks, casinos   and fish farming. There's also the questions of safety. With storms, typhoons and pirates   , the high seas are a dangerous place. However, the Institute says that it can stand bad weather and prevent crimes with its well-designed systems. So, is this just a day dream? Well, maybe not. One of the people behind the project is Peter Thiel. He founded PayPal and was one of the first investors   in Facebook. So far, he's donated  500,000 to the project. And Friedman isn't wasting any time. He recently announced the creation of the Poseidon Award. This will be given to the first seastead with fifty people.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Which happened earlier, the first female ascent or Edward Whymper reaching the top of the Matterhorn?\\"  Context: \\"The first British Mont Blanc ascent was in 1788; the first female ascent in 1819. By the mid-1850s Swiss mountaineers had ascended most of the peaks and were eagerly sought as mountain guides. Edward Whymper reached the top of the Matterhorn in 1865 (after seven attempts), and in 1938 the last of the six great north faces of the Alps was climbed with the first ascent of the Eiger Nordwand (north face of the Eiger).\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The first female ascent of Mont Blanc happened earlier than Edward Whymper reaching the top of the Matterhorn. Based on the context provided, we can see that the first female ascent of Mont Blanc occurred in 1819, whereas Edward Whymper successfully reached the top of the Matterhorn in 1865. So, there is a difference of 46 years between these two significant events, with the first female ascent happening first.  To provide more detail on these events, the first British Mont Blanc ascent happened in 1788 when mountaineering was gaining traction as a popular activity, particularly among the Swiss. Mont Blanc, being the highest peak in the Alps, was an attractive challenge for mountaineers during that time. In 1819, a significant milestone was achieved when a woman reached the summit of Mont Blanc for the first time, showcasing bravery and skill that broke gender barriers in mountaineering. On the other hand, Edward Whymper was a prominent mountaineer, best known for his expeditions in the Alps. Among his many accomplishments, Whymper's successful summit of the Matterhorn in 1865 stands out. The Matterhorn, renowned for its formidable shape and difficult climbing conditions, was one of the last major peaks in the Alps to be conquered. Whymper's achievement, despite taking seven attempts, undoubtedly placed him among the great mountaineers of his time.  In conclusion, the first female ascent of Mont Blanc in 1819 happened earlier than Edward Whymper's successful summit of the Matterhorn in 1865. Both events hold great significance in mountaineering history as they showcase bravery, determination, and the pushing of boundaries in the face of great challenges that the sport embodies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead!  and the situation: Two students studied the atmosphere of Earth and other planets from our solar system. Zack learned about Earth's atmosphere, while Ken learned about the atmospheric conditions on planet Venus.  Answer the following question: Which student learned more about corrosive sulfuric acid? Answer:","output":"Ken learned more about corrosive sulfuric acid.  Step 1: Identify the relevant information. In this case, the relevant information is that Venus's clouds contain large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid. Step 2: Match the information with the students. Zack learned about Earth's atmosphere, which does not mention corrosive sulfuric acid, while Ken learned about Venus's atmospheric conditions, which include a significant presence of corrosive sulfuric acid. Step 3: Determine which student learned more about corrosive sulfuric acid based on the information. Since Ken studied the atmospheric conditions on Venus, which contain large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid, he learned more about this substance than Zack, who studied Earth's atmosphere and did not encounter the same element in his studies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Act 1: Emma, a 12-year-old girl living in a small town, is allergic to cats. However, no matter where she goes, there seems to be an abundance of cats roaming around the globe, making her life miserable. One day, while seeking refuge from the felines, Emma accidentally stumbles upon an old library where she finds a mysterious and ancient map showing a small town in America with the words \\"No Cats Allowed\\" written on it.

Upon learning about the planned invasion, Emma and her friends team up with the townspeople to devise a plan to protect their paradise from the onslaught of cat enthusiasts. Through teamwork, wit, and the use of magical artifacts left by the town's founders, they successfully defend the town and drive off Madame Whiskers and her followers.

Events in Beleriand are described chiefly in his work \\"The Silmarillion\\", which tells the story of the early ages of Middle-earth in a style similar to the epic hero tales of Nordic literature. Beleriand also appears in the works \\"The Book of Lost Tales\\", \\"The Children of Húrin\\", and in the epic poems of \\"The Lays of Beleriand\\".  - The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a children's fantasy novel by English author J. R. R. Tolkien. It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the \\"New York Herald Tribune\\" for best juvenile fiction. The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children's literature.  - In the fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Edain were men (humans) who made their way into Beleriand in the First Age, and were friendly to the Elves.  - Haleth is a fictional character from J.R.R. Tolkien 's Middle - earth legendarium . She was a leader of the Second House of the Edain , called the Folk of Haleth after her . At the time of her birth , the Second House of Men had settled in Thargelion , in East Beleriand , living in separate homesteads and having no lords of their own . But in Y.S. 375 of the First Age Morgoth sent out an Orc - raid against them . The Men were caught off - guard , and a great part of their people was wiped out . The remnant was gathered under one Haldad and his twin children , daughter Haleth and son Haldar ; and they held out for days in a stockade until the Noldor rescued them , by which time both Haldad and Haldar were slain . Caranthir offered to Men his lands to live in protected , but Haleth refused , for now she was chosen a Chieftain , being of great heart and no less in valour than her kinsmen . Next year she led her people to Estolad ; and after a time again urged them to move further westward . They passed through the horrors of Nan Dungortheb only by the strength of Haleth 's will , and at last came to the woods of Talath Dirnen . Later many removed the forest of Brethil , which was a part of Doriath outside the Girdle of Melian , but now was granted to them by Thingol . Haleth ruled the Folk of Brethil until she died . She was buried in a green mound in the heights of the Forest , which was called therefore the Ladybarrow ( Haudh - en - Arwen in Sindarin and Tûr Haretha in their own tongue ) . The next Chieftain of Brethil was her nephew Haldan .  - Norse mythology is the body of mythology of the North Germanic people stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition.  - Middle-earth is the setting of much of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium.

R. R. Tolkien, the First Age, or First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar is the heroic period in which most of Tolkien's early legends are set.

R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel \\"The Hobbit\\", but eventually developed into a much larger work.

When Doris Maxwell starts drilling for oil, cowboy Gene Autry tries to stop the drilling, believing the territory's water supply will be ruined. Doris' father, bank president Maxwell, embezzled 25,000 to support the drilling project. Doris and Gene's fight heats up after he shoots out the tires on her car and she steals his horse, Champion. In an attempt to discredit Gene, Doris, who runs a radio station above Sing Low's cafe, broadcasts him on a program sponsored by the oil company. When Gene discovers the trick, he sets out in a rage to find her. George Wilkins, who is in charge of the oil well drilling, takes Doris to the drilling site and tell her the well is dry and he needs additional funds from her father to bring the well in. Doris doesn't know that Wilkins is actually trying to swindle her father by getting him to pay for all of the equipment while he stalls the drilling. Wilkins intends to take over the lease on the profitable land when the bank's lease runs out. While taking the payroll to the drilling site, Wilkins and Doris are held up by two thieves, who are actually Wilkins' henchmen. Gene comes to the rescue and grudingly returns the money to Doris, who continues on to the drilling site. Wilkins reprimands his men for getting caught and then lets them go. Doris and Gene return to the bank, where they discover Maxwell has tried to commit suicide after receiving a letter notifying him that the bank examiner would be arriving soon. Protecting Maxwell from embezzlement charges, Gene makes it seem as if Maxwell was shot during a robbery. The answer is:","output":"Maxwell. In the story, George Wilkins needs additional funds from Doris' father, whose name is Maxwell, to continue the drilling project at the oil well site."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer this question: who plays davey jones in pirates of the caribbean??","output":"The character Davy Jones, the supernatural ruler of the ocean depths and the fearsome captain of the ghostly ship Flying Dutchman, is portrayed by British actor Bill Nighy in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series, specifically in the second and third installments: \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\\" (2006) and \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\\" (2007). Bill Nighy is a renowned and versatile actor with a career spanning theater, television, and film. He was born on December 12, 1949, in Caterham, Surrey, England. Nighy began his acting career in the late 1970s with appearances in various television shows and theater productions. Over the years, he has demonstrated his exceptional acting skills across a wide range of genres, from drama and comedy to fantasy and science fiction. Some of Bill Nighy's most notable performances include roles in films such as \\"Love Actually\\" (2003), where he played the aging rockstar Billy Mack, as well as other major movies like \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" (2011) and its sequel \\"The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" (2015). In addition, he has been involved in several other high-profile films, including \\"Underworld\\" (2003), \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" (2004), \\"Hot Fuzz\\" (2007), \\"The Boat That Rocked\\" (2009), and \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1\\" (2010), in which he portrayed Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour. As Davy Jones in the Pirates of the Caribbean films, Nighy provided not only the voice but also the physical performance behind the character through the use of motion capture technology. This entails wearing a special suit with sensors while acting out the character's movements, which are then digitally recorded for use by visual effects artists to create the final character on screen. In the case of Davy Jones, the combination of Nighy's distinctive voice and the intricate digital animation resulted in a memorable and menacing portrayal of the mythical sea captain burdened with a tragic curse. Aside from his extensive work in film, Bill Nighy has continued to appear in successful television shows and miniseries, such as the critically acclaimed dramas \\"State of Play\\" (2003) and \\"The Girl in the Café\\" (2005) and the recent BBC adaptation of Agatha Christie's \\"Ordeal by Innocence\\" (2018).

Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties, synthesis and reactions. Among important applications is the Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester(ROCOCOOR) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X, zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR, the Reformatskii reaction which converts α-halo-esters and aldehydes to β-hydroxy-esters, the Simmons–Smith reaction in which the carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide reacts with alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane, the Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds. The Barbier reaction (1899) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two. In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water. On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, are expensive and difficult to handle.

A workplace for Generation Z When the Boston architecture firm CBT set out to reimagine the Schrafft’s City Center office complex in Charlestown in 2014, it focused on the needs of the future workforce — the oldest of whom were still teenagers at the time. Members of Generation Z, born between roughly 1996 and 2010, are growing up in the era of crowdsourcing and interactive video games like Minecraft, said CBT principal Haril Pandya. These kinds of collaborations are shaping the workers of tomorrow, who will expect to have similar types of cross-pollination in their professional lives, Pandya said. For the revamped Schrafft’s center, a former candy factory, that means a lobby with spaces that “foster and nurture those interactions.” When completed this summer, the entryway will be a destination, with a three-story atrium, a coffee bar, and a lounge with an oversized gas fireplace. The space will also pay homage to the sweets once made there, with faceted windows meant to evoke a candy wrapper and chocolate tones on the concrete floor with bright, glossy pops of red and oranges — a theme Pandya calls “confectionary contemporary.” Old Schrafft’s ads and photos, including factory workers in hairnets, have been turned into wallpaper for the lobby. It will be a stark contrast to the building’s current drab hotel vibe, with mismatched carpets and granite kiosks. A Rendering of Schrafft’s new lobby In all, CBT is reimagining about 10,000 square feet of the main building’s 600,000 square-foot space, including the cafeteria and other common areas, along with landscaping and a walkway to the Mystic River. The complex is currently home to about 30 tenants and 3,500 employees, a number that’s expected to stay level even after Partners HealthCare decamps for Assembly Row in July and Boston Medical Center and several other new tenants move in. To anticipate what the next generation of workers will expect, CBT has an academic group that researches trends and patterns among college students. What they don’t want, Pandya said, is a jarring transition: “ ‘Holy cow, I have to go from this great awesome university vibe to, like, corner cubicle? That’s the worst ever.’ ” The workforce of tomorrow will be fine without a dedicated desk or cubicle, by the way, Pandya said, because they’re comfortable plugging in their laptops anywhere. As for photos and other mementos that workers put up to personalize their workspace, Gen Z has no need for those either. All that stuff is in their phones. As work and leisure continue to blend, young workers expect even more from their offices, Pandya said. In between e-mails and conference calls, they want places to interact with coworkers, eat, exercise, play games, and take walks. The new motto, as Pandya sees it: “There’s no place like work.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Boston architecture firm CBT is redesigning the Schrafft's City Center office complex with Generation Z in mind, focusing on collaborative spaces, flexible work environments, and incorporating elements that blend work and leisure to create an attractive workplace for the future workforce.

Title: Piranha 3-D Movie plot: Fisherman Matt Boyd is fishing in Lake Victoria when a small earthquake hits, splitting the lake floor and causing a whirlpool.

He reunites with his old crush Kelly Driscoll and meets Derrick Jones, a sleazy pornographer, as well as Danni Arslow, one of his actresses. Derrick convinces Jake to show him good spots on the lake for filming a pornographic movie. That night, Jake's mother, Sheriff Julie Forester, searches for the missing Matt Boyd with Deputy Fallon. They find his mutilated body and contemplate closing the lake. This decision, however, is made difficult as two-thousand partying college students are on spring break, which is important for bringing revenue to the small town. The next morning, a lone cliff diver is attacked and consumed by the vicious, marauding piranhas. Jake bribes his sister, Laura, and brother, Zane (Sage Ryan), to stay home alone so that he can show Derrick around the lake. After Jake leaves, Zane convinces Laura to go fishing on a small sandbar island. They forget to tie the boat down and are stranded in the middle of the lake.

Let's break down the premise and hypothesis to better understand their relationship. Premise: \\"but uh in my spare time someday i i hope to do something more with it i have a lot a ideas but putting them into work is another story\\" The premise suggests that the speaker has a lot of ideas and hopes to do something with them in their spare time. The statement also implies that the speaker faces challenges in putting their ideas into action or work, possibly due to time constraints or other factors. Hypothesis: \\"I have lots of ideas but don't have that much time.\\" The hypothesis also states that the speaker has many ideas but faces challenges because of limited time. Although it is not explicitly mentioned that these ideas will be acted upon in the speaker's spare time, the premise implies that the speaker hopes to do so. By comparing the premise and hypothesis, we can see that they both express the notion of having numerous ideas but facing time-related obstacles. While the hypothesis might not encompass the entire premise, it captures one of the central issues mentioned—the speaker's lack of time. In conclusion, if the premise is true, it is reasonable to assume that the hypothesis could also be true, as both statements highlight time limitations as a factor hindering the speaker in utilizing their ideas.

Falling asleep is a natural process that allows the body and mind to recover from daily activities, restore energy, and consolidate information from experiences. It is an essential part of maintaining good health and overall well-being. While laying down and relaxation are both parts of the process of falling asleep, the actual act of your eyes closing is more indicative of the transition from waking to sleep. Laying down is a position that can facilitate rest, but one can lay down without falling asleep. Relaxation is also an important aspect of falling asleep, but like laying down, it doesn't necessarily indicate being asleep or transitioning into sleep. Laziness and feeling better are not directly relevant to the act of your eyes closing while resting. Laziness usually refers to a lack of motivation or unwillingness to engage in activity, which may lead to resting, but it does not indicate the act of falling asleep itself.

Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which farmer had soil which may delay planting to less ideal dates?  Barb and Jill practiced small scale farming. Jill farmed the conventional way, while barb used the no-tillage method.  Hint: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. The answer is:","output":"Barb had soil which may delay planting to less ideal dates, as she used the no-tillage method. In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: After the Empire of Japan invaded and occupied the Northeast in 1931, the Chinese Anarchist Party organized small anti-Japanese guerrilla units","output":"Okay, so let me explain this for you like you're a little kid! A long time ago, in 1931, the Empire of Japan invaded and took control of a place called the Northeast. Now, there were some people in China called the Chinese Communist Party who didn't like that very much. So, they made small groups of fighters, like teams, to go and fight against the Japanese. They also made a big team called the Northeastern People's Revolutionary Army to fight for good changes for people. But their groups were a lot smaller than other groups called the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies, who got together because they all loved their home and wanted the Japanese to leave. Now, the hypothesis is a guess we can make after reading this story. The guess is: \\"After the Empire of Japan invaded and occupied the Northeast in 1931, the Chinese Anarchist Party organized small anti-Japanese guerrilla units.\\" Wait a second, this guess is a little wrong! It should be about the Chinese Communist Party, not the Chinese Anarchist Party. So the right hypothesis would be: \\"After the Empire of Japan invaded and occupied the Northeast in 1931, the Chinese Communist Party organized small anti-Japanese guerrilla units.\\" That's better! So now we understand that the Chinese Communist Party made small groups of fighters to go against the Japanese when they invaded the Northeast."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 1: Will it be the same to read with ear plugs or with complete solitude? Question 2: Will it be the same to read with ear plugs or in complete solitude? Pick your answer from: a). no. b). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the two questions and determine the difference, if any, in their meaning. Question 1: Will it be the same to read with ear plugs or with complete solitude? Question 2: Will it be the same to read with ear plugs or in complete solitude? In both questions, the goal is to determine if reading with ear plugs has the same effect on concentration as reading in complete solitude. The difference between the two questions lies in the preposition used in the second part of the questions: \\"with\\" in the first question, and \\"in\\" in the second question. Step 2: Determine if the difference in preposition has any significant impact on the meaning of the questions. Using \\"with\\" in the first question implies that the question is asking if there is a connection or relationship between reading with ear plugs and complete solitude. The implication is that one might be in a noisy environment but still read with ear plugs. Using \\"in\\" in the second question implies that the reader is in an environment characterized by complete solitude and is asking if this environment has the same impact on concentration as reading with ear plugs. The difference in prepositions, however, doesn't seem to have a significant impact on the general meaning of the questions as both are aiming to compare reading with ear plugs to reading in complete solitude. Step 3: Answer questions 1 and 2 based on the understanding of the comparison being made in both questions. Answer to Question 1: a). no Answer to Question 2: a). no Step 4: Determine if these answers are the same. Yes, the answers to both questions are the same. While reading with ear plugs can help block out some noise, it might not completely block out all sounds. Some people might still be distracted by internal thoughts or other sensory inputs even if they can't hear external sounds. In complete solitude, there are fewer distractions overall, making it easier for some people to concentrate while reading."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The use of red has similar connotations from country to country: the blood, sacrifice, and courage of those who defended their country; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings; and the sacrifice of Christ's blood (in some historically Christian nations) are a few examples. Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the former British Empire. The British flag bears the colors red, white, and blue; it includes the cross of Saint George, patron saint of England, and the saltire of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white. The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain, the colors of the French tricolore include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country. Many former colonies of Spain, such as Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Peru, and Venezuela, also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners.

Break down the statement and understand the context. 2. Identify any connections or relationships between the premise and the hypothesis. 3. Assess whether the premise implies the hypothesis, or if more information is required. Step 1: Break down the statement and understand the context. Premise: \\"The task has caught up with me anyway and at last.\\" This premise tells us that a specific task that was perhaps delayed or put off has finally caught up with the speaker. Step 2: Identify any connections or relationships between the premise and the hypothesis. Hypothesis: \\"I finally have no choice but to mow the lawn this weekend.\\" The hypothesis is a statement about a specific task that needs to be done this weekend, now that the speaker feels they have no other choice. Step 3: Assess whether the premise implies the hypothesis, or if more information is required. While the premise and the hypothesis both discuss tasks that need to be completed, the premise lacks specificity about the type of task or when it needs to be done. The hypothesis refers to the lawn mowing task and specifies that it has to be done over the weekend. Thus, we can infer that there is a possible connection between the premise and the hypothesis, but the premise alone does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. Conclusion: The given premise does not entail the hypothesis \\"I finally have no choice but to mow the lawn this weekend,\\" as more information is required to establish a direct connection between the two.

To find out how many he ate, we need to subtract the apples used for pie and the apples left from the total number he bought: 28 apples (total bought) - 4 apples (used for pie) - 10 apples (left) = 14 apples (eaten) Now, we can find the ratio of the number of apples Samuel ate to the total number of apples he bought: 14 apples (eaten) : 28 apples (total bought) To simplify the ratio, we divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 14 in this case: 14 apples / 14 = 1 28 apples / 14 = 2 So the simplified ratio is boxed{1:2} ."},{"instruction":"Simplify the expression [ frac{(sqrt{2}  1)^{2  sqrt{3}}}{(sqrt{2} + 1)^{2 + sqrt{3}}}, ] writing your answer as (a  b sqrt{c},) where (a,) (b,) and (c) are positive integers, and (c) is not divisible by the square of a prime.","output":"First, recognize that: [ frac{1}{sqrt{2} + 1} = frac{sqrt{2} - 1}{2 - 1} = sqrt{2} - 1. ] So, [ frac{(sqrt{2} - 1)^{2 - sqrt{3}}}{(sqrt{2} + 1)^{2 + sqrt{3}}} = (sqrt{2} - 1)^{2 - sqrt{3}} cdot (sqrt{2} - 1)^{-2 - sqrt{3}} = (sqrt{2} - 1)^{2 - sqrt{3} - 2 - sqrt{3}}. ] This simplifies further to: [ (sqrt{2} - 1)^{-2sqrt{3}}. ] Taking (x = sqrt{2} - 1), we know: [ x^2 = (sqrt{2} - 1)^2 = 3 - 2sqrt{2}. ] So, (x^{-2sqrt{3}} = (3 - 2sqrt{2})^{-sqrt{3}}), which can be expressed as: [ (3 - 2sqrt{2})^{-sqrt{3}} = left(frac{1}{3 - 2sqrt{2}}right)^{sqrt{3}} = (3 + 2sqrt{2})^{sqrt{3}}. ] Noting that the exact expansion would require binomial theorem for non-integer exponents, we keep the expression in its simplified radical form.

Since x_1 < x_2, it follows that -x_2 < -x_1, which implies 2^{-x_2} < 2^{-x_1}.   Therefore, 2^{-x_2} - 2^{-x_1} < 0,   and (2^{-x_1+1}+2)(2^{-x_2+1}+2) > 0,   thus f(x_1) - f(x_2) < 0,   which means the function f(x) is increasing.   Therefore, boxed{text{The function } f(x) text{ is increasing}}. (3) Since f(x) is an odd function, the inequality f(t^2-2t) + f(2t^2-k) < 0 can be rewritten as f(t^2-2t) < -f(2t^2-k), which is equivalent to f(t^2-2t) < f(k-2t^2).   Since f(t) is increasing, we have t^2-2t < k-2t^2. Therefore, 3t^2-2t < k.   When t = -frac{1}{3}, 3t^2-2t reaches its minimum value of -frac{1}{3}. Therefore, k > -frac{1}{3}.   Thus, boxed{k > -frac{1}{3}}."},{"instruction":"A factory plans to build an opentopped rectangular water tank with a volume of 6400 m³ and a depth of 4 m.

We also need to consider the cost of the walls. There are three walls to consider (since the top is open), two with area 4x (the sides) and one with area frac{6400}{x} (the front and back combined).

Thus, the total bad sets of type 1 is:                  |S| = sum_{i=1}^{99} C_{S_i}^{3} geqslant 99 times C_{48}^{3} = 99 times frac{48 times 47 times 46}{6}          4. **Calculate Total Four-Station Combinations**:     - Total number of combinations of 4 stations out of 99:                  C_{99}^{4} = frac{99 times 98 times 97 times 96}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 4 times 99 times 98 times 97             - Number of interconnected sets is total minus bad sets:                  C_{99}^{4} - |S| leqslant 4 times 99 times 98 times 97 - 99 times 8 times 47 times 46             - Simplify the expression:                  4 times 99 times 98 times 97 - 8 times 99 times 47 times 46 = 99 times 8 times (49 times 97 - 47 times 46) = 2052072          5. **Construct Example**:     - Arrange 99 stations in a circular manner of a regular 99-gon. Define bidirectional passages through each station's shortest and longest divides forming a predefined structure ensuring identical connections (\`S\` type bad sets). # Conclusion The maximum number of interconnected groups of 4 space stations is: [ boxed{2052072} ]"},{"instruction":"Find the value for m when the equation 21 ( m + n ) + 21 = 21 (  m + n ) + 21 is true.","output":"To find the value of m when the equation is true, we need to simplify and solve the equation for m.

Combine with (-7xy^{2}): Multiply the results from step 1 with -7xy^{2}, which gives 8x^{6}y^{3} cdot (-7xy^{2}). 3.

Simplify the expression: The x^{6} and y^{3} terms cancel out with part of the denominator, leaving -4x^{3}y^{2} after simplification.

Setting these equal to each other gives: [ frac{1}{4}x^2 = kx + 1 ] Rearranging, we get: [ x^2 - 4kx - 4 = 0 ] From this quadratic equation, we know: [ x_1 + x_2 = 4k, quad x_1 cdot x_2 = -4 ] Thus: [ x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1 cdot x_2 = 16k^2 + 8 ] The lengths |AF| and |BF| are given by: [ |AF| = y_A + 1 = frac{1}{4}x_1^2 + 1, quad |BF| = y_B + 1 = frac{1}{4}x_2^2 + 1 ] Therefore: [ |AF| times |BF| = left(frac{1}{4}x_1^2 + 1right)left(frac{1}{4}x_2^2 + 1right) = 4k^2 + 4 ] When k = 1, we find: [ |AF| times |BF| = 8 ] boxed{|AF| times |BF| = 8}  Part (3): Proving q = sqrt{4p + 9} Given p = |AF| times |BF| = 4k^2 + 4, and the expressions for OA and OB: [ OA = |x_1|sqrt{1 + frac{1}{16}x_1^2}, quad OB = |x_2|sqrt{1 + frac{1}{16}x_2^2} ] The product q = |OA| times |OB| becomes: [ q = |x_1x_2|sqrt{(1 + frac{1}{16}x_1^2)(1 + frac{1}{16}x_2^2)} = sqrt{16k^2 + 25} ] Since 16k^2 + 25 = 4(4k^2 + 4) + 9 = 4p + 9, we have: [ q^2 = 4p + 9 ] Thus, we conclude: [ q = sqrt{4p + 9} ] boxed{q = sqrt{4p + 9}}"},{"instruction":"Calculate the sum of 324 and 73, multiply the result by 27, and then write the product in base8.

This is a reasonable assumption because the sum of a single-digit number and its digits will not reach 125, and a two-digit number with its sum of digits also seems insufficient.  2. **First digit of n is 1:**     Let n = overline{1ab}, meaning n has the form 100 + 10a + b, where a and b are digits (i.e., 0 leq a,b leq 9). This simplifies our approach, focusing us on a very specific set of numbers. 3. **Rewrite n + S(n):**     Given ( n = overline{1ab} ), we need to express (S(n)), the sum of digits of (n):     [     S(n) = 1 + a + b     ]     Substituting this into the given equation:     [     n + S(n) = 100 + 10a + b + 1 + a + b = 125     ] 4. **Combine and simplify the equation:**     Combining like terms, we get:     [     100 + 10a + b + 1 + a + b = 125     ]     [     101 + 11a + 2b = 125     ]     Subtract 101 from both sides:     [     11a + 2b = 24     ] 5. **Solve for the digits a and b:**     We need to find non-negative integer solutions for a and b that satisfy (11a + 2b = 24).

After the first move, all cards will be flipped, and no further moves can be made. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**    Assume that for any sequence of ( k < n ) cards, the game will necessarily end.

Let ( z ) be the lowest card number with a black face on top. If all cards are initially white, the first player will make a move, and the game begins. If players avoid playing on cards lower than ( z ), they will eventually run out of moves because they will be forced to play on cards lower than ( z ) (since the game with ( n - z ) cards will end by the inductive hypothesis).    When a move is made on a card lower than ( z ), it will eventually result in a card lower than ( z ) becoming black. Repeating this process, we will eventually reach a point where the card numbered 1 is black. At this point, the card numbered 1 is \\"out of the game,\\" and we are left with ( n - 1 ) cards.

We have:    [    2009 div 41 = 49 quad text{with a remainder of} quad 2009 mod 41 = 0    ]    This means that 2009 is exactly divisible by 41, resulting in 49 groups of 41 cards each. 3. **Winning Strategy:**    Since 49 is an odd number, the starting player (Amir) can always ensure that after each of his moves, the number of remaining groups of 41 cards is even. This is because each move affects exactly 41 cards, flipping their state. By carefully choosing his moves, Amir can force the game into a state where Ercole has no legal moves left.

First, let's understand what sqrt{a^{2}} and sqrt{b^{2}} represent given that a and b are both negative. 1. Since a < 0, sqrt{a^{2}} simplifies to -a. This is because a^{2} is positive (as squaring any real number results in a non-negative number), and the square root of a positive number is positive. However, since a is negative, we take -a to represent the positive value of a. 2. Similarly, since b < 0, sqrt{b^{2}} simplifies to -b for the same reasoning as above.

But f(f(x)) = x for all x, so p^2(-2) + pq(1-p) + q = -2. Now consider another value. Setting x = 0, we find f(0) = -10. Since -10 < -1, f(-10) = -10p + q. Therefore, f(f(0)) = f(-10) = -10p + q, fulfilling f(f(x)) = x for all x, and hence -10p + q = 0. From the equation -10p + q = 0, we find q = 10p.

We want two people at each place. The number of ways to choose 2 people out of 4 to go to one of the places (and the other 2 automatically go to the other place) is given by the combination formula: [binom{4}{2} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6] Therefore, there are 6 different arrangements, making option B correct. **Option C:** To ensure each place has at least one volunteer, we can distribute the 4 volunteers in the following group sizes: 1-1-2, 1-2-1, or 2-1-1. Each distribution has 3 ways to assign the groups to the places, and there are 2 ways to pick who goes alone in the 1-1-2 distribution (and similarly for the other distributions). This gives us: [3 times (3 times 2) = 18] However, this calculation overlooks the fact that for the 1-1-2 distribution, we also need to consider the different ways to pick the 2 volunteers going together, which actually results in: [3 times binom{4}{2} = 3 times 6 = 18] And since there are 2 more distributions (1-2-1 and 2-1-1) that are essentially the same in terms of arrangement, we multiply by 3: [18 times 3 = 54] This contradicts the initial solution provided, indicating a need to reassess the calculation for option C. Upon reassessment, considering each unique distribution (1-1-2, 1-2-1, 2-1-1) and the ways to assign volunteers to these distributions correctly, the total arrangements should be calculated considering the permutations of volunteers to the places, which is: [6 times 3! = 6 times (3 times 2 times 1) = 36] So, option C is correctly stated as having 36 different arrangements. **Option D:** To allocate 20 identical ambulances to 3 places with at least one ambulance at each place, we can think of placing 2 dividers among the 20 ambulances to create 3 groups. The number of ways to place these dividers is the combination of choosing 2 positions out of 19 possible slots (between the ambulances): [binom{19}{2} = frac{19!}{2!(19-2)!} = 171] Therefore, option D is correct with 171 different arrangements.

The daily sales volume, given the price reduction, becomes (20 + 2x) pieces. The profit made from selling each piece after the price reduction is (40 - x) dollars. Therefore, the total daily profit can be expressed as the product of the profit per piece and the number of pieces sold, which gives us the equation: (40 - x)(20 + 2x) = 1050 Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get: 800 + 80x - 20x - 2x^2 = 1050 Rightarrow -2x^2 + 60x - 250 = 0 Rightarrow x^2 - 30x + 125 = 0 Solving this quadratic equation for x, we find: x_{1} = 25, quad x_{2} = 5 Given the context, x = 5 doesn't make sense as it would not yield the desired profit, so we discard it.

The equation for achieving a 1600 daily profit, based on the price reduction, is: (40 - y)(20 + 2y) = 1600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 800 + 80y - 20y - 2y^2 = 1600 Rightarrow -2y^2 + 60y - 800 = 0 Rightarrow y^2 - 30y + 400 = 0 To determine the feasibility of achieving this profit, we check the discriminant (Delta) of the quadratic equation: Delta = (-30)^2 - 4 times 1 times 400 = 900 - 1600 = -700 Since Delta < 0, the equation has no real roots. This indicates that it is not possible to achieve a daily profit of 1600 by reducing the price, as no real value of y satisfies the equation.

The triangle triangle I_AI_BI_C is homothetic to the intouch triangle triangle A_1B_1C_1 with the homothety center being the incenter I of triangle ABC. 2. **Orthocenter and Circumcenter Relationship:**    Note that the incenter I of triangle ABC is the orthocenter of the excentral triangle triangle I_AI_BI_C. This is because the altitudes of triangle I_AI_BI_C are the angle bisectors of triangle ABC, which intersect at the incenter I. 3. **Euler Line of triangle I_AI_BI_C:**    The Euler line of a triangle passes through its orthocenter, circumcenter, and the centroid.

These circles intersect ( AC ) at point ( N ) and ( AB ) at point ( M ) respectively. 2. We use the Power of a Point theorem applied to point ( B ) with respect to the circumcircle of ( triangle AEC ). The theorem states that for two secants intersecting outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments of one secant equals the product of the lengths of the segments of the other secant:    [    BE cdot BC = BM cdot BA    ] 3. Analogously, we apply the Power of a Point theorem for point ( C ) with respect to the circumcircle of ( triangle AEB ):    [    CE cdot CB = CN cdot CA    ] 4. We then divide the second equation by the first equation:    [    frac{CE cdot CB}{BE cdot BC} = frac{CN cdot CA}{BM cdot BA}    ] 5. Simplify the equation:    [    frac{CE}{BE} = frac{CN}{BM} cdot frac{CA}{BA}    ] 6. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the angle bisector of an angle of a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the lengths of the other two sides, we have:    [    frac{CA}{BA} = frac{CE}{BE}    ] 7. Substitute this into the previous equation:    [    frac{CE}{BE} = frac{CN}{BM} cdot frac{CE}{BE}    ] 8. Cancel out (frac{CE}{BE}) from both sides:    [    1 = frac{CN}{BM}    ] 9. Therefore, it follows that:    [    CN = BM    ]    Hence, we have proved that (CN = BM).     10. To show that the areas of ( triangle BME ) and ( triangle CNE ) are equal, we proceed using two methods:    **Method 1: By Congruence of Triangles**        - Observe that if arcs (BE) and (EN) are equal and arcs (ME) and (EC) are also equal, the chords subtending these arcs are equal:      [      BE = EN quad text{and} quad ME = EC      ]    - Therefore, triangles (BME) and (CNE) share two sides and the angle between them respectively equal, hence are congruent by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) postulate. This implies that the areas of the triangles are equal.    **Method 2: By Identical Heights**        - Since (AE) is the angle bisector of ( angle BAC ), and given that (CN = BM), the altitudes from (E) to bases (CN) and (BM) are equal because they are perpendicular to equal bases (BM) and (CN).    - Hence, the areas of triangles ( triangle BME ) and ( triangle CNE ) are equal because bases and corresponding heights are equal. # Conclusion: [ boxed{The areas of triangle BME and triangle CNE are equal.} ]"},{"instruction":"John cycled a total of 3671_9 kilometers.

Let the coordinates of the right angle be ((0,0)), the point where the circle touches leg (a) be ((r,0)), and the point where the circle touches leg (b) be ((0,r)). The center of the circle is at ((r,r)). 4. The distance from the center of the circle to the hypotenuse (which is the radius (r)) can be found using the properties of similar triangles. The triangle formed by the center of the circle and the points where the circle touches the legs is similar to the original right-angled triangle. 5. Using similar triangles, we have:    [    frac{a-r}{r} = frac{r}{b-r}    ] 6. Cross-multiplying gives:    [    (a-r)(b-r) = r^2    ] 7. Expanding and simplifying the equation:    [    ab - ar - br + r^2 = r^2    ]    [    ab - ar - br = 0    ]    [    ab = ar + br    ]    [    ab = r(a + b)    ] 8.

This can be rewritten as:    [    frac{1}{r} = frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b}    ] Thus, we have shown that: [ frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{r} ] (blacksquare) The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{r} } )"},{"instruction":"Find the point where the line passing through ((2, 3, 5)) and ((4, 2, 9)) intersects the (xz)plane.","output":"First, calculate the direction vector (vec{d}) using the points ((2, 3, 5)) and ((4, 2, 9)): [vec{d} = begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2  2 - 3  9 - 5 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 2  -1  4 end{pmatrix}.] Next, parametrize the line: [begin{pmatrix} x  y  z end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 2  3  5 end{pmatrix} + t begin{pmatrix} 2  -1  4 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 2 + 2t  3 - t  5 + 4t end{pmatrix}.] For the line to intersect the (xz)-plane, the (y)-coordinate must be 0: [3 - t = 0 implies t = 3.] Substitute (t = 3) back into the parametrized equations for (x) and (z): [x = 2 + 2(3) = 8, quad z = 5 + 4(3) = 17.] Hence, the intersection point is: [boxed{(8, 0, 17)}.] Conclusion: The intersection point where the line through ((2, 3, 5)) and ((4, 2, 9)) meets the (xz)-plane has been found, and the coordinates are consistent with the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Calculate the sum of the angles theta_1 + theta_2 + theta_3 + theta_4 in degrees for the equation z^4 = 16i.","output":"First, express z^4 = 16i in polar form.

We aim to find the maximum possible value of ( N ). 2. **Initial Assumption**:    Assume that the maximum number of islands ( N ) can be ( 36 ). We denote these islands in such a way that they form 6 groups, each containing 6 islands. Within each group, every pair of islands is connected, forming a complete graph ( K_6 ). 3. **Verification of the Requirements**:    - **Maximum of 5 Bridges Per Island**: Each island has exactly 5 bridges since it is connected to the other 5 islands in its group.    - **Every Subset of 7 Islands**: Any subset of 7 islands contains at least one group of 6 islands. Since this subset cannot have all 7 islands completely unconnected, it must contain at least one pair of connected islands, satisfying the condition. 4. **Proof by Contradiction**:    Assume there are ( N geq 37 ) islands, and we need to show that this leads to a contradiction:    - Consider any island ( A ), which is connected to at most 5 other islands.    - Temporarily ignore ( A ) and its neighbors.

Island ( B ) is similarly connected to at most 5 other islands.    - Temporarily ignore ( B ) and its 5 neighbors.

None of these islands can be connected to one another, contradicting the given condition that every subset of 7 islands contains at least one connected pair. 6. **Conclusion**:    The contradiction shows that having ( N geq 37 ) islands is impossible.

Since k must be an integer, the smallest k that satisfies this condition is k = 17. So the smallest 3-digit number in the sequence is 6(17) + 2 = 102. For the largest value: 6k + 2 ≤ 999 6k ≤ 997 k ≤ 997 / 6 k ≤ 166.166... Since k must be an integer, the largest k that satisfies this condition is k = 166. So the largest 3-digit number in the sequence is 6(166) + 2 = 998. Now we have an arithmetic sequence starting with 102 and ending with 998, with a common difference of 6 (since each subsequent number in the sequence is 6 more than the previous one). The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term) where n is the number of terms. To find n, we use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: last term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference 998 = 102 + (n - 1) * 6 896 = (n - 1) * 6 n - 1 = 896 / 6 n - 1 = 149 n = 150 Now we can find the sum: Sum = 150/2 * (102 + 998) Sum = 75 * 1100 Sum = 82500 So the sum of all 3-digit numbers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 6 is boxed{82,500} ."},{"instruction":"The ratio of cats to dogs at the pet store is 3:4.

Let's denote the vertices of the triangle by (A, B, C) in the usual manner. Let (O) be the center of the incircle and let (O_a, O_b, O_c) be the centers of the excircles opposite to vertices (A, B, C), respectively. 3. We know from the reference [Kiss Gy.: Amit jó tudni a háromszögekről, KöMaL 52. évf. 3. szám (2002. március), 130-139. old] that the distances of the points where the incircle touches the legs of the triangle from vertex (C) are (s-c). 4. For the excircles, the distances from (C) to the points of tangency on the legs are (s-b), (s-a), and (s), respectively.     5. So, the radius of the incircle is (s-c) and the radii of the excircles are (s-a), (s-b), and (s). 6. Assume these four numbers form four consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence. This implies the order (s-c, s-b, s-a, s) must hold true. 7. For them to be in arithmetic progression, the common difference ((d)) must be equal throughout. Therefore:    [    (s-b) - (s-c) = (s-a) - (s-b) = s - (s-a)    ]    Simplifying these, we obtain:    [    (s-b) - (s-c) = b - c    ]    [    (s-a) - (s-b) = a - b    ]    [    s - (s-a) = a    ] 8.

However, for (a, b,) and (c) to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality. Specifically, (a + b > c):    [    a + b = a + 2a = 3a = c    ] 10. This implies:     [     a + b = c     ]    which violates the triangle inequality since (a + b) must be strictly greater than (c). **Conclusion:** Hence, there does not exist a right triangle where the radii of the incircle and the three excircles form four consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence.

Part 2: Calculating the Minimum Transportation Cost Since the coefficient of x in the expression y = 50x + 45000 is positive (50 > 0), y increases as x increases.

Substituting x = 10 into the expression for y: [ y = 50 times 10 + 45000 = 45500 ] Thus, the minimum transportation cost is 45500 yuan, achieved by transporting: - 10 tons of goods from city A to town A, - 110 tons from city A to town B (since city A had 120 tons and 10 were sent to town A), - 130 tons from city B to town A (to fulfill the remaining need of town A), - 0 tons from city B to town B (since city A fully supplies town B's needs).

For the expression to be an integer, the denominator 2^c - 2^d must divide the numerator 2^a - 2^b.

For frac{2^a - 2^b}{2^c - 2^d} to be an integer, 2^d (2^{c-d} - 1) must divide 2^b (2^{a-b} - 1). This implies that 2^d must divide 2^b, which means d leq b. 4.

According to the triangle inequality theorem, a set of lengths can form a triangle if:    [    a + b > c    ]    Since all our numbers (a, b,) and (c) are between 100 and 200:    - The smallest sum of any two numbers in this range is (100 + 100 = 200)    - The largest possible number for (c) is 200 4. **Check the Triangle Inequality**    We need to check if the sum of the two smallest numbers is larger than the largest one:    [    a + b > c    ]    Given (a, b, c in [100, 200]), consider the smallest sum of any two from the three numbers:    [    a + b geq 100 + 101 = 201    ]    This sum is always greater than or equal to 201, and since the largest number in our range is 200, it is always true that:    [    a + b > c    ]    This inequality holds for any selection of numbers within this subset. 5. **Conclusion**    Through the pigeonhole principle and the triangle inequality theorem, we have proven that there exists at least one subset among the 50 that contains three natural numbers which can form the sides of a triangle based on their lengths.

Since a pig weighing less than 16 kg is considered underweight, let's consider the maximum weight an underweight pig can have is 15.999 kg (just below 16 kg). To find the maximum number of pigs that can be underweight, we need to consider the scenario where we have the maximum number of underweight pigs and possibly one pig that brings the average to exactly 15 kg. Let's assume that we have 'n' underweight pigs, each weighing just below 16 kg (for simplicity, we'll use 15.999 kg), and one pig that weighs enough to bring the total weight to 60 kg. So, the equation would be: (n * 15.999 kg) + weight of the last pig = 60 kg Since we're looking for the maximum number of underweight pigs, we want 'n' to be as large as possible, and the weight of the last pig to be just enough to reach the total weight of 60 kg without increasing the average. If all 4 pigs were underweight, the total weight would be: 4 * 15.999 kg = 63.996 kg, which is more than 60 kg, so not all 4 pigs can be underweight. If we have 3 underweight pigs, their total weight would be: 3 * 15.999 kg = 47.997 kg Now, we need to find the weight of the last pig to see if it can be over 16 kg to maintain the total weight of 60 kg: Weight of the last pig = 60 kg - 47.997 kg = 12.003 kg Since 12.003 kg is less than 16 kg, the last pig would also be underweight.

With ell points, the contribution of each vertex to the external angle sum is phi + (phi - 15^circ). 3. **Total Internal Angle Relation**: Given that the sum of all internal angles is twice the sum of all external angles, the internal angle at each vertex is 180^circ - (phi + (phi - 15^circ)) = 180^circ - 2phi + 15^circ. 4. **Equation Setup**: Since there are ell such internal angles, the total sum is ell(180^circ - 2phi + 15^circ) = 2(360^circ) Rightarrow ell(180^circ - 2phi + 15^circ) = 720^circ. 5. **Simplifying and Solving for ell**:    [    ell(195^circ - 2phi) = 720^circ    ]    Given phi + (phi - 15^circ) = frac{360^circ}{ell}, we have 2phi - 15^circ = frac{360^circ}{ell}.

So, 0.10 * T toys are red and small. - There are 40 green and large toys. Since half of the toys are large, T/2 - 40 toys are red and large. - There are 60 red and large toys. We can set up the following equation to find the total number of red toys (R): Red and small + Red and large = Total red toys 0.10T + 60 = R We also know that half of the toys are large, and among them, 40 are green and 60 are red: T/2 = Green and large + Red and large T/2 = 40 + 60 T/2 = 100 This means that T = 200 (since 100 is half of the total number of toys).

Let ( N ) denote the set of natural numbers. 2. For any subset ( A subseteq N ), let ( overline{A} ) denote its complement with respect to ( N ), that is, ( overline{A} = N setminus A ). 3. Consider the sets ( A_1 ) and ( overline{A_1} ). One of these sets must be infinite because the union of ( A_1 ) and ( overline{A_1} ) is ( N ), which is infinite. 4.

Dividing through by R, we get:    [    frac{R}{AD} + frac{R}{BE} + frac{R}{CF} = 2 implies frac{1}{AD} + frac{1}{BE} + frac{1}{CF} = frac{2}{R}    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{1}{AD}+frac{1}{BE}+frac{1}{CF} = frac{2}{R}} ]"},{"instruction":"Among the following functions, the one whose domain and range are the same as the function y=e^{ln x} is (　　) A: y=x B: y=ln x C: y= frac {1}{ sqrt {x}} D: y=10^{x}","output":"From the problem, the function y=e^{ln x}=x, has a domain of {x|x > 0}, and its range is (0,+infty).   For option A: y=x, the domain is mathbb{R}, thus option A is incorrect.   For option B: y=ln x, the domain is {x|x > 0}, but its range is mathbb{R}, thus option B is incorrect.   For option C: y= frac {1}{ sqrt {x}}, the domain is {x|x > 0}, and its range is (0,+infty), thus option C is correct.   For option D: y=10^{x}, the domain is mathbb{R}, but its range is (0,+infty), thus option D is incorrect.   Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{C}.   By determining the domain and range of the function y=e^{ln x}, one can easily judge the given options.   This question tests the understanding of the domain and range of logarithmic functions, which is an application of the properties of functions and is relatively easy."}]`),_={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},Y=["disabled"],F={key:0},E={key:1};function R(n,e,h,m,o,s){const f=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),k(f,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
