Chicagoan Chester \\"Chet\\" Ripley, his wife, Connie, and their two sons, Buckley \\"Buck\\" and Ben, are on vacation at a lake resort in Pechoggin, Wisconsin during the summer. All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl, Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat the Old 96'er (a 96-ounce steak) at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy. Later, just at the peak of tension between families, it emerges that Roman has made a bad investment and is broke. He has not told Kate and was planning to hit up Chet for the cash. Later, during a thunderstorm, the twins wander off and fall into a mine shaft. Chet and Roman find them, but the claustrophobic Roman is reluctant to descend into the tiny mine shaft. After some encouragement from Chet, Roman summons up all his courage, while Chet goes in search of a rope to pull them out. Upon realizing that the mine is stocked with old dynamite, Roman takes his daughters and climbs out of the shaft on his own.

The mills in North Carolina exist because textile capital migrated from the Northeast in pursuit of low wages, no unions, and cheaper materials. Does it follow that \\"All of the mills in the Northeast shut down and moved to North Carolina.\\"?","output":"It does not directly follow that \\"All of the mills in the Northeast shut down and moved to North Carolina,\\" as the statement is an oversimplification of a more complex historical, economic, and social phenomenon. While it is true that many mills in the Northeast did shut down or relocate to states like North Carolina due to the reasons mentioned, it is important to note that the process was not uniform, and some mills continued to operate in the Northeast for a variety of reasons. There were several factors that contributed to the shift of textile mills from the Northeast to states like North Carolina. As the statement suggests, one major factor was the pursuit of lower wages. Workers in the Northeast, who were often represented by labor unions, demanded higher wages and better working conditions. In contrast, states in the South, particularly North Carolina, had a large supply of workers who were willing to work for lower wages and were not a part of strong union movements. This made it more cost-effective for mill owners to operate in the South. Another factor contributing to the shift was the availability of raw materials, particularly cotton and other fibers, which were more abundant and less expensive in southern states. Moreover, the South's generally milder climate and widespread use of hydroelectric power also played a role in driving down operating costs for the mills.  However, it is worth noting that not all mills in the Northeast shut down and moved to North Carolina, or the South in general. Some mills continued to operate due to various factors, such as population density and demand in the Northeast region, diversified product lines that gave them a competitive advantage, or the desire to maintain a family business in their traditional location. Additionally, over time, many of the factors that originally drove mills to North Carolina lessened in impact: international competition, modernization of facilities, and some regional convergence of wages further changed the landscape of the textile industry. In conclusion, the statement that \\"All of the mills in the Northeast shut down and moved to North Carolina,\\" is not entirely accurate. While many mills did indeed relocate or shut down due to the factors mentioned, it is important to recognize that the process was not uniform and some mills did continue to operate in the Northeast. The textile industry's migration from the Northeast to North Carolina, and the South more broadly, is better understood as a multifaceted process influenced by a combination of economic, social, and historical factors, and not as a simple, all-encompassing phenomenon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia? , can you please find it?   Nielsen is perhaps most closely associated outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In Symphony No. 2 (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).The title of Symphony No. 3, Sinfonia Espansiva (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the \\"outward growth of the mind's scope\\". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. Symphony No. 4, The Inextinguishable (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of timpani are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as \\"the life force, the unquenchable will to live\\".Also frequently performed is the Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In Symphony No. 6 (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony...","output":"The full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia, is Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921-22).

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters.

Question: Who acted as protector to Martin Luther when he was under the ban of the Empire? Answer: The immediate provocation spurring this act was Pope Leo X’s renewal of the indulgence for the building of the new St. Peter's Basilica in 1514.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: No, the given response does not answer the question about who acted as a protector to Martin Luther when he was under the ban of the Empire. The correct answer is Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, also known as Frederick the Wise. Frederick the Wise, who ruled Saxony from 1486 until his death in 1525, was a key political and religious figure in the early years of the Protestant Reformation. He played a significant role in protecting and supporting the German monk and theologian Martin Luther, who was one of the foremost leaders of the Reformation. When Martin Luther displayed his opposition to the Catholic Church's sale of indulgences and numerous other contentious practices, the church resorted to its conventional methods for silencing critics by excommunicating and threatening him with further punishment, including potential death. Pope Leo X excommunicated Luther in 1521, and Luther was soon after declared an \\"outlaw\\" by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V during the Diet of Worms. This essentially meant that anyone could kill Luther without suffering legal consequences, and it urged the political authorities to capture and hand him over to the emperor. In such a precarious situation, Frederick the Wise provided an essential safeguard for Luther. Upon Luther's departure from Worms, Frederick arranged for his abduction and subsequent safekeeping at the Wartburg Castle in Eisenach. Out of public sight and under the alias of Knight George, Luther had the time and security to work on his writings, including his famous translation of the New Testament into German. Frederick the Wise continued to offer protection and support to Luther even as the Reformation took hold in Saxony, creating friction between the regional powers and the Catholic Church. Frederick may not have been a fervent supporter of religious reform, but his principled protection of Martin Luther and his efforts to establish political stability certainly facilitated the growth and maturation of the Protestant Reformation in Germany. Without Frederick III acting as a protector, it is uncertain whether Luther, his ideas, and the Reformation would have thrived as they did."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Banat tries unsuccessfully to kill Graham during a magic act, shooting the magician instead. Graham is brought to the headquarters of the Turkish secret police for questioning, where Colonel Haki blames the assassination attempt on German agents seeking to delay the re-arming of Turkish ships. The colonel shows Graham a photograph of Banat, who he says was hired by a Nazi agent named Muller.

Authorities were working on plans Friday for residents who were forced to flee a wildfire in northern Texas to return home, a day after firefighters made progress battling the blaze that destroyed dozens of homes. The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. \\"We feel much better about this fire today,\\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer. Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire. \\"My house is right through here, though it may be gone,\\" Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire. Nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire. \\"I'm just moving them from pasture to pasture,\\" Cindi McCoy told WFAA, referring to her livestock. \\"As one pasture burns, I'm moving them back to that one and bring(ing) them back around.\\" The weather forecast continued to predict mostly dry weather for the area for Friday, with high temperatures from the mid-90s into the 100s, the Forest Service said. Texas is experiencing the worst fire season in state history. Since fire season began last November, a record 3.5 million acres have burned. Hot and dry weather combined with a historic drought have made conditions ripe for rapid fire growth. In the past seven days, the Forest Service has responded to 224 fires burning a combined 31,541 acres.

The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the  Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up  Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on  Bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to  Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel  Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained. Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib. The United States never obtained this access. An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \\"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the  Bin Laden family.\\" One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What action does Serena, despite considering Rachel and Jacob a threat, remain unaware of? ?  In Depression-era North Carolina, George Pemberton is an ambitious timber baron who meets Serena Shaw, a young woman with a sad past. He falls in love with her, they marry, and Serena comes with George to his land. There, she starts taking control of things, pressuring and questioning George, while remaining affectionate towards him. George's business partner Buchanan feels threatened by her, as she begins to exceed his authority. Things grow worse between George and Buchanan, and Buchanan strikes a deal with the local sheriff, who wants to buy George's land to make a park. George is hurt by Buchanan's betrayal, and Serena convinces George that Buchanan was never his friend. The next day, they both go shooting alone from the group attempting to flush out a bear. After some snide remarks from Buchanan, George contemplates killing him only to hesitate and be seen by Buchanan. As Buchanan cocks his rifle, George fires first and shoots him in the chest. Campbell, George's worker, witnesses the murder, but denies it when Sheriff McDowell inquires. The death is ruled an accident. Serena consoles George and justifies his actions. One day, he sees his illegitimate son, Jacob, posing with his mother, Rachel, for a picture. He feels responsible for the boy, and since Rachel never asked for anything, he begins giving sums of money in envelopes to her for Jacob. Serena remains unaware of this, though she does consider Rachel and the baby a threat. One day, an accident occurs in the forest and Galloway, a mysterious worker, loses his hand to an axe swing. Serena rushes to help him and uses a belt as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding which saves his life. Having problems with her pregnancy, Serena and George rush to the hospital after Serena experiences heavy bleeding and pain. She miscarries. They learn that she can never again bear children. Things continue to grow worse, and Rachel's baby becomes more obvious to Serena.

Answer the question When two objects are touching, heat is transferred from the warmer object to the cooler one by","output":"When two objects are touching, heat is transferred from the warmer object to the cooler one through a process called conduction. Conduction is the transfer of heat within or between solid objects that are in direct contact with one another. The process occurs due to the collisions between rapidly moving particles and slower moving particles, resulting in the exchange of energy. In any material, the microscopic particles—atoms, molecules, and ions—are in constant motion. As these particles move, they possess kinetic energy. In warmer objects, the particles have more kinetic energy and vibrate at higher speeds. When two objects with different temperatures come into contact, the faster-moving particles of the warmer object collide with the slower-moving particles of the cooler object. As the particles collide, energy is transferred from the higher-energy particles to the lower-energy ones, causing the cooler object's particles to vibrate faster and gain kinetic energy. This leads to a rise in the cooler object's temperature. The transfer of heat through conduction continues until both objects reach thermal equilibrium, meaning that their temperatures become equal. At this point, the net flow of heat energy between the objects ceases, as the rates of energy transfer between them become equal and opposite. The efficiency of heat transfer through conduction depends on several factors: 1. Material properties: The thermal conductivity of the materials involved plays a significant role in determining the rate of heat transfer. Thermal conductivity measures a material's ability to conduct heat. Some materials, like metals, have high thermal conductivity, which means they readily transfer heat. In contrast, insulators, such as wood or plastics, have low thermal conductivity and slow down the transfer of heat. 2. Surface area: The amount of surface area that is in contact between the two objects also affects the rate of conduction. The larger the area of contact, the more particles are available to collide and transfer their energy. This results in a higher rate of heat transfer between the objects. 3. Temperature difference: The greater the difference in temperature between the two objects, the faster heat will be transferred through conduction. This is because the energy difference between the particles in the warmer object and the cooler object will be larger, leading to more effective collisions and energy exchange. 4. Thickness of the material: The thickness of the material also affects the rate of heat transfer. Thicker materials or objects take longer to heat up or cool down, as the heat must travel a greater distance through the material. In summary, when two objects are touching, heat is transferred from the warmer object to the cooler one by conduction. This involves the transfer of kinetic energy from the rapidly moving particles in the warmer object to the slower moving particles in the cooler object, leading to an increase in temperature for the cooler object. The process continues until thermal equilibrium is reached, at which point the net flow of heat between the objects ceases. Factors such as material properties, surface area, temperature difference, and thickness of the materials influence the efficiency of heat transfer through conduction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gunpowder consists of three primary ingredients: sulfur, saltpetre (potassium nitrate), and a form of carbon. Traditionally, the carbon source added to sulfur and saltpetre to make gunpowder is charcoal. Charcoal is produced by heating wood or other organic materials in the absence of oxygen, a process called pyrolysis. It mainly consists of elemental carbon, along with small amounts of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements. Charcoal is preferred as the source of carbon in the production of gunpowder because of its porous nature and the advantage it provides as a reliable and efficient fuel for combustion. When combined in appropriate proportions, the three ingredients create a powerful exothermic reaction when ignited. The general ratio of the components in gunpowder is 75% potassium nitrate, 15% charcoal, and 10% sulfur by weight. The potassium nitrate, or saltpetre, acts as an oxidizer, supplying oxygen to support the combustion process. Sulfur serves as a fuel that burns at a low temperature, thereby reducing the ignition temperature and making the mixture more easily ignitable. Finally, charcoal acts as the main fuel component, readily burning in the presence of oxygen supplied by the potassium nitrate and quickly releasing energy in the form of heat and gas. Once ignited, the rapid production of heat and gas generates a significant amount of pressure in a confined space, which can be harnessed to propel projectiles in firearms or create explosive effects for pyrotechnics or mining activities. While modern propellants and explosives have largely replaced traditional gunpowder due to their higher efficiency, increased stability, and reduced smoke production, the significance of gunpowder in shaping human history as an essential component of warfare, mining, and entertainment cannot be understated."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Title: Behind the mask Review: As the author relates his work in the CIA from the early seventies when the American people started challenging our government's role in world politics, to today's even more chaotic world, he's revealed an agency frought with ineptitude and inefficiency. As one of the grunts on the ground, working clandestinely, he's watched in alarm as the effectiveness of the agency has gone from a stellar one gathering behind the scenes information to being a hand-tied-behind-their-backs (dis)organization. It's a fascinating read through the eyes and ears of one who's worked some of the most dangerous parts of the world. Is this product review negative? Choices: + Yes. + No. Answer:","output":"No, this product review is not negative. Despite describing some challenges and deteriorations in the CIA over time, the reviewer does not express a negative opinion about the product in question, which appears to be a book. The reviewer finds the book to be \\"fascinating\\" and values the author's insider perspective from \\"one of the grunts on the ground\\" and his experience from \\"some of the most dangerous parts of the world.\\" The reviewer may express a negative view of the CIA's progress over the time, pointing out the agency's transition from an efficient intelligence gathering entity to an inept and inefficient organization. However, such criticism related to the contents of the book does not straightly translate to a negative review of the book itself. In fact, this critique may well be part of the reviewer's fascination with the book, as they offer readers a unique, critical insight into the CIA. The areas of ineptitude and inefficiency highlighted by the author might have possibly made the account more engaging and insightful for the reader. The review, thus, does not focus on negative aspects of the book's writing style, structure, or the way it delivers the content, which are classic ways to negatively review a book. Summary executions of the book's protagonists or negative depictions of persons or situations would also be areas where one might look for negativity, but these are not present. Instead, the content seems to offer exactly what a reader could be seeking— an insider's view to the state of affairs within the CIA and its course over time and amidst changing political landscapes. This rarity of viewpoint might be what prompts the reviewer to describe the book as a 'fascinating read.' Therefore, it's safe to conclude that the review in question is not negative in terms of the product (book)."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:Information:  - Exmoor is loosely defined as an area of hilly open moorland in west Somerset and north Devon in South West England. It is named after the River Exe, the source of which is situated in the centre of the area, two miles north-west of Simonsbath. Exmoor is more precisely defined as the area of the former ancient royal hunting forest, also called Exmoor, which was officially surveyed 18151818 as in extent. The moor has given its name to a National Park, which includes the Brendon Hills, the East Lyn Valley, the Vale of Porlock and of the Bristol Channel coast. The total area of the Exmoor National Park is , of which 71% is in Somerset and 29% in Devon.  - Minehead is a coastal town and civil parish in Somerset, England. It lies on the south bank of the Bristol Channel, north-west of the county town of Taunton, from the border with the county of Devon and in proximity of the Exmoor National Park. The parish of Minehead has a population of approximately 11,981 making it the most populous town in the West Somerset local government district. This figure includes Alcombe and Woodcombe, suburban villages which have been subsumed into Minehead.  - Rolling is a type of motion that combines rotation (commonly, of an axially symmetric object) and translation of that object with respect to a surface (either one or the other moves), such that, if ideal conditions exist, the two are in contact with each other without sliding.  - The Norman conquest of England was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman, Breton, and French soldiers led by Duke William II of Normandy, later styled as William the Conqueror.  - Gloucestershire (; abbreviated Glos.) is a county in South West England. The county comprises part of the Cotswold Hills, part of the flat fertile valley of the River Severn, and the entire Forest of Dean.  - Dunster is a village, civil parish and former manor within the English county of Somerset, today just within the north-eastern boundary of the Exmoor National Park. It lies on the Bristol Channel coast south-southeast of Minehead and northwest of Taunton. The United Kingdom Census of 2011 recorded a parish population of 817.  - Taunton is the county town of Somerset, England. The built up area of the town had a population of 64,621 in 2011.  - Dorset (or archaically, Dorsetshire) is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast. The ceremonial county comprises the non-metropolitan county, which is governed by Dorset County Council, and the unitary authority areas of Poole and Bournemouth. Covering an area of , Dorset borders Devon to the west, Somerset to the north-west, Wiltshire to the north-east, and Hampshire to the east. The county town is Dorchester which is in the south. After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch. Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation, while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density.  - A hammermill is a mill whose purpose is to shred or crush aggregate material into smaller pieces by the repeated blows of little hammers. These machines have many sorts of applications in many industries, including:  - A turbine (from the Latin \\"turbo\\", a vortex, related to the Greek , \\"tyrb\\", meaning \\"turbulence\\") is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator or producing thrust, as in the case of jet engines. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.  - The Anarchy was a civil war in England and Normandy between 1135 and 1154, which resulted in a widespread breakdown in law and order. The conflict was a succession crisis precipitated by the accidental death of William Adelin, the only legitimate son of Henry I, in 1120. Henry's attempts to install his daughter, the Empress Matilda, as his successor were unsuccessful and on Henry's death in 1135, his nephew Stephen of Blois seized the throne with the help of another nephew, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester. Stephen's early reign was marked by fierce fighting with English barons, rebellious Welsh leaders and Scottish invaders. Following a major rebellion in the south-west of England, Matilda invaded in 1139 with the help of her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester.  - Dunster Working Watermill ( also known as Castle Mill ) is a restored 18th century watermill , situated on the River Avill , close to Gallox Bridge , in the grounds of Dunster Castle in Dunster , Somerset , England . It is a Grade II * listed building . The mill stands on a site where a mill was first recorded in the Domesday Book , but the present building was constructed around 1780 . It closed in 1962 but was restored in 1979 and is still used to grind flour . The equipment is powered by two overshot wheels . It is owned by the National Trust but operated as a tourist attraction by a private company .  - Somerset is a county in South West England which borders Gloucestershire and Bristol to the north, Wiltshire to the east, Dorset to the south-east and Devon to the south-west. It is bounded to the north and west by the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel, its coastline facing southeastern Wales. Its traditional border with Gloucestershire is the River Avon. Somerset's county town is Taunton.  - A shell keep is a style of medieval fortification, best described as a stone structure circling the top of a motte.  - Dunster Castle is a former motte and bailey castle, now a country house, in the village of Dunster, Somerset, England. The castle lies on the top of a steep hill called the Tor, and has been fortified since the late Anglo-Saxon period. After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset. A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege during the early years of the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century.  - A textile or cloth is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibres (yarn or thread). Yarn is produced by spinning raw fibres of wool, flax, cotton, or other material to produce long strands. Textiles are formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, or felting.  - A sawmill or lumber mill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber. Prior to the invention of the sawmill, boards were rived (split) and planed, or more often sawn by two men with a whipsaw, one above and another in a saw pit below. The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill, a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis, Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD. Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and in the next few centuries, spread across Europe. The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade. Generally, only the saw was powered, and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to move the log steadily through the saw blade.  - A hammer is a tool or device that delivers a blow (a sudden impact) to an object. Most hammers are hand tools used to drive nails, fit parts, forge metal, and break apart objects. Hammers vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes.  - Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains or roots and used to make many different foods. Cereal flour is the main ingredient of bread, which is a staple food for many cultures, making the availability of adequate supplies of flour a major economic and political issue at various times throughout history. Wheat flour is one of the most important ingredients in Oceanic, European, South American, North American, Middle Eastern, North Indian and North African cultures, and is the defining ingredient in their styles of breads and pastries.  - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.  - Bristol is a city, unitary authority area and county in South West England with an estimated population of 449,300 in 2016. It is England's sixth and the United Kingdom's eighth most populous city, and the most populous city in Southern England after London. The city borders the Unitary Authority areas of North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the historic cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively.  - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east. The City of Exeter is the county town; seven other districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, and West Devon are under the jurisdiction of Devon County Council; Plymouth and Torbay are each a part of Devon but administered as unitary authorities. Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is and its population is about 1.1 million.  - South West England is one of nine official regions of England. It is the largest in area, covering and the counties of Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, as well as the Isles of Scilly. Five million people live in South West England.  - A metal (from Greek  \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable  that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking  as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals, the others are nonmetals or metalloids. Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms.  - A paper mill is a factory devoted to making paper from vegetable fibres such as wood pulp, old rags and other ingredients using a Fourdrinier machine or other type of paper machine.  - The Severn Estuary is the estuary of the River Severn, the longest river in Great Britain. It is at the mouth of four major rivers, being the Severn, Wye, Usk and Avon, and other smaller rivers. Its high tidal range of about means that it has been at the centre of discussions in the UK regarding renewable energy.  - The River Avill is a small river on Exmoor in Somerset, England.  - A water turbine is a rotary machine that converts kinetic energy and potential energy of water into mechanical work.  - Wiltshire (or ) is a county in South West England with an area of . It is landlocked and borders the counties of Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The county town was Wilton but Wiltshire Council is now based in the new county town of Trowbridge.  - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England. It extends from the lower estuary of the River Severn to the North Atlantic Ocean. It takes its name from the English city of Bristol, and is over 30 miles (50 km) across at its widest point.  - A water wheel is a machine for converting the energy of free-flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill. A water wheel consists of a large wooden or metal wheel, with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface. Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but the tub or Norse wheel is mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft. Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load.  - A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses moving water as its power source. It is thus a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. Thus watermills may be gristmills, sawmills, paper mills, textile mills, hammermills, trip hammering mills, rolling mills, wire drawing mills, and so on.  - Lumber (American English; used only in North America), or timber (used in the rest of the English speaking world) is wood that has been processed into beams and planks, a stage in the process of wood production. Lumber may also refer to currently un-needed furniture, as in Lumber room, or an awkward gait, ultimately derived from the look of unfashionable and unwanted furniture.  - A wheel is a circular component that is intended to rotate on an axle bearing. The wheel is one of the main components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines. Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines. Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a ship's wheel, steering wheel, potter's wheel and flywheel.  - Wire drawing is a metalworking process used to reduce the cross-section of a wire by pulling the wire through a single, or series of, drawing die(s). There are many applications for wire drawing, including electrical wiring, cables, tension-loaded structural components, springs, paper clips, spokes for wheels, and stringed musical instruments. Although similar in process, drawing is different from extrusion, because in drawing the wire is pulled, rather than pushed, through the die. Drawing is usually performed at room temperature, thus classified as a cold working process, but it may be performed at elevated temperatures for large wires to reduce forces.  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - Paper is a thin material produced by pressing together moist fibres of cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags or grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets. It is a versatile material with many uses, including writing, printing, packaging, cleaning, and a number of industrial and construction processes.

The clay was sourced from the local riverbank, where the villagers believed it to have the perfect consistency for pottery making. Step 2: Knead the clay I began by kneading the clay to remove any air bubbles and achieve a uniform texture. This would ensure a smooth, balance, and strong wheel. It was important for the clay to be moist enough to work with but not too wet, which would cause cracking upon drying. Step 3: Shape the clay into a wheel Once the clay was prepared, I proceeded to shape it into a thick, round disc. I used the palms of my hands to flatten the clay while keeping it uniformly thick, checking for any cracks and ensuring that the edges were smooth and even. Step 4: Cut out the center I carefully measured and marked the center of the clay disc. Using a sharp-edged tool, I gently cut out the middle portion to create a hole for the wheel's axle, making sure the hole was large enough to accommodate the axle without compromising the wheel's structural integrity. Step 5: Refine the shape After cutting the center, I continued to refine the wheel's shape by smoothing out the edges, flattening any irregularities, and ensuring that the sides were as even as possible. This would ensure that the wheel would roll smoothly and reliably while in use. Step 6: Allow the wheel to dry Once I was satisfied with the shape, I placed the wheel in a dry, well-ventilated area to allow the water to evaporate from the clay. This process would take several days, and it was crucial to ensure the wheel was fully dried to prevent cracking while in use. Step 7: Firing the wheel When the wheel was dry, it was time for firing. This process would harden and solidify the clay, making it even more durable and long-lasting. The villagers had built a traditional wood-burning kiln where the wheel could be fired at a high temperature. Once the kiln reached the desired temperature, I carefully placed the wheel inside and let it fire for the appropriate amount of time, monitoring the temperature to ensure the wheel was properly fired. Step 8: Cool and inspect the wheel After the firing process was complete, I allowed the wheel to cool down gradually. Once it was cool enough to handle, I inspected the wheel for any cracks or imperfections caused during the firing process. To my satisfaction, the wheel turned out strong, smooth, and free from any defects. Step 9: Installing the wheel Finally, I brought the wheel back to the villagers, who celebrated its completion with much joy. The wheel was then installed onto the axle of a cart, and the villagers marveled at how smoothly and efficiently the new, handmade wheel performed. The age-old tradition of wheel-making was preserved, and the villagers were proud to continue this craft which had been passed down through generations. They recognized that their wheel-making skills, honed and perfected over time, were an integral part of their identity and a testament to the human spirit of innovation and adaptation. With every wheel crafted and every cart put to use, the villagers knew that they were keeping their ancestor's legacy alive."},{"instruction":"Q:For convenience some customers want things straight to the doorstep and use what?

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"If less gases remain trapped in the atmosphere, it will directly affect the greenhouse effect by reducing its intensity. The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap heat and energy in the Earth's atmosphere. This leads to an increase in global temperatures, causing climate change and other environmental impacts. In the scenario where fewer greenhouse gases are trapped in the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect will be lessened, which means that less heat and energy will be retained in the atmosphere. This could potentially lead to a decrease in global temperatures, thus counteracting or mitigating some of the negative consequences associated with climate change. In this case, the perturbation is directly impacting a step of the process, as it influences the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and affects the primary mechanism through which the greenhouse effect occurs. By reducing the amount of greenhouse gases that are trapped in the atmosphere, the process of heat and energy retention is directly altered, impacting the overall intensity of the greenhouse effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Gory 'NeverDead' is one ridiculous romp After spending a few days playing Konami's \\"NeverDead,\\" I couldn't help but think video game makers are running out of ideas — or at least good ones. That's because the protagonist in this aptly-named game is an immortal demon hunter with a unique ability: He can be ripped apart and then must hop or roll around to reattach his body again. In fact, his rolling head can be used to solve puzzles, such as squeezing into tight spaces, before rejoining his torso and limbs when the job is done. Not only is this over-the-top Japanese-made adventure just ridiculous, the execution — if you can pardon the pun — is as faulty as the premise. The convoluted story starts 500 years ago when our hero Bryce Boltzmann is cursed with immortality by a bizarre demon king named Astaroth. Fast-forward to today and Boltzmann is a bitter mercenary-for-hire, who has watched his loved ones die for centuries. He exacts revenge by hunting demons — and makes some serious cash on the side, too. Boltzmann fights alongside a sexy female fighter, Arcadia — a mortal who can succumb to her injuries. Using a number of weapons including automatic machine guns and a katana sword, this third-person game has you shooting and slashing increasingly weird demons, solving a few environmental puzzles and unlocking new areas to continue the fight. Not only is Boltzmann unable to die, he can still survive without his head — er, unless it's eaten. While clearly campy, this game mechanic doesn't work well because just as you're frantically trying to regroup your body parts you're torn apart again by the vicious demons. This makes for a frustrating experience. It's too bad, because the swordplay can be quite fun at times. The right analog stick on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 controller moves your blade through the sharp-toothed enemies approaching you from all sides. The camera angles are also an issue as you can't always see your character clearly, or the body parts you need to find. Plus, the game tends to slow down when there's a lot of action onscreen at the same time. Boss fights are also problematic as many regain their health before you can finish them off. At times you won't know where to go next, unless Arcadia stares at a door and waits for you to figure it out; you're supposed to press down on the game controller's d-pad to get a hint on where to go next, but this only works about a quarter of the time. The indoor and outdoor environments are repetitive and unimaginatively designed. As you can see, there are some issues with the game, which offers both a single-player campaign and online options for both cooperative (co-op) and head-to-head play (again, pardon the pun). On one hand, the bloody and gory \\"NeverDead\\" is certainly unique thanks to its body dismemberment feature, but its numerous shortcomings — which could've been addressed with more time and polish — mean it's not worth your time or money. If you're intrigued by its silly premise and want to give it a spin, rent it for the weekend or wait until the game ends up in the bargain bin. It won't be long. Platform: Microsoft Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3 Score: 2.0 stars (out of 4)","output":"\\"NeverDead\\" is a video game with a funny story about an immortal demon hunter who can be ripped apart and then put himself back together again.

This topic examines whether zoos, as institutions that hold and display animals for public viewing, are morally defensible considering the negative impact they have on the physical and psychological well-being of the animals they house. The debate typically revolves around weighing the various pros and cons of zoos, including their potential educational, conservation, and research benefits against the issues of animal welfare and ethics. The sentences provided emphasize the concerns related to animal welfare in zoos: 1. The good intentions of zookeepers may not outweigh the suffering experienced by animals in zoos. 2. Animals in zoos are confined to small spaces and separated from the public by cages and bars, which may impact their natural behaviors and well-being. 3. Enclosures for large mammals like elephants are significantly smaller than their natural habitats, leading to restricted movement and unnatural living conditions. 4. Polar bears in zoos are confined to spaces that are a fraction of their natural territories in the Arctic, which poses issues for their natural behaviors and well-being. 5. Due to unnatural conditions and confinement, animals in zoos may suffer psychological distress, often displayed by abnormal or self-destructive behavior. 6. Aquatic animals may have insufficient water in their enclosures, and birds are prevented from flying by having their wings clipped and being confined to aviaries, suppressing their natural instincts and behaviors. 7. The urban locations of zoos can pose additional threats to the animals, such as predator attacks on zoo inhabitants (e.g., the fox attack at London Zoo in 2010 that killed several penguins). The debate on zoos raises questions about our responsibility towards animals, the necessity and effectiveness of zoos' conservation and education efforts, and whether the captivity of these creatures is justified in light of the physical and psychological distress they may experience. Those in favor of zoos argue for their importance in wildlife conservation, species preservation, and public education, while opponents emphasize the inherent cruelty and ethical dilemmas associated with confining animals and disrupting their natural lives for our benefit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam.

Step 1: Identify the language of the text The text is indeed in Spanish. This is clear from recognizing common Spanish words and the grammatical structure of the sentences. Step 2: Determine the percentage of people who can read Spanish According to Ethnologue, there are approximately 460 million native Spanish speakers in the world, with additional people who speak it as a second or foreign language. The global population is approximately 7.8 billion. Step 3: Calculate the percentage of people who can read Spanish Assuming that only native Spanish speakers can read Spanish (which is not accurate, as there are also non-native speakers who can read it), we can create a rough estimation: (460 million / 7.8 billion) * 100 = 5.9%. This means that approximately 5.9% of the world's population are native Spanish speakers and would likely be able to read the text. Step 4: Determine the percentage of people who can't read Spanish Since the percentage of people who can read Spanish is estimated to be around 5.9%, the percentage who can't read Spanish would be the remaining proportion: 100% - 5.9% = 94.1% Conclusion: It is not accurate to say that \\"99% of people can't read this since it's in Spanish\\".

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what kind of plant would shed its leaves each year?\\" is \\"grapevines\\", given that  grapevines shed their leaves seasonally each year? Possible answers:  (a). Yes;  (b). No; Answer:","output":"(a). Yes, I believe grapevines can indeed be considered an appropriate answer to the question \\"what kind of plant would shed its leaves each year?\\" as they are known to shed their leaves seasonally. Grapevines (Vitis spp.) are deciduous plants, which means they shed their leaves annually, usually during the autumn months. This seasonal leaf shedding is a natural part of the plant's life cycle as it prepares for dormancy during the winter. In response to changes in temperature, day length, and other environmental factors, grapevines experience physiological and biochemical changes that lead to leaf senescence and eventual leaf drop. The process of leaf shedding in grapevines occurs as follows: 1. As daylight hours decrease, chlorophyll production slows, causing leaves to change color from green to hues of yellow, orange, or red. 2. As leaves lose their chlorophyll, they become less capable of producing food for the plant through photosynthesis, eventually leading to leaf senescence. 3. During senescence, nutrients from the leaves are transported back into the main plant body to be stored and later used during the next growing season. 4. Abscission, the process of shedding leaves, occurs as a weakened abscission zone forms at the base of the petiole (the leaf stalk), which eventually causes the leaf to detach from the plant. While grapevines are not the only plants to undergo this process, they are an example of the type of plant that does. Deciduous plants, such as grapevines, shed their leaves annually as part of their life cycle, allowing them to conserve resources and tolerate harsh environmental conditions during winter. As such, grapevines are indeed an example of a plant that would shed its leaves each year, making \\"grapevines\\" the correct answer to the given question."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Portuguese Restoration War  was the name given by nineteenth-century Romantic historians to the war between Portugal and Spain that began with the Portuguese revolution of 1640 and ended with the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668. The revolution of 1640 ended the 60-year Iberian Union. The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare, much of it occasioned by Spanish and Portuguese entanglements with non-Iberian powers. Spain was involved in the Thirty Years' War until 1648 and the Franco-Spanish War until 1659, while Portugal was involved in the Dutch-Portuguese War until 1663. In the seventeenth century and afterwards, this period of sporadic conflict was simply known, in Portugal and elsewhere, as the Acclamation War.

Please answer the following question: Justin Nelson, Jr., pounded the last of the stakes of his new cattle pen into the dry dirt. Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece. With a sigh escaping from the bellows of his withering chest, Justin shuffled back to the porch he had added onto his small two-room home. In the distance, a plume of dust was billowing off the road.

So, the first step is to have a clear understanding of this concept. Part #2: Analyzing the provided sentence. Usage: You should read and understand the given sentence. In this instance, the sentence is about differing interpretations of membership policies.  Part #3: Determining whether the sentence is overruling or non-overruling. Usage: Once you understand the sentence, you need to identify whether it is overruling or non-overruling. In this case, the sentence refers to a debate concerning the rules of membership - it has nothing to do with overriding prior law or legal precedent. Thus, it would be classified as non-overruling. This meets the criteria because it's not talking about a newer law or decision that nullifies a previous case or decision. Part #4: Classifying the sentence.

One in three drivers is so clueless when it comes to road signs that they cannot even recognise the symbol for the national speed limit, a survey claims. A quarter of us are also unaware that blue motorway signs also explain the speed limit, while one in seven motorists mistakenly thought that 'slippery road' warning sign meant that the road had been freshly painted. Eight per cent of drivers admitted they were baffled by the common 'road narrowing' sign, while almost a fifth said they did not know that when driving in a built-up area the speed limit is 30mph unless signs say otherwise. The scale of ignorance was revealed in a survey of 2,000 drivers by car insurers More Than. The results also found that a 'worrying' proportion of drivers regularly ignore speed limits and drive as fast as they want to. More than a third (36 per cent) said they disregard 30mph limits, travelling at an avergae of 38mph, while 32 per cent said they break 47mph limits, going 47mph on average instead. On motorways, even more people admitted to ignoring the law, with 43 per cent breaking the 70mph in favour of an average speed of 81mph.

He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is endangered when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death-threatening postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected.Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill lurks around Kahane's home and is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi), whom he watches while talking to her on the phone, that Kahane is at a showing of 'The Bicycle Thief'. Mill goes to the theater, pretending to recognize Kahane in the lobby after the film, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar and have some drinks. Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mills offer; he calls Mill a liar, pointing out that he knows Mill didn't really go to the theater to see 'The Bicycle Thief' because Kahane saw Mill wander in late and only catch the last five minutes of it, and denies responsibility for sending Mill the postcards. Kahane continues goading Mill about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot the two men fight. Mill loses his balance and falls, and feeling threatened, kills Kahane, then makes the death look like a robbery gone wrong.The next day, Mill receives another postcard. Mill attends Kahanes funeral and gets along with June; she knows none of the other mourners. Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts Mill about the murder and says that the police know Mill was the last one to see Kahane alive.

Question: youtube is a? Context: Both private individuals and large production companies have used YouTube to grow audiences. Independent content creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort, while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic. Concurrently, old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings, and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television. While YouTube's revenue-sharing \\"Partner Program\\" made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than 100,000 annually and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from 2.5 million to 12 million—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as \\"a free-to-use... promotional platform for the music labels\\". In 2013 Forbes' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media. In 2013, videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as \\"mega\\", \\"mainstream\\" and \\"mid-sized\\" received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel? , can you please find it?   Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling... The answer is:","output":"The first name of the person is not provided in the given text.

For that, he chose two objects, both made of the same element - object A and object B. Object A has a larger surface area, but object B has smaller surface area. He let these objects to react with other reactants to see how the processes work.  But I can use this background: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster.  What is an answer for this question: Would object A be more or less exposed to the reactants than object B?","output":"Based on the provided background information, it is clear that the surface area of a solid object plays a significant role in determining how effectively it can react with other elements because only the matter at the surface of the solid can interact with the reactants. In the situation you mentioned, John has chosen two objects, object A and object B. Both of these objects are made of the same element, but object A has a larger surface area, while object B has a smaller surface area. Consequently, the reaction rate of these two solid objects should be directly influenced by the differences in their surface areas.  In line with this understanding, object A would be more exposed to the reactants than object B, as its larger surface area allows it to have more contact points available for interaction with the surrounding reactants. This increased exposure would consequently result in a higher reaction rate for object A than for object B, given the identical nature of the elements they are made of.  An analogy to this concept can be seen in the example of the hammer and nails. Both the hammer and nails are made of iron, but the nails have a larger surface area relative to their volume, which exposes more of their material to the surrounding oxygen and consequently accelerates the rusting process compared to the hammer. Similarly, the increased surface area of object A exposes more of its material to the reactants surrounding it, facilitating a faster reaction process than the reaction involving object B. In conclusion, object A will be more exposed to the reactants than object B as it has a larger surface area, which increases the number of contact points available for interaction with other elements. This, in turn, results in object A potentially experiencing a higher reaction rate compared to object B, assuming all other factors remain constant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Robert Wilson \\"Robb\\" Royer (born December 6, 1942 in Los Angeles, California) is an American musician and songwriter, best known as a founding member of Bread from 1968 to 1971. While he was with the band, they had a #5 UK/#1 US hit single with \\"Make It With You\\". He was replaced by Larry Knechtel in 1971. Context: In 1982 Royer wrote the song \\"Quittin' Time\\" (co-written with Roger Linn) which eight years later was recorded by Mary Chapin Carpenter and won an ASCAP Airplay award. Royer traveled to Nashville to receive the award and stayed with Griffin, who had previously relocated from L.A. to Nashville. Larry Knechtel had also been living and working as a session musician in Nashville. Royer relocated to Nashville in 1994.  Todd Cerney was already a grammy-nominated songwriter when Royer met him in 1994 at Jim Della Croce's house. Cerney had written two top-forty songs (Loverboy's \\"Notorious\\" and Restless Heart's \\"I'll Still Be Loving You,\\" which reached number one on the Country charts). Cerney had established a private recording studio in his home where he engineered a number of other singer-songwriters' albums.  Griffin, Royer and Cerney first collaborated by co-writing the song \\"Kyrie\\" in 1994. Knechtel later joined the trio and together they performed and co-wrote songs (including the 1995 song \\"Slow Train\\") under the band name \\"Toast\\". Toast performed at various Nashville venues including the Bluebird, Third and Lindsley, and 12th & Porter. They wrote and performed their own songs including such titles as \\"Road Kill,\\" \\"Knechtelodeon,\\" \\"No More Smokin',\\" \\"Grenadine,\\" \\"Magdelena,\\" and \\"Radio Dixie.\\" The group used session drummers for their recordings and performances. The group would later be known as Radio Dixie in 1998. The name change was intended to help with promotion of the group, but the group disbanded by the end of 1998. Royer and Cerney continued to write together, generating additional titles including \\"Hurtin' Cowboy,\\" \\"New Orleans Prayer,\\" \\"I Believe I Kissed an Angel,\\" and \\"Beside Myself.\\" Question: did they produce any music?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, the group consisting of Robb Royer, Todd Cerney, Larry Knechtel, and Griffin produced music together under the band names \\"Toast\\" and later \\"Radio Dixie.\\" During their time as a band, they collaborated to write and perform several songs, including \\"Kyrie,\\" \\"Slow Train,\\" \\"Road Kill,\\" \\"Knechtelodeon,\\" \\"No More Smokin',\\" \\"Grenadine,\\" \\"Magdelena,\\" and \\"Radio Dixie.\\" The group used session drummers for their recordings and live performances. Although they primarily performed at local Nashville venues such as the Bluebird, Third and Lindsley, and 12th & Porter, the group managed to make an impact on the local music scene. When the group changed their name to Radio Dixie in 1998, they intended to promote their music more substantially. However, the group dissolved by the end of 1998. Even after the group disbanded, Royer and Cerney continued to collaborate on songwriting, producing additional titles such as \\"Hurtin' Cowboy,\\" \\"New Orleans Prayer,\\" \\"I Believe I Kissed an Angel,\\" and \\"Beside Myself.\\" Through their various band formations and collaborative songwriting, they contributed significantly to the musical landscape of their time in Nashville."},{"instruction":"Alex took up Ash's position after it was needed for him to do.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The World Health Organization (WHO) planned to study the relationship between the eating habits of the people and the disease. Two doctors were chosen to make the study. They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries. They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa. The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor. The diseased children are usually from one to four years old. As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body. The skin changes color and may break out in open sores . The hair changes color and starts to fall out. The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time. Stomach liquids are no longer produced. The doctors reasoned that kwashiorkor was found in the young children of this age in many parts of Africa because of lack of milk or meat. Their mothers, after stopping their breastfeeding, gave them foods full of starches instead of greatly needed proteins. They found that the addition of milk to the food of the children suffering from kwashiorkor saved many lives. The unbelievable thing about kwashiorkor is that the very existence of the disease--which has been killing thousands of children for centuries--was not even recognized in Latin America as recently as ten years ago. The deaths of those children were mistakenly listed as due to other diseases. It was the WHO's work in Africa that led to the discovery of the problem in Central America.

And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true.

The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome.

Please answer the following question: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.  Company A was a refinery and managed petroleum products. Another company, named company H, produced and distributed electricity using wind power. Both companies strive to be more efficient and to pollute less.  Which company made less fuel for trucks? Answer:","output":"Company H made less fuel for trucks. This is because Company H produces and distributes electricity using wind power, which does not involve creating fuel for vehicles.

Case B: Induction Induction, on the other hand, refers to the transfer of charge or energy without direct physical contact between the objects.

Given the question: The city of Lampo is currently experiencing some soil piping in the ground. The government officials of Lampo are currently looking to start a casino to bring in extra revenue to the town. They are currently consulting with a company that is located in Himpton, a city that is not experiencing soil piping. The company is a well respected leader in the casino industry and is eager to work with Lampo.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Are sink holes more or less likely to form in Lampo?  Hint: Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage. The answer is:","output":"Sink holes are more likely to form in Lampo. Step-by-step justification: 1. The question asks about the likelihood of sink holes forming in Lampo. 2. The paragraph provides information about the situation in Lampo, including the fact that it is experiencing soil piping. 3. The definition of soil piping, as mentioned in the hint, states that it is a form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface and causes sink hole formation, among other issues. 4. Since Lampo is currently experiencing soil piping, and soil piping causes sink hole formation, it is reasonable to deduce that sink holes are more likely to form in the city of Lampo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is part of the larger Ozark Mountain AVA, which also includes regions in Missouri and Oklahoma. The smaller Altus AVA is entirely contained within the Arkansas Mountain AVA. The Arkansas Mountain AVA includes 2880000 acre , making it the ninth largest AVA as of 2008. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas has many large waterfalls.","output":"While the Arkansas Mountain AVA is indeed located within the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas, the information provided mainly focuses on the wine industry and its geographical specifications. It does not mention or provide any data concerning the presence or size of waterfalls in the region. To properly assess the presence and size of waterfalls in the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas, we must consider additional information on the region's natural landscape and geological features. The Ozark Mountains, also known as the Ozark Plateau, is a physiographic region in the United States that covers parts of Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The region is characterized by its unique geomorphology, consisting of plateaus, deep valleys, rivers, and springs. It is common for such geological formations to create waterfalls as water flows from higher elevations to lower ones, causing the erosion of soft rock layers and creating steep drops. Some of the river systems in the Ozarks, including the Buffalo National River, contain picturesque waterfalls. Northwestern Arkansas, where the Arkansas Mountain AVA is located, is a part of the Boston Mountains, which are the highest and most rugged portion of the Ozarks. The region is abundant in water resources due to the presence of numerous rivers, such as the Buffalo, Mulberry, and Kings rivers, as well as many smaller creeks and tributaries. These rivers and streams give rise to numerous waterfalls throughout the area, some of which are well-known, such as Triple Falls, Glory Hole, and Hemmed-in Hollow Falls. There are also many lesser-known, smaller waterfalls scattered throughout the region. Given the information regarding the landscape features of the Ozark Mountains, particularly the presence of many rivers, creeks, and tributaries, in addition to the region's rugged terrain in the Boston Mountains of northwestern Arkansas, we can conclude that the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas possess a significant number of waterfalls. However, the provided data about the Arkansas Mountain AVA does not directly relate to the conclusion, as the AVA's focus is mainly on viticulture, not the presence or size of waterfalls. In summary, though the information provided about the Arkansas Mountain AVA does not directly address or support the conclusion, additional information about the Ozark Mountains' geology and hydrology does indicate that there are numerous waterfalls in the area. However, the sizes of the waterfalls may vary, ranging from large, well-known ones to smaller, less celebrated cascades."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"In order to determine if the premise supports the validity of the hypothesis, we need to examine both the premise and hypothesis thoroughly, and then analyze their logical connection. The premise given is: \\"No, Mr. White.\\" This statement indicates a denial, refusal, or disagreement with something related to an individual referred to as Mr. White. However, the statement does not provide ample context or information. It is unclear what is being denied or to what aspects of Mr. White's situation the remark is referring. On the other hand, the hypothesis provided is: \\"The man's last name was White.\\" This hypothesis is a statement about a specific individual, asserting that he has the last name 'White.' To conclude whether the hypothesis is true or not based on the given premise, we need to see if there is a logical connection between the two of them. If we analyze the premise and hypothesis, we can see that both statements involve someone with the last name 'White.' The premise directly refers to a person called 'Mr. White,' while the hypothesis states that a man has the last name 'White.'  However, the initial statement that says, \\"No, Mr. White\\" only provides a negative response or denial to an unknown request or action involving someone named Mr. White, and does not give any information about the man's identity or personal information. It does not confirm, nor deny, the hypothesis directly. Based on this analysis, we cannot firmly conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true as well. The premise, while involving a person named Mr. White, does not give any specific information about the man or his last name, and therefore, cannot be used to definitively support or disprove the hypothesis. We would need more context and information in order to draw a stronger connection between the premise and hypothesis for a valid conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Objective: How to Make a Non Toxic Wood Furniture Polish Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer, I will outline both the solutions and discuss the naive physics reasoning behind them. After assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each solution, it will be easier to determine which one is more sound. Solution 1: A Homemade Olive Oil and Lemon Furniture Polish Ingredients: - 1 cup of olive oil - 1/4 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice Procedure: 1. Mix the olive oil and lemon juice in a glass jar or a spray bottle.  2. Shake the container well to combine the ingredients, as the oil and lemon juice are immiscible liquids and may separate. 3. Apply a small amount of the polish to a clean, soft cloth or microfiber cloth. 4. Gently rub the cloth onto the wood furniture in circular motions, working on small sections at a time. 5. Allow the polish to absorb into the wood for a few minutes, then buff with a clean cloth to reveal a natural shine. 6. Store the remaining polish in a cool, dark place for future use. Naive Physics Reasoning: This solution uses olive oil, a natural substance with conditioning properties that nourish and protect the wood. The lemon juice adds a light, fresh scent and provides mild cleaning properties that help remove surface dirt. Together, these ingredients create a simple yet effective non-toxic wood furniture polish that gives a natural shine without causing damage to the wood or leaving harmful chemical residues. Solution 2: A Homemade Beeswax and Coconut Oil Furniture Polish Ingredients: - 1/4 cup of beeswax pellets or grated beeswax - 3/4 cup of coconut oil Procedure: 1. In a double boiler or a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water, melt the beeswax. Be sure not to let the water come into direct contact with the beeswax. 2. Once the beeswax has melted, add the coconut oil. Stir gently until the coconut oil has melted and combined with the beeswax. 3. Remove the mixture from heat and let it cool slightly. Pour the liquid into a glass jar and allow it to solidify. Once cooled, it will form a thick paste. 4. To use, apply a small amount of the polish with a clean, soft cloth, working in circular motions and covering small sections of the wood at a time. 5. Allow the polish to absorb into the wood for about 30 minutes. 6. Buff the surface of the furniture with a clean cloth to remove any excess polish and reveal a protective, natural shine. Naive Physics Reasoning: This solution uses beeswax and coconut oil, both natural substances that have conditioning and protective properties. Beeswax helps seal and protect the wood, while coconut oil nourishes and moisturizes the surface. The combination of these two ingredients creates a highly effective non-toxic wood furniture polish that provides long-lasting protection and a lustrous shine without exposing the wood or the user to harmful chemicals. Conclusion: Based on naive physics reasoning, both solutions can effectively polish and protect wood furniture without using toxic chemicals. However, the beeswax and coconut oil furniture polish (Solution 2) seems to be a more sound solution, as it provides a long-lasting protective barrier and a more durable shine. The olive oil and lemon polish (Solution 1) may require more frequent applications due to the quick-absorbing nature of olive oil and the mild cleaning action of lemon juice. Ultimately, both solutions are non-toxic and suitable for maintaining wood furniture, but Solution 2 is preferred for its sturdiness and extended protective qualities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"Bribing someone is an unethical and generally illegal act, and I do not condone or support it. Instead, I encourage you to approach situations in a fair, honest, and transparent manner. However, I can provide you with information on how to influence and persuade someone ethically and professionally. Here is a detailed outline of ethical persuasion techniques: 1. Build rapport: Establishing a connection and trust with the person you want to influence is key. Be genuinely interested in their perspective, empathetic towards their concerns, and respectful of their opinions. 2. Understand their needs and motivations: Invest time in learning about the person's goals, aspirations, and values. This allows you to present your ideas or requests in a way that aligns with their interests and addresses their concerns effectively. 3. Use effective communication skills: Be clear, concise, and articulate when presenting your ideas. Use evidence, anecdotes, or examples to back up your claims and create a compelling argument. Additionally, use open questions that encourage dialogue, allowing you to even understand and address any objections they might have. 4. Demonstrate credibility: Show your knowledge, expertise, and reliability in the subject matter you're discussing. This can be done by providing facts, statistics, or examples that substantiate your point while also displaying your passion and commitment to the issue. 5. Appeal to emotions: As humans, we are often driven by our emotions. Understand the emotional aspects of your case and evoke feelings such as empathy, pride, or urgency. Connect your argument to their core values and beliefs to create a stronger impact. 6. Create a sense of urgency: People are more likely to act if they perceive a time constraint or fear missing out on a valuable opportunity. Emphasize the importance of acting now or outline the potential consequences of inaction. 7. Offer solutions: People are more likely to buy into your idea if you provide them with a viable solution to their problem. Present the benefits of your suggestion clearly and emphasize how it would improve their current situation. 8. Reach a consensus: Find common ground and emphasize points of agreement. Make the person feel like they are part of the decision-making process by encouraging collaboration and shared ownership of the idea or project. 9. Practice patience: Persuasion takes time and effort. Be prepared to engage in multiple conversations or meetings before you secure a commitment. Remain persistent, confident, and open to feedback throughout the process. By applying these ethical persuasion techniques, you can build strong relationships and achieve desired outcomes without resorting to bribery or any other form of unethical behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fruit, which is formed by the enlargement of flower parts, is frequently a seed-dispersal tool that attracts animals to eat or otherwise disturb it, incidentally scattering the seeds it contains (see frugivory). Although many such mutualistic relationships remain too fragile to survive competition and to spread widely, flowering proved to be an unusually effective means of reproduction, spreading (whatever its origin) to become the dominant form of land plant life. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did mutualistic relationships spread to eventually become?","output":"Mutualistic relationships, through the process of seed dispersal by animals consuming fruits, eventually spread to become the dominant form of land plant life. This essentially means that plants managed to use animals to their advantage, ensuring their seeds were spread further and more efficiently. In biology, mutualism is the way two organisms of different species exist in a relationship in which each individual benefits. In this case, the plant and the animal constitute the two organisms. The plant benefits by having its seeds dispersed over a wide area, resulting in higher chances of continual survival and proliferation of its species. The animal, on the other hand, benefits from the food resource which is the fruit or flower part. Hence, creating a symbiotic relationship that benefits both parties. Flowering proved to be a notably efficient means of reproduction which eventually led to this form of mutualism. Through gradual ecological changes and evolution, flowering plants — also known as angiosperms, developed a trait that helps in attracting animals, which is their fleshy, nutritious fruits. When beings like birds, insects, or mammals consume these fruits, they inadvertently help in the transportation of seeds. The movement of animals, whether through flying, walking, or other means, allows the seeds to be dispersed in many different locations, sometimes quite far from the parent plant. If the consumed seeds aren't fully digested and can remain viable after passage through the digestive tract of the animal, they can potentially germinate and grow in the new location when excreted. Over time, the spreading of this mutualistic relationship between plants and animals became more widespread and eventually resulted in such angiosperms becoming the dominant form of land plant life. This innovative means of seed dispersal has allowed flowering plants to colonize a vast array of environments and niches across the globe more effectively than other plant groups. This global pervasiveness of angiosperms is a testimony to the overwhelming success of these mutualistic relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Olmecs were the earliest known major civilization in Mexico following a progressive development in Soconusco. They lived in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, in the present-day states of Veracruz and Tabasco. It has been speculated that the Olmecs derive in part from neighboring Mokaya or Mixe-Zoque. The Olmecs flourished during Mesoamerica's formative period, dating roughly from as early as 1500 BCE to about 400 BCE. Pre- While the actual ethno-linguistic affiliation of the Olmec remains unknown, various hypotheses have been put forward. For example, in 1968 Michael D. Coe speculated that the Olmec were Mayan predecessors.  In 1976, linguists Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman published a paper in which they argued a core number of loanwords had apparently spread from a Mixe-Zoquean language into many other Mesoamerican languages. Campbell and Kaufman proposed that the presence of these core loanwords indicated that the Olmec - generally regarded as the first \\"highly civilized\\" Mesoamerican society - spoke a language ancestral to Mixe-Zoquean. The spread of this vocabulary particular to their culture accompanied the diffusion of other Olmec cultural and artistic traits that appears in the archaeological record of other Mesoamerican societies.  Mixe-Zoque specialist Soren Wichmann first critiqued this theory on the basis that most of the Mixe-Zoquean loans seemed to originate only from the Zoquean branch of the family. This implied the loanword transmission occurred in the period after the two branches of the language family split, placing the time of the borrowings outside of the Olmec period. However, new evidence has pushed back the proposed date for the split of Mixean and Zoquean languages to a period within the Olmec era. Based on this dating, the architectural and archaeological patterns and the particulars of the vocabulary loaned to other Mesoamerican languages from Mixe-Zoquean, Wichmann now suggests that the Olmecs of San Lorenzo spoke proto-Mixe and the Olmecs of La Venta spoke proto-Zoque.  At least the fact that the Mixe-Zoquean languages are still spoken in an area corresponding roughly to the Olmec heartland, and are historically known to have been spoken there, leads most scholars to assume that the Olmec spoke one or more Mixe-Zoquean languages. were their any other languages?","output":"Yes, there is a possibility that the Olmecs were exposed to or spoke other languages besides the Mixe-Zoquean languages. Mesoamerica was a culturally and linguistically diverse region, with multiple ethnic groups and languages coexisting and interacting throughout its history. Although Mixe-Zoquean languages are the most likely candidates for the Olmec's primary language based on current evidence, it is important to note that the Olmecs had extensive trade networks and interactions with various neighboring cultures and civilizations, such as the Maya, the Zapotec, and the Teotihuacan. This exposure to multiple cultures could have led to a multilingual environment where multiple languages were spoken and understood by the Olmec people. For example, the presence of Mayan inscriptions and iconography in some Olmec sites suggests that some Olmecs might have known or had some understanding of the Mayan language. Similarly, there must have been some level of communication between the Olmecs and their trading partners from distant regions, which could have necessitated the use of other languages or the development of a pidgin or trading language. Moreover, the Olmec civilization has often been dubbed \\"the mother culture\\" of Mesoamerica, as many later civilizations borrowed or adopted various elements of Olmec culture, religion, and iconography. This cultural exchange also implies a certain degree of linguistic interaction and exchange between the Olmecs and other Mesoamerican groups. In summary, while the prevailing hypothesis suggests that the Olmecs spoke Mixe-Zoquean languages, it is likely that they were also familiar with or spoke other languages due to their extensive trade networks, interactions with neighboring cultures, and the borrowing of Olmec cultural elements by later civilizations. Further archaeological and linguistic research may shed more light on the full extent of the Olmec's linguistic diversity and interactions with other Mesoamerican languages."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who was known as the Mummy of Birchin Bower?  Beswick's mummified body was initially kept at Ancoats Hall, the home of another Beswick family member, but it was soon moved to a room in Dr White's home in Sale, Manchester, where it was stored in an old clock case. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a celebrity; the author Thomas de Quincey was one of those who went to view her at White's house. Following White's death in 1813, Beswick's body was bequeathed to a Dr Ollier, on whose death in 1828 it was donated to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, where she became known as the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. She was displayed in the museum's entrance hall, next to a Peruvian and an Egyptian mummy, and her relatives were allowed free access to visit her as they wished. She was described by a visitor in 1844 as \\"one of the most remarkable objects in the museum\\". The \\"cold dark shadow of her mummy hung over Manchester in the middle of the eighteenth century\\", according to writer Edith Sitwell.There are no pictures of Hannah Beswick.

The legs and trunks were tightly bound in a strong cloth such as is used for bed ticks [a stiff kind of mattress cover material] and the body, which was that of a little old woman, was in a glass coffin-shaped case. Shortly after the museum's transfer to Manchester University in 1867 it was decided that as Beswick was \\"irrevocably and unmistakably dead\\", the time had come for her to be buried. But since 1837 UK law had required that a medical examiner issue a certificate of death before a burial could take place; as Beswick had died in 1758 an appeal had to be made to the Secretary of State, who issued an order for her burial. With the permission of the Bishop of Manchester, Hannah Beswick was interred in an unmarked grave in Harpurhey Cemetery on 22 July 1868, more than 110 years after her death.

A typical definition of gravity is that it is a force. It causes an attraction between two masses. According to this definition, anything that has mass exerts a force. Any object exerts gravity on other objects. It does not matter how small it is, it has gravity. The more matter an object has, the more gravity it has. Your pencil has a tiny bit of gravity, but far too little to notice. What about a planet? It would have a lot of gravity. An objects gravity exerts a pull on other objects. Friction only occurs between objects that are touching. Gravity can act between objects that are not touching. In fact, gravity can act over very long distances. Where else can you feel gravity?

The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.  Joe is at a party and carrying around a can of beer that he has had in his hand for awhile. He bumps into Sally, and they begin chatting. During their conversation, Sally notices the beer in Joe's hand, and remarks that a beer sounds like a good idea. She heads over to the refrigerator and grabs a nice cold one and pops it open. She takes a sip while the two continue their chat.  Which person's beer has molecules farther apart? A:","output":"A: To determine whose beer has molecules farther apart, we need to consider the temperatures of each beer. 1. Joe has been holding his beer for a while, so it's expected that his beer has become warmer due to the heat transfer from his hand. 2. Sally just got her beer from the refrigerator, so it's likely colder than Joe's beer. 3. As water (and by extension, beer) cools down, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another, increasing its density. This continues until it reaches its highest density at about 4°C. Conversely, as it warms up, the molecules move farther apart and the density decreases. 4. Based on this information, Joe's beer is warmer and therefore has molecules farther apart compared to Sally's colder beer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Utility Patent protects new inventions that have a useful application. This covers new methods, processes, machines, manufactured items, devices or chemical compounds or any new improvements to any of these. Most recipes would fall under the Utility Patent category.  The product shape or packaging may also be susceptible to protection under a design patent. In this case you could apply for one of those as well. Patents can be filed either in the United States or in other countries. If you feel that your recipe requires international protection, then you should apply for a patent in countries where you want patent protection. The European Union offers a \\"European Patent Office\\" that facilitates patent applications for countries within the EU. There are patent lawyers who specialize in filing the necessary paperwork with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. While you're certainly allowed to submit your own paperwork, the patent office recommends you hire a lawyer at this point to handle the flow of paperwork and make sure you submit all the required materials. Regardless of who does the actual filing, the papers are then submitted electronically to the patent office.  The application cover sheet and list of required attachments can be obtained from the United States Patent and Trademark Office website, at uspto.gov.  The patent application should be filed either online or via regular mail (note that filing online will allow you to avoid the 400 \\"non-electronic filing\\" surcharge and speed up the process considerably). The US patent office will consider your paperwork and make a determination if your recipe is eligible for a patent. If you're approved, the patent office will contact you. After you pay an issue and publication fee, your patent will be granted.  The vast majority of patent applications are routinely rejected. You should not take it personally. Examiners are required to enforce the rules diligently and it often works out to your advantage, resulting in a more valuable patent. If your application is rejected you have an opportunity to argue or to amend (narrow) the claims or to appeal the examiners' final decision. This often takes several years and thousands of dollars in filing fees and attorneys' fees. If your application is finally rejected and you abandon it, and you still want to protect your recipe, you can do so by  protecting it as a trade secret. Those who know the secret will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and in this way you can prevent your recipe from getting leaked.","output":"This article talks about patents, which are like special papers that protect people's new inventions or ideas. Recipes can get patents too, so no one else copies them. There are different types of patents, and a recipe might fit into more than one group. A Utility Patent is the most common for recipes. Sometimes, the shape or packaging of a product can also get a Design Patent. People can apply for patents in the United States or in other countries. If they want their recipe to be safe in many places, they should apply in each country they want protection. There's a special place called the \\"European Patent Office\\" that helps with patents in Europe. People can do the papers by themselves or get help from a special lawyer, but it's better to hire one. Once everything is ready, the papers have to be sent to the patent office electronically. This must be done either online or by regular mail, but doing it online is faster and avoids extra costs. The patent office checks all the papers and decides if the recipe can have a patent. If they agree, the person has to pay some fees, and the patent is given.  Sometimes patents get rejected, but it's not personal. If it's refused, people can change some things or argue, but it takes time and money. If, in the end, they can't get a patent, they can still protect their recipe by calling it a \\"trade secret.\\" That means only those who know it have to promise not to tell anyone else about it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question:   Joe's urine was almost clear; its water content was probably high or low? Answer:","output":"Joe's urine being almost clear is an indication that its water content is high. The color of urine is determined by the amount of water that is excreted along with various waste products and chemicals. A well-hydrated person typically produces clear or pale yellow urine, which indicates that the water content in the urine is high. This means that Joe's body is efficiently processing and eliminating waste products while maintaining a healthy balance of water and electrolytes. The process of urine formation takes place in the kidneys, where blood is constantly filtered, and waste products, excess salts, and water are removed. Urine is primarily composed of water (about 95%), and the remaining 5% consists of waste products such as urea, creatinine, and various salts and ions. When the body is well-hydrated, the kidneys receive sufficient water to dilute these waste products, resulting in lighter-colored urine. On the other hand, darker-colored urine indicates that the water content in the urine is low. This usually means that the body is not receiving enough water, and as a result, the waste products are more concentrated in the urine. Dehydration, certain medications, and some medical conditions can all contribute to darker-colored urine. Dark yellow to amber-colored urine can indicate mild to severe dehydration, and it is essential to increase water intake in such cases. In summary, Joe's almost clear urine suggests that its water content is high, and his body is effectively eliminating waste products while maintaining optimal hydration levels. A healthy urine color is generally light yellow to clear, and it is essential to monitor urine color as an indicator of hydration status and overall health. Drinking an adequate amount of water every day, as per individual needs, is crucial for maintaining good kidney function and promoting overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Clinton emphasized her own experience as first lady, senator and secretary of state, saying she would provide the steady diplomacy the country needs. “National security is the foundation of how we make sure our interests are pursued in the world,” said Louis Goodman, Emeritus Dean of International Relations at American University in an interview with VOA. With polls show terrorism is a major concern among Americans, Clinton targeted Trump's positions on the issue. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has promised to temporarily block Muslims from crossing U.S. borders. \\"The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more.

Translate to English","output":"I believe that the relevant regulations should provide guidance to officials on how they should ensure both sound financial management and good administration. In order to achieve and maintain both sound financial management and good administration in an organization, it is essential that relevant policies and regulations are implemented, providing officials with clear and comprehensive guidance. These regulations should be designed with the goal of ensuring transparency, efficiency, and accountability. 1. Transparency: A key aspect of financial management and good administration is transparency, meaning that all financial transactions and decision-making processes are open, accessible, and easily understood by all stakeholders. To encourage transparency, officials should be required to maintain accurate and up-to-date records of financial transactions, and to make these records available for regular audits and public scrutiny. 2. Efficiency: Effective use of resources can maximize the impact of an organization's budget and prevent wastage. Regulations should encourage officials to engage in efficient practices, such as cost-benefit analysis, prioritizing projects with the highest potential impact, and consistently monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of their actions. 3. Accountability: To ensure a high level of accountability for financial management and administrative decisions, regulations should set clear expectations of conduct for officials and provide mechanisms for enforcement. These may include detailed performance indicators, ongoing performance reviews, and designated channels for reporting misconduct when it occurs. 4. Education and Training: Regulations should also emphasize the need for ongoing education and training for all officials involved in financial management and administration. This will ensure that they remain up-to-date with best practices, and are equipped to make informed and responsible decisions. 5. Collaboration and Communication: Effective communication and collaboration between officials and various stakeholders, including colleagues, external partners, and the public, is crucial for good administration. Regulations should encourage open lines of communication and support collaboration among various actors to achieve the organization's objectives. 6. Risk Management: In order to protect the organization and its financial assets, it is essential to have a robust risk management process in place. Regulations should outline requirements for risk assessment, risk mitigation strategies, and contingency planning. 7. Performance Measurement: Regularly measuring and assessing the performance of financial management and administrative processes helps identify areas for improvement, and ensures that the organization is on track to achieve its goals. Regulations should establish performance metrics, evaluation processes, and reporting requirements for officials. By implementing and adhering to these principles, relevant regulations can provide a solid foundation for officials to ensure sound financial management and good administration within their organization. This, in turn, will contribute to the overall success and reputation of the organization, building trust and confidence among stakeholders and the public."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Sometimes, while we draw, paint or write, we accidentally spill some ink on our clothes, carpet or table. Don't worry! I am here to help you learn how to clean up these ink stains. Let's talk about six easy ways to clean them up, so keep reading and try these steps with the help of an adult. 1. Blot excess ink immediately: When you spill ink, the first thing you must do is to take a paper towel or a clean cloth and gently press it on the ink stain. Don't rub it, or the ink might spread. Just lightly dab so it can soak up the extra ink. Ask an adult to assist you! 2. Try isopropyl rubbing alcohol: Isopropyl rubbing alcohol is a special liquid that you can find at home with your parents' help. It's like a helper that makes ink disappear. Dip a cotton ball or a soft cloth in the rubbing alcohol and gently dab it on the ink stain. Watch the ink magically dissolve! 3. Consider using vinegar on the ink stain: Vinegar is another special cleaning agent that can help remove ink stains. Mix some white vinegar with cornstarch to make a thick, gooey paste. With your parent's help, spread the paste over the ink stain and let it dry. Later, you can brush off the paste, and the ink will be gone. Amazing, right? 4. Try hairspray: Did you know that hairspray can help remove ink stains too? With the help of an adult, spray some hairspray on the stain, leave it there for a few moments, and then dab it with a clean cloth. You'll see that the ink starts disappearing. 5. Try a commercial stain remover: There are special cleaning products, like stain removers, that your parent or guardian can buy from a store. These are like superheroes fighting against ink villains! Ask an adult to help you apply the stain remover on the ink stain, follow the instructions written on the bottle, and watch the stain go away. 6. Rinse the area thoroughly with clean water: After you've tried one of these cleaning methods, it's important to clean the area with water to remove any leftover cleaner. Gently rinse the area with cool, clean water and pat it dry with a clean cloth or paper towel. Remember, you might have to try these steps more than once to make the ink stain go away completely. Always ask for an adult's help while trying these cleaning methods, and soon enough, the ink stain will disappear as if it was never there! Happy cleaning!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The atmosphere is lively and filled with anticipation, as a prominent ship is about to embark on a long and perilous journey across the vast and dangerous ocean. A young sailor named Johanna, who recently joined the crew, is secretly a woman disguised as a man. She has been searching for answers about her true identity after discovering a mysterious letter amongst her late father's belongings. The letter hinted at a dark family secret, a past entwined with the legendary and feared \\"Siren of the Sea.\\" Unbeknownst to the crew, Johanna is a descendant of this mystical figure. Facing a lifetime of prejudice and judgement, she assumes a male identity to pursue her quest for the truth about her heritage—defying the societal expectations of her time and risking her own safety. Act II: As the ship embarks on its journey, the intricate web of relationships amongst the crew members begins to unravel. Johanna's resourcefulness and incredible seamanship skills catch the eye of the gruff, yet wise ship captain, Captain Victor Grey. He takes Johanna under his wing and becomes her mentor. Throughout the voyage, the crew encounters both treacherous storms and marine creatures of fierce wonder as they navigate through the open ocean. Johanna becomes close friends with a fellow young sailor named Thomas, a kind-hearted dreamer with a penchant for storytelling. Johanna, driven by her desire to uncover the truth and inspired by her friendships, begins to trust those around her more openly. One stormy night, the ship gets caught in a whirlpool, which leads them to the hidden and mystical \\"Siren's Cove\\"—a place forgotten by time and cloaked in mystery. Here, the crew encounters strange and otherworldly beings with powerful siren-like qualities. Among these beings is a wise and ancient siren named Orenda, who reveals the truth of Johanna's heritage and helps her understand the nature of her unique abilities. Act III: As they set to leave the Siren's Cove, disaster strikes when a notorious pirate ship, captained by the ruthless Black Anne, attacks them. A fierce battle ensues, and Johanna's true identity is revealed during the conflict. Captain Grey is gravely injured, and it's up to Johanna to harness her newfound powers to save the crew and defeat the pirate threat. Johanna is embraced by the crew for her courage and sacrifices, but she knows that returning to Portside Landing would mean a return to the life of oppression and judgment she sought to escape. She voluntarily hands over the captain's hat to Thomas. In a heartfelt farewell, Johanna decides to stay behind in the Siren's Cove, where she can continue to unravel her past and explore the limits of her powers. Thomas, now in charge of the ship, leads the remaining crew back to their home, where they vow to keep Johanna's secret and honor her memory as a brave and loyal sailor. The film closes with the crew of the ship, now bonded by their experiences, sailing toward the horizon—with Johanna's spirit forever in their hearts. Throughout the film, Johanna's journey and persistence in following her own path, despite all the odds against her, remind the viewer of the importance of remaining true to oneself, even in the face of tremendous adversity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Should McDonald's Give Charles Ramsey A Reward For Heroism? Just what is McDonald's McDonald's trying to accomplish by involving itself in the horrible story of three young women held captive for over a decade in a Cleveland house? The fast-food behemoth says it wants to get in touch with Charles Ramsey, the heroic neighbor who kicked apart a door to free Amanda Berry, helped her call 911, and then gave a vivid, witty, and ultimately viral account of what happened to a local TV reporter. Explaining his sudden acts of heroism, Ramsey noted that he was “eating my McDonald’s” when he heard shouting from his neighbor’s house and sprang into action. McDonald’s came up in the 911 call too. McDonald’s says it is responding to an outpouring of social media requests that it honor or reward Ramsey somehow. Well, OK. But really, it’s the most tenuous of connections. Had Ramsey been eating a kruller from Dunkin’ Donuts, texting on a Samsung phone, or playing an XBox game (or all of those things) at the time Berry started yelling for help, would those respective corporations be expected to queue up to laud him? This is treacherous territory, because McDonald’s cannot be seen as capitalizing on a series of terrible crimes. And yet, it’s not really clear it can completely avoid that. Basking in the reflected light of Ramsey’s heroism may be one step removed, but one step removed is still pretty damn close. There are also issues of class lurking underneath the surface here, given the nexus of cheap-tasty-unhealthy fast food and the public health problems that lower-income communities face. Food corporations are desperate to promote public health and lighten up their menus. Giving Charles Ramsey a lifetime supply of Big Macs helps no one. But giving him a lifetime supply of Fruit and Walnut Salads might be seen as opportunistic or patronizing. (Unless he happens to really, really like McDonald’s Fruit and Walnut Salads.) And during a time when corporations are taking on more quasi-public functions, from slapping their names on stadiums and running prisons and municipal agencies, this only shows the limits of the trend. Really, it’s the community – the city of Cleveland – that should take the lead in formally thanking and honoring Ramsey. Ramsey, to his credit, has promised to give any reward money to the three kidnapping victims. But that only means that McDonald’s would be better off donating directly, and quietly, to any funds set up for that purpose, and stepping back. Follow me on Twitter or Facebook. My Forbes blog page is here.","output":"McDonald's is attempting to get in touch with Charles Ramsey, the man who rescued three kidnapped women in Cleveland, due to an outpouring of social media requests asking the fast-food chain to honor or reward him.

However, McDonald's must be cautious not to appear as capitalizing on a series of terrible crimes, and should consider donating directly to any funds set up for the victims while stepping back from public involvement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You pass a group of people. The people are talking to each other. You cannot hear what they are saying. But suddenly they start laughing. What would you think? Would you think they were laughing at something funny that one of them said? Or -- be honest with yourself -- would you think they were laughing at you? Yes, you. Being laughed at is a common fear. But a major study published in two thousand and nine found that this fear is not the same around the world. It differs from culture to culture. People in Finland were the least likely to believe that people laughing in their presence were making fun of them. Less than ten percent of Finns in the study said they would think that, compared to eighty percent of people in Thailand. Some people in the study said they felt unsure of themselves in social situations but hid their feelings of insecurity. Others said they avoided social situations where they had been laughed at before. The study found that people in Turkmenistan and Cambodia were more likely to be in the first group. They would hide their feelings of insecurity if they were around other people's laughter. But people in Iraq, Egypt and Jordan were more likely to try to avoid such situations if they felt they had been laughed at before. Shy people often avoid situations that would force them into close contact with other people. They worry that something they say or do will make other people laugh at them. But some people worry much more than others. They may have a disorder called gelotophobia. Gelos is a Greek word. It means laughter. Phobia means fear. This fear of laughter can be truly sad for those who live with it. It can affect how they lead their lives. In the study, a team from the University of Zurich led more than ninety researchers from around the world. They wanted to understand the difference between normal shyness and true gelotophobia. Another purpose of the study was to compare the levels of fear of being laughed at in different cultures. The researchers surveyed...

The answer to this question is:","output":"The last step of the baking process after the cake has been baked for the required time is to carefully remove the cake from the oven. This should be done by using oven mitts or a thick cloth to ensure you do not burn yourself as the oven and the cake pan will both be extremely hot.  Once the cake is out of the oven, you must let it cool before proceeding with any decoration or frosting. Place the cake pan on a wire cooling rack if available - if not, a cool counter-top will do. If you try to tip the cake out while it's still hot, it may break or crumble, so it's important to let it cool down in its pan. This could take from around 10 minutes to half an hour, depending on the size and thickness of the cake. After the cake has cooled adequately in its baking pan, you can then remove it from the pan. You do this by first taking a butter knife or a palette knife and running it around the edge of the cake to ensure it's not sticking to the sides of the pan. Then, place a larger plate or stand over the top of the cake pan and flip it upside down so the cake falls out onto the plate or stand. Now, your cake is ready for decoration. If you're using a frosting, ensure that it's not too runny or thick; you need it to spread easily but not drip off the cake. Use a palette knife or a butter knife to spread the frosting over the top of the cake and around the sides if desired. You can also use a piping bag to apply the icing in a decorative manner. After the frosting, you can add any other decorations you like, such as sprinkles, chocolate shavings, fresh fruits, or edible flowers. Be creative and make it unique and beautiful! Finally, cut a slice and enjoy a well-deserved treat. If you're not serving the cake immediately, make sure to store it properly. If the cake is frosted with a cream-based icing, it should be stored in the refrigerator. If it's covered in buttercream or ganache, it can stay at room temperature, preferably under a cake dome. Remember, practice makes perfect. If your cake didn't turn out as expected, don’t get discouraged. Analyze what went wrong and try again.

Answer the following question. A Sachertorte is a type of chocolate cake which originated in which country?","output":"Sachertorte is a type of chocolate cake that originated in Austria, specifically in its capital city, Vienna. The cake was created in 1832 by Franz Sacher, a 16-year-old Austrian apprentice pastry chef at the court of Prince Klemens von Metternich, who was a prominent statesman and diplomat in the Austrian Empire. The prince requested a unique dessert for his distinguished guests, and it was then that the young Sacher came up with the recipe for this fabulous cake. The Sachertorte typically consists of two layers of dense and velvety chocolate sponge cake, separated by a thin layer of sweet and tangy apricot jam. The entire cake is then covered with a rich, glossy layer of dark chocolate ganache. This luscious combination gives the cake its distinctive bittersweet taste. To finish it off, it is usually garnished with a rosette of whipped cream, which is served on the side or next to the slice of cake. The original recipe for Sachertorte remains a well-guarded secret of the Hotel Sacher in Vienna, where it was first served in 1876. Eduard Sacher, Franz Sacher's son, and his wife Anna had established the hotel, and over time, the cake became an iconic symbol of Viennese cuisine. The hotel still serves the authentic Sachertorte, referred to as the \\"Original Sacher-Torte,\\" and has even trademarked the name, ensuring the consistency and quality of the cake served to its guests. Over the years, the Sachertorte has gained international renown and inspired various adaptations of the recipe, which can now be found in different countries with slight variations in flavor and presentation. However, the traditional Austrian version remains the most well-known and continues to be an essential element of the country's culinary heritage. In Austria, the Sachertorte is not only enjoyed in hotels and cafes, but it's also a popular cake to serve at home for special occasions or as a dessert during festive seasons. In fact, December 5th is recognized as National Sachertorte Day in Austria, which is a testament to the cake's importance and enduring popularity. In summary, the Sachertorte is a delicious and iconic chocolate cake that originated in Austria. Created by Franz Sacher in the early 19th century, it is now enjoyed by people all over the world and remains a symbol of culinary excellence and tradition for the Austrian people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Frank and Noah were two researchers. Noah researched the climate of Antarctica, while Frank researched the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa.  Which researcher observed a large amount of surface warming?  Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The researchers present a complete temperature... The answer to this question is:","output":"Noah, the researcher who studied the climate of Antarctica, observed a larger amount of surface warming as compared to Frank who studied the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa. This is because some parts of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica, have experienced significant warming trends. As mentioned in the hint, the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05°C (0.09°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006, according to a study by Eric Steig. West Antarctica, in particular, has warmed by more than 0.1°C (0.2°F) per decade in the last 50 years, with the warming being strongest in winter and spring. This warming trend is partly offset by the autumn cooling in East Antarctica. The surface warming in West Antarctica has not led to substantial melting at the surface or directly affected the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. However, it is worth noting that there have been instances of ice shelves collapsing, such as the 2002 Larsen-B ice shelf collapse and the 2008 Wilkins Ice Shelf collapse, which have raised concerns on the effects of warming in the region. Furthermore, a study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth, providing further evidence that Noah, the researcher studying the climate of Antarctica, observed a larger amount of surface warming compared to Frank. Although the effects of human carbon dioxide emissions on Antarctica's warming trend remain ambiguous, the noticeable warming trend in various parts of the continent clearly demonstrates that Noah experienced a significant amount of surface warming during his research."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please answer the following question: Process: - One type of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air - Some scientists believe that releasing too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is one of the causes of global warming - This upsets the balance of the carbon cycle - The ozone layer helps protect us from harmful rays from the sun - It is getting damaged from air pollution such as methane gas from livestock and CFCs from spray cans - Acid rain is created when gasses such as sulfur dioxide get high into the atmosphere - The wind can blow these gasses for miles and then they get washed out of the air when it rains - This rain is called acid rain and can damage forests and kill fish.  Question: suppose cutting down more trees happens, how will it affect global warming increases.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"A: More Cutting down more trees will have a significant impact on increasing global warming. This can be explained through several factors that contribute to this detrimental effect on the environment. 1. Carbon sequestration: Trees play a crucial role in the carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. They act as natural \\"carbon sinks,\\" storing this carbon in various plant tissues, such as leaves, branches, and roots, and in the surrounding soil. When trees are cut down, this carbon-absorption capacity is lost. Moreover, if the trees are burned or left to decay, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere as CO2, further contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming. 2. Reduced cooling effect: Forests impact local and regional temperatures through the process of evapotranspiration, where water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil and transpiration by plants. This process helps maintain the balance of temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, which in turn helps to regulate the earth's climate. When trees are removed, this cooling effect is diminished, leading to a rise in local temperatures that can contribute to the overall increase in global warming. 3. Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services: Forests are home to a diverse range of species and provide essential ecosystem services, such as water purification, pollination, and soil stabilization. Deforestation can lead to habitat loss and the extinction of species, disrupting the balance of ecosystems and making them less resilient to climate change. This can have cascading effects on the environment, affecting the planet's ability to adapt to changing conditions and increasing global warming. 4. Change in albedo: Albedo refers to the proportion of incoming solar radiation that is reflected by a surface back into space. Light-colored surfaces like snow, ice, and some tree canopies have a high albedo and help to reflect sunlight, keeping the earth cool. Dark surfaces, such as deforested lands and urban areas, absorb more sunlight, leading to an increase in surface temperatures. When trees are cut down and replaced with darker surfaces, the earth's surface absorbs more sunlight, contributing to global warming. In conclusion, cutting down more trees will lead to an increase in global warming due to the loss of carbon sequestration capacity, reduced cooling effect through evapotranspiration, disruption of ecosystems and their services, and changes in the earth's albedo. It is essential to promote responsible and sustainable forestry practices, as well as the preservation and restoration of existing forests, in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change and maintain a healthy and balanced environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The plan, which seeks to charge a fee for each e-mail sent, has been met with widespread disapproval from both individuals and organizations alike. The opposition is notable for its diversity, encompassing people with different political affiliations, social backgrounds, and professions. Among the opponents are not only average internet users who stand to be affected by the proposed fee plan, but also numerous businesses and advocacy groups that rely on e-mail as a primary means of communication. One reason for such a broad opposition is the concern that the fee plan would create a tiered system, segregating those who can afford the fees from those who cannot, effectively creating inequalities within the digital realm. This, critics argue, would have a far-reaching impact on digital communication, inhibiting access to vital information and services for those on the lower end of the economic scale. Furthermore, the plan raises concerns about the future of e-mail as a democratic platform. Currently, e-mail serves as an essential tool for communication, enabling people from all walks of life to easily exchange ideas, opinions, and information. By introducing a fee per e-mail sent, AOL would significantly alter the nature of e-mail communication, restricting its availability based on financial capability. This could potentially suppress the flow of ideas and counteract the democratizing effect the internet has had in recent decades. Business environments would also be affected by the implementation of such a plan. With e-mail being a primary means of communication in many industries, the fee plan could potentially increase overall operating costs, forcing businesses to reconsider their communication strategies and perhaps turn to alternative channels. This could have a trickle-down effect, impacting employees and stakeholders alike. As the opposition to AOL's proposed e-mail fee plan continues to grow, it remains unclear whether the company will proceed with its plans or reconsider its approach. Regardless of the outcome, the widespread concern and diverse range of groups speaking out against the proposal underscore the importance of equal access to digital communication in our modern society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

File-This March 22, 2005, file photo shows men wait outside the Cimarron Correctional Facility, in Cushing, Okla. Three inmates are dead and five injured after a disturbance at an Oklahoma prison, a spokesman... (Associated Press)      The incident that also left four inmates injured happened around 4 p.m. Saturday at the Cimarron Correctional Facility in Cushing, a community between the state's two largest cities, Oklahoma City and Tulsa. The prison houses medium- and maximum-security male inmates.      Three inmates were declared dead on Saturday and the fourth died overnight at a hospital. Terri Watkins, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections, said Sunday that preliminary reports show the first three men who died were fatally stabbed. But Watkins said she didn't know the nature of the injuries to any of the other inmates.      The stabbings apparently happened in quick succession while the inmates at a medium-security wing of the prison were being let out of their cells into the exercise yard, Watkins said.      \\"The entire stabbing incident happened over a couple of minutes,\\" Watkins said, adding that prisoners were all locked in their cells within 40 minutes of the outbreak of violence.      No prison staff were injured or involved in the attack, Watkins said. None of the prisoners' names were released because their families had to be notified first, she said.      One of the treated inmates was later returned to the prison and the other three remained hospitalized in stable condition Sunday, said Steve Owen, a spokesman for Tennessee-based Corrections Corporation of America, which owns and operates the prison.      Owen said the inmate attacks lasted less than two minutes. He didn't immediately respond to an email Sunday seeking further details.      It is the second major violent outburst in months at the prison.      In June, some 200 to 300 of the prison's roughly 1,600 inmates were involved in a brawl there. Eleven prisoners were taken to hospitals after the fight and the facility was placed on lockdown. The fighting occurred among inmates in three separate housing units.      Watkins said that as a precaution, all Oklahoma prisons have been placed on lockdown, which means that inmates are confined to their cells and their movement inside the facility is severely restricted.      She said two separate investigations are underway — one by the Department of Corrections' inspector general's office and the other by CCA.      Oklahoma has the highest rate of prison homicides in the nation, with state inmates killed at a rate more than three times the national average, according to figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.      The figures reviewed by The Associated Press as part of a months-long investigation earlier this year show that there were 39 homicides at Oklahoma prisons between 2001 and 2012, a rate of 14 per 100,000 inmates. The national average is 4 per 100,000.      ___      Follow Sean Murphy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apseanmurphy ||||| A \\"disturbance\\" at an Oklahoma prison Saturday afternoon left four inmates dead and several more hospitalized, officials said Sunday.

Answer the following question: Article: The education of thousands of children with reading and sight trouble is being held back because of a lack of awareness of their legal rights, say campaigners. They are calling for greater efforts to increase awareness of the rights of such children to have text books in design other than standard   print. The campaign is being supported by five times Olympic gold medalist, Sir Steve Redgrave, who has reading trouble. Pupils have the right to receive text in another way, and parents can take action under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) if they feel their children are being treated in a different way through a lack of support.

Options: - basement - antarctic - house - cellar - heat building  Explain why a human would choose \\"house\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"house\\" as the answer to the question, \\"where does a furnace usually heat?\\" because a furnace is designed to provide warmth and maintain a comfortable indoor environment for residential spaces – particularly homes. While each of the other options might be associated with either heating or the presence of a furnace, the primary purpose of a furnace is centered around maintaining warmth within living spaces, which makes \\"house\\" the most accurate and relevant response among the options given.  Let's explore the alternatives to provide a clearer understanding of why \\"house\\" is the best choice: 1. Basement: A basement may indeed be a location where a furnace is installed, but this option does not capture the essence of the question, as it merely indicates the physical location of the furnace and not the intended area it is meant to heat. Furnaces are installed in basements to supply heat to the entire house; thus, selecting \\"basement\\" as an answer would not fully address the question's intent.  2. Antarctic: The Antarctic is a geographic region at the Earth's southernmost continent. Although it experiences extremely cold temperatures, this option does not relate to the purpose or function of a furnace. Moreover, furnaces are typically used for heating indoor spaces, not entire regions or continents.  3. Cellar: A cellar can be compared to a basement as it is an enclosed underground space within a house, often used for storage purposes. While a furnace might be located in a cellar, the main purpose of the furnace is still to provide heating to the entire house. Similar to the basement reasoning, choosing \\"cellar\\" omits the overall objective of a furnace – to heat the entire living space. 4. Heat building: This option could be a potential answer if the question were about a furnace’s purpose. However, it is unclear whether \\"heat building\\" refers to a specific type of building or if it simply rephrases the act of heating a building. Consequently, this option lacks clarity and specificity compared to \\"house,\\" which straightforwardly indicates the space where a furnace is typically used. In summary, although some of the other options provided can be related to the presence or function of a furnace, a human would choose \\"house\\" because it is the most accurate answer aligning with the core purpose of a furnace – to provide heating to living spaces, specifically residential homes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A pony  bit me earlier.\\" As it happened, the bite was virtually painless: more the kind of small bite you might get from a naughty child. The pony responsible was queuing up for some ice cream in the car park near Haytor, and perhaps thought I'd jumped in ahead of him. The reason why the ponies here are naughty is that Haytor is a tourist-heavy area and tourists are constantly feeding the ponies foods, despite sighs asking them not to. By feeding the ponies, tourists increase the risk of them getting hit by a car, and make them harder to gather during the area's annual pony drift . The purpose of a pony drift is to gather them up so their health can be checked, the baby ones can be stooped from feeding on their mother's milk, and those who've gone beyond their limited area can be returned to their correct area. Some of them are also later sold, in order to limit the number of ponies according to the rules set by Natural England. Three weeks ago, I witnessed a small near-disaster a few mils west of here. While walking, I noticed a pony roll over on his back. \\"Hello!\\" I said to him, assuming he was just rolling for fun, but he was very still and, as I got closer, I saw him kicking his legs in the air and breathing heavily.

The officer immediately sent a local farmer out to check on the pony. The pony had actually been trapped between two rocks. The farmer freed him, and he began to run happily around again.

Write a summary based on this article: A man who was injured by a suicide bomb blast in Hangu lies while awaiting treatment at the Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar on May 26, 2011.      ISLAMABAD |      ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed 24 people in Pakistan on Thursday in the latest militant attack since the death of Osama bin Laden which has angered Pakistan and led to a call for the United States to withdraw some of its military trainers.      The killing of bin Laden by U.S. special forces in a Pakistani town on May 2 has sparked a wave of militant attacks and has also led to a sharp erosion of trust between Pakistan and its ally, the United States.      A suicide car-bomber set off explosives outside a police station in the northwestern town of Hangu a day after a similar attack destroyed a police station in the city of Peshawar.      \\"We're trying to remove rubble and there's fear some people could be trapped,\\" a government official in Hangu, Adil Siddique, told Reuters by telephone.      Police said the toll could rise beyond 24 as many among 45 people wounded were in serious condition.      Pakistani Taliban militants, allied with al Qaeda, claimed responsibility. They have vowed revenge for bin Laden's death.      The raid that killed bin Laden at his compound in Abbottabad, 50 km (30 miles) northwest of Islamabad, intensified U.S. questions about Pakistan's possible role in sheltering militants, straining an already fragile relationship.      But many Pakistanis saw the top-secret U.S. raid as a violation of sovereignty and some members of parliament have asked for a review of ties with Washington, which gives Pakistan billions of dollars in aid to help in the war against Islamist militants.      Pakistan had informed the United States in the last week or two that it would not need some U.S. special forces trainers advising the Pakistani military, the Pentagon said.      Pakistani security officials said the decision came three days after the al Qaeda leader's death.      \\"We don't need unnecessary people here. They cause problems for us instead of being helpful,\\" said a Pakistani security official who declined to be identified. He said the withdrawal might start by early June.      Another Pakistani security official said the decision was made because of concerns over the Americans' security and because \\"resentment all around was very high.\\"      Pentagon spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan said there had been \\"no real change\\" to the small U.S. military training mission in Pakistan.      The number of trainers in Pakistan was not disclosed but Lapan said the entire military mission has ranged between 200 and 300 people.      Other Pakistani and U.S. military sources in Pakistan have said the special forces training component formerly numbered about 120 and would be drawn down to less than 50.      Other U.S. troops are involved in helicopter maintenance, liaising with the Pakistani military and aid efforts. It is unclear if they will also be withdrawn.      \\"Essential people are being asked to stay,\\" the second security official said. \\"This includes SSG (special forces) and technical assistance.\\"      While seeking answers to questions surrounding bin Laden's movements, the United States has been keen to prevent a complete breakdown in relations with an ally whose help is seen as essential for efforts to stabilize neighboring Afghanistan.      \\"BITTER FIGHT\\"      While hinting that Pakistan could do more in its counter-terrorism efforts, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised it as a \\"good partner.\\"      \\"We do have a set of expectations that we are looking for the Pakistani government to meet, but I want to underscore in conclusion it is not as though they have been on the sidelines,\\" Clinton told a news conference in Paris. She gave no details.      \\"They have been actively engaged in their own bitter fight ... and we are going to look to put our partnership on as strong a foundation going forward as possible,\\" she said.      As the United States starts to withdraw troops from Afghanistan this year and some U.S. lawmakers are urging the Obama administration to reconsider assistance to Pakistan in the wake of the bin Laden raid.      U.S. aid has also led to quarrels between Pakistan's civilian government and its armed forces over how U.S. military funds were spent, according to WikiLeaks, highlighting the turf battles and lack of transparency over billions of dollars.      U.S. diplomatic cables in 2009, published by Dawn newspaper, showed then Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin asked the U.S. embassy to keep him informed of American aid given directly to the military, saying the army chief did not pass on the information.      At the same time, some Pakistan government officials feared money from a special reimbursement fund was being \\"siphoned off into private coffers.\\" Washington, too, was concerned military funds were being diverted by the civilian government for social programs, cables said.      Many critics wonder if U.S. aid is misspent to beef up Pakistan's military capabilities against old rival India, or possibly to bolster its nuclear weapons program.      Pakistan has received 20.7 billion worth of U.S. assistance over the past decade, about two-thirds of it military aid intended to improve the army's capabilities against militants.

The attack took place just weeks after the killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. special forces in Abbottabad, Pakistan, which led to an increase in militant attacks and a significant decline in trust between the two countries. The Pakistani Taliban, allied with al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing in Hangu, vowing revenge for bin Laden's death. The bombing targeted a police station, coming after a similar attack on a police station in Peshawar. Rescue efforts were complicated as some individuals were possibly trapped under the rubble.

Con Conquest of Mexico .\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The conquest of Mexico lasted a long time.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"Con Conquest of Mexico,\\" it is not entirely clear what specific events or time period the statement is referring to. However, if we assume that this premise is referring to the historical series of events associated with the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, which was a significant part of the larger Spanish colonization of the Americas, we can analyze the hypothesis \\"The conquest of Mexico lasted a long time.\\" The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, led by Hernán Cortés, began in 1519 and ended in 1521. The Aztec Empire, centered in Mexico and led by Moctezuma II at the time, was a highly advanced and complex civilization. Following initial meetings and diplomacy between the Spanish and the Aztecs, the relationships between the two groups quickly deteriorated. The conquest was characterized by significant battles, political maneuvering, and eventual subjugation of the Aztec Empire. The timeline for the conquest of Mexico can be seen as quite short, as it lasted only two years from 1519 to 1521. However, considering the complexity of the Aztec Empire and the extent of the Spanish colonization efforts in the Americas, one could argue that the complete subjugation of indigenous populations and the establishment of stable Spanish rule took much longer than the initial conquest. Following the fall of the Aztec Empire, there were numerous uprisings, confrontations, and tensions between the Spanish colonizers and the indigenous populations. The process of \\"pacification\\" conducted by the Spanish authorities, which aimed to suppress indigenous resistance, took many years to complete. The Spanish colonizers employed a variety of tactics, including forced labor systems and the spread of European diseases, which significantly contributed to the decline of the indigenous population. Furthermore, the integration of the remaining indigenous peoples into the newly formed colonial society took several generations, as many aspects of indigenous culture and religion were forcibly suppressed and replaced with Spanish culture and Catholicism. The lasting impacts of the Spanish conquest of Mexico can still be observed today in the cultural, demographic, and linguistic features of modern Mexican society. In conclusion, while the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, which can be considered a significant aspect of the conquest of Mexico, took only two years, the process of subjugating, assimilating, and controlling the indigenous populations and territories took much longer, lasting several generations. Taking this broader perspective into consideration, the hypothesis \\"The conquest of Mexico lasted a long time.\\" can be regarded as true. However, it is important to note that this analysis is based on the assumption that the premise \\"Con Conquest of Mexico\\" refers to the historical events associated with the Spanish colonization of the Aztec Empire and its surrounding territories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A soldier can be an enlisted person, a non-commissioned officer, or an officer.  - A non-commissioned officer or noncommissioned officer (NCO, colloquially non-com or noncom) is a military officer who has not earned a commission. Such is also called sub-officer in some countries. Non-commissioned officers, in the English-speaking world, usually obtain their position of authority by promotion through the enlisted ranks. In contrast, commissioned officers hold higher ranks than NCOs, have more legal responsibilities, are paid more, and often have more non-military training such as a university diploma. Commissioned officers usually earn their commissions without having risen through the enlisted ranks. \\"Mustang\\" is a slang term in the United States Armed Forces used to refer to a commissioned officer who began his or her career as an enlisted service member.  - Secession (derived from the Latin term \\"secessio\\") is the withdrawal of a group from a larger entity, especially a political entity (a country), but also any organization, union or military alliance. Threats of secession can also be a strategy for achieving more limited goals.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'occupation'.

Article: The man who invented Coca-Cola was not a native Atlanta, but on the day of his funeral every drugstore in town shut up the shop in honor of him. He was John Styth Pemberton, born in 1833 in Knoxville, Georgia, eighty miles away. Pemberton was a chemist, sometimes known as Doctor, who, during the Civil War, became an officer and led a cavalry troop. He settled in Atlanta in 1869, and soon began making such patent medicines as Triplex Liver Pills and Globe of Flower Cough Syrup. In 1885, he registered a trademark for something called French Wine Coca-Ideal Nerve and Tonic Stimulant. A few months later, he formed the Pemberton Chemical Company, and hired an accountant named Frank M. Robinson, who had not only a good head for figures, but, attached to it, so unique a nose that he could judge the ingredients of a batch of syrup merely by sniffing it. In 1886 --- a year in which, as contemporary Coca-Cola officials like to point out, the English writer Conan Doyle made Sherlock Holmes known publicly and France found the truth about the Statue of Liberty --- Pemberton invented a syrup that he called Coca-Cola. It was a change of his French Wine Coca. He had taken out the wine and added a bit of caffeine, and, when the end product tasted awful, had thrown in some cola nut oil and a few other oils, mixing the mixture in a three-legged iron pot in his back yard and swishing it around with an oar. He distributed it to soda fountains in used beer bottles, and Robinson, with his elegant account's script, instantly designed a label, on which \\"Coca-Cola\\" was written in the style which is still employed. Pemberton looked upon his mixture less as a drink than as a headache cure. One morning in 1886, a man suffering from a headache dragged himself into an Atlanta drugstore and asked for a bottle of Coca-Cola. According to usual practice, druggists should pour a teaspoonful of syrup into a glass of water, but at that time, the man on duty was too lazy to walk to the fresh-water tap. Instead, he mixed the syrup with some soda... Question: How did Pemberton change French Wine Coca formula to make it taste delicious? Options: A: He mixed it with several oils instead of water.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Consumer Prices Post Sharp Annual Drop WASHINGTON -Consumer prices were flat in July as energy costs retreated following a big surge in June. Over the past 12 months, prices dropped the most in nearly six decades as the recession and lower energy costs kept a lid on inflation. The Commerce Department says consumer prices showed no changed in July, in line with analysts' expectations and far below the 0.7 percent jump in June. Prices fell 2.1 percent over the past 12 months, the biggest annual decline since a similar drop in the period ending in January 1950. Most of the past year's decline reflects energy prices falling 28.1 percent since peaking in July 2008. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. WASHINGTON (AP) — Retail sales dropped in July, government data showed, reinforcing concerns among economists that consumers won't spend enough to help a recovery take hold. But Friday is expected to bring better news: July inflation is expected to have remained flat, and industrial production is likely to have grown for the first time in nine months. Thursday's retail sales report served as a reality check for an economy that lately has appeared poised to emerge from recession and grow again. Consumer spending powers about 70 percent of economic activity. The Cash for Clunkers rebate program helped give auto sales their biggest jump in six months in July, but sales sank elsewhere. Gas stations, department stores, electronics outlets and furniture stores all suffered. Overall, sales fell 0.1 percent, the Commerce Department said, after two months of modest gains. Economists had expected a 0.7 percent increase. Excluding autos, sales fell 0.6 percent, also much worse than predicted. Unemployment, flat wages, tighter credit, fear of layoffs and the urge to save more have caused many consumers to spend less. Shrinking home equity and stock portfolios have compounded the problem. As a result, \\"households are in no position to drive a decent economic recovery,\\" Paul Dales, U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients. Even Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which had managed to post robust sales during the recession, reported an unexpected drop in quarterly earnings. The company faulted lower prices for groceries and other products. But it warned that the economy continues to force customers to scale back their purchases. Still, low prices should provide some comfort for consumers. The worst recession since World War II has kept prices in check, as workers can't demand higher pay due to the scarcity of jobs. Companies have been unable to boost prices because of weak demand. Over the 12 months ending in June, consumer prices fell 1.4 percent, the biggest decline in almost six decades. That trend is expected to continue when the Labor Department reports the consumer price index figures for July on Friday at 8:30 a.m. EDT. The latest figures came just a day after the Federal Reserve said the economy appeared to be \\"leveling out.\\" The Fed, signaling the recession appears to be ending, said it would hold interest rates at their current record lows. The success of Cash for Clunkers is also expected to push industrial production up 0.3 percent in July. If the forecast is correct, the increase would come after industrial production fell in 17 of the previous 18 months. The report is slated to be released Friday at 9:15 a.m. EDT. But some analysts say people buying cars under Cash for Clunkers might be holding that money back from other sectors of the economy where they might otherwise spend it. Some of Europe's largest economies also benefited from government programs to support the auto industry. Germany and France returned to economic growth in the second quarter, raising hopes the recession will end throughout Europe sooner than thought. In the United States, weak retail sales were widespread in July. One gauge that excludes autos, gas and building materials fell slightly, the fifth straight month of declines. Department store sales fell 1.6 percent last month. And the broader category of general merchandise stores, which includes big chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp., dropped 0.8 percent. Gas station sales plunged 2.1 percent in July — more because of falling prices at the pump than shrinking demand. On Wall Street, stocks rose modestly. The Dow Jones industrials finished up about 37 points at just above 9,398 — their highest close since the market lows of early March. Employers cut the fewest number of jobs in July in nearly a year, and the unemployment rate fell for the first time in 15 months. But jobs remain scarce. More than 6.2 million Americans are receiving jobless benefits, the government said Thursday — 140,000 fewer than the previous week. Counting people taking advantage of an unemployment benefits program enacted by Congress, 9.25 million people received unemployment compensation in the week that ended July 25, down about 100,000 from the week before, as new claims rose but some recipients ran out of benefits and fell off the rolls, economists said. The nonprofit National Employment Law Project has calculated that 540,000 people will exhaust their emergency benefits without finding work by the end of September. And by the end of the year, it predicts 1.5 million will run out. That prospect has some in Congress calling for a further extension of benefits. Obama administration officials have said they would support an extension. AP Business Writers Martin Crutsinger and Alan Zibel in Washington, and Anne D'Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

The Corbett administration said its lawsuit seeking to halt same-sex marriage licenses in Montgomery County \\"would have no direct effect\\" on the couples who have already received them.

Thirty-two of the couples have petitioned to intervene in the case, arguing that a ruling against Hanes could also invalidate their marriages.

Tom Corbett's attorneys said Wednesday.      Corbett's administration has filed a lawsuit seeking to block same-sex marriage licenses in suburban Philadelphia, where Montgomery County Register of Wills D. Bruce Hanes has issued more than 150 to gay and lesbian couples since July 24.      State attorneys said in a court filing on Wednesday the gay marriage licenses have no \\"value or legitimacy'' and can't be defended in court. They compared gay and lesbian couples to children, who can't marry because a 1996 law says marriage is between a man and a woman.      \\"Had the clerk issued marriage licenses to 12-year-olds in violation of state law, would anyone seriously contend that each 12-year-old ... is entitled to a hearing on the validity of his 'license'?'' the state wrote in a case brief.      The state Department of Health brought the case against Hanes. Hanes, who says the state law is unconstitutional and discriminatory, is scheduled to appear in Commonwealth Court next week in the case.      More than 30 gay and lesbian couples that received marriage licenses from Hanes say a ruling against him could invalidate their marriages, and they've sought to participate in the case.      The state opposes their participation and their efforts to defend what it calls their \\"purported marriage licenses.'' It said the gay and lesbian couples should file their own lawsuits or wait to see what happens with a federal challenge to the state's marriage law.      \\"This case is about one thing: whether a local official may willfully disregard a statute based on his personal legal opinion that the statute is unconstitutional,'' the state's lawyers wrote.      The Commonwealth Court last week laid out the topics to be argued at the Sept. 4 hearing on the marriage licenses issued by Hanes. It wants lawyers to focus on whether the court has jurisdiction, given that Hanes is a judicial officer.      Other questions are whether issuing marriage licenses is a judicial act and whether the constitutionality of the state's marriage law can be raised as a defense.      Also at issue are whether the Department of Health has standing to sue, and, if not, the effect of Democratic Attorney General Kathleen Kane's delegation of defense of the law to the governor's legal staff.

He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house.

It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore.

Please write a short summary for the following article: A Gutsy Gut Renovation in London The house that Caroline Baldwin and Brian Taylor bought has been described—and by its former owner, to boot—as “the most expensive slum in Britain.” And while £1.8 million, or 2.5 million, isn’t especially expensive by London standards, it is certainly a lot to pay for a Georgian townhouse so decrepit that the first thing the couple did was put up scaffolding to stop it falling down around them. “It was in such a bad state that we were advised we couldn’t even go in to some of the rooms in case the ceilings fell,” said Mrs. Baldwin. Now, after a top-to-bottom renovation, this former slum is a light-filled family house. And, although the restoration project cost 1.27 million, the work, plus strong market conditions over the past four years, means the house is now valued at an estimated 5.7 million. Their house, in the affluent northwest London neighborhood of Islington, had been owned for decades by Fran and Jay Landesman, an elderly and rather eccentric couple whose lifestyle has been chronicled in British newspapers by their journalist son, Cosmo. He gave their home the “most expensive slum” moniker in a newspaper article in 2010, recounting how his aging hippie parents refused to throw anything away and regarded cleaning as a “bourgeois hang-up.” After Fran and Jay died, Mr. Landesman put the house up for sale, and in 2012 the Baldwin-Taylors agreed to buy it. The couple—he’s 43 and she’s 36—had been living in Ghana, working for a shipping and logistics company. But they wanted to return to Britain full time so that their daughter Maya, now 7, could be educated in England. The neglected house’s structural instability was one challenge the family faced. The other was that, because the house was an example of classic Georgian architecture, any work they carried out had to be approved by the local council. Initially, the couple had hoped to enlarge the kitchen but were refused building permits. Instead they added a garden room at the end of their backyard and expanded the existing basement—moves that increased the property’s square footage from 2,850 square feet to around 3,000 square feet. Along with shoring up precarious ceilings, waterproofing the basement, and restoring load-bearing walls that the Landesmans had knocked down, the homeowners’ main challenge was to conserve the house’s original features with the help of Gerard Rainey, senior architect at the firm Architecture for London. “We wanted to retain as much of the Georgian features as we could,” said Mrs. Baldwin. “The house also felt very dark, and very convoluted, and we wanted to make it as bright, and as classy, as possible.” They reclaimed original wide pine floorboards from elsewhere in the house to restore the living room floor. They hunted down a grate for the fireplace that was also of the correct period to fit the house and replaced postwar windows with modern re-creations of original Georgian sash windows. Their kitchen is an exercise in simplicity: wood cabinets painted gray; chunky, white Corian countertops and a white marble-tiled backsplash. While the palette in most of the rest of the house is pale and neutral, Mrs. Baldwin has let her love of color loose in the living room, with sofas in rich navy blue, teal and purple. Double doors open onto a study, with walls painted a deep charcoal that sets off a modern, scarlet chandelier. The couple’s master bedroom suite, one of the home’s four bedrooms, is at the top of the five-story property. The build started in July 2014, and the family moved in last April. Work continued until August on the basement, which now has a living room, bedroom and bathroom. The adjacent “coal hole” is now a kitchen. Outside, they added a decked terrace area with built-in barbecue and steps that lead down to a paved patio framed by curved, raised flower beds. Mr. Rainey worked around a London plane tree, designing a garden room with a curved roof echoing the flower beds. This room could be a study or a sitting room, but is currently being used as a guest bedroom suite. The family is now settling into their new home. “It is fantastic,” said Mrs. Baldwin. “I used to walk through this street as a teenager and think how I would love to live here one day, so in many ways it is a culmination of a very old dream for me.”","output":"Caroline Baldwin and Brian Taylor purchased a run-down Georgian townhouse for £1.8 million (2.5 million) in Islington, a wealthy area in northwest London.

Gather materials: Before starting, gather the necessary materials, which include the paper, cardboard, and glue. Using glue is the best option here, as it is specifically designed for attaching paper and similar materials, whereas soldering is meant for joining metal components. 2. Align the paper: Place the paper on a flat surface, ensuring it is properly aligned over the cardboard. This step is crucial for making sure the paper attaches to the cardboard neatly and without any unsightly wrinkles or creases. 3. Apply glue: Apply glue to the back of the paper or directly onto the cardboard surface, depending on the type of glue you're using. Be sure to follow the glue's instructions to make sure you're using the appropriate amount and application method. 4. Attach paper to cardboard: Carefully place the paper onto the glued surface of the cardboard. Press down gently and evenly across the entire surface of the paper to eliminate any air bubbles and ensure a strong bond between the paper and cardboard. 5. Allow time to dry: Once the paper is in place, give it time to dry according to the glue manufacturer's recommended drying time. This might vary depending on the specific glue brand and type being used. 6. Trim excess edges: If any excess paper or glue is visible along the edges of the cardboard, trim it off carefully with a pair of scissors or a utility knife.

Most follow the women-in-prison formula, only relocated to a concentration camp, death camp, or Nazi brothel, and with an added emphasis on sadism, gore, and degradation. The most infamous and influential title (which set the standards of the genre) is a Canadian production, \\"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\\" (1974). Its surprise success and sequels led European film-makers, mostly in Italy, to produce dozens of similar films. While the \\"Ilsa\\" series were profitable, the other films were mostly box-office flops, and the genre all but vanished by the mid-1980s.  - Love Camp 7 is a 1969 U.S. women - in - prison Nazi exploitation B - movie directed by Lee Frost and written by Wes Bishop and Bob Cresse , the latter of whom also acts as a sadistic camp commandant .  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - An exploitation film is a film that attempts to succeed financially by exploiting current trends, niche genres, or lurid content.  - A brothel or bordello is a place where people may come to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute, sometimes referred to as a sex worker.

From the very beginning, the film struggles to establish a coherent storyline, leaving audiences confused and disoriented amidst a sea of disjointed scenes. Director John Foster's thinly veiled attempts to integrate magic, fantasy, and drama fall flat as the film's pacing awkwardly staggers between languid exposition and frenzied action sequences. The Forgotten Forest's artificial dialogue lands with a resounding thud, its hollow words devoid of any genuine emotion or wit. Undeniably, the film squanders the potential of an initially intriguing premise - a hidden forest with mystical powers - succumbing to a perplexing mishmash of undercooked ideas that lead nowhere. Aside from its narrative issues, The Forgotten Forest is further mitigated by subpar performances from its woefully miscast ensemble. Lead actor Michael Reeves delivers a wooden and unconvincing portrayal of the protagonist, Alex, leaving much to be desired in terms of emotional depth and believability. Likewise, the supporting cast feels bland and uninspired, leaving audiences hard-pressed to invest in their struggles and triumphs. Moreover, the film's visuals and special effects do little to salvage the overall experience. The forest's supposedly enchanting setting appears artificial and markedly unremarkable, punctuated by moments of laughably amateurish CGI. Even the film's score, composed by the normally reliable Stephen Richards, lacks the necessary gravitas to elevate the story to a more captivating level – ultimately proving to be just another disappointment in a long line of unfulfilled promises. In conclusion, The Forgotten Forest regrettably amounts to a forgettable and uninspiring viewing experience. Hindered by an incoherent plot, flat characters, and uninspired visuals, this movie falls short of providing any semblance of entertainment or emotional impact.

Bruce Jenner comes out as transgender, says 'I am a woman' NEW YORK (AP) — In the 1970s, Bruce Jenner was a symbol of American masculinity as an Olympic champion. Nearly 40 years later, in an extraordinary television interview, Jenner told the world that he identifies as a woman and has felt gender confusion since he was a little boy growing up in the New York suburbs. Jenner let his hair down — literally loosening a ponytail and letting his hair flow past his shoulders — in a symbolic moment at the start of his two-hour interview with ABC News' Diane Sawyer that was televised Friday. \\"Yes, for all intents and purposes, I am a woman.\\" For the transgender community, it was a moment as significant as Ellen DeGeneres' coming out as a lesbian was for gays nearly 20 years ago. DeGeneres tweeted support to Jenner, saying the former Olympian was \\"saving lives and opening minds.\\" \\"My whole life has been getting me ready for this,\\" said Jenner, 65, known to a younger generation as the patriarch of television's omnipresent Kardashian clan. \\"It's not just the last few years as they've been treating me as a joke.\\" The interview was filmed in February in Los Angeles and New York, before a fatal car accident in which Jenner was involved. The Nielsen company said an audience of just fewer than 17 million people saw the interview. Jenner said he self-identifies as \\"her,\\" not a specific name. But he told Sawyer he felt comfortable using the pronouns \\"he\\" and \\"him,\\" a designation that is an important issue for many in the transgender community, which believes that transgender people should be referred to by the pronouns with which they choose to identify. Jenner said his \\"brain is more female than it is male.\\" He said he began gender reassignment therapy in the 1980s — taking hormones, having surgery to make his nose smaller and having hair removed from his face and chest — but gave it up. As Jenner got older, he realized that if he got sick and faced death without facing up to this issue, \\"I'd be so mad that I didn't explore that side of my life.\\" As a young boy, Jenner felt an urge to try on his mother's and sister's dresses. \\"I didn't know why I was doing it,\\" he said. \\"It just made me feel good.\\" Jenner said he has never been sexually attracted to men, and he wanted to make clear to viewers that gender identity and sexuality were separate things. \\"I am not gay,\\" he said. \\"I am, as far as I know, heterosexual. I've always been with a woman, raising kids.\\" Jenner said he has not decided whether he will undergo sexual reassignment surgery. \\"These are all things that are out there in the future for me to explore,\\" he said. \\"There's no rush for that. And I would do it so quietly that nobody in the world would know.\\" Jenner's four oldest children appeared on the interview special to support their father, but not the two girls he had with Kris Kardashian. He said his stepdaughter Kim has been a big supporter, urged on by husband Kanye West, but that his stepdaughter Khloe was taking it the hardest. Jenner's first two wives offered messages of support; ABC said Kris Kardashian's publicist called to specifically say his third wife would have no comment. But Kardashian tweeted that no one had asked for comment and, after the interview aired, tweeted: \\"Not only was I able to call him my husband for 25 years and father of my children, I am now able to call him my hero.\\" Jenner told Sawyer that Kris was having a difficult time with it, and that if she better understood it, the couple would probably still be together. Jenner's 89-year-old mother also was interviewed, saying she was more proud of Bruce than when he stood as an Olympic champion in Montreal. The E! Entertainment network announced that Jenner would be part of a documentary series about the transition that would begin airing on July 26. Hollywood offered support. \\"Tonight\\" host Jimmy Fallon, echoing Neil Armstrong when the astronaut took his first steps on the moon, tweeted: \\"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\\" \\"Today, millions of people learned that someone they know is transgender,\\" said GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. \\"By sharing this story, Bruce Jenner has shined a light on what it means to be transgender and live authentically in the face of unimaginable public scrutiny. Though Jenner's journey is one that is deeply personal, it is also one that will impact and inspire countless people around the world.\\" Jenner showed Sawyer a closet filled with dresses and men's clothes. Sawyer said she had a private dinner with Jenner where he wore a dress, but the former Olympian did not appear in one in the ABC special. Jenner said his two youngest daughters, suspecting that each other was secretly using her clothes, set up a computer to catch the other in the act — only to find their father using their full-length mirror wearing one of his own dresses. \\"I would like to think that we can save some lives here,\\" said Jenner, who admitted he once considered suicide at a low point when seen by paparazzi heading to a surgery to have his Adam's apple shaved back. \\"I have a feeling this is my cause in life. This is why God put me on this Earth, to deal with this issue.\\" What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"In April 2015, former Olympian, Bruce Jenner, publicly came out as transgender in an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC News. Bruce, now Caitlyn Jenner, revealed that she had felt gender confusion since her childhood and had self-identified as a woman. During the interview, Jenner discussed her journey and experiences with gender transition, including undergoing gender reassignment therapy in the 1980s. The interview was considered a significant moment in raising awareness and acceptance of the transgender community, similar to Ellen DeGeneres' coming out as a lesbian in 1997."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Moccasins are the best option, but a simple flat, brown slip-on shoe would coordinate with the look. Basic brown suede boots would also work as long as they have a flat sole. Fur-lined or fringed boots can add some flair to your costume.  If you do not expect to walk through mud puddles, you can also wear moccasin-style slippers. Simple brown sandals could also work as long as they are not embellished with other decorations. Start with a brown cloth headband that wraps around the head rather than over it. Use a hot glue gun to attach one to three feathers to the inside of the headband. Position them so they are at the side of the head and behind the ear.  If you cannot find a brown wrap-around headband, cut a strip of stretchy brown fabric that is long enough to fit around the wearer's head and add an extra 1-inch (2.5-cm) to the length. Loop the strip of fabric around to create a band, using fabric glue or hot glue to secure the extra 1-inch (2.5-cm) of fabric over the other end of the band. If you want to give your headband extra flair, decorate it with wooden beads, colorful seed beads, or craft paint. If you want to add a little extra shape to your tunic, tie a braided leather sash around the wearer's waist. If you can’t find a sash or belt without a buckle, cut a strip of brown leather, canvas, or brown rope that is long enough to wrap around the waist. Make sure to cut enough extra material so you can tie the belt into a loose bow at the front of the costume. A fringed leather belt can add an attractive touch to your costume too.

In the first act we meet the Ekdahl family -- large, joyous, prosperous. Then Oscar (Allan Edwall), father of Alexander (Bertil Guve) who might be 11 and Fanny (Pernilla Allwin) who might be 7, dies.In act two, Oscar appears to his children. Alexander asks why he doesn't go off to Heaven. Oscar replies that he doesn't want to leave those he lived with. The children's mother remarries in less than a year, going to a strict Bishop Edvard Vergerus' (Jan Malmsjö) house with none of her furniture, none of the children's toys, and an optimism that she can make a good thing of it despite his powerfully controlling personality. Alexander learns from the ghost of the Bishop's first wife that she and her children died trying to escape after having been locked up for days. They climbed out a window but failed to make it across the cold fast-flowing stream that separates the back of the house from the town. Alexander tells this to a servant who repeats it to the Bishop. The Bishop must discredit this story, and demands retraction. Then he locks up the boy.In act three, Isak (Erland Josephson), a family friend, arrives at the house, ostensibly to buy a chest, but actually to smuggle the children out of the house (in the chest!). During this escape, the ghosts of his former family appear to the Bishop. The children are kept for the moment in Isak's house, where Alexander meets Ismael Retzinsky (Stina Ekblad) whose paranormal abilities help Alexander start a fire in the Bishop's house, a fire that is fatal to the hated step-father.In the final act, mother (Ewa Fröling) and children are back in the warm comfort of their extended family's house. Gustav (Jarl Kulle), the late Oscar's brother, gives a toast in which he summarizes the play. Without mentioning ghosts explicitly, he says there are things we know and should enjoy, such as food and dance, and many more aspects of life of which we are ignorant.

They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft. The next morning, Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias's lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy but cannot get them off of Mathias.

What are some good projects to learn Haskell language?","output":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. While both questions are related to the Haskell programming language, they address different aspects and goals. Question 1: How shall I convince you to consider Haskell as an official language in OpenAI? This question aims to gather information and arguments that could be used to persuade someone (in this case, most likely OpenAI) to consider Haskell as an official language for their projects. The focus here is on the reasons and benefits that Haskell could bring to the organization and why it should be adopted as an official language. A detailed and long answer for this question would involve providing an outline of:  1. Haskell's unique features and advantages:    - Purely functional programming: Emphasizes immutability and the absence of side effects, which helps create clean, modular, and maintainable code.    - Strong static typing: Helps catch many errors during the compilation process and prevents a wide range of runtime errors, improving code reliability.    - Lazy evaluation: Allows for efficient, high-level programming abstractions by evaluating expressions only when necessary.    - Concurrency and parallelism support: Provides lightweight threads and synchronization primitives that make Haskell a suitable choice for concurrent and parallel programming tasks.    2. Success stories of organizations and projects using Haskell:    - Companies like Facebook, Standard Chartered Bank, and Galois have successfully adopted Haskell for their projects.    - Open-source projects such as Cardano, a decentralized cryptocurrency platform, and Pandoc, a universal document converter, employ Haskell for critical components.    3. The growing Haskell community and ecosystem:    - Numerous libraries and tools, such as Stack and Cabal for package management, Hackage as a package repository, and frameworks like Yesod for web development, are available to Haskell developers.    - There are numerous events and meetups, such as the Haskell eXchange conference and ZuriHac, dedicated to learning, discussing, and promoting Haskell.    - Online resources like Learn You a Haskell for Great Good and Haskell School of Music provide high-quality educational materials for learning Haskell. Question 2: What are some good projects to learn the Haskell language? This question focuses on exploring potential projects that can help someone learn the Haskell programming language. The aim here is to provide ideas and suggestions for hands-on practical experience to learn and practice Haskell effectively. A detailed and long answer for this question would involve providing a list of suggested project ideas, such as: 1. Command-line utilities:    - Implement common Unix utilities like \\"grep,\\" \\"cat,\\" or \\"wc\\" in Haskell to understand basic syntax, data structures, and IO operations. 2. Functional data structures:    - Implement classic data structures (for example, stacks, queues, and trees) using functional programming concepts to grasp the basic principles of Haskell. 3. Web applications:    - Use a web development framework such as Yesod to create a simple web application, such as a blog or a to-do list app. 4. Parser combinators:    - Write a parser for a programming language or markup format (e.g., JSON, XML, or a simple calculator language) using parser combinators to get acquainted with the world of monads and applicative functors. 5. Implement a simple game:    - Create a text-based or a simple graphical game using the Gloss or SDL library to understand the interaction between functional programming and realtime systems. 6. A Projects Euler solver:    - Solve math problems from the Project Euler website using Haskell's expressive and concise syntax to boost your problem-solving skills using functional concepts. These two questions serve distinct purposes - one focusing on advocating for Haskell's adoption in an organization and the other on providing project ideas for learning Haskell. While they are both related to Haskell, the inquiries target separate aspects of the language and its usage, and thus, they do not have the same meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given an arithmetic operation in Italian and you have to find its answer. The operations 'addition' and 'subtraction' have been replaced with their italian translations i.e you need to perform addition when you see 'aggiunta' and subtraction in case of 'sottrazione'. Q: 2779 aggiunta 4009 sottrazione 3483 sottrazione 2614 sottrazione 1960 sottrazione 4254 A:","output":"To find the answer, we will complete the operation step-by-step from left to right, using the Italian words for addition ('aggiunta') and subtraction ('sottrazione'). Starting from the left, you have: 1. '2779 aggiunta 4009' translates to '2779 plus 4009'. Adding 2779 and 4009 leads to 6788. 2. Then, '6788 sottrazione 3483' translates to '6788 minus 3483'. Subtracting 3483 from 6788 leaves a remainder of 3305. 3. Moving on, '3305 sottrazione 2614' becomes '3305 minus 2614'. This gives us 691. 4. To that, we apply '691 sottrazione 1960' or '691 minus 1960'. Since 1960 is greater than 691, the result will be a negative value: -1269. 5. Finally, '-1269 sottrazione 4254' means '-1269 minus 4254'. Again, since 4254 is greater than 1269 (even if 1269 is negative), the result is a more negative value: -5523. So, 2779 aggiunta 4009 sottrazione 3483 sottrazione 2614 sottrazione 1960 sottrazione 4254 equals -5523."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which woman is less likely to have hemophilia?  Hint: Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body's ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe.

Between the third and fourth sessions the pope announced reforms in the areas of Roman Curia, revision of Canon Law, regulations for mixed marriages involving several faiths, and birth control issues. He opened the final session of the council, concelebrating with bishops from countries where the Church was persecuted. Several texts proposed for his approval had to be changed. But all texts were finally agreed upon. The Council was concluded on 8 December 1965, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What does the Catholic church considered \\"mixed\\" in a \\"mixed marriage\\"?","output":"A \\"mixed marriage\\" in the context of the Catholic Church refers to a marriage between a Catholic and a non-Catholic individual. The non-Catholic partner can be a baptized Christian from another denomination, or a non-Christian (someone who follows other religions or has no religious affiliation). The Catholic Church has guidelines and regulations for mixed marriages to ensure that the religious beliefs of both parties are respected, and the Catholic partner remains loyal and supportive of the Catholic faith. In the past, the Catholic Church showed greater caution and concern regarding mixed marriages due to the potential risks in upholding and preserving the Catholic faith within such relationships. This concern stems from the challenges that could arise from differences in religious beliefs and practices, which might complicate the couple's commitment to raising their children in the Catholic tradition. Therefore, the Church has always preferred marriages between Catholics. However, the Church, recognizing the complex and diverse nature of modern society, allows mixed marriages under specific conditions. According to the 1983 Code of Canon Law, Canon 1124 declares that mixed marriages cannot take place without the necessary permission from the local ordinary, usually the bishop. The Catholic partner must obtain this permission, acknowledging their responsibility to preserve their faith and do all within their power to have their children baptized and raised as Catholics. The non-Catholic partner must be informed of these promises and intentions, and the Church emphasizes the importance of the couple's mutual respect for each other's beliefs. During the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), the Church discussed the need for a more pastoral approach to mixed marriages. In the reforms announced by Pope Paul VI, the Church acknowledged the need to revise regulations surrounding mixed marriages to address the challenges faced by couples in interfaith relationships. This revision sought to promote better understanding, respect, and cooperation between the Catholic Church and other Christian communities and non-Christian religions. In summary, the Catholic Church considers a marriage \\"mixed\\" when it involves a Catholic and a non-Catholic partner. The Church has regulations and guidelines in place to maintain the integrity of the Catholic faith within such marriages, but it also fosters a more pastoral and understanding approach to the diverse and complex nature of modern relationships."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While it provides important information about the organization's governance and financial structure, it does not mention its founding or founder. The American Red Cross was founded by Clara Barton on May 21, 1881. She was a nurse, educator, and humanitarian who first came into contact with the International Red Cross while providing aid during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871). On her return to the United States, she campaigned for the establishment of a similar organization in the country. With the help of John D. Rockefeller and other prominent individuals, she eventually succeeded in founding the American Red Cross. As mentioned in the given statement, the American Red Cross was issued a corporate charter by the United States Congress under Title 36 of the United States Code, Section 3001. It is governed by volunteers and supported by community donations, income from health and safety training, products, and income from blood products. Despite not mentioning Clara Barton as the founder, the statement does provide crucial context on how the American Red Cross functions and is funded.

Negative Yelp Review: Title: Disappointing Experience at the Hypothetical Café I rarely write reviews, but my recent experience at the Hypothetical Café has compelled me to share my disappointment. Being a popular spot in town, my expectations were high; however, the café failed to meet those standards on multiple levels, from the food and drinks to the service and atmosphere. Upon walking into the café, I immediately noticed the chipped and worn furniture and the overly cramped seating arrangement. The lack of attention to the café's ambiance was a red flag, but my friends and I still chose to give it a try. As we glanced over the menu, we initially found it quite extensive, offering a wide range of both sweet and savory options. Unfortunately, this excitement would not last long. After placing our orders, we started to experience issues with the service and staff. Our waiter took forever to bring our drinks and appeared disinterested, bordering on rude, when we tried to clarify a missing item. Furthermore, the regular water we'd requested showed up lukewarm, which was far from refreshing, and the coffee served to someone in my party tasted watered-down and almost stale. Moving on to the food, which was supposed to be the saving grace of this place. After waiting over 30 minutes for our orders to arrive, we were more than ready to dig in. One friend ordered Eggs Benedict and another chose the shrimp and avocado toast, while I opted for the highly recommended Hypothetical Burger. The Eggs Benedict was overcooked and dry, with a poorly seasoned hollandaise sauce. The shrimp and avocado toast was a disaster – the shrimp tasted as if it had been thawed improperly and the avocado was overly mashed with an off-putting texture. As for the Hypothetical Burger, I must say I was extremely let down. The burger was greasy and served on a soggy bun that fell apart halfway through eating it. The fries accompanying my meal were limp and could have used a second round in the fryer, and the coleslaw was drowning in dressing, rendering it far too rich to consume. I did address my concerns with the staff and management, but the response received was underwhelming and dismissive. To add insult to injury, the bill took a considerable amount of time to arrive and had errors, which required further waiting to sort out. In conclusion, the Hypothetical Café has left a poor taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively. As someone who truly appreciates good dining experiences and values customer service, I regret to say that I won't be returning to this establishment. It saddens me to write such a negative review, but I feel it's important to share my experience in the hope that improvements can be made."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court.  - The Visigoths were the western branches of the nomadic tribes of Germanic peoples referred to collectively as the Goths. These tribes flourished and spread during the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity, or the Migration Period. The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups (possibly the Thervingi) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient. The Visigoths invaded Italy under Alaric I and sacked Rome in 410. After the Visigoths sacked Rome, they began settling down, first in southern Gaul and eventually in Spain and Portugal, where they founded the Visigothic Kingdom and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.  - Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the time of transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages in mainland Europe, the Mediterranean world, and the Middle East. The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work \\"The World of Late Antiquity\\" (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. 235  284) to, in the East, the early Islamic period (7th9th centuries), following the Muslim conquests in the mid7th century. In the West the end was earlier, with the start of the Early Medieval period typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the Western edges of the empire.  - Theodoric I ( Gothic : Þiudareiks ; German : Theodorid or Theodorich ; Latin : Theodericus ) , ( c. 393 -- 20 June 451 ) called in Spanish , Portuguese and Italian Teodorico , was the Germanic King of the Visigoths from 418 to 451 AD . An illegitimate son of Alaric , Theodoric is famous for his part in defeating Attila at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451 , where he was killed .  - The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (or Fields), also called the Battle of Châlons or the Battle of Maurica, took place on June 20, 451 AD between a coalition led by the Roman general Flavius Aetius and the Visigothic king Theodoric I against the Huns and their vassals commanded by their king Attila. It was one of the last major military operations of the Western Roman Empire, although Germanic foederati composed the majority of the coalition army. The battle was strategically inconclusive: the Romans stopped the Huns' attempt to establish vassals in Roman Gaul, and installed Merovech as king of the Franks. However, the Huns successfully looted and pillaged much of Gaul and crippled the military capacity of the Romans and Visigoths. The Hunnic Empire was later dismantled by a coalition of their Germanic vassals at the Battle of Nedao in 454.  - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - Alaric I (- \\"supreme chief/ruler\\" 370 (or 375)410 AD) was the first King of the Visigoths from 395410, son (or paternal grandson) of chieftain Rothestes. Alaric is best known for his sack of Rome in 410, which marked a decisive event in the decline of the Roman Empire.  - The Goths were an East Germanic people, two of whose branches, the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths, played an important role in the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the emergence of Medieval Europe. The Goths dominated a vast area, which at its peak under the Germanic king Ermanaric and his sub-king Athanaric possibly extended all the way from the Danube to the Don, and from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea.  - Attila (or ; fl. circa 406453), frequently referred to as Attila the Hun, was the ruler of the Huns from 434 until his death in March 453. Attila was a leader of the Hunnic Empire, a tribal confederation consisting of Huns, Ostrogoths, and Alans among others, on the territory of Central and Eastern Europe.  - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire.  - Merovech (Latin: \\"Meroveus\\" or \\"Merovius\\"; died 453/457) is the semi-legendary founder of the Merovingian dynasty of the Salian Franks (although Chlodio may in fact be the founder), which later became the dominant Frankish tribe. His name is close to \\"Marwig\\", lit. \\"famed fight\\" (compare modern Dutch \\"mare\\" \\"news, rumour\\" and \\"vermaard\\" \\"famous\\"). He is said to be one of several barbarian warlords and kings that joined forces with the Roman general Aetius against the Huns under Attila on the Catalaunian fields in Gaul. The first Frankish royal dynasty called themselves Merovingians (\\"descendants of Meroveus\\") after him, although no other historical evidence exists that Merovech ever lived.

Russian is an East Slavic language and an official language in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. It is also widely used, though unofficial, in many former Soviet countries such as Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia, and Estonia.  Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the four living members of the East Slavic languages, the others being Belarusian, Ukrainian and Rusyn. Over the centuries, it has been influenced by and adopted words from many other languages, including Greek, Latin, Italian, French, German, and English. Written in the Cyrillic script, Russian has a lexicon of the Indo-European type. It also retains sizable Indo-European and Old East Slavic components in grammar and vocabulary. The Russian language was developed through a progression from Old East Slavic (9th to 14th centuries), through Middle East Slavic (14th to 15th centuries), to Modern Russian (late 17th century to the present). The sentence you provided in Russian, \\"Участниками конвенции являются 144 страны\\", translates in English as \\"144 countries are participants of the convention\\". In Russian grammar, the verb generally follows the noun in the sentence structure. Like other Slavic languages, Russian uses cases to show grammatical relationships between words in a sentence, which can be confusing to learners whose languages do not use cases.   Russian is the eighth most spoken language in the world by number of native speakers and the seventh by total number of speakers. It’s one of the six official languages of the United Nations. So, the prior sentence is in Russian language, one of the prominent languages worldwide.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Many people think that the ideas about right and wrong are only personal ideas. Bennett wrote The Book of Virtue   in which he suggested that great moral   stories can build character. The success of Bennett's book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values, just like honesty, courage, loyalty and many others. For Americans, one basic moral value is honesty. The story about George Washington and the cherry tree teaches this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favourite cherry tree. When his father asked him about it, George said, \\"I did it.\\" Instead of punishment, his father spoke highly of him. Sometimes American honesty--being open and direct--can make people angry. But Americans still believe that \\"honesty is the best virtue\\". Another virtue is perseverance  . A story tells of a little train climbing a hill. The hill is too high to get over it. But the train just kept pulling, all the while saying, \\"I think I can, I think I can.\\" At last, the train was over the top because he did not give up. Compassion  may be the queen of American virtues. The story of \\"The Good Samaritan\\" from the Bible describes a man with compassion. On his way home, he found a poor traveler lying on the road. The kind man, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need. Compassion can even turn into a good cycle. In 1992, people in Iowa sent plenty of water to help Floridians  hit by storms. The next summer, during the Midwest flood, Florida returned. Millions of Americans are quietly passing along the kindness shown to them. In no way can this book cover all the moral values honored (...) by Americans.

Until its acceptance by the National Trust, Belton House was always in the ownership of the family of its builder, though the failure of three generations to produce a son and heir caused the ownership to pass sideways and sometimes through the female line.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that said \\"Kerry was hitting a dry spell.\\"? from the following article ?  The album  was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as \\"probably the odd man out at that point\\", he stated he \\"didn't participate as much because of that\\".  Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell.\\" King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums.

Context: The answer to why there was so little assimilation of Jews in central and eastern Europe for so long would seem to lie in part in the probability that the alien surroundings in central and eastern Europe were not conducive, though contempt did not prevent some assimilation. Furthermore, Jews lived almost exclusively in shtetls, maintained a strong system of education for males, heeded rabbinic leadership, and scorned the life-style of their neighbors; and all of these tendencies increased with every outbreak of antisemitism. Answer:","output":"The Hebrews followed rabbinic leadership."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Comparative religion is the branch of the study of religions concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's religions. In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as ethics, metaphysics, and the nature and form of salvation. Studying such material is meant to give one a richer and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the sacred, numinous, spiritual and divine.  - Numinous is an English adjective, derived from the Latin \\"numen\\", meaning \\"arousing spiritual or religious emotion; mysterious or awe-inspiring\\".  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"  - Basic English is an English-based controlled language created by linguist and philosopher Charles Kay Ogden as an international auxiliary language, and as an aid for teaching English as a second language. Basic English is, in essence, a simplified subset of regular English. It was presented in Ogden's book \\"Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar\\" (1930).  - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.  - Samuel Henry Hooke ( January 21 , 1874 -- January 17 , 1968 ) was an English scholar writing on comparative religion . He is known for his translation of the Bible into Basic English . He was born in Cirencester , Gloucestershire . He was educated at St. Mark 's school , Windsor and Jesus College , Oxford . From 1913 to 1926 he was Professor of Oriental Languages at the University of Toronto , where he was a founder of and contributor to Canadian Forum . In 1930 he was appointed Professor of Old Testament Studies at the University of London .  - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.   - The Bible (from Koine Greek  , \\"tà biblía\\", \\"the books\\") is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans.  - Charles Kay Ogden (1 June 1889  20 March 1957) was an English linguist, philosopher, and writer. Described as a polymath but also an eccentric and outsider, he took part in many ventures related to literature, politics, the arts and philosophy, having a broad effect particularly as an editor, translator, and activist on behalf of a reformed version of the English language. He is typically defined as a linguistic psychologist, and is now mostly remembered as the inventor and propagator of Basic English.  - Sacred means revered due to sanctity and is generally the state of being perceived by religious individuals as associated with divinity and considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion; or inspiring awe or reverence among believers.  - Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. The term \\"ethics\\" derives from the Ancient Greek word  \\"ethikos\\", which is derived from the word  \\"ethos\\" (habit, \\"custom\\"). The branch of philosophy axiology comprises the sub-branches of ethics and aesthetics, each concerned with values.  - Salvation (Latin \\"salvatio\\"; Greek \\"stria\\"; Hebrew \\"yasha\\") is being saved or protected from harm or being saved or delivered from some dire situation.

Summarize: President Nicolas Maduro said the officer was killed by a sniper and branded the protesters \\"murderous\\". More than 240 people were arrested after the pre-dawn raids on four camps in the east of the capital. Since anti-government protests began in February, more than 40 people have been killed, and thousands more arrested. \\"A sniper killed the policeman while he was cleaning debris left by these violent, murderous protesters,\\" a sombre Mr Maduro said during a televised address. \\"He was vilely killed,\\" he added. Three other policemen were wounded, one by gunfire, Venezuelan media reported. Interior Minister Miguel Rodriguez said police had found \\"drugs, weapons, explosives and mortars\\" in the camps. The violence erupted after raids by members of the National Guard broke up four tent camps maintained by student activists. Hundreds of demonstrators poured on to the streets and set up barricades. Masked youths threw stones and petrol bombs, while police responded with tear gas. Witnesses said shots were fired from buildings into the streets, but this could not be confirmed. Mr Rodriguez said 243 protesters had been detained and that the authorities were currently determining whom to charge. He said protesters had used the camps as bases to launch \\"violent attacks\\", after which they would \\"hide... saying they were taking part in a peaceful protest\\". Earlier this week, the pressure group Human Rights Watch accused Venezuelan security forces of illegally detaining and abusing protesters. Demonstrations were triggered by frustration with Venezuela's high crime rates and poor economic situation but have grown into a wider anti-government movement. Students have been at the forefront of the protests, erecting barricades and organising demonstrations and sit-ins.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  After her sister Olga marries and leaves home, Katrin Koerber, the daughter of an Austrian medical professor, fights loneliness and dreams of a more exciting life outside Austria.  Consequently, when Dr. Walter Fane, a British bacteriologist, asks her to marry him and move to Hong Kong, she agrees, even though she is not in love with him. As soon as the newlyweds arrive in Hong Kong, however, Walter becomes consumed with his medical work, and Katrin becomes the romantic target of Jack Townsend, the unhappily married attaché to the British embassy.  While showing her the city's exotic sights, Jack flirts with Katrin and kisses her.  Katrin, unnerved by Jack's actions, retreats to her house, but soon rejoins him to observe local dancers performing at a Buddhist festival.  Stimulated by the dancing and the atmosphere of a Buddhist temple, Jack confesses his love to Katrin, and Katrin admits that she is not in love with Walter. At home, Katrin then treats Walter coolly and reveals that his chronic lateness and fatigue annoy her. To make amends, Walter comes home early the next day, but discovers Katrin's bedroom door locked and Jack's hat on a table.  That evening, Walter confronts Katrin with his suspicions, and she admits that she loves Jack.  Distraught, Walter tells Katrin that he will grant her a divorce only if Jack promises in writing that he will divorce his wife and marry her.  When Katrin presents Walter's conditions to Jack, he tells her that a divorce would ruin both his career and his reputation and backs out of the affair. The answer is:","output":"The profession of the person that Olga's sister, Katrin Koerber, is not in love with is a British bacteriologist. This fact is established based on the context given that states, \\"Dr. Walter Fane, a British bacteriologist, asks her to marry him and move to Hong Kong, she agrees, even though she is not in love with him.\\" Dr. Walter Fane gets consumed with his work upon their arrival in Hong Kong which causes a distance between them. Katrin is courted by Jack Townsend, an attaché to the British embassy, and she admits to him that she isn't in love with her husband, Walter. Despite the romantic advances of Jack Townsend, Katrin's lack of love concerns her husband, Dr. Walter Fane, the British bacteriologist.

Background: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.  Paragraph: Two friends had different diseases. Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend received more interferon? The answer to this question is:","output":"Nigel received more interferon. Given the background information and the paragraph provided, we can determine that Nigel received more interferon due to his infection with the HIV virus. Interferon is a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected, particularly in response to a viral infection. Since Nigel was more prone to viral infections and got infected with HIV, his immune system would have produced more interferon to help combat the virus. On the other hand, Manny had a bacterial infection. Although interferon might have some activity against bacterial infections, its primary function is to combat viral infections. Therefore, it is more likely that Nigel, who was infected with a virus, received more interferon than Manny, who had a bacterial infection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Review: This film was not nearly as much of a chore as I expected it to be. There are a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore UFO conspiracy paranoia-fest. Most of the acting is mediocre, but fairly typical for 1970s-style stuff replete with pregnant pauses. A photographer and a model witness some strange goings-on in the woods and soon fall victim to these same goings-on. Flying saucers are spotted, more people disappear - but is it the aliens or our own government's ultra-secret group of cover-up guys? Soon enough, a reporter and a \\"UFOlogist\\" (apparently modeled on the character of the writer-director) are drawn into this unraveling fiasco and become the target of the ultra-secret agents who are as menacing as they are improbable and witless. Then the fun really begins. The movie, predictably, makes about as much sense as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but should be commended for taking itself so seriously. The camera work is OK for a low-budget film, the pacing is pretty good, the script is silly and absurd, and there are continuity issues which are fun to look out for. What are the few seconds of brilliance I mentioned? Honestly, I can't say much you without writing a spoiler.

Really nice little place with great pizza and friendly staff. It's sit-down in the same way that Chipotle is sit-down. They serve wine and beer, but maybe I'm just not used to that in a non-table-service establishement.  Unlike Osteria 100, the pizzas are a good size for lunch. The first time I went, a friend and I split a Ceasar salad and a Vesuvius pizza. Portions were fine for a light lunch. The second time I had one pizza myself.   The dough quality is excellent - thin, toasted on the edges, and soft within. The taste is so fresh - much like Il Pizziaolo in Mt Lebo.  I've since had the Quattro Formaggi and the Prosciutto y Fungi and both were great.  This is a great addition to the downtown lunch scene. I hope they do well - the location is on the very edge of town - and nice to see that they are open past 3pm. Would be a cool happy hour place if they had a bar, but there's just no room for one. With the right wine list it would be kind of like having Dinette minutes from my office.  Two downsides: 1. Noise! It's all hard surfaces, so conversations travel. In their defense, it's all glass on two sides, so no much you can do there. 2. THere is no vestibule, so on wintry days there are big chills rushing in with every patron.

Special camps offer young people the chance to learn about different subjects: anything from space exploration to business to medicine.

A shooting guard, he initially achieved success playing professional basketball in Europe in the 1980s, before joining the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1989. A star on multiple stages, Petrovic earned two silver medals and one bronze in Olympic basketball, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA World Cup, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA EuroBasket, and two EuroLeague titles. He represented Yugoslavia's national team and, later, Croatia's national team. Petrovic's national team debut came at the age of 15, at the Under-18 Balkan Championship in Turkey, where the Yugoslavian junior team won the bronze. The young man regularly played for the Yugoslavian national team in the Balkan Championships, also winning gold with the junior team and silver with the senior team. He also brought back the silver from the 1982 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship in Bulgaria.  The 1984 Summer Olympics were Petrovic's first competition of a grand scale with the Yugoslav senior national team, and the bronze medal won in Los Angeles that summer became his first Olympic medal. Third place was also earned at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, remembered for the last minute thriller in the semi-final game against the Soviet Union. At the 1987 EuroBasket, Petrovic again returned with bronze, as Yugoslavia lost to the hosts and gold medalists Greece. The University Games, held in Zagreb in 1987, saw the Yugoslavian squad with Petrovic win the gold. In the 1988 Summer Olympics, Yugoslavia with Petrovic, earned 2nd place, as they lost once more to the Soviet powerhouse.  An excellent club season with Real Madrid was topped by Petrovic's 1989 accomplishment with the Yugoslav national team: at the EuroBasket in Zagreb, the young Yugoslavian team went all the way, defeating Greece more than comfortably in the championship game. Petrovic was the tournament's second leading scorer and most valuable player. The very next year, the summer in between the two most frustrating seasons of his professional career, as he struggled for playing time with the Trail Blazers, Petrovic was again making history with the national team, as Yugoslavia became world champions, after beating the Soviet Union for the gold in Buenos Aires, at the 1990 FIBA World Championship. Did he play in Yugoslavia?","output":"Yes, Drazen Petrovic played basketball in Yugoslavia. He started his professional basketball career in Europe during the 1980s and represented the Yugoslavian national team in several competitions, including the Balkan Championships and FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship. He also played for the Yugoslavian national team in the 1984 Summer Olympics and many other international tournaments before playing in the NBA."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: WASHINGTON — At a Supreme Court argument on Wednesday about procedures in redistricting cases, the justices appeared to be trying to reconcile two conflicting impulses. They did not want to close the door entirely on challenges to gerrymandering, but they also did not want to be required to rule on them. Though the court has never rejected a voting district on the ground that it gave a political party an unconstitutional advantage, it has never ruled out that such a district might exist. On Wednesday, the court seemed inclined to endorse procedures that would at least treat such claims seriously by sending them to special three-judge courts created by a federal law for redistricting cases. But as the argument drew to a close, several justices voiced a competing concern — the law also allows direct appeals to the Supreme Court from rulings of the three-judge courts, meaning more work and less discretion for the justices. The case, Shapiro v. McManus, No. 14-990, is a challenge to Maryland’s 2011 congressional maps. Democrats, the challengers said, had gone to elaborate and unconstitutional lengths to create oddly shaped districts to favor their candidates. A single federal trial judge dismissed the case, saying it did not present issues serious enough to warrant convening a three-judge court. In the first part of the argument, several justices seemed to disagree. “They want to raise about as important a question as you can imagine,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer said of the challengers. “And if they are right, that would affect congressional districts and legislative districts throughout the nation.” The argument was unusually sleepy, lasting 47 minutes instead of the usual hour and going for long stretches without questions from the bench. As it neared the end, it took a turn, with justices raising concerns about their workload and their ability to shape their own docket. “There are a lot of cases that come up in three-judge district courts that would be the kind of case — I speak for myself, anyway — that we might” decide not to review if they arrived in the usual course, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said. “With the three-judge district court, no, we have to decide it on the merits.” Justice Breyer echoed that point. “If there is a set of cases where this court should be careful as to when and how and which it enters in which order,” he said, it is those involving sensitive political issues. “If we accept your view,” he told Michael D. Kimberly, a lawyer for the challengers, “we have to take immediately whatever variations on the theme of disproportionate gerrymandering, whatever order they happen to arise and whenever they happen to arise, because we have no choice.” Much of the discussion concerned how legally tenuous a claim had to be before single judges could act on their own. Chief Justice Roberts did not seem satisfied with the available distinctions, which he said created “an awfully fuzzy line” and gave no guidance to judges. Justice Elena Kagan said the category of cases in which a judge could act alone should be very narrow if the test is whether the court has jurisdiction to hear the case at all. “We’ve basically said that’s only when it’s completely ridiculous,” she said, one where “it’s just a laughingstock of a case.” Steven M. Sullivan, a lawyer for Maryland, created some confusion with a description of the sorts of cases so frivolous that any judge should be entitled to dismiss them. “It’s easy when it’s the little green men and the extraterrestrials,” he said. That was probably a reference to Justice David H. Souter’s dissent in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, a 2009 decision that made it easier to dismiss all kinds of lawsuits at the outset. (It is appropriate, Justice Souter wrote, to dismiss “claims about little green men, or the plaintiff’s recent trip to Pluto, or experiences in time travel.”) But the reference seemed lost on Justice Antonin Scalia, who asked several questions about how extraterrestrials figured in the case.

News article: Forget the avocado, here are the foods we’ll love to hate in 2016 The avocado’s ubiquity in 2015 was pretty strange, when you think about it, since there is evidence of avocado use dating from 10,000 BC in a cave in Coaxcatlan, Puebla, in Mexico. But try telling that to someone trying to Instagram their brunch without getting egg yolk all over their phone. The avocado has been done to death this year – along with articles about the avocado being done to death. An irony I am well aware of. This torrent of publicity for what is basically a delicious thing to eat, followed by a fierce backlash, is inexplicable if you’ve been quietly eating avocados for years. Related: Ripe and ready: how ‘evil geniuses’ got us hooked on avocados Let’s look at the positives. In many ways, the rise of the avocado in 2015 has been a welcome development. There are more of them around, for a start, and some of them are even ripe. You can get avocado on toast in places that aren’t London. I know, because I live somewhere that is not London. And when it comes to food trends, you know something’s gone mainstream when it rocks up in my town. But there are drawbacks too. Apparently, avocados were the most pinned food on Pinterest this year. Just writing that sentence makes me hate humanity. The ludicrous idea that they’re a butter substitute emerged. See “brownies” made from avocados, apple sauce and coconut flour. And we saw the advent of avocado tattoos. You really have seen it all when you’ve seen someone sporting a tattoo of a haunted avocado. All these things and, of course, the final straw – Nigella Lawson’s championing of avocado on toast on Simply Nigella. I love Nigella. I love avocados. But although her avocado on toast contains dill (no), lime, chilli flakes and radish, avocado on toast is most definitely not a recipe. Even Nigella had to admit this. But unfortunately she added that avocado on toast was “part of the fabric of my life”. There are plenty of contenders for trendy foods we can all become incredibly annoyed by in 2016 People just sick to death of the whole thing (the whole enchilada, if you will – a dish, of course, that is perfect with avocado) have suggested that the smug and ubiquitous avocado should be left behind in 2015. But rather than turn our backs on this delectable food, how about we simply enjoy avocados and stop plastering pictures of them all over social media? After all, there are plenty of contenders for trendy foods we can all become incredibly annoyed by in 2016: Drinking vinegars with a venerable history. Shrubs are more delicious than they sound, but have inexplicably started appearing in hipster hangouts in New York and London – see the Shrub and Shutter restaurant in Brixton. Homemade of course. And peanuts simply won’t do. Almonds. Cashews. Pecans. The more expensive the better. You will fall into ruinous penury and break your blender trying to make this at home. And then you will go to the supermarket and buy a jar of Sun-Pat. Slimy in its raw state, brittle in its packaged, dried form, quickly turning limp. Umami. Already in Marks & Spencer biscuits. What do you do with it? No one knows. But you’ll buy it anyway. Fermented tea drink people say tastes fantastic. They are lying. Health benefits, apparently. Kombucha tea bars are “popping up” at places such as Mick’s Garage in Hackney, London, says the trendiest food blogger in the world, Clerkenwell Boy. I’m so untrendy I thought that might be an actual garage. So I Googled it. Then I had a little cry. The good news is that said bar offers it as a mixer for spirits. And if there’s one thing that’s comfortingly impervious to aggravating food trends, it’s good old hard liquor. Cheers. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article takes a humorous and slightly cynical look at the popularity of certain food trends in 2015, with a particular focus on avocados. Avocados became tremendously popular in 2015, showing prominence across social media, and seemingly appearing in every possible dish or recipe. This was bolstered by celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, who included the avocado on toast in her television show, despite her own admission that it wasn't a recipe but \\"part of the fabric of her life\\".  The author finds this rampant trend tiresome and mocks its prominence on platforms like Pinterest and the array of strange ways avocados are being used, from being a butter substitute in brownies to the trend of getting avocado tattoos. The author suggests enjoying avocados without the need to constantly share them on social media. Additionally, the author speculates on potential upcoming food trends for the year 2016. This includes shrubs or drinking vinegars that are becoming popular in hipster locations in New York and London, and the surge of homemade nut butter, where almonds, cashews, and pecans are preferred over traditional peanuts. Other predicted trends include the utilization of kelp, a type of seaweed, and kombucha tea, a fermented drink, praised for its health benefits but criticized by the author for its taste. In summary, the news article is a satirical critique of food trends, focusing primarily on the overexposure and exhaustion of avocados in 2015, with a prediction on the possible new trends in 2016, like shrubs, homemade nut butter, kelp, and kombucha."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

These protests are in direct response to the mounting issue of funding cuts, which students and faculty alike believe have hampered the quality of education and services provided at their institutions. Step 1: Understand the issue The main source of discontent stems from the drastic budget cuts to higher education made by both federal and state governments over the past few years. As a result, colleges and universities have been forced to adjust their budgets, often at the expense of essential programs, services, and support staff. This has led to students and faculty members experiencing increased financial pressure, decreased resources, and limited opportunities. Step 2: Research and gather information Various public sources have reported that funding for higher education has been on a steady decline in the US. This is especially alarming as it comes at a time when college tuition continues to rise, student debt has escalated, and a greater emphasis is being placed on the importance of higher education for future success. Step 3: Highlight the impact of funding cuts The consequences of reduced funding are manifold: colleges and universities have to grapple with minimized support for research, infrastructure, and student services. Additionally, many educational institutions have been forced to implement hiring freezes, furlough faculty and staff members, and even cancel or postpone academic programs. Step 4: Describe the protests and what they aim to achieve In response to these adverse effects, students, faculty, and staff have started organizing and participating in raucous protests on their campuses. Their main objective is to oppose these funding cuts and bring attention to the deteriorating state of the American higher education system. Protesters hope that their actions will prompt a reevaluation of budgeting priorities, with the goal of reestablishing financial security for colleges and universities. Step 5: Address the potential outcomes of the protests While it is challenging to predict the precise outcomes of these rowdy demonstrations, the sheer number and intensity of the protesters cannot be ignored. It is possible that the public outcry will push policymakers to rethink their funding strategies and reconsider the importance of investing in higher education for both individual and societal prosperity. In conclusion, the recent surge of rowdy protests at US campuses offers a glimpse into the frustrations and concerns faced by those directly affected by the funding cuts in higher education. As the battle for resources and support continues, it remains to be seen whether these demonstrations will bring about the desired change and secure a brighter future for students, educators, and institutions alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Earth has been devastated by a nuclear war instigated by five terrorists, and it has taken two million years for the radioactive clouds to once again allow sunlight to reach the surface. Only a handful of humans have survived the apocalypse, while the rest have changed into mutants who roam the radioactive wastelands. Eventually, humanity's true ancestors  – fairies, elves and dwarves – resurfaced and live in the idyllic land of Montagar in peace for three millennia.  While her people celebrated 3,000 years of peace, their ruler Delia, queen of the fairies, fell into a trance and left the party. Puzzled, the fairies followed her to her home and discover that she has given birth to twin wizards. They were the kindhearted Avatar who spent much of his boyhood entertaining his ailing mother with beautiful visions and his mutated brother Blackwolf, who was pure-evil, never visiting his mother, but spending his time torturing small animals. When Blackwolf learned of their mother's death, he attempted to usurp her leadership, being defeated in duel against a grief-stricken Avatar.

Please answer the following question: Rob is experimenting with how air pressure works. To that end, he has designed two tests. In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations.  Would case A have faster or slower air flow above it than case B? Answer:","output":"To answer Rob's question, let's first discuss the key differences between an airplane wing and a race car spoiler. Then we can determine how air flow would behave above each of these and whether case A would have a faster or slower air flow compared to case B. Case A: Airplane Wing Airplane wings are designed to create lift, which allows the plane to fly. This is achieved through a concept called the Bernoulli principle. The wing is shaped in an airfoil manner, with the upper part of the wing being curved and the lower part being relatively flat. When air flows around the wing, it splits into two streams - one that travels above the wing and one that travels below it. Due to the curved design of the wing, the air moving on the upper surface has to travel a longer distance than the air on the lower surface. According to the Bernoulli principle, an increase in the speed of a fluid (in this case, air) results in a decrease in pressure. As a result, the air flow above the wing is faster than the air flow below it, creating a lower pressure area above the wing. The higher pressure below the wing pushes the airplane upward, generating lift. Case B: Race Car Spoiler A race car spoiler, on the other hand, is designed to improve the car's handling and traction at high speeds by reducing lift and increasing downforce. Downforce refers to the force exerted on a vehicle that pushes it downwards towards the ground, improving the car's grip on the road and ensuring better stability. A spoiler works by disrupting the air flow around the car, creating turbulence and a high pressure area above the spoiler. In this case, the air flow above the spoiler is inherently slower due to the spoilers design, which is to create high pressure. This is contrary to wing of an airplane, where the objective is to create lift based on differences in air pressure. Comparison and Conclusion: Comparing case A (airplane wing) and case B (race car spoiler), we can see that the primary difference lies in the purpose of each design. An airplane wing is designed to create lift by generating a low pressure area above the wing with faster air flow, whereas a race car spoiler aims to increase downforce and stability with a high pressure area above it due to slower air flow. Therefore, based on the principles of Bernoulli and the design objectives of each case, the air flow above case A (airplane wing) would indeed be faster than the air flow above case B (race car spoiler)."},{"instruction":"Q:I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

The new album was publicised during Jay-Z's performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April, when a blimp flew across the venue announcing that M.I.A.'s new album would be released on 29 June 2010. M.I.A. promoted the album with a series of appearances at music festivals, including the Hard festival in New York and The Big Chill in Herefordshire. Her performance at the latter was cut short due to a stage invasion by fans. She also performed at the Flow Festival in Finland, where she was joined onstage by Derek E. Miller playing guitar during her performance of \\"Meds and Feds\\", and the LokerseFeesten in Lokeren, Flanders, Belgium, where her performance drew a crowd of 13,500, the biggest of the 10-day music festival.

Having everything ready before you start mixing will keep you from forgetting an important ingredient.  Preheat the oven to 375 ° fahrenheit (190 ° celsius).","output":"Line a 12-cup muffin tin with cupcake liners and set aside. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt until thoroughly combined. In a separate large mixing bowl, cream together 1/2 cup (1 stick) of unsalted, softened butter and 1 cup of granulated sugar using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes on medium-high speed. Add 2 large room-temperature eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition to ensure they are fully incorporated. Add 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and mix until combined. Next, gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with 1/2 cup of whole milk. Begin and end with the flour mixture to ensure a smooth batter. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough cupcakes. Fold in any additional flavorings or mix-ins (such as chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or fruit) if desired. Using a cookie scoop or a spoon, evenly distribute the cupcake batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each liner about 2/3 full to allow for rising during baking. Gently tap the muffin tin on the counter to release any air bubbles and ensure a consistent rise. Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Keep an eye on the cupcakes to ensure they do not overbake, as this will result in dry and crumbly cupcakes. Once the cupcakes are baked, remove the muffin tin from the oven and allow it to cool on a wire cooling rack for around 5 minutes. After this time, carefully remove the individual cupcakes from the tin and place them directly on the cooling rack to cool completely. This will prevent the cupcakes from becoming soggy as they cool. While the cupcakes are cooling, prepare your desired frosting. Popular options include buttercream, cream cheese frosting, or even a simple dusting of powdered sugar. Once the cupcakes have cooled completely, use a piping bag and a decorative tip to create beautiful swirls of frosting or simply spread the frosting on top with a knife or an offset spatula. Finally, add any additional decorations such as sprinkles, edible glitter, or fondant shapes if desired. Serve these delicious and easy-to-make cupcakes at your next gathering or as a simple treat for your family, and enjoy the satisfaction of creating a delightful homemade dessert with minimal effort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He grew up in an eight-story house at 10 West 54th Street, the tallest private residence ever built in the city. Rockefeller was the youngest of six children born to financier John Davison Rockefeller Jr. and socialite Abigail Greene \\"Abby\\" Aldrich. John Jr. was the only son of Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller Sr. and schoolteacher Laura Celestia \\"Cettie\\" Spelman. In 1964, along with other American business figures such as Sol Linowitz, Rockefeller founded the non-profit International Executive Service Corps which encourages developing nations to promote private enterprise. In 1979, he formed the Partnership for New York City, a not-for-profit membership organization of New York businessmen. In 1992, he was selected as a leading member of the Russian-American Bankers Forum, an advisory group set up by the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to advise Russia on the modernization of its banking system, with the full endorsement of President Boris Yeltsin.  Rockefeller had a lifelong association with the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) when he joined as a director in 1949. In 1965, Rockefeller and other businessmen formed the Council of the Americas to stimulate and support economic integration in the Americas. In 1992, at a Council sponsored forum, Rockefeller proposed a \\"Western Hemisphere free trade area\\", which became the Free Trade Area of the Americas in a Miami summit in 1994. His and the Council's chief liaison to President Bill Clinton in order to garner support for this initiative was through Clinton's chief of staff, Mack McLarty, whose consultancy firm Kissinger McLarty Associates is a corporate member of the Council, while McLarty himself is on the board of directors. He was also a trustee of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, including 1948, when Alger Hiss was president.  Displeased with the refusal of Bilderberg Group meetings to include Japan, Rockefeller helped found the Trilateral Commission in July 1973. Which policy group was considered the most important?","output":"The most important policy group mentioned in the article is the Trilateral Commission. It was founded by David Rockefeller in July 1973, as he was displeased with the refusal of the Bilderberg Group meetings to include Japan. The Trilateral Commission played a significant role in fostering cooperation and policy coordination among the three major industrialized regions of the world: North America, Western Europe, and Japan. The formation of this group indicates the importance of collaboration among these powerful regions for global policymaking and highlights Rockefeller's efforts in shaping international relations and promoting economic integration."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

В процессе разучивания и шлифования программ, в ходе различного уровня зачетов, прокатов и соревнований, при удачах и неудачах у фигуристов едва ли не ежедневно возникают конфликты с собой, с партнером, с тренером, с хореографом, со школьными преподавателями, с родителями и т.д. и т.п. каждый из этих конфликтов ложится еще одним камнем на душу юного существа, и задача психолога - постоянно избавлять спортсмена Translate to English English:","output":"During the process of learning and polishing programs, in the course of various levels of assessments, rentals, and competitions, with successes and failures, figure skaters almost daily face conflicts with themselves, with a partner, with a coach, with a choreographer, with school teachers, with parents, etc. Each of these conflicts lays another stone on the soul of a young individual, and the task of a psychologist is to constantly relieve the athlete. In the world of figure skating, it is natural for conflicts to arise due to the high-pressure environment, differing expectations, and the need for constant improvement. This makes it essential for athletes to have access to psychological support in order to navigate these challenges effectively. When faced with conflicts, it is important for skaters to maintain open communication and understanding with all parties involved. This includes discussing any concerns, acknowledging differing perspectives, and working together to find a solution that benefits everyone. A psychologist can help facilitate these conversations and mediate any disputes that may arise. Additionally, a psychologist can help athletes develop emotional resilience in order to cope with the inevitable challenges that come with being a competitive figure skater. This involves teaching them about self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Building these competencies can help skaters respond more effectively to conflicts and reduce the lasting impact they might have on their mental wellbeing. Moreover, a psychologist can provide athletes with strategies to help them manage performance anxiety, which is a common issue faced by figure skaters. This might include relaxation techniques, visualization exercises, or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to help challenge negative thoughts and beliefs. By overcoming performance anxiety, skaters can enhance their focus, improve their overall performance, and, in turn, experiencing fewer conflicts within their sport environment. It is also crucial for coaches, choreographers, and other support staff to be aware of the potential conflicts that can arise in the competitive figure skating world. They should work collaboratively with athletes and their families to create a supportive and inclusive environment, promoting positive interactions and fostering mutual respect. By doing this, they can help minimize conflicts and create a more positive atmosphere for everyone involved. In conclusion, the role of a psychologist in competitive figure skating is multifaceted, involving conflict resolution, emotional resilience development, performance anxiety management, and fostering a supportive environment. By continually addressing these aspects, psychologists can help athletes navigate conflicts and reach their full potential in their sport."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the TV sitcom 'Friends' what is the name of Phoebe's twin sister?","output":"In the popular TV sitcom 'Friends,' Phoebe Buffay's twin sister is named Ursula Buffay. Ursula is portrayed by the same actress, Lisa Kudrow. Ursula Buffay is a recurring character on 'Friends' and her storyline significantly intertwines with Phoebe's. She is also a character on the show 'Mad About You,' which aired around the same time as 'Friends.' Ursula was initially introduced on 'Mad About You' before her character was adapted into the 'Friends' storyline as Phoebe's twin sister. This crossover brought an interesting connection between the two popular TV shows. As for the characters themselves, both Phoebe and Ursula have strikingly different personalities. Phoebe is an eccentric, kind-hearted, and somewhat naive individual who is known for her quirky behavior, odd sense of humor, and unique approach to life. She works as a freelance masseuse and a musician, often performing original songs at Central Perk, the gang's favorite coffee shop hangout. On the other hand, Ursula is quite the opposite; she is portrayed as an extremely nonchalant, carefree, and self-centered person who displays little concern for others. She frequently forgets people's names, including her sister's, and generally makes a minimal effort to form relationships or even engage in basic conversations. Ursula works as a waitress at Riff's, a restaurant in 'Mad About You,' and later as a pornographic film actress (under Phoebe's name) in 'Friends.' Throughout the 'Friends' series, Ursula's appearances often lead to tension-filled encounters and awkward situations with Phoebe and the rest of the group. The two sisters have a rocky relationship due to their conflicting personalities and contrasting outlooks on life. However, these interactions add an interesting dynamic, humor, and depth to Phoebe's character and contribute to the overall appeal of the show."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

A family doctor and father-of-three was jailed today for seriously injuring two people while over the drink-drive limit. Gwyn Haydn Roberts, 45, from Abergavenny, drank one-and-a-half litres of cider and two cans of Special Brew after a visit to his sick mother in Gwynedd ended in a row. Mold Crown Court heard he drove on the wrong side of the road and went around bends on a grass verge on the A487. The doctor cried in the dock as he admitted causing serious injuries by dangerous driving. He was banned from driving for four years. The court heard how Roberts paid a visit to his sick mother in Criccieth on June 17, which ended in a row. Roberts - who was previously disqualified from driving for 27 months in 2010 for drink driving – drove on the wrong side of the road as he motored along the A487. The journey home was a 120-mile trip that would have taken an able driver around three hours. The crash happened between Penrhyndeudraeth and Maentwrog in Gwynedd when Roberts crossed a double white line and hit a car driven by Indian restaurant workers Babel Mia and passenger Raj Mia. Both cars were written off in the collision and Babel Mia suffered a broken right foot, deep cuts to the head and knees. He was in hospital two days. His colleague suffered broken ribs, cuts and bruises. Roberts, a father of three, suffered a fractured sternum. Blood tests taken from Roberts four hours later showed he had 180 miligrammes of alcohol in his blood compared to the legal limit of 80. The crash happened between Penrhyndeudraeth and Maentwrog in Gwynedd (pictured) Father-of-three Roberts - who was previously disqualified from driving for 27 months in 2010 for drink driving – drove on the wrong side of the road as he motored along the A487 between in Gwynedd, north-west Wales. Anna Pope, defending, said Roberts was receiving treatment for his alcohol addicition and Wynford Ellis Owen had written the report on his treatment. He had gone to Criccieth to visit his ageing mother who was seriously ill with bowel cancer. But there were emotional and mental issues from his childhood which came to the surface and they triggered his decision to drive home. Miss Pope said: 'He takes responsibility for what he did and made frank admissions. 'It is clear from the references there is another side to this man. He is an extremely successful GP valued by his patients. 'He is a loving husband and father to three children. He is also an extremely troubled man throughout his adult life,' she said. The issues from his childhood had driven him to drink and prescription drugs, although there was no suggestion that had affected his work. Miss Pope said his first drink drive offence happened when he had driven to the Black Mountains to commit suicide but could not go through with it. He was arrested as he drove back and was found to be over the limit. He had been detained for a short while under the Mental Health Act and had referred himself for residential rehabilitation. He was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and Miss Pope said he should be spared jail to allow his rehabilitation to continue. The journey the doctor wanted to take was a 120-mile trip that would have taken around three hours. But Judge Rhys Rowlands said the decision to try and drive 130 miles plus along 'tortuous roads' was 'extraordinarily dangerous'. He pointed out that he must have known full-well what he was doing was illegal. 'You were placing other road users at risk and sadly that is what happened. You were driving at speed, on the wrong side of the road and around bends, prompting one motorist to film it and another motorist described your overtaking as the most dangerous she had seen. You could easily have killed those in the other car. 'I have read letters from professional colleagues and patients you have assisted over the years. Professionally you are highly thought of and you have taken steps to try and address your drinking. You are the sole provider for a young family and the effect has been profound on them.' He sentenced Roberts to 27 months in jail and disqualified him from driving for four years. The General Medical Council will consider the future of Dr Gwyn Haydn Roberts in January, but Mold Crown Court was told he was unlikely to practise medicine again.

Summarize the following: Organize your obligations into “Do,” “Don’t Do,” and “Delegate.”  Instead of trying to do it all, figure out which household tasks need to be done (your “Do” list), and which can wait (your “Don’t Do” list).  If there are things you could get your partner, your kids, or a hired hand to do – washing the dishes, walking the dog, and so on – separate them into your “Delegate” list.  This will rebalance your family’s time in such a way that you all have the ability to spend more time together, instead of you and/or your partner taking on a disproportionate amount of housework. Be realistic and honest when evaluating your time.  Don’t add something to your “Do” list just because you feel guilty. Organize your work tasks, too, so that you can identify which things need doing and which you can delegate to a coworker. You can lose a lot of time that can be spent with your family (or on yourself) by searching for misplaced keys, remote controls, and other essential belongings.  Choose a convenient location for your wallet or purse, your keys, and your glasses.  Get in the habit of placing these essentials – especially the things you seem to lose frequently – in the same place every day. For instance, you might choose to always put your glasses by the bedside, and your keys by the door. Look for ways to save time and use them whenever possible.  For instance, if your dry cleaner offers free pickup, or you can get your pizza delivered instead of picking it up, spring for these convenience services.  This will help you maximize your family time. If you’re enrolled in university, use the campus gym instead of trekking from school to the gym and then home. If you’re the type of person who rises to a challenge, you might benefit from trying to make and meet unique family-related goals.  Set a minimum amount of time to spend with your family each week – for instance, 15 hours.  Or you could try a qualitative goal like making your child smile at dinner. Change your family-time goals regularly to keep the contest fresh. Instead of checking email, working on projects, and texting friends or coworkers when you’re home, turn your phone off and shut down your computer.  This way, your family will get your undivided attention.  After your kids and partner are asleep, you can log back on.  This is especially important during family outings and meals. You can also use your computer and phone early in the morning, when your kids and partner are asleep. Some people get discouraged because they think, “I could never maximize my family time in the way that my neighbor did.”  This is defeatist thinking and will not help you maximize your family time.  Instead, organize your time as well a possible without passing judgment on yourself. Remember, nobody can spend all their time with their family.

Hunter was very good at writing articles but Kyle was not.","output":"Hunter was very good at writing articles, having a natural talent for putting his thoughts onto paper in a clear and concise manner. His ability to captivate readers with engaging content seemed almost effortless. Whether it was a news piece, an opinion column, or a well-researched article, Hunter managed to deliver high-quality writing consistently, never failing to surprise his audience with his unique perspective. On the other hand, Kyle struggled with his writing. Unlike Hunter, Kyle seemed unable to communicate his ideas effectively on paper. He faced numerous challenges, ranging from difficulties organizing his thoughts to an inability to find the right words to express his feelings or arguments. Kyle's struggles were not due to a lack of effort. He was determined to improve, and often spent hours researching and re-writing each piece he worked on, trying to make his articles more engaging and informative. It was as if every sentence was a struggle for him, a battle to find the right way to communicate his point. Nevertheless, Kyle remained committed to improving his writing abilities. He consistently sought feedback from his peers, took writing courses, and looked to Hunter for guidance. Slowly but surely, he began to see small improvements in his work. His sentence structure became clearer, his grammar improved, and he gradually built up a broader vocabulary to help articulate his thoughts. Hunter, recognizing Kyle's resilience and determination, took it upon himself to mentor his friend and help him refine his skills. They spent countless hours together, analyzing Kyle's work, discussing various writing techniques and strategies, and comparing different styles. Hunter shared his writing secrets with Kyle, teaching him the importance of a strong opening hook, smooth transitions, and a compelling conclusion. He also stressed the importance of research and fact-checking, ensuring that Kyle understood the significance of being well-informed and thorough in his work. They used real-world examples of great writing, deconstructing articles published in renowned newspapers and magazines, to illustrate what made them stand out. Through perseverance and consistent practice, Kyle slowly began to develop a voice of his own. He started to gain confidence, noticing that his writing had begun to captivate readers with engaging content and thought-provoking insights. With every small victory, Kyle's determination only grew, and he found himself even more motivated to refine his writing skills and share his unique perspective. As time went on, the once vast gap that existed between Hunter and Kyle's writing abilities began to narrow. And while it was clear that Hunter's innate talent for writing still set him apart, Kyle's hard work, determination, and his willingness to learn, allowed him to make significant strides. Ultimately, Kyle's journey to become a better writer not only demonstrated the power of perseverance but also served as a testament to the transformative power of mentorship. By working with Hunter and receiving the guidance, support, and encouragement that he needed, Kyle was able to transform his weaknesses into strengths, and eventually, he too became known for his ability to write captivating articles. Both Hunter and Kyle continued to write, each making their mark in the world of journalism. Now seasoned writers, they also used their experiences to inspire and mentor the younger generation, fostering a deep-rooted passion for writing and helping others excel in a craft that had once seemed unattainable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Note: A conference call for media with FTC Consumer Protection Director Jessica Rich will occur as follows:      Date: July 1, 2014      Time: 2:45 p.m. ET      Call-in lines, which are for media only, will open 15 minutes prior to the start of the call. Jessica Rich and FTC staff will be available to take questions from the media about the case.      In a complaint filed today, the Federal Trade Commission is charging mobile phone service provider T-Mobile USA, Inc., with making hundreds of millions of dollars by placing charges on mobile phone bills for purported “premium” SMS subscriptions that, in many cases, were bogus charges that were never authorized by its customers.      The FTC alleges that T-Mobile received anywhere from 35 to 40 percent of the total amount charged to consumers for subscriptions for content such as flirting tips, horoscope information or celebrity gossip that typically cost 9.99 per month. According to the FTC’s complaint, T-Mobile in some cases continued to bill its customers for these services offered by scammers years after becoming aware of signs that the charges were fraudulent.            Excerpts from an actual T-Mobile bill showing cramming charges. (click to view full-size)      “It’s wrong for a company like T-Mobile to profit from scams against its customers when there were clear warning signs the charges it was imposing were fraudulent,” said FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez. “The FTC’s goal is to ensure that T-Mobile repays all its customers for these crammed charges.”      In a process known as “third-party billing,” a phone company places charges on a consumer’s bill for services offered by another company, often receiving a substantial percentage of the amount charged. When the charges are placed on the bill without the consumer’s authorization, it is known as “cramming.”      The FTC’s complaint alleges that in some cases, T-Mobile was charging consumers for services that had refund rates of up to 40 percent in a single month. The FTC has alleged that because such a large number of people were seeking refunds, it was an obvious sign to T-Mobile that the charges were never authorized by its customers. As the complaint notes, the refund rate likely significantly understates the percentage of consumers who were crammed. The complaint also states that internal company documents show that T-Mobile had received a high number of consumer complaints at least as early as 2012.      The FTC has made significant efforts to end mobile cramming. In the last year, in addition to holding a public workshop on mobile cramming, the Commission has filed several lawsuits against alleged mobile cramming operations Jesta Digital, Wise Media, and Tatto Inc. According to today’s complaint, T-Mobile billed its customers for the services of these FTC defendants as well as an operation sued by the Texas Attorney General.      The complaint against T-Mobile alleges that the company’s billing practices made it difficult for consumers to detect that they were being charged, much less by whom. When consumers viewed a summary of their T-Mobile bill online, according to the complaint, it did not show consumers that they were being charged by a third party, or that the charge was part of a recurring subscription. The heading under which the charges would be listed, “Premium Services,” could only be seen after clicking on a separate heading called “Use Charges.” Even after clicking, though, consumers still could not see the individual charges.      The complaint also alleges that T-Mobile’s full phone bills, which can be longer than 50 pages, made it nearly impossible for consumers to find and understand third-party subscription charges. After looking past a “Summary” section as well as an “Account Service Detail” section, both of which described “Usage Charges” but did not itemize those charges, a consumer might then reach the section labeled “Premium Services,” where the crammed items would be listed.      According to the complaint, the information would be listed there in an abbreviated form, such as “8888906150BrnStorm23918,” that did not explain that the charge was for a recurring third-party subscription supposedly authorized by the consumer. In addition, the complaint notes that consumers who use pre-paid calling plans do not receive monthly bills, and as a result the subscription fee was debited from their pre-paid account without their knowledge.      When consumers were able to determine they were being charged for services they hadn’t ordered, the complaint alleges that T-Mobile in many cases failed to provide consumers with full refunds. Indeed, the FTC charged that T-Mobile refused refunds to some customers, offering only partial refunds of two months’ worth of the charges to others, and in other cases instructed consumers to seek refunds directly from the scammers – without providing accurate contact information to do so.      The complaint also notes that in some cases, T-Mobile claimed that consumers had authorized the charges despite having no proof of consumers doing so.      The FTC’s complaint seeks a court order to permanently prevent T-Mobile from engaging in mobile cramming and to obtain refunds for consumers and disgorgement of T-Mobile’s ill-gotten gains.      The FTC thanks the Federal Communications Commission and its Enforcement Bureau for their invaluable assistance with and close cooperation and coordination in this matter.      The Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint was 5-0. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.      NOTE: The Commission files a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The case will be decided by the court.

The response from T-Mobile CEO John Legere isn’t exactly what you would describe as contrite.      “We have seen the complaint filed today by the FTC and find it to be unfounded and without merit,” writes Legere. “In fact T-Mobile stopped billing for these Premium SMS services last year and launched a proactive program to provide full refunds for any customer that feels that they were charged for something they did not want.”      So there you go, America. T-Mobile shouldn’t be sued for something it made a mountain of money from because it is no longer making that mountain of money and it’s offering refunds to customers who “feel” they were charged for something they didn’t order.      Legere — who struts around in a leather coat, crashing his competitors’ parties, has a history of making grandiose statements about his company and blatantly mocking his much bigger competitors, and who recently used the word “rape” in reference to AT&T and Verizon — calls the FTC suit “sensationalized,” which is a bit like Bob Hope calling Bing Crosby dead.      Legere comes across like the snotty teen who got caught doing something wrong and then cops an attitude when he’s told that “I’m no longer doing it” does not wipe away the transgression.      In speaking with reporters after today’s announcement, Jessica Rich, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, explained that the agency “did engage in settlement negotiations with T-Mobile, but were not able to reach a settlement.”      Here is the entire statement from Legere, presented in appropriately colored text:      We have seen the complaint filed today by the FTC and find it to be unfounded and without merit. In fact T-Mobile stopped billing for these Premium SMS services last year and launched a proactive program to provide full refunds for any customer that feels that they were charged for something they did not want. T-Mobile is fighting harder than any of the carriers to change the way the wireless industry operates and we are disappointed that the FTC has chosen to file this action against the most pro-consumer company in the industry rather than the real bad actors.      As the Un-carrier, we believe that customers should only pay for what they want and what they sign up for.” said John Legere, CEO T Mobile USA. “We exited this business late last year, and announced an aggressive program to take care of customers and we are disappointed that the FTC has instead chosen to file this sensationalized legal action. We are the first to take action for the consumer, I am calling for the entire industry to do the same.      This is about doing what is right for consumers and we put in place procedures to protect our customers from unauthorized charges. Unfortunately, not all of these third party providers acted responsibly—an issue the entire industry faced. We believe those providers should be held accountable, and the FTC’s lawsuit seeking to hold T-Mobile responsible for their acts is not only factually and legally unfounded, but also misdirected. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — T-Mobile USA knowingly made hundreds of millions off its customers in bogus charges, a federal regulator alleged Tuesday in a complaint likely to damage the reputation of a household name in wireless communications.      In its complaint filed in federal court, the Federal Trade Commission claimed that T-Mobile billed consumers for subscriptions to premium text services such as 10-per-month horoscopes that were never authorized by the account holder. The FTC alleges that T-Mobile collected as much as 40 percent of the charges, even after being alerted by other customers that the subscriptions were scams.      \\"It's wrong for a company like T-Mobile to profit from scams against its customers when there were clear warning signs the charges it was imposing were fraudulent,\\" said FTC Chair Edith Ramirez. \\"The FTC's goal is to ensure that T-Mobile repays all its customers for these crammed charges.\\"      The practice is often referred to as \\"cramming\\": businesses stuff a customer's bill with bogus charges associated with a third party. In this case, the FTC says T-Mobile should have realized that many of these premium text services were scams because of the high rate of customer complaints. But while as many as 40 percent of customers demanded refunds, others didn't notice the charges.      Headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, T-Mobile USA, Inc., is a publicly traded company. According to its website, Deutsche Telekom AG maintains a 67 percent ownership in the company's common stock. |||||Summary:","output":"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint against T-Mobile USA in 2014, alleging that the mobile phone service provider made hundreds of millions of dollars by placing charges on mobile phone bills for premium SMS subscriptions without customer authorization.

Pick the answer from these options Available options: (i). the interaction between abiotic factors (ii). the effects of chemical weathering (iii). the process of deposition (iv). the effects of abrasion","output":"To determine the correct answer, we need to evaluate the given situation and understand the relationship between lichens and the rock. Lichens grow on the rock surface, and the breakdown of rock underneath the lichen suggests a chemical or physical change taking place. Let's analyze step-by-step: 1. Lichens consist of a combination of fungi and algae, which are living organisms. 2. The rock surface is a non-living, natural material. 3. Lichens are known to secrete acids that break down rock surfaces to obtain essential mineral nutrients. 4. The breakdown of the rock surface due to lichen growth is a common phenomenon. Now let's evaluate the options: (i). the interaction between abiotic factors - This option refers to the interaction between non-living factors, which is not applicable in this case, as lichens are living organisms. (ii). the effects of chemical weathering - This option discusses the chemical changes that result in decomposition or disintegration of rock material. Since lichens secrete acids that break down rock surfaces, this option aligns with the given scenario. (iii). the process of deposition - Deposition refers to the process of sediment particles settling and accumulating over time. This option is not relevant to the current situation, as the rock is breaking down, not accumulating particles. (iv). the effects of abrasion - Abrasion refers to the physical wearing down of a surface due to friction or impact. In this case, the breakdown is a result of chemical actions, not physical forces.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.  Question: \\"What is the date of the worst oil spill in history?\\" Response: \\"January, 2011\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

News article: This post has been corrected, as noted below.      It was Kyndall Jack's screams that ultimately led to her rescue, officials said Thursday.      The 18-year-old, who had been missing in Orange County's Trabuco Canyon since Easter Sunday, was airlifted off a rugged hillside Thursday morning and transported to UCI Medical Center in Orange, officials said.      Rescuers reached the woman Thursday morning after a hiker alerted rescue teams of the sounds of a woman screaming near Falls Canyon. Officials said she was about half a mile from where she and a friend, Nicolas Cendoya, parked their car Sunday.      Photos: The search for missing hikers      “She is responsive, appears to be dehydrated, she is weak,” said Lt. Jason Park of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department. “She’s alive, she’s conscious and she’s being transported.”      Park described the operation as a difficult rescue because of the steep terrain. One of the volunteer reserve deputies involved in the search for Jack suffered a head injury after a fall and was being taken to another area hospital.      Capt. John Muir of the Orange County Fire Authority said that when Jack’s parents were told she had been found, “they cried, they hugged us, they thanked us immensely.\\"      \\"This is a good outcome,\\" he told reporters. \\"This is why we do what we do.”      Crews had scoured the difficult terrain since Sunday evening, when Cendoya and Jack called authorities on a cellphone and said they were lost.      Cendoya, 19, was found dehydrated and disoriented on Wednesday night, about half a mile from the parked car off a gravel road that had been traversed by search crews.      Rescuers had to slash through thick brush to get to Cendoya, who was wearing board shorts and a shirt but did not have shoes, Park said.      Cendoya's arms and legs were covered in scratches, officials said. He was rushed to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, where he arrived in \\"very serious\\" condition, Dr. Michael Ritter said.      Ritter said Thursday that Cendoya was responding well to treatment and would probably be released in a few days.      Cendoya's rescue reinvigorated crews searching for Jack, authorities said Thursday morning.      Ritter said Cendoya told him the pair had been \\"hiking around\\" Sunday when night fell and they somehow became separated. Cendoya said that was the last time he saw Jack, the doctor said.      Cendoya covered himself with brush to keep warm, Ritter said. He also prayed.      \\"Nick said the thing that kept him going was praying,\\" Ritter told reporters. \\"He said he would pray every day and every night to give him the strength to get out of there.\\"      [For the record, 3:40 p.m. April 4: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that UC Irvine Medical Center is in Irvine; it is in Orange.]      ALSO:      Groups sue to block Wal-Mart grocery from opening in Chinatown      Mother accused of drowning two daughters commits suicide in jail      Sex offender says being student body president helps him 'move on' ||||| A teenage girl who has been lost in a California canyon since Sunday was found today clinging to the side of a steep cliff and shouting for help, authorities said.      Kyndall Jack, 18, was located a day after her male companion, Nicholas Cendoya, had been found wandering and disoriented in Cleveland National Forest.      Rescue crews rappelled to rescue Jack and she was airlifted to University of California - Irvine hospital, where was being treated for severe dehydration, authorities said.      \\"The most important thing is that she has been found and Nicholas has been found and they are well,\\" siad Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Jason Park.      Kyndall and Cendoya disappeared Easter Sunday while hiking near Trabuco Canyon, Calif.      Jack was wearing shorts and was found clinging to the side of a steep cliff when reached by rescue crews.

Cendoya, 19, was located by another hiker, who was not a part of the search efforts, in thick brush shortly before sundown Wednesday, officials said. The hiker who spotted Cendoya went for help and found firefighters on an unrelated mission nearby. A helicopter brought Cendoya to Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo, where he was listed in serious condition.      Cendoya was located about a half-mile south of where much of the search had focused.      Rescue crews worked through the night, scouring the rough terrain in hopes of finding Jack.      Several dozen searchers with help from helicopters had been combing the rugged hills of Trabuco Canyon.      Two volunteers got lost themselves and had to be airlifted out Wednesday. They were searching the area because the Sunday 911 call was traced to a nearby cell tower, Orange County Fire Authority Capt. John Muir said.      The two were believed to have gone off trail near Holy Jim Trail, a tree-lined dirt path along a creek that leads to a waterfall and is popular with day hikers.      In the 911 call, they said they were about a mile from Jack's car, which was parked at a trailhead, but rescuers expanded the search when they weren't found nearby.      The area is in a section of the national forest in the Santa Ana Mountains, which lie along the border of Orange and Riverside counties southeast of Los Angeles.

A refinery that burned coal was built nearby and over time the water nearby became very acidic. The coral and marine life died because of this but a few miles north on another beach named Greendale the same creatures are surviving just fine.  Will building a refinery at Greendale cause the acidity of the water to increase or decrease?  Hint: Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic. Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume.

Summarize: Normal concealers do not hide facial redness well, but a corrective concealer relies on the principle of complementary colors to balance out discolored skin. For facial redness, apply a green-tinted concealer. Apply small dots of concealer over the red areas of your face. Blend it in gently using your fingertips or a makeup sponge.  If the redness persists over time or is too strong to be covered up by concealer, you may have a condition called rosacea. Contact your dermatologist if you think you may have it.  Avoid applying a heavy layer. The concealer may or may not cover up all of the redness on your face. Even if a standard, moderate amount does not hide every ounce of unwanted red, you should avoid using a thick coating of it. The green tint might start showing through if there is too much concealer to blend into your skin. If you're trying to cover widespread redness from a sunburn, a green-tinted primer might be better than concealer. Your skin redness may be due to sun exposure. Apply sunscreen before leaving the house, even when it seems cloudy. Facial and sensitive-skin sunscreens exist at your local drugstore.  Sunscreen must be at least SPF 30 to be effective.  “Non comedogenic” sunscreen avoids clogging up your pores. You can also buy face makeup or moisturizer that has sunscreen in it. In drier, colder weather, your face can get wind burnt and the particles in the air can strip away healthy layers of skin and damage the surface of your skin. If you protect them, your cheeks and nose will be less rosy once you step back inside a room.  When your face is exposed to the cold, the blood vessels constrict, causing your skin to turn white. Once you step into a warmer area, however, all the blood rushes back to your face at once, causing your skin to become bright red. Wear a scarf, hat, or ski-mask made of non-irritating fibers. There are some dietary changes you can make to help with the redness from the inside. Hydrating, cooling foods like carrots, sweet potatoes, apples, celery, coconuts, cucumbers, melons, peaches, papayas, spinach, and broccoli contain antioxidants capable of moisturizing your skin from the inside out.  If your urine is a pale yellow that is almost clear, you are hydrated enough. If your urine is a concentrated yellow or orange-yellow, you should drink more water. By consuming more of these foods, you can protect your skin from drying out when exposed to cold winter air or other harsh, dry conditions. Avoid spicy foods, hot drinks, caffeine, and alcohol. These encourage skin redness and will only exacerbate your skin problem. Cucumbers have a high water content and many vitamins and minerals that can help hydrate your skin. Peel and slice a chilled cucumber. Lean your head back and place slices over any red areas of your face for 15 to 20 minutes.  Within that amount of time, the vitamin C in the cucumber should have reduced any pesky redness.  Avoid rubbing cucumber over your skin, however, since the friction can cause further irritation. Green tea has anti-inflammatory agents and helps constrict blood vessels in your skin, which will help reduce redness and inflammation. Put several tea bags or a few tablespoons of loose leaf tea in a pot of boiling water and remove from heat. Let the tea steep for 10 minutes. Once the tea steeps, pour it into a bowl and lay a washcloth in the green tea, soaking it up as the tea cools. When the tea is at room temperature, run the tea soaked cloth over your face.  You can also use chamomile and peppermint tea. Avoid using peppermint tea if your skin is sensitive. Make sure you use a cloth you don't mind getting stained. The green tea will have a color and will likely stain whatever cloth you use. Do not rub the cloth over your face vigorously, since that will irritate your skin further. Be careful putting petroleum jelly on acne-prone skin: it can make acne worse. For an extra layer of protection on your skin, you can spread a thin coating of petroleum jelly over your face. The petroleum jelly will prevent your blood vessels from constricting and expanding too quickly, which can reduce or prevent most facial redness. If you are unsure, apply to a small area of your cheek where your redness is not the worst. If your skin is redder or more irritated in a few hours, do not apply jelly to the rest of your face. Cold temperatures can reduce redness by shrinking the blood vessels in your skin. This method is especially useful if the redness is accompanied by feelings of burning or swelling. For the cold compress, take a clean, soft washcloth and run it under cool water. Gently press it to the irritated area.  You can also use an icepack wrapped heavily in towels, if you want to avoid a wet compress. You can also place a wet washcloth in the refrigerator for a few minutes to cool it before pressing it to your face. Do not use rough or cold washcloths.","output":"Normal concealers may not effectively hide facial redness, but corrective concealers use complementary colors to balance out discolored skin.

Context: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human.

Question: Which change will occur in the wire of an electrical circuit that is working properly? Pick your answer from: [I] The wire will become warmer.; [II] The wire will lose some of its mass.; [III] The wire will form an electric field.; [IV] The wire will develop a new crystal structure.; Answer:","output":"Answer: [I] The wire will become warmer. Explanation: When an electrical circuit is working properly, an electric current flows through the wire, which consists of moving charged particles such as electrons. As these electrons flow through the wire, they occasionally interact with the wire's atoms, which vibrate and create resistance. The resistance provided by the wire's atoms results in a transfer of energy from the electrons to the atoms, as the electrons lose some of their energy during the collisions. This energy transfer manifests itself as heat, which causes the wire's temperature to increase. Therefore, the wire will become warmer when an electrical circuit is functioning properly. This effect is most noticeable in cases where the resistance of the wire is relatively high, such as in incandescent light bulbs, where the wire becomes hot enough to produce light when an electric current passes through it. Regarding the other options: [II] The wire will lose some of its mass: It is highly unlikely that the wire will lose any significant portion of its mass while an electrical circuit is working properly. While some loss may occur due to electron collisions causing atoms to be displaced from the wire's surface, the amount of mass lost in this way would be negligible and not noticeable. [III] The wire will form an electric field: While a magnetic field is created around the wire when current flows through it, the electric field is a property of charged objects, not necessarily the wire itself. As an electrical circuit works properly, the electric field would not be a result of the wire itself but rather the voltage source and connected components that influence the distribution of charges. [IV] The wire will develop a new crystal structure: There is no substantial basis for the claim that a new crystal structure will form in the wire. Under normal operating conditions, the wire's lattice structure remains relatively unchanged. However, it should be noted that in cases where high amounts of heat are generated, like in the case of highly resistive wires used in heating elements, the structure may be subject to change over extended usage and time. These changes are usually due to mechanical stress or high-temperature effects, but they are not expected under typical conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Student:","output":"Part #1: Identify the beginning, middles, and ending of the story. Usage: Beginning: Mike was raised in Italy. Middle 1: Mark decided to come to America as an adult. Middle 2: Mike decided to come to America as an adult. Ending: Mike has been making the most delicious pizza's in America since! In this example, we have a clear beginning, two potential middles, and an ending. Part #2: Choose the middle statement that makes the story incoherent / implausible. Usage: \\"Mark decided to come to America as an adult.\\" is the chosen middle statement. This statement makes the story incoherent because it introduces a new character, Mark, and doesn't directly connect to Mike's story, which is the main focus of the story. Part #3: If both sentences are plausible, pick the one that makes less sense. Usage: In this example, we don't need to use this part, since we already found an incoherent middle statement. However, if both middles were coherent, we would choose the one that makes less sense in the context of the story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

[ii] positive.","output":"The sentiment of this tweet can be interpreted as negative. Here's a detailed analysis as to why: [i] Negative: 1. Boredom generally indicates dissatisfaction with one's current situation or activity, which is often considered as a negative emotion. The use of the word \\"bored\\" in the tweet highlights the person's unpleasant state of mind. 2. The repetition of the word \\"really\\" three times intensifies the degree to which the user is feeling bored. This amplifies the negative sentiment, suggesting a stronger expression of this unpleasant emotion. 3. The absence of any positive language or context within the tweet makes it difficult to perceive positivity in the sentiment. The focus remains entirely on the experience of boredom, highlighting the negative emotion associated with it. 4. The use of multiple periods, also known as an ellipsis, at the end of the tweet, could suggest a sense of resignation, a trailing off, or a feeling of being lost. This punctuation choice supports the presence of a negative sentiment, as it might be implying a hopeless or stuck-in-a-rut kind of feeling. Taking these points into consideration, the sentiment of this tweet can be identified as negative. The tweet centers around a negative emotion, boredom, and amplifies it through the repetition of reinforcing adverbs and punctuation choices, ultimately leading to a negative interpretation of the sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-select: Knowing that \\"clams live at the bottom of the ocean\\", how would one answer \\"A boy wants to collect clams for supper and must therefore spend time\\" Pick from: 1. in lake shallows; 2. in desert sands; 3. in rocky hills; 4. in sea depths;...A:","output":"In order to answer the question, \\"A boy wants to collect clams for supper and must therefore spend time\\" based on the information provided, we must first understand the habitat and environment where clams can be found. Since we know that \\"clams live at the bottom of the ocean\\", the best option from the given choices would be \\"4. in sea depths\\". However, it is important to provide a more detailed and lengthy explanation for this choice, taking into account the different factors that play a role in clam collection and ocean depths. Firstly, it is essential to consider the various types of clams that are edible and ideal for supper. Some common varieties include hard-shell clams (also known as quahogs), soft-shell clams (or steamers), and razor clams. Each type of clam has its habitat and specific method of collection. They are generally found along the coastal areas, where ocean tides play a significant role in their life cycle. To collect clams, it is not necessary to dive into deep sea depths. Rather, one should find a suitable location along the coastline, ideally in areas with tidal flats, sandy or muddy bottoms, and shallow water, since these are the preferred habitats of clams. Before heading out to collect clams, it is crucial to know and follow local regulations, seasons, and limits. This can include the requirement of a permit, a specific legal clam size, and a daily bag limit. Responsible clam harvesting not only ensures sustainability but also helps maintain a healthy ecosystem. The collection of clams can be done during low tide when the water recedes, allowing easier access to the ocean floor where clams are buried. Some common clamming methods include digging in the soft sediment with a shovel or rake, using a clamming gun (a suction device specifically designed for clam collection), or simply using bare hands to feel for buried clams. While the actual method utilized may depend on the type of clam being collected and local customs, the common denominator is spending time along the shoreline where clams dwell. Therefore, the boy in question must spend time \\"in sea depths\\", but with a clearer understanding that he should be focused more on coastal areas with appropriate conditions for clam collection, rather than diving deep into the ocean. In conclusion, based on the initial information about clams, the boy would have the most success collecting clams for supper by spending time along the shoreline in appropriate areas, focusing on the sea depths, and particularly during low tide, to locate and harvest these delectable shellfish."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Brave Malala Yousafzai, who has made an astonishing recovery since being shot in the head, refuses to be daunted by the terrorists who tried to assassinate her. She revealed her political aspirations just hours after she was awarded Europe's top human rights prize and on the eve of the announcement for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, for which she was a strong contender but lost out to chemical weapons watchdog OPCW.

Article: A mother whose newborn son was mistakenly turned over by maternity ward staff to another mother and breast-fed has sued the Minneapolis hospital.      Tammy Van Dyke, of Apple Valley, sued Allina Health System's Abbott Northwestern Hospital late last week.      The suit said the Dec. 5, 2012, mix-up led to \\"unnecessary medical treatment, tests and expenses, and severe mental injury and emotional pain and suffering.\\"      In response, Abbott acknowledged the mistake, saying it appears the staff failed to follow procedure of matching codes on the infants' and mothers' identification bands.      Two months later, Abbott instituted a new procedure using higher-tech identification bands to avoid further mix-ups.      \\"We began using electronic identification bands for the mother and infant that must be matched when returning the infant to the mother,\\" said Michelle Smith, who oversees Abbott's Mother Baby Center. \\"This helps us to assure that the identity of the infant and mother are matched each time.\\"      The new system displays a green light to tell the nurse that the mother and baby match.      Allina spokeswoman Gloria O'Connell said Tuesday she's unaware of any such mix-up occurring at Abbott since the electronic bands started being used.      Van Dyke gave birth to son Cody Stepp on Dec. 3, 2012, and the boy was handed over to another mother in the center and breast-fed, the suit said. Cody was wearing three hospital ID bracelets with the proper identification on his ankle, according to his mother.      A few days after the late-night mistake, Van Dyke said that Cody and the other woman, who had given birth to twins, were given blood tests to make sure they were not exposed to any infectious diseases, such as hepatitis or HIV, that can be transmitted through breast milk.      All the tests were negative, she said — but Cody had retesting scheduled every three months for a year.      The suit seeks more than 50,000 and whatever other compensation a court might find proper for Van Dyke.      Her attorney, Wayne Jagow, declined to discuss specific facts of the case, but said they decided to sue after negotiations for a settlement failed.      \\"My client had no desire to bring herself into the limelight again by starting a lawsuit, but really had no choice as our statute of limitations was up,\\" Jagow said in an e-mail. \\"We had attempted to get some sort of dialogue going with Abbott/Allina over the last year to handle this quietly and they simply refused.\\"      Jagow also said Van Dyke was not told of any changes to procedures to prevent this from happening to other families.      \\"This has always been her primary concern,\\" he said. ||||| A newborn baby will have to undergo a year of medical tests for HIV and hepatitis because he was accidentally put in the wrong bassinet by a Minneapolis hospital and then breastfed by the wrong mother.      The mix-up happened Wednesday in Abbott Northwestern Hospital when Tammy Van Dyke's little boy Cody was accidentally switched to the wrong bassinet in the nursery.      \\"You put your baby in the nursery, not even 48-hours old, and you think they're safe,\\" Van Dyke told ABC News today. \\"I'm holding it together. I'm just in disbelief, and it was like I was in a dream, a bad dream, and I couldn't get it to stop.\\"      Van Dyke was told two hours after the switch happened, just hours before she was going to take Cody home.      The infant had to undergo blood testing for HIV and hepatitis immediately following the switch.      \\"It was horrible,\\" Van Dyke said. \\"Two nurses had to go in through veins in his tiny little arms.\\"      Although the tests came back negative, Abbott Northwestern Hospital told Van Dyke her newborn son would have to undergo blood testing every three months for a year.      Hospital spokeswoman Gloria O'Connell said the tests were \\"just a precaution,\\" but declined to elaborate because of patient confidentiality.      Van Dyke was able to speak with the other mother, who had to wait 20 minutes before her baby, Liam, was located.      \\"It gave me peace of mind to talk to her,\\" Van Dyke said. \\"She was just as distraught as me that this happened to her, and in the meantime, also didn't know where her baby was. She has twins.\\"      Van Dyke, who also has a 2-year-old, said the homecoming shortly after wasn't what she thought it would be.      \\"I imagined getting up and getting ready and having Cody in the car with his big brother and coming home as a happy family,\\" Van Dyke said. \\"We were going to videotape the homecoming, showing his room, and I couldn't stop crying. I couldn't put myself together, because it wasn't what I had imagined all this time.\\"      In an apology letter given to her, the hospital states:      \\"Please accept this letter with our sincerest apologies for what occurred today at the hospital, that in the nursery your newborn son was placed in the wrong bassinette and then was taken to the wrong mother and breastfed. The hospital agrees to pay for the additional testing that you had done today and will also pay for the tests recommended for your son related to this incident up to one year.\\"      And in a press release from Abbott Northwestern, practicing obstetrician and Chief Clinical Officer of Allina Health, Dr. Penny Wheeler, said, \\"As an obstetrician, I have personally seen verification of the infant's identifying name band matched correctly with the mother's on hundreds of occasions. It is extremely unfortunate that was not the case this time. We sincerely apologize to the involved families and will make certain we understand why our procedures were not appropriately followed in this case.\\"      \\"I will be thankful to God when this year's over and he's cleared all his health tests and we don't have to think about this again,\\" Van Dyke said. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In December 2012, a newborn baby named Cody was mistakenly given to the wrong mother and breastfed in a Minneapolis hospital.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The last step of the process, after the energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions, is the creation of seismic waves that cause the ground to shake, leading to an earthquake. When the energy builds up in the Earth's crust and reaches a critical point at or near fault lines, the enormous stress causes the fault to slip or give way. This movement of the Earth's plates along the fault line releases the stored energy in the form of seismic waves. There are mainly two types of seismic waves: Body waves and Surface waves. Body waves consist of Primary waves (P-waves) and Secondary waves (S-waves). Primary waves are the fastest-moving seismic waves and cause the ground to move back and forth, while Secondary waves move slower and cause the ground to move up and down as well as side to side. Surface waves, on the other hand, travel along the Earth's surface and cause the most damage due to their larger amplitudes and slower velocities. These seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and along its surface, causing the ground to shake as they pass through. This ground shaking is what we typically experience as an earthquake. The intensity of the shaking can vary greatly depending on the magnitude of the earthquake, the distance from the epicenter, the depth of the earthquake's focus, and the type of geological materials and structures in the affected area. As the seismic waves propagate away from the epicenter, they lose energy and become weaker, resulting in diminishing shaking intensity. However, in some situations, the seismic waves can get trapped in sedimentary basins and amplify, leading to stronger shaking and more significant damage. In the aftermath of an earthquake, several secondary processes might occur. These include aftershocks – smaller earthquakes that follow the main shock and can cause further ground shaking and damage, potential landslides and rockfalls triggered by the initial shaking, and, in coastal areas, the possibility of tsunamis generated by underwater faults or landslides. In summary, the final step of the process after energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions is the generation of seismic waves that propagate through the Earth, causing ground shaking and resulting in an earthquake. This event can lead to varying levels of damage, depending on the specific conditions of each earthquake."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss.

Please answer the following question: ROLAND NARROWED HIS EYES AND STARED UPWARD INTO THE DARKNESS, across the top of Mont Segur toward the Cathar fortress. Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered.

How do you say this sentence in English?","output":"The sentence \\"¿Para qué sirve el CO2?\\" in English translates to \\"What is the purpose of CO2?\\" or \\"What is CO2 used for?\\" Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a chemical compound consisting of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, and it serves several essential functions in our environment and various industries. 1. Photosynthesis: CO2 plays a vital role in the process of photosynthesis carried out by plants, algae, and some microorganisms. These organisms use sunlight, water, and CO2 to produce glucose, a type of sugar that provides energy for growth, and release oxygen as a byproduct. Photosynthesis maintains a balance of oxygen and CO2 in the atmosphere and is the primary source of oxygen required for life on Earth. 2. The Carbon Cycle: CO2 is a crucial component of the Earth's natural carbon cycle, where carbon is exchanged among the atmosphere, oceans, and terrestrial ecosystems. It is released into the atmosphere through respiration, decomposition of organic matter, and combustion of fossil fuels. CO2 in the atmosphere can be absorbed by plants for photosynthesis or dissolved in the ocean, where it participates in the marine ecosystem and can eventually form carbonate rocks. This continuous cycle helps regulate Earth's climate and atmospheric composition. 3. Greenhouse Effect: CO2 is a greenhouse gas that absorbs and emits infrared radiation. The greenhouse effect refers to the process by which certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat, warming the Earth's surface and stabilizing its climate. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have led to an increase in CO2 concentrations, causing a significant impact on global climate change. 4. Industrial and Commercial Uses: CO2 has various applications in different industries and commercial processes. It is used in food and beverage industries as a refrigerant, to carbonate drinks, and to preserve freshness. In the medical field, CO2 is utilized for its constriction and dilation properties in certain medical procedures. Additionally, CO2 is employed in fire extinguishers, the production of chemicals, and enhanced oil recovery techniques. In conclusion, carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of life on Earth and has a range of applications across various industries. However, it is essential to manage CO2 emissions responsibly to prevent adverse effects on the environment and global climate."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"what is the first area mentioned?\\"  Context: \\"Ptolemy's Geography divided Asia on a similar basis.

What did the English dancer Margaret Kelly found in 1932????","output":"In 1932, the accomplished English dancer and actress Margaret Kelly founded one of the most iconic and glamorous dance troupes in history, known as the Bluebell Girls. The dance troupe originated in Paris, France, and quickly gained widespread acclaim for their high-kicking and spectacular choreographed routines, forever changing the face of French cabaret entertainment. Margaret Kelly was born on June 24, 1910, in Liverpool, England. She began dancing at a young age and pursued a career as a professional dancer. After moving to Paris, she was given the nickname \\"Miss Bluebell\\" due to her beautiful blue eyes. This, in turn, inspired the name of her famed dance troupe. The Bluebell Girls were initially formed as a chorus line of classically trained dancers with precise choreography, adept at performing high leg-kicks and elaborate dance routines. The group's home base was the legendary Lido de Paris, a luxurious cabaret and burlesque show venue located on the world-famous Champs-Élysées. They quickly became the star attraction at the Lido and across numerous other premier Parisian entertainment venues such as the Moulin Rouge and the Folies Bergère. The key to the Bluebell Girls' immense success was largely due to Margaret Kelly's high standards and commitment to discipline and quality. She carefully chose talented dancers from around the world, ensuring they were well-trained and exhibited grace, poise, elegance, and uniformity. The girls stood out due to their height, which was a crucial factor in their selection. Margaret Kelly insisted that her dancers should be tall, with a minimum height requirement of 5'8\\" for American dancers and 5'10\\" for dancers of other nationalities. Throughout their illustrious career, the Bluebell Girls performed for millions of people, including Hollywood stars, politicians, and European royalty. They participated in renowned events such as the prestigious Royal Variety Performance in England, and their shows were elaborate productions complete with ornate costumes, grand sets, and spectacular special effects. Margaret Kelly's Bluebell Girls served as a stepping stone for many dancers who would eventually develop successful solo careers in the entertainment industry. Kelly eventually retired from active involvement in the dance troupe in 1986, though she remained the honorary president until her death in 2004. Today, the legacy of the Bluebell Girls and their contribution to the world of cabaret and dance endures, as they continue to uphold the high standards set by their founder. In summary, Margaret Kelly founded the iconic Bluebell Girls dance troupe in 1932 in Paris, France. Trained in classical dance, the group revolutionized French cabaret entertainment with their high-kicking routines and unique blend of elegance, precision, and glamour. The legacy of the Bluebell Girls lives on as they continue to captivate audiences across the world as a symbol of timeless showmanship and the creative vision of their pioneering founder."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Who is more likely to have LDL cholesterol build up in the inner walls of their arteries?  Michael and Robert are two patients at a cardiology clinic. Both just received their blood test results and were told that they need to improve their cholesterol levels. They were each recommended to begin exercising regularly. Michael took this advice to heart, and began regular aerobic exercise every week. Robert, on the other hand, only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks.  Hint: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.","output":"Based on the information provided, Robert is more likely to have LDL cholesterol build up in the inner walls of their arteries. This is because he only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks, whereas Michael took the advice to heart and began regular aerobic exercise every week. Regular aerobic exercise is known to lower LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) and increase HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol), which helps to prevent the build-up of LDL cholesterol in the arteries. Since Robert exercises less frequently than Michael, he has a higher risk of LDL cholesterol build-up."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article:","output":"Title: The Unique Diet of Two-Million-Year-Old South African Pre-Humans Introduction Recent analysis of a two-million-year-old \\"missing link\\" fossil discovered in South Africa has provided fascinating insights into the diet of these pre-humans. While the diet of other early hominids has been relatively well-documented, little was known about the unique South African species, until now. Researchers have found that unlike other pre-human species, this short and gangly creature consumed a diet rich in leaves and fruit – a striking resemblance to the diet of modern-day chimpanzees. Unearthing the Missing Link The fossil in question, referred to as the \\"missing link,\\" is believed to bridge the evolutionary gap between modern humans and their distant ancestors. Uncovered in South Africa, this rare find has the potential to shed light on the little-known history of our own lineage. By studying the diet of these early hominids, scientists hope to better understand the evolutionary changes that led to the development of Homo sapiens as the sole surviving member of the hominid taxonomic family. A Diet Rich in Leaves and Fruit Researchers have meticulously analyzed the fossil's preserved dental remains, offering a glimpse of a species that once thrived in the abundant landscapes of South Africa. Intriguingly, the findings revealed that this particular hominid had a diet predominantly composed of leaves and fruit. Such a diet starkly contrasts with that of other pre-humans, making this South African species truly unique. The research team's findings showed strong evidence of the short and gangly creature relying heavily on soft, easy-to-consume vegetation like leaves, while also incorporating larger quantities of fruit into its dietary intake. These food choices significantly differ from other pre-human diets that were primarily based on nuts, seeds, and root vegetables – a reflection of a distinct lifestyle and habitat. A Connection to Modern Chimpanzees Interestingly, the diet of the South African pre-human species draws an intriguing parallel with that of present-day chimpanzees. Chimps are known to primarily consume fruit and leaves, with a diet comprising of approximately 58% fruit, 27% leaves, and the remaining percentage consisting of seeds, flowers, and other plant materials, as well as insects. This striking similarity in dietary habits between the two-million-year-old South African pre-human and modern chimpanzees provides intriguing insights into their potential relationship and shared ancestry. Conclusion The analysis of this rare \\"missing link\\" fossil has undeniably expanded our understanding of early human evolution, particularly concerning the unique dietary habits of the South African pre-human species. By comparing this pre-human's diet to that of modern chimpanzees, scientists can uncover new information about the evolution of our own species and the environment in which it thrived. The findings prompt further exploration into the diets and lifestyles of pre-human species found in other regions, creating a more comprehensive view of the diverse history of humankind. As the field of paleoanthropology continues to evolve and unearth new discoveries, we come one step closer to unraveling the fascinating mysteries that lie at the core of our own lineage and history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: + They paid their bills . + They have extra responsibility . + They had good alternatives . + They paid their mortgage .","output":"The narrator's life seems to be brimming with challenges and responsibilities. Analyzing the given text, we can infer the following truths about the narrator's life: 1. They paid their bills: The narrator explicitly mentions, \\"I have bills.\\" While they do not specifically say that they paid their bills, it can be implied that as the sole breadwinner for the family, they would be responsible for ensuring that the bills are paid. This statement showcases the financial obligations they have to fulfill. 2. They have extra responsibility: The statement, \\"I was the only one working in my family,\\" clearly establishes that the narrator bears the burden of not just their own needs but also those of their family members. This additional weight makes their life more challenging and demanding as compared to someone without such an obligation. 3. They had good alternatives: This statement, in fact, is not true. The narrator explicitly mentions that \\"there were no good alternatives available.\\" This lack of appealing options has not only limited their choices but also forced them to make difficult decisions on the spot. 4. They paid their mortgage: Similar to the first statement, while the narrator mentions, \\"I have a mortgage to pay,\\" they do not explicitly state that they paid their mortgage. However, it can be assumed that being the sole breadwinner, the narrator would have to ensure that the mortgage is paid to maintain their family's living situation. In conclusion, out of the four possible answers provided, two are true of the narrator's life: \\"They paid their bills\\" and \\"They have extra responsibility.\\" The other two options - \\"They had good alternatives\\" and \\"They paid their mortgage\\" - are not necessarily true since the narrator explicitly denies any existence of good alternatives, and there is no direct mention of whether the mortgage was indeed paid."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tara Maclay is a fictional character created for the action-horror/fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003). She was developed by Joss Whedon and portrayed by Amber Benson. Tara is a shy young woman with magical talents who falls in love with Willow Rosenberg, one of the core characters. Together, they help Buffy Summers, who has been given superhuman powers to defeat evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. Tara becomes more outspoken during the sixth season about the ethics of Willow's use of magic, cautioning Willow that she depends too much on it. The dynamics of their relationship suddenly turn during \\"Once More, with Feeling\\". Willow had cast a spell on Tara to alter her memory in the preceding episode and Tara finds out about it during \\"Once More, with Feeling\\", the musical episode of the series. Tara was given a prominent role in the musical due to the skill of Benson's voice: she sings a love ballad to Willow, a duet with Giles, and backup in two other songs. The musical nature of the episode compelled the characters to express what they had been feeling secretly, or had refused to admit to themselves. Tara's song is a fervent and explicit expression of love for Willow which she had not made clear to the audience until this point. Tara later sings with Giles that she will leave Willow if she does not change. Self-conscious about her singing abilities, Hannigan requested not to be given a song and sings only a few lines in the episode. Critics saw this as Tara's personality becoming more forceful as Willow begins to show signs of weakness as she is overtaken by her addiction. Tara challenges Willow to go for a week without using any magic. Willow almost immediately breaks her promise, however, and Tara leaves her at the end of \\"Tabula Rasa\\". Tara remains a part of the group, spending time with Dawn, and non-judgmentally acting as Buffy's confessor when Buffy divulges she has a painful and compulsive sexual relationship with Spike, a vampire whom she loathes.  Despite their separation, Tara remains devoted to Willow's recovery and supports her in her decision to abstain from using magic. She is, according to author Lorna Jowett, one of the few characters who is never seduced by evil. Shuttleworth notes that most Buffy characters go through a rite of transformation except for Tara. Among female characters she is the most virtuous. Like the other Buffy characters in the series whose names have symbolic interpretations, Tara's name resembles the Latin terra, meaning \\"earth.\\" She is solidly grounded, with Willow attached to her, and Benson's body more naturally representative of women. Tara is wholly feminine both in dress and demeanor, as opposed to Buffy and (less) Willow mostly dressed with trousers and jackets, but never seeks male approval. She is clad in earthy, natural colors, long flowing skirts and clinging blouses, with an intent to comfort instead of arouse as other women on the show are dressed. Her admonishments to other characters are always made with love, with their best interests at heart. Even Tara's last words, commenting that Willow's shirt is stained (with Tara's own blood), indicate her preoccupation with the welfare of others.  Tara has also appeared in The Long Way Home, Always Darkest, Retreat, and the one-off Willow.","output":"This text is about Tara Maclay, a fictional character from the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this math problem Solve 4807 - 5192 = 35*d for d.","output":"First, let's look at the problem in a clearer way, focusing on solving for the variable d: 4807 - 5192 = 35 * d This is a simple linear algebra equation wherein we need to find the value of variable 'd'.  The first step to solving for 'd' is to simplify the left side. To do so, we will perform the subtraction operation between 4807 and 5192. So we get: -385 = 35*d  This simplifies the equation, as it now only has one operation left, which is the division to find the value of 'd'.  To isolate the variable on one side and ensure 'd = something', you divide both sides of the equation by 35. Considering that every operation performed on one side of the equation must be performed on the other side as well to maintain the equality, we get: d = -385 / 35 Now, we just need to perform the simple division operation to find the value of 'd'. So, we have: d = -11 So, to summarize:  You start with 4807 - 5192 = 35*d. Subtracting the two values on the left gives us -385 = 35*d.  Then you isolate 'd' by dividing both sides of the equation by 35, giving you d = -11.  Therefore, the solution to the problem 4807 - 5192 = 35*d is d = -11."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Don't give up: there may be a place for you in the world of voice-acting.  _ . In addition to many appearances on television and in movies, Rickey is a voice-over actor, someone we hear but don't see. Rickey has acted since he was 6, both on and off camera. After school, his grandmother-- a manager and acting coach--helped him develop his skills by doing voice exercises and reading aloud. Voice-over actors do many kinds of acting. They are the voices of cartoon characters on television, in movies and video games, and for communicating toys. In films, they replace the foreign language conversation with English version. They create crowd noises, make commercials, act in radio plays, and record telephone instructions and public announcements. They read books on tape and even record museum tours. Like other actors, voice-over actors need to understand scripts, interpret characters, and breathe correctly. They have to master voice techniques, such as pacing, volume, and range. Sometimes they use their normal voices; other times they change their voices to create different characters or noises. Rickey receives his Danny Phantom scripts only a few days before he tapes each episode . He writes helpful notes on the script to guide himself on speaking his part. Rickey practices, then tapes at the recording studio. He and the other cast members sit in a soundproof booth, acting out their characters as they read their lines into the microphones. \\"The cartoon gets created after we record the words, so we have to imagine everything in our mind,\\" says Rickey.

The PQ advocates national sovereignty for Quebec involving independence of the province of Quebec from Canada and establishing a sovereign state. The PQ has promoted the possibility of maintaining a loose political and economic sovereignty-association between Quebec and Canada. The party traditionally has support from the labour movement, but unlike most other social-democratic parties, its ties with the labour movement are informal. Members and supporters of the PQ are called \\"péquistes\\" (;), a French word derived from the pronunciation of the party's initials.  - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language.  - The Saguenay River (French: \\"Rivière Saguenay\\") is a major river of Quebec, Canada.

The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers.

Another option is to fill the bottle with the vinegar and water solution. Then, let the solution sit in the bottle for one to two minutes. Once you have soaked the bottle, rinse out the solution. Then, use a damp brush or a sponge to scrub the bottle. Make sure you scrub the mouth and lid of the bottle well, as this is usually where germs live. Scrubbing the bottle will also help to remove any remaining vinegar in the bottle. Let the water bottle air dry on a drying rack or a clean towel overnight. If you are in a rush, you can use a clean cloth to dry the bottle. Make sure you dry the mouth and lid of the bottle well.","output":"The article provides a detailed guide on how to clean and disinfect a water bottle using a simple solution of white vinegar and water. This method is efficient and effective in removing germs and bacteria, ensuring a safe and clean bottle for use.  Firstly, prepare the cleaning solution by mixing equal parts of white vinegar and water in a bowl. There are two ways to use this solution for cleaning the water bottle. The first method is to submerge the bottle entirely in the solution, ensuring that it fills the inside as well. The second method is to pour the solution directly into the bottle. In either case, let the bottle soak in the solution for about one to two minutes for the cleaning process to take effect. After soaking the bottle, thoroughly rinse out the solution using water. Proceed to scrub the entire bottle, paying extra attention to the mouth and lid areas, using a damp brush or sponge. These parts require special care as they are typically the most prone to germ accumulation. Scrubbing also helps eliminate any remaining vinegar residue inside the bottle. Once the scrubbing process is complete, allow the water bottle to air dry by placing it on a drying rack or a clean towel overnight. Air drying is more effective in removing any lingering moisture or smells. However, if you need your water bottle to dry quickly, you can use a clean cloth to pat it dry, ensuring that the mouth and lid areas are thoroughly dried as well. In summary, the article emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clean and germ-free water bottle for health reasons.

The Minister, Dr Elioda Tumwesigye, spoke of the plan on 'The Truth About AIDS' on the BBC World Service. \\"We want to give an opportunity to every Ugandan at least one round to say yes or no to an HIV test,\\" he said. \\"We will go to every home, every village, and test.\\" Dr Tumwesigye claimed this door-to-door approach to testing counselling had worked well in the Western Ugandan district he represents as a member of parliament. If the East African country can establish the HIV status of nine out of every ten people, it will have achieved the first of three targets of a new grand initiative led by UNAids (the Joint United Nations programme on HIV/Aids). The 90-90-90 strategy is aimed at effectively ending the pandemic by the year 2030, by exploiting the preventative potential of well managed HIV/Aids treatment. If a patient takes their antiretroviral drugs properly, the amount of virus in the blood and other body fluids is lowered to a level where it is essentially undetectable. At these levels, the risk of transmitting the virus to other people is much reduced. The second 90 of the UNAids formula requires that 90% of those identified as HIV positive should be on antiretroviral therapy. The final criterion is that 90% of the patients on treatment must maintain complete virological suppression. In other words, therapy must be well enough administered and managed that the virus is unable to replicate in the body. UNAids has set a goal for countries to implement this regime by 2020. If nations can achieve this, computer modelling shows that the rate of new infections would be curbed drastically by the year 2030. The expense of ramping up services might be high in the short-term, but economic benefits are reaped later on as the cost of treating far fewer new patients plummets. Joshua Musinguzi, head of Uganda's Aids control programme said that his country has some way to go to reach the targets, but that they are achievable. \\"I like them because they are setting a stage for the country to move towards epidemic control. \\"The idea now is to move towards an Aids-free generation for Uganda. \\"In the last three consecutive years, we have actually enrolled more people on treatment each year than the number of new infections in those years. \\"This is a tipping point in the epidemic.\\" That is a significant milestone. However, Professor Vinand Nantulya, head of the Uganda Aids Commission, points out that currently the number of infected people on treatment is outnumbered by those who are not. \\"In Uganda, it's about 1.7 million people who should be on treatment and so far we are reaching about 800,000\\", said Prof Nantulya. \\"So we will need [more] money and [more] staff in the hospitals and clinics to put people on treatment, and then we need to follow up those on treatment to be sure that the treatment is having impact on the viral load in the blood.\\" Monitoring viral load requires expensive lab equipment that is not available in most Ugandan hospitals and clinics. More than doubling the number of people on medication will more than double the antiretroviral drugs bill. Currently about 80% of Uganda's HIV medication is paid for by international donors while the rest comes from the country's own coffers. Both overseas funders and the Ugandan government will need to dig much deeper to meet UNAids' 90-90-90 targets. According to Dr Medard Bitekyerezo, deputy chairperson of the Parliamentary Aids committee:  \\"We are looking at levies on bank transactions and interest. \\"We are looking at air tickets, beer, soft drinks and even cigarettes,\\" as examples of goods and services which could be taxed to feed the AIDS fund. Dr Bitekyerezo stressed: \\"This money is going to be specifically targeted for HIV-related issues\\". Zimbabwe and Ghana are the only other African countries with similar HIV-dedicated funding mechanisms. Listen to The Truth About Aids on the BBC World Service What is a summary of this text?","output":"The Minister of Health in Uganda wants more than 90% of people in the country to know if they have HIV or not.

The goal is to help end the spread of HIV by 2030. If people with HIV take their medicine correctly, they have a much lower chance of giving the virus to others. Uganda still has some work to do to reach the 90-90-90 targets, but they believe it is possible.

Q: which british prime minister declared war on germany? A:","output":"A: Neville Chamberlain, who served as the British Prime Minister from 1937 to 1940, officially declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939. Neville Chamberlain, a member of the Conservative Party, was in office during the critical period of the late 1930s when tensions in Europe were escalating dangerously. Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime had aggressively expanded its grasp on European territory through annexations and military invasions, beginning with the remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936, followed by the annexation of Austria in 1938, and the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939. Throughout these increasingly threatening geopolitical developments, Chamberlain pursued a policy of appeasement, which aimed to prevent the outbreak of a potentially catastrophic war by making diplomatic concessions to the expansionist demands of Nazi Germany. Chamberlain was hopeful that by addressing some of Germany's grievances from the Treaty of Versailles (the 1919 peace treaty that imposed harsh conditions upon Germany following World War I), Britain could satisfy Hitler and prevent further conflict. However, his policy of appeasement is now widely considered to have been misguided and ineffective. Hitler's appetite for conquest only grew, and Chamberlain's efforts to maintain peace did little to halt the Nazi regime's aggressive expansion. The tipping point came in September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. This was a direct violation of the Munich Agreement, which Chamberlain had helped to broker in 1938. The Munich Agreement, hailed by Chamberlain as an assurance of \\"peace for our time,\\" had granted Germany the Sudetenland—a predominantly German-speaking region of Czechoslovakia—on the condition that Hitler would make no further territorial claims in Europe. Hitler's invasion of Poland shattered any remaining optimism surrounding the policy of appeasement. In response, both Britain and France, which had treaty obligations to defend Poland, issued ultimatums to Germany demanding the withdrawal of their forces. When Germany failed to comply, both countries declared war on September 3, 1939. With that, Neville Chamberlain, the British Prime Minister, reluctantly proclaimed Britain's entry into World War II. In May 1940, following mounting criticism over his leadership during the war, Chamberlain resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded by Winston Churchill, who led Britain through its darkest hour and saw the Allied powers ultimately secure victory in 1945."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Men with a beer belly could be at risk of dying up to 17 years earlier than their leaner counterparts.  The Dangers of Abdominal Fat: In contrast with subcutaneous fat, which is stored just beneath the skin, the fat that accumulates around the midsection wraps itself around vital organs such as the stomach, liver, intestines, and pancreas. This visceral fat not only increases blood pressure but also releases harmful inflammatory chemicals and hormones, which can ultimately lead to a myriad of health issues. Excess abdominal fat has been directly linked to a higher risk of developing chronic conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and respiratory illnesses. Life Expectancy Impact: Margaret Ashwell's analysis unearthed alarming findings about the link between abdominal fat and life expectancy. Men with a beer belly are now forecasted to die up to 17 years earlier than those sporting a flat stomach. This staggering statistic highlights the urgent need for individuals with excess abdominal fat to take action in order to improve their overall health and extend their life expectancy. Why Belly Fat is More Dangerous: The reason behind abdominal fat being more dangerous than fat stored in other areas of the body lies in its proximity to essential organs. Fat pressing against these vital organs can impair their functioning, leading to inflammation and the production of harmful chemicals. Specifically, visceral fat generates a hormone called angiotensinogen, which accelerates blood pressure, increasing the risk of heart disease. Additionally, the fat cells around the waist secrete even more inflammatory cytokines-chemical messengers that further exacerbate health problems. Preventative Measures to Reduce Abdominal Fat: Tackling the issue of abdominal fat is not only critical for one's overall health but also for extending one's life expectancy. Implementing healthy lifestyle changes can significantly reduce excess belly fat and lower the risk of developing serious health conditions. The following are a few suggested preventative measures: 1. Balanced diet: Incorporate fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains into your daily meals. Limit the consumption of sugary and processed foods that contribute to weight gain and the formation of harmful visceral fat.  2. Regular exercise: Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with strength training exercises for all major muscle groups. 3. Stress management: High levels of stress can lead to hormone imbalances that encourage fat accumulation around the midsection. Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, can help in managing stress levels more effectively. 4. Adequate sleep: Aim for six to eight hours of sleep per night to maintain hormonal balance and support overall health. 5. Alcohol moderation: Limit alcohol intake as excessive consumption can contribute to weight gain, specifically around the abdominal area. Conclusion: While \\"beer belly\\" may seem like a benign term, its implications are far more serious than just an aesthetic concern. Excess abdominal fat is a significant risk factor for numerous health problems, ultimately leading to a shortened life expectancy. By embracing a healthier lifestyle that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, stress management, and alcohol moderation, individuals can effectively combat this silent killer and lead a happier, healthier, and longer life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who moved to London on completing his seven-year indenture? from the following article ?  William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

Please briefly summarize this news article: Flooding and Rain Hits East Coast (CHARLESTON, S.C.) — Flooding from days of record-setting rain along the heavily populated East Coast washed out bridges and homes, and forecasters warned wind gusts topping 35 mph could down trees and power lines across the Carolinas and Virginia in the coming hours. At least five weather-related deaths have been reported since rains began spreading over the Eastern Seaboard, which has appeared to dodge the full fury of Hurricane Joaquin churning hundreds of miles out in the Atlantic. President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency in South Carolina and ordered federal aid to bolster state and local efforts as flood warnings remained in effect for many parts of the East Coast through Sunday. The steady downpour drew its moisture from a slow-moving low-pressure system over the Southeast that has linked up to a finger of tropical moisture from Hurricane Joaquin. Heavy rain was expected to continue overnight in the Carolinas and parts of northern Georgia and could cause some significant river and stream flooding, the National Weather Service said. The low-pressure system also was expected to whip up stiff northeasterly winds in the Blue Ridge mountains of the Carolinas and western Virginia with gusts up to 35 mph through Sunday, the weather service said. With tree roots already loosened in waterlogged soil, increased winds held the prospect of toppling trees onto power lines or property. “We’re not out of the woods yet,” North Carolina emergency management director Mike Sprayberry said late Saturday. High winds toppled a tree that hit a vehicle and killed a passenger Thursday near Fayetteville, North Carolina. Three people died in separate weather-related traffic incidents in South Carolina on Friday and Saturday, the Highway Patrol said. A drowning in Spartanburg, South Carolina, also was linked to the storm. The Greenville-Spartanburg Airport in South Carolina recorded 2.3 inches of rain Saturday, smashing the previous record of 0.77 inches set in 1961, according to John Tomko, National Weather Service meteorologist at Greenville-Spartanburg. “This one is extraordinary in that it’s such a prolonged event,” he said. Downtown Charleston was closed off to incoming traffic Saturday as rain flooded roads and left some motorists stranded as flood waters engulfed their cars, including a white BMW with water to the engine. At least two bridges were washed out in other parts of the state “Where we normally are dealing with flooding for a few hours, we’re dealing with it in days here,” Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen told The Associated Press. “We’re seeing areas flood today that did not traditionally flood.” Flooded roads were closed throughout the mid-Atlantic region and power companies reported scattered outages in several states. In New Jersey, storms dislodged an entire house from its pilings in a low-lying area of Middle Township in southern Jersey. No one was in the residence. Flood watches and warnings also are in effect in Delaware and parts of New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia. The weather service issued a warning for residents living along the coast to be alert for rising water. A combination of high water and high waves could cause beach erosion and damage docks and piers. In Ocean City, Maryland, spokeswoman Jessica Waters said moderate high tide flooding Saturday forced street closures in low-lying areas but caused no major damages or injuries. Meanwhile, the Atlantic Seaboard was spared what could have been much worse damage had Joaquin not continued on a path well off the U.S. coast. And some people found ways to enjoy the wet weather, cavorting in kayaks and canoes in some flooded areas. Steven Capito spent the day surfing by the Ocean View Fishing Pier in Norfolk, Virginia, where two- to three-foot waves crashed ashore. Ordinarily, he said waves from the Chesapeake Bay would barely lap his ankles. “It’s kind of a fun novelty to be out here in the bay,” said Capito, who lives in Virginia Beach. “You only get to do it a couple of times a year and it’s nice and warm.” Smith reported from Charleston and Foreman from Charlotte, North Carolina. Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Brock Vergakis in Norfolk, Virginia; David Dishneau in Ocean City, Maryland; Bruce Shipkowski in Trenton, New Jersey, and Julie Walker in New York.","output":"Record-setting rain and flooding have hit the heavily populated East Coast of the United States, causing destruction of bridges and homes.

Sauvage snaps out of his stupor just long enough to join Clarence Bowden (Julian D. Christopher), his former commanding officer, to work as a bodyguard for former World Heavyweight boxing champion and now successful businessman Wayne Barclay (Raz Adoti). It appears that the release of notorious rap mogul Terrell Singletery (Viv Leacock) from prison has caused Barclay's worried sister Tamara (Vivica A. Fox) to take pro-active action by hiring Bowden and Sauvage, as Singletery has made threats in the past about doing away with the one man responsible for his incarceration Barclay himself. The first night of bodyguard work does not go well for Sauvage and Bowden, as Bowden gets killed during an assassination attempt on Barclay by a Hummer full of Uzi-carrying gangbangers sent by Singletery. It is up to Sauvage to continue the fight, which means bringing in a reinforcement in his friend Casey Bledsoe (Mark Griffin), and training some new recruits not of his choosing.

As the evening progressed, Lawrence couldn't resist the bowl of mixed nuts on the table. The saltiness mixed with the varying textures of almonds, cashews, and pecans made it difficult for him to stop munching on them. Adam, on the other hand, preferred different types of snacks and was content with the occasional handful of nuts.  While eating the salty nuts, Lawrence sipped a refreshing cold beverage, which only seemed to make the nuts more enticing. As they sat on the couch engaged in conversation, Lawrence continued to dip his hand into the bowl of nuts, enjoying the satisfying crunch that accompanied every bite. Since the nuts were positioned within Lawrence's reach, and he enjoyed them so much, his natural instinct was to continuously eat them. Adam, on the other hand, wasn't as much of a fan of salty snacks, preferring sweeter alternatives. He had a small plate of chocolate chip cookies nearby, which he nibbled on from time to time. He liked the sweet and comforting taste of the cookies and felt that there was no reason to force himself to eat more nuts than he wanted. Adam's fondness for his dessert allowed Lawrence to eat more nuts without feeling guilty about it. As the evening came to an end, the bowl of nuts was nearly empty. Lawrence, still enjoying the taste of the salty snack, felt no regret about indulging in his favorite type of treat. Adam, who barely consumed half the cookies, was satisfied with his self-restraint and was glad that both of them were able to have something they loved. In conclusion, it was Lawrence's preference for salty snacks that led him to eat more nuts than Adam did, while Adam's inclination towards sweet treats like cookies made him content with a smaller portion of nuts.

Elaborating on the matter, the tribunal said the agency was not providing enough public information about the important safeguards that regulate how data is passed to foreign governments and UK law enforcement departments. The way GCHQ was handling and sharing information until recently contravened the privacy rights of individuals, established under the European Convention of Human Rights. With this paragraph, I’m providing a more detailed explanation of why the tribunal found the GCHQ's practices as contravening privacy rights. It is essential to lay out the specifics of the issue for the readers to fully comprehend the tribunal's concerns.  While the tribunal's judgment is a significant setback, the UK Home Office reiterated the government's commitment to transparency. It stated that the government is fully resolved to comply with all legal frameworks, an explicit reference to the criticism levied at GCHQ.  In this paragraph, I am incorporating the response from the UK Home Office to maintain a balanced view and offer readers insight into how the government is addressing the concerns raised by the tribunal. Reporting the government's standpoint is crucial to present the entire narrative. Given that the tribunal's criticism of GCHQ only relates to practices until December, it’s apparent that changes have been enacted to address these concerns. It remains to be seen how effective such changes have been and whether they will fulfill the government's commitment to transparency, whilst still ensuring national security.  In the conclusion, I'm speculating about the possible effects of this judgment. Giving readers a sense of future developments effectively rounds out the article and paves the way for further reporting. To conclude, I'm re-emphasizing on the crux of the issue: a balance between privacy and national security.  Throughout the article, I focused on presenting the facts clearly and objectively, which is the essence of good journalism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Lorry Page, a co-founder of Google, played saxophone in high school. The former World Bank president James D. Wolfensohn has played cello at Carnegie Hall. The connection isn't a coincidence. I know because I asked. I put the question to top-flight professionals in industries from tech to finance to media, all of whom had serious ( if often little-known) past lives as musicians. Almost all made a connection between their music training and their professional achievements. Will your school music program turn your kid into a Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft (guitar)? Or a Woody Allen (clarinet )? Probably not. These are outstanding achievers. But the way these and other visionaries   I spoke to process music is interesting. But the key question is: why does that connection exist? Paul Allen offers an answer. He says music \\"establish your confidence in the ability to create.\\" He began playing the violin at age 7 and switched to the guitar as a teenager. Even in the early days of Microsoft, he would pick up his guitar at the end of marathon days of programming. The music was the emotional analog   to his day job, both of them show his different creativity. He says, \\"something is pushing you to look beyond what currently exists and express yourself in a new way.\\" For many of the high achievers I spoke with, music functions as a \\"hidden language,\\" as Mr. Wolfensohn calls it, one that enhances the ability to connect different or even opposite ideas.

The less weight, the more speed one can generate with the same amount of effort with comparison to higher weight. In this case, the user mentions Jennifer has been overweight, which caused her slowness in gaining speed but after a year of regular running, Jennifer has become quite light. This weight loss should grant her an increase in speed with the same energy exerted. Therefore, her lightweight status suggests that she \\"speeds up quickly\\" (Option A).

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"Scalars and vectors are two types of quantities used to describe different aspects of physical phenomena. Scalars are quantities that have only magnitude, and they do not have direction. Examples of scalar quantities include mass, energy, and temperature. Scalars can be described by a single numerical value. Vectors, on the other hand, are quantities that have both magnitude and direction. Examples of vector quantities include displacement, velocity, and force. Vectors are typically represented by an arrow that indicates the magnitude by its length and the direction by the arrowhead. Mathematically, vectors are typically described using components, which are the individual parts of the vector along each axis of the coordinate system. The reason why vectors have components and scalars don't is due to the directional aspect of vectors. Components are necessary to describe the direction of a vector in a coordinate system. A scalar, because it has no direction, does not require components to express its value. As for the last question, I assume you are asking if \\"Scalars vs. Vectors\\" and \\"Why do vectors have components and scalars don't?\\" have the same meaning. While both questions relate to the nature of scalars and vectors, they are not exactly the same. The first one asks for the definitions of scalars and vectors, while the second one asks specifically why vectors have components and scalars don't.

Possible A: roof, field, meadow, garden, garbage can  Why is \\"roof\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Roof\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense as a location where you would be unlikely to find bugs because it is an environment not particularly conducive to supporting the needs of insects. Here are some detailed reasons: 1. Limited Food Sources: Bugs, like any other living organisms, require sustenance to survive. Roofs, being primarily constructed of materials like shingles, tiles, or metal, do not provide the organic matter that constitutes the primary food source for many insects. Furthermore, the elevated nature of roofs limits the likelihood of vegetation growth or the presence of other food sources, such as decomposing organic material or small organisms that insects may feed on. 2. Lack of Habitat: Roofs are generally designed to provide protection from the elements for buildings and structures. Consequently, they do not offer ideal habitats for insects, which typically seek out shelter and protection in locations with more vegetation, ground cover, or natural crevices. Roofs tend to be more open and exposed, making them an undesirable option for insect colonies or nesting grounds. 3. Exposure to Weather Conditions: Roofs bear the full brunt of the elements, including sunlight, wind, rain, and snow, which can all be harmful to insects. The constant exposure to these weather conditions can create inhospitable environments for insects that prefer more stable and temperate surroundings. Roofs generally lack the temperature-regulating insulation that soil, plant cover, or other natural elements provide for insects. 4. Limited Accessibility: Many insects crawl or fly close to the ground, making it difficult for them to access roofs of buildings. Their limited ability to reach elevated surfaces deters them from establishing themselves in such locations. Also, roofs that are well-maintained and free from overhanging branches or other points of access can become even more challenging for insects to reach. 5. Predators: Roofs can make some insects more vulnerable to their natural predators like birds or larger insects who can access the elevation of the roof. Insects tend to avoid locations where they are exposed and more likely to be targeted by predators. In contrast, the other possible answer options (field, meadow, garden, and garbage can) all have ample supplies of food, shelter, and moisture that can support the needs of various insect species. As a result, finding bugs in these more hospitable locations is significantly more likely."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Did you know that although peanuts look like nuts and taste like nuts, they aren't nuts at all? They belong to the pea family, so they are called peanuts. The peanut grows flowers above ground, but its \\"fruit\\" grows underground. It grows in more countries than most other \\"nuts\\". The peanut is a native South American plant. Scientists believe that it grew wild in Brazil long ago. They think that for several thousand years the early peoples of South America made it a part of their diet. These peoples were nomads who moved on when a natural food could no longer be found in one area. Along the way they probably let fall some peanuts, which got into the ground and grew. This is believed to be the way the plant reached the place where the Incas lived. The Incas, from about 1100 to 1532, thought highly of peanuts. The peanuts were eaten in several forms and used as sacrificial offerings to the Incan Sun God. Later in the 16thcentury, European soldiers had brought peanuts to other parts of the world, including North America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Pacific Islands. Although peanuts were found native in South America, they are now grown in almost every country that has warm weather. India produces the most peanuts. China's production is next, followed by the United States. The peanut is special in more ways than one. It can be eaten raw, boiled, roasted, or fried. Hundreds of widely different products have been made from it. Carver, an American scientist, set himself the task of discovering new uses for eating and for many other products. Peanuts are very highly _ and are also high in protein  . Americans use about seven-tenths of their protein in the form of meat. In India, where the poor can't pay for meat or milk, peanut meal and peanut milk have been produced. These have been a great help to the poor. New products are continually being made from peanuts, among them peanut cheese and a powder that becomes peanut butter when water is added. The fact is that peanuts are so healthy...

Background: James Buchanan Jr. was born in a log cabin in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania (now Buchanan's Birthplace State Park), in Franklin County, on April 23, 1791, to James Buchanan, Sr. (1761-1821), a businessman, merchant, and farmer, and Elizabeth Speer, an educated woman (1767-1833). His parents were both of Ulster Scottish descent, the father having emigrated from Milford, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1783. One of eleven siblings, Buchanan was the oldest child in the family to survive infancy. Context: The Civil War erupted within two months of Buchanan's retirement. He supported the United States, writing to former colleagues that \\"the assault upon Sumter was the commencement of war by the Confederate states, and no alternative was left but to prosecute it with vigor on our part\\". He also wrote a letter to his fellow Pennsylvania Democrats, urging them to \\"join the many thousands of brave & patriotic volunteers who are already in the field\\".  Buchanan spent most of his remaining years defending himself from public blame for the Civil War, which was even referred to by some as \\"Buchanan's War\\". He began receiving angry and threatening letters daily, and stores displayed Buchanan's likeness with the eyes inked red, a noose drawn around his neck and the word \\"TRAITOR\\" written across his forehead. The Senate proposed a resolution of condemnation which ultimately failed, and newspapers accused him of colluding with the Confederacy. His former cabinet members, five of whom had been given jobs in the Lincoln administration, refused to defend Buchanan publicly.  Initially so disturbed by the attacks that he fell ill and depressed, Buchanan finally began defending himself in October 1862, in an exchange of letters between himself and Winfield Scott that was published in the National Intelligencer newspaper. He soon began writing his fullest public defense, in the form of his memoir Mr. Buchanan's Administration on the Eve of Rebellion, which was published in 1866.  Buchanan caught a cold in May 1868, which quickly worsened due to his advanced age. He died on June 1, 1868, from respiratory failure at the age of 77 at his home at Wheatland and was interred in Woodward Hill Cemetery in Lancaster. Question: What happened in his final years?.

Are the following two questions the same? What has better compression, ZIP or RAR? How do I extract or unzip or unrar a password protected zip or rar file?","output":"No, little buddy, those are two different questions. Let me explain them to you: 1. What has better compression, ZIP or RAR? This question is asking which one, ZIP or RAR, can make files smaller when we squish them together. Imagine you have a big fluffy teddy bear and you want to put it in a small box. Compression is like finding the best way to squish the teddy bear into that box. ZIP and RAR are like different ways of squishing the teddy bear. Some teddy bears might fit better using the ZIP way, while others might fit better using the RAR way. Usually, RAR can squish things a bit more than ZIP. 2. How do I extract or unzip or unrar a password protected zip or rar file? This question is about opening up a squished package that is locked with a secret code. Imagine that teddy bear you squished into the box earlier, but now, the box has a lock on it. We need a special key (password) to open it. So, this question is asking how to use that key to open the locked box and take the teddy bear out without squishing it. To do this, you would need a special tool (a software) on your computer to open those locked ZIP or RAR files, and of course, the secret key (password) to unlock it. I hope that helps you understand the difference between these two questions, my little friend!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Background: Meader was born in Waterville, Maine during one of the worst floods ever to hit New England: he often said he was born on \\"the night the West Bridge washed out\\". He was the only child of Charles Vaughn Meader, a millworker, and Mary Ellen Abbott. After his father broke his neck and drowned in a diving accident when Meader was only eighteen months old, his mother moved to Boston to work as a cocktail waitress, leaving Meader behind with relatives. A sometimes unruly and troubled child, Meader was sent to live with his mother in Boston at the age of five Context: On October 22, 1962, Meader joined writers Bob Booker and Earle Doud and a small cast of entertainers to record The First Family. The album poked fun at Kennedy's PT-109 history; the rocking chairs he used for his back pain; the Kennedy family's well-known athleticism, football games and family togetherness; children in the White House; and Jackie Kennedy's soft-spoken nature and her redecoration of the White House. The First Family became the fastest-selling record in the history of the United States. It sold 1.2 million copies during the first two weeks of its release, and ultimately sold 7.5 million copies.  Kennedy himself was said to have given copies of the album as Christmas gifts, and once greeted a Democratic National Committee group by saying, \\"Vaughn Meader was busy tonight, so I came myself.\\" At one press conference, Kennedy was asked if the album had produced \\"annoyment  [sic] or enjoyment.\\" He jokingly responded, \\"I listened to Mr. Meader's record and, frankly, I thought it sounded more like Teddy than it did me. So, now he's annoyed.\\" Kennedy told Benjamin Bradlee that \\"parts of it were amusing.\\" Other sources, such as Thomas C. Reeves' A Question of Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy, state that President Kennedy was upset with the parodies, and that First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was furious, even demanding that the President keep Meader off radio and television.  Still in his 20s, Meader was suddenly famous, rich, and in constant demand. He was profiled in Time and Life magazines, appeared on network television variety shows such as The Ed Sullivan Show, The Jack Paar Program, The Andy Williams Show and Hootenanny. Though a series of tour dates in early 1963 were notably unsuccessful (Billboard reported that he \\"bombed\\" in Pittsburgh, and only 742 people showed up in Philadelphia), he still played to packed houses in Las Vegas. The First Family won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1963. That March, Meader recorded a follow-up album, The First Family Volume Two, a combination of spoken comedy and songs performed by actors and comedians portraying members of the President's family and White House staff. The sequel was released in the spring of 1963, and while not as successful as the first volume, still sold hundreds of thousands of copies.  In July 1963, Meader left Cadence Records and Booker/Dowd to sign with MGM Records. Meader planned to record general satire and abandon his JFK impersonations. Question: How long did the show last? Answer:","output":"There is no specific mention of a show in the provided context. The context talks about various appearances Vaughn Meader made on television variety shows and the success of his comedy albums \\"The First Family\\" and \\"The First Family Volume Two.\\" However, it does not provide information about the duration of a particular show."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She has no time for toys, and refuses to be treated as a child. During a blizzard on Christmas Eve, Lisa is transported to Toyland. She arrives just before Mary Contrary (Jill Schoelen) is to be wedded to the unpleasant Barnaby Barnacle (Richard Mulligan), although Mary loves Barnaby's nephew, Jack Nimble (Keanu Reeves). Lisa stops the wedding and, with her new friends, finds out that Barnaby plans to take over Toyland. Lisa, Mary, Jack, and Georgie Porgie (Googy Gress) go to the kindly Toymaster (Pat Morita) for help, but he can only help them if Lisa really believes in toys. Barnaby confronts them and the Toymaster, finally showing his true colors, and steals a flask containing distilled evil that the Toymaster had been collecting, before leaving Lisa and company to be eaten by Trollog, a vulture-like monster with a single enchanted eye that Barnaby uses to spy on his enemies. They escape by blinding Trollog with paint and locking him in a chest, but are captured and imprisoned one by one in Barnaby's hidden fortress. Barnaby reveals that he had been creating an army of trolls to take over Toyland, and then attempts to corrupt his captives into being his servants with the contents of the flask, stating he would replace Trollog with Lisa and make Mary his Troll Princess. Lisa, however, proves to be immune to the evil, and manages to reverse the effects on her friends. After escaping from Barnaby's stronghold, they return to the Toymaster. When Barnaby unleashes his army of trolls upon Toyland, Lisa's newfound belief animates an army of life-sized toy soldiers that the Toymaster had created, and they drive Barnaby into the Forest of the Night.

's muy loco , but no more ridiculous","output":"To determine whether the phrase is positive or negative, let's analyze it step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the key words in the phrase. Key words in this phrase are \\"muy loco\\" (very crazy) and \\"no more ridiculous.\\" Step 2: Understand the meanings of each key word and their connotations. \\"Muy loco\\" has a negative connotation as it refers to something being very crazy, which often indicates an unfavorable or out of control situation. However, depending on the context, it can also have a positive or humorous connotation if referring to something fun and wild. \\"No more ridiculous\\" implies that something is not any more absurd than something else. This part of the phrase has a neutral connotation as it is making a comparison and does not explicitly label something as good or bad. Step 3: Evaluate the overall tone of the phrase. Considering both parts of the phrase, the overall tone appears to be neutral leaning towards slightly negative. The use of \\"muy loco\\" suggests a potentially negative view of a situation. However, the addition of \\"no more ridiculous\\" softens the negativity as it implies that the situation is not entirely absurd. In conclusion, this phrase can be seen as neutral to slightly negative, but the context in which it is used may impact the interpretation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Understand the premise. The premise specifies that \\"The hands that had grabbed me belonged to a little man.\\" Step 2: Define the major components within the premise. These are \\"hands\\", \\"grabbed\\", and \\"little man.\\" Step 3: Understand the hypothesis. The hypothesis states \\"The giant man touched me.\\" Step 4: Define the major components within the hypothesis. These are \\"giant man\\" and \\"touched\\". Step 5: Compare the premise and the hypothesis.  It can be seen that the premise talks about \\"a little man\\" whereas the hypothesis mentions \\"a giant man.\\" Considering these phrases likely refer to the size or stature of the man, these two descriptions are opposites. Step 6: Determine if the change in the description is significant.  In this case, the difference between \\"little\\" and \\"giant\\" is significant - they are complete opposites.  So, based on these steps, the hypothesis \\"The giant man touched me\\" is false based on the given premise \\"The hands that had grabbed me belonged to a little man.\\" The misalignment between the size of the man in the premise and hypothesis warrants this conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Ravens entered the game concerned that they would have trouble, having lost 3 matches in the year to teams with losing records on the road. This increased their determination. On their first possession, they came within field goal range on 4th and 1, and decided to attempt to convert, which failed. But on their next possession, Ray Rice scored a touchdown for a 7-0 lead. Billy Cundiff missed two moderate field goals in the first half, but toward the end, made one that increased the lead to 10-0. The Browns forced a fumble in the third quarter and capitalized on it with a field goal, cutting this lead to 10-3. But on the ensuing drive, Ray Rice, who rushed for over 200 yards in the entire game, had a 67-yard gain which led to a touchdown, increasing the lead to 17-3. They would later add to that cushion when Lardarius Webb returned a punt 68 yards for a touchdown. The Browns made one more touchdown, making what would be the final score of 24-10. But when the Ravens got their final possession, following the 2-minute warning, they were able to run out the clock as they won their 7th-straight game over the Browns and improved to 9-3. Answer this question based on the article: How many field goals were attempted in the first half?","output":"Based on the article, there were three field goals attempted in the first half. This inference can be made from the information given that during the Ravens' first possession, they were within field goal range but decided to attempt to convert on 4th and 1, which failed. This first attempt is assumed to be a field goal attempt since they were within range. Then, the text further describes that Billy Cundiff missed two moderate field goals in the first half. So, when these two missed attempts by Cundiff are added to the initial failed attempt by the team in their first possession, it can be concluded that there were a total of three field goal attempts in the first half."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress.

Second question: Is it safe for a white American to go to South Africa? Are these two questions asking the same thing? OPT:  - no.  - yes.","output":"In order to provide a comprehensive answer, I will address each question individually, though they share similarities. First question: How safe is South Africa and, in particular, Johannesburg? South Africa is a diverse country with a rich culture and stunning landscapes. However, the general safety situation can be challenging, particularly in urban areas. In terms of crime rates, South Africa ranks fairly high, with Johannesburg being one of its largest cities and an area where safety concerns are most relevant. While crime can be an issue in South Africa, it is important to understand that the extent of crime varies depending on the location and circumstances. Tourist attractions, well-traveled areas, and affluent neighborhoods tend to be safer in comparison to other regions. Nonetheless, crime can still happen in these areas, so it is essential always to remain cautious and vigilant. Johannesburg, specifically, is a bustling city that offers a mix of pleasant experiences and potential risks. As mentioned before, certain neighborhoods and areas are considered to be safer than others. For instance, areas like Sandton, Rosebank, and Melrose Arch are more secure due to the concentration of business centers, shopping malls, and tourist attractions. On the other hand, downtown Johannesburg, Soweto, and Alexandra township are areas where crime rates tend to be higher, and visitors are advised to exercise considerable caution or avoid these areas altogether. Second question: Is it safe for a white American to go to South Africa? Yes, it can be safe for a white American to visit South Africa, provided they take standard precautions to ensure their safety, regardless of the color of their skin. South Africa is a multicultural, diverse country, and generally, visitors of all ethnicities are welcome. However, the safety tips shared here apply to everyone, regardless of their background. Some general safety tips for travelers visiting South Africa include: 1. Do thorough research on the areas you intend to visit, and prioritize regions with lower crime rates. 2. Stay in reputable hotels or lodgings with good security measures in place. 3. Keep your belongings secure, avoid displaying large amounts of cash or expensive items, as these can make you a target for thieves. 4. Be cautious when walking alone, especially in unfamiliar areas or at night. 5. Use reputable transportation options, like registered taxis or ride-hailing services like Uber. 6. Avoid drawing unnecessary attention to yourself by wearing flashy clothes or jewelry. 7. Keep your travel plans and itinerary private, and do not share too much information with strangers. Are these two questions asking the same thing? While both questions are related to safety in South Africa, they are not asking the same thing. The first question addresses the general safety situation in the country, with a focus on Johannesburg, while the second question specifically asks about the safety of a white American visiting South Africa. Both answers emphasize the importance of personal discretion and taking the necessary precautions to ensure a safe and memorable trip to South Africa."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: \\"St. Thomas Seminary\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to a rectangle that's 12-inches (30 cm) wide by 7 to 8-inches long (17.5 to 20 cm). Keep the wide side of the rectangle towards you so you can easily roll it into a log later. Take the prepared filling of your choice and place a quarter of it onto the dough circle. Use an offset spatula or the back of a large spoon to spread the filling evenly across the dough. Leave 1/4-inch (6 mm) edge bare on the side that's closest to you. This will help seal the dough together when you roll it up. You'll need about 2 to 4 tablespoons of filling for each log. Hold the edge of the rugelach that's closest to you. It should be the long, bare edge. Use your fingertips to gently roll the dough over the filling. Continue tightly rolling the dough to make a log. Pinch the ends together to form tight seals. Set the log on a baking sheet in the freezer and chill it for 10 to 15 minutes.  Chilling the log will make it easier to cut. Roll out and fill the remaining logs of dough once you've finished the initial portion of dough. Consider filling each log with a different flavor of filling. Remove the logs from the freezer and cut away the ends of each log so they're neat. Use a sharp knife to cut each log into 10 to 12 pieces, depending on how thick you want them. Place the rugelach slices cut-side down on the prepared baking sheets. Ensure that there are a few inches (5 cm) of space between the rugelach. Bake the rugelach for 20 to 25 minutes. They should turn golden brown. Giving the rugelach space will prevent them from baking into one another.","output":"This article provides step-by-step instructions on preparing and baking rugelach, with emphasis on rolling out the dough, applying fillings, rolling the dough into logs, cutting the logs into slices, and baking them to golden brown perfection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Using affection as a reward can be an effective way to let your child know you approve of their behavior. You may give your child a high five, a pat on the back, arm or shoulder, or a big smile. Choices: a. Similarly, you can give a treat or a toy that your child likes like a prize. You can also give your child a lip lock or a ribbon to make things easier on them or a little piece of candy.. b. A simple, \\" good job! You just convinced mom to let you go to the park \\" will work just fine. Unfortunately, there is no simple limit to their behavior at all-nothing works out the same way.. c. You can also display other forms of affection, like hugs or kisses. The benefit of using affection as a reward is that it is free and immediate, so you can use it as a reward as soon as your child does something good.. d. You may also give your child a toy they can play with while exercising. For example, you may give your child a peanut or a treat every time they perform a task well done..","output":"c.

The benefit of using affection as a reward is that it is free and immediate, so you can use it as a reward as soon as your child does something good. Explanation: a. This choice is incorrect because it talks about giving toys or treats as a reward, which is not related to showing affection as a reward mentioned in the paragraph. Giving things like a lip lock, a ribbon, or candy is not showing affection. b. This choice is also incorrect because it is negative and confusing. It does not provide a clear ending to the paragraph about rewarding with affection. It may confuse a five-year-old. d.

Now for the first time Payne wrote to a magazine from the prison about what happened on the night of 13 October 1999. I had to stay late at the hospital that night to do an operation. I finally left at about 11p.m.. I drove home slowly because the wind was blowing and it was raining heavily. I was running into our road when a man suddenly ran in front of my car. I almost hit him but I stopped just in time. I was scared and the man looked scared, too. I got out of the car but he ran away before I could ask if he was all right. It was very strange. When I got home, the lights were on but it was very quiet. I called to my wife but there was no answer. Then I remembered that she was out at a concert. I was still very unhappy about what happened on the road, so I made myself a drink. Then I went upstairs to have a bath. I saw that the window in the bedroom was open. This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out. She was afraid of burglars. When I went to close it, I found Ellen. She was lying on the floor. There was blood everywhere. I rushed over for her pulse but she was dead. I was so scared. I sat on the floor beside her body without knowing what to do. The next thing I knew was that the sky was getting light. I can't remember a thing about that night. In the morning I phoned the police. They arrived half an hour after I phoned them. But it seemed like hours. During that time I tried hard to remember anything I could about the night before. I couldn't stop thinking about the man in the road. What was he doing at that time of night in our quiet neighborhood? In this passage Payne tried to  _  .

Donna Foster works for publisher John Caine. She agrees to have his niece, Christabel, live with her in San Francisco while attending business school. Christabel proves to be a scheming, socially ambitious woman. She flirts with Donna's fiance, the wealthy Curtis Carey, at a party for Donna's friend, painter Gabriel Broome. She also attracts the interest of aspiring author Nick Bradley. While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money. Christabel then turns around and cunningly does the same to Curtis by convincing him to propose a pre-nuptial agreement. Donna is offended and the couple break up, which turns out to have been Christabel's plan all along. With Curtis now available, Christabel rebuffs a marriage proposal from Nick, whose novel is about to be published by Caine. A romance develops that leads to Christabel marrying Curtis and becoming a high society lady. However, it turns out that she is still attracted to Nick, whom she begins seeing on the side.

The Wiggles are an Australian children's music group formed in Sydney, New South Wales, in 1991. The current members of the group are Anthony Field, Lachlan Gillespie, Simon Pryce, and Emma Watkins. The original members were Field, Phillip Wilcher, Murray Cook, Greg Page, and Jeff Fatt. Wilcher left the group after their first album. In mid-2012, The Wiggles announced that Page, Fatt, and Cook would be retiring from touring with the group; Emma Watkins, the first female member of The Wiggles, replaced Page, Lachlan Gillespie replaced Fatt, and Simon Pryce replaced Cook. Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children. According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\". Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter. Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce. The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.  The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people. Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce wore \\"In Training\\" T-shirts, and debuted the song \\"Do the Propeller!\\" during these concerts. The final televised performance of the original band members, along with the new members, was on 22 December 2012, during the annual Carols in the Domain in Sydney. Their final performance, after over 7000 shows over the years, was on 23 December at the Sydney Entertainment Centre.  Also by 2012, The Wiggles performed to audiences whose parents attended their shows in their early years, and they were hiring performers who were part of their audience as young children. The Wiggles began airing a show on Sirius XM satellite radio in late 2012, featuring the original members and their replacements, and stories and games for young listeners. In December, the group auctioned their famous \\"Big Red Car\\" (called the \\"iconic Volkswagen Beetle Cabriolet\\") for charity for almost A36,000 on the auction site eBay.

Summarize this article: Alexander Lukashenko said those who worked fewer than 183 days per year would not be liable in 2017 - but stressed the tax would not be scrapped. The decree - adopted in 2015 - requires those people to pay about 250 (Â£205) as compensation for lost tax revenues. It triggered mass protests last month, and more rallies are planned for March. Mr Lukashenko announced the decision to freeze the tax collection at a government meeting in the capital Minsk on Thursday. \\"The decree must be adjusted during March. The decree will not be abolished,\\" he was quoted as saying by Belarus's Belta news agency. The president also said that those who had already paid the tax in 2016 would be fully compensated if they found a job next year. According to the last tax inspection, 470,000 people should have paid the tax but only 50,000 had done so, Reuters news agency reports. At the same time, the president warned that the authorities must show \\"tough reaction\\" to organisers of any future street protests against the decree. Mr Lukashenko has run Belarus - a country where little dissent is tolerated - since 1994. He has been described by some Western officials as \\"Europe's last dictator\\". However, Mr Lukashenko has recently been seeking to improve ties with the West and lessen the country's dependence on Russia. Summary:","output":"Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, announced that those who worked fewer than 183 days in the year would not be liable to pay tax in 2017. The decree was introduced in 2015 and meant those working less than half the year had to pay approximately 250 as compensation for lost tax revenues, which led to mass protests. Despite suspending the tax for 2017, Lukashenko affirmed that it will not be scrapped entirely and needs to be adjusted during March. Of the 470,000 people who should have paid the tax, only 50,000 did, suggesting widespread opposition to the measure. Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994 and is often labelled as “Europe’s last dictator,” warned authorities must show a \\"tough reaction\\" to future protests against the decree. He also declared that people who already paid the tax in 2016 would be fully compensated if they found a job in 2017.

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

Answer:","output":"Title: Unimpressive and Not Up to Expectations Review: I recently decided to try out the com.google.android.gms app, given its connection to Google, and to be quite honest, I am underwhelmed with my experience. Although the app does offer some useful functionalities, it does not seem to bring anything groundbreaking to the table. Given the reputation of Google, I had higher expectations.  First of all, the app can be quite unresponsive at times. There are moments when it lags or crashes entirely, which is very frustrating, especially when it comes to time-sensitive tasks. I've had to either reboot the app or my phone to get it to function properly on several occasions. Secondly, the app's interface is not as user-friendly as I hoped it would be. Navigating through the different menus and options can be quite a chore, and it's not as intuitive as I would expect from a Google app. It took me significantly longer to accomplish certain tasks, which should've been straightforward. Lastly, customer support has been less than helpful. During the few times I reached out for help, I found that their responses were too generic or they took too long to reply. It's quite disappointing, considering Google's reputation for reliable customer service. In conclusion, it's tough for me to wholeheartedly recommend com.google.android.gms to anyone right now due to its unresponsiveness, confusing interface, and poor customer support. Based on these factors, I'm giving it a 2-star rating. Perhaps with some improvements and updates in the future, the app could reach its full potential and offer the quality experience users should expect from a Google product."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choose the next sentence.By Associated Press An auction ended Friday with no bids for the New Hampshire compound of a tax-evading couple convicted of amassing an arsenal of weapons and holding federal law enforcement officials at bay for months. The auction of Ed and Elaine Brown's fortress-like home on 100 acres in Plainfield was held at U.S. District Court in Concord. The minimum required bid was 250,000. Elaine Brown's dental office in Lebanon also was being auctioned but got no bids Prospective bidders have not been allowed to tour the property, and last year, the U.S. Marshals Service cited the possibility of land mines and other explosives buried on the property as a complication. The court has ruled that the OPTIONS: - Associated Press and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale. - Browns and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale. - Concord and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale. - Ed and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale. - Elaine Brown and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale. - Elaine of Brown and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale. - Lebanon and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale. - New Hampshire and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale. - Plainfield and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale. - U.S. District Court and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale. - US Marshals and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale.","output":"- Browns and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale. The correct answer is that the Browns and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale. This is because Ed and Elaine Brown were convicted of tax evasion and are no longer entitled to their properties. Wrong options: - Associated Press: This option is incorrect because the Associated Press is a news organization and is not related to the property dispute. - Concord, Lebanon, New Hampshire, Plainfield: These options are incorrect because they are names of places and have no relevance to the claims on the properties. - Ed and any heirs, Elaine Brown and any heirs, Elaine of Brown and any heirs: These options are incorrect because they only refer to one member of the couple rather than both Ed and Elaine Brown. - U.S. District Court, US Marshals: These options are incorrect because they refer to governmental authorities and organizations that are involved in the legal process, but they would not have claims on the properties or assets themselves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Every night, Albert would gather with his friends at the community center to play a variety of card games. His favorites were Bridge and Rummy, but he excelled at Poker. Over the years, he earned the reputation of being the best poker player in town. One day, a stranger arrived in the town. He was a tall man dressed in a fine suit, with a mysterious aura surrounding him, and he introduced himself as Mr. Black. He claimed to be a traveling businessman, looking for a friendly card game to pass the time. In particular, he was a master of poker, and he challenged anyone in the town to a match. Albert, never one to back down from a challenge, accepted Mr. Black's invitation. He could feel his heart racing as the stakes grew higher in each round. The two poker players studied each other carefully, attempting to anticipate their opponent's moves. As the hours passed, the game seemed to become more about their battle of wits and not just about the cards. It was at this pivotal moment that Albert noticed a slight tell in his opponent's behavior. Whenever Mr. Black had a strong hand, he would briefly touch his cufflink. Albert took advantage of this insight to gradually gain the upper hand in the game. To everyone's surprise, Mr. Black graciously accepted defeat and congratulated Albert on his victory. Then, as suddenly as he had arrived, the enigmatic stranger left the town. Albert's friends showered him with praise, and word of his accomplishment spread far and wide. Several weeks later, Albert received an unexpected parcel in the mail. In it was a beautifully crafted deck of cards and a handwritten note. \\"Dear Albert,\\" the note began, \\"I trust you'll put this deck to good use. I enjoyed our recent game, and I hope we might encounter each other again soon. Until then, may your cards forever remain in your favor.\\" Moved by the token of appreciation, Albert guarded this unique deck of cards with great care and only brought it out for the most special of occasions.

Green's Arcadia Group has over 2,500 outlets in the UK, including affordable fashion chain, Topshop, and employs over 44,000 staff.

Question: President Donald Trump suffered a political setback Tuesday when Democrats won easy victories in governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey. In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\\" he said. Political analysts said Democratic enthusiasm and a focus on Trump were clearly on display in both states. \\"We have heard for months and months about all this energy on the left.

Conditions on Io are difficult: gravity is 1/6 that of Earth's with no breathable atmosphere, spacesuits are cumbersome, and miners carry their own air supply. Shifts are long, but significant bonuses are paid. The outpost's general manager, Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), boasts that productivity has broken all previous records since he took over. O'Niel's wife Carol (Kika Markham) feels she cannot raise their son Paul on Io, fleeing with the child to the Jupiter space station to await a shuttle back to Earth. Later, a miner named Tarlow (John Ratzenberger) suffers an attack of stimulant psychosis: he sees spiders and rips open his spacesuit, resulting in his death by explosive decompression. Cane, another miner, enters an elevator without his spacesuit during another psychotic episode, and likewise dies from decompression. With the reluctant assistance of Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel investigates the deaths. Another incident involves a worker, Sagan, who takes a prostitute hostage and threatens to kill her with a knife. O'Niel attempts to calm the man while Montone (James B.

This involved evacuating people from the buildings and the surrounding area, providing medical help and emotional support, and setting up makeshift shelters for survivors. Moreover, the shared sense of grief, fear, and anger served as a powerful unifying force, transcending social barriers and fostering connections among individuals. Many stories emerged from the rubble, highlighting acts of altruism, heroism, and solidarity among people who were present during the attacks or who played a part in the subsequent rescue and recovery efforts. It was this collective response to adversity that created an environment where \\"no one was a stranger that day.\\" People began to see themselves as part of a larger community, working together to overcome the trials and tribulations brought about by the 9/11 attacks.

They might also set specific weight-loss goals for themselves, such as losing a certain amount of weight by a particular date or being able to fit into a particular outfit. 3. Support: To stay motivated in their journey, the protagonist might seek out support from friends, family, or even online communities dedicated to weight loss and healthy living.

Progress and Results: Over time, the protagonist may start to see significant changes in their appearance, mood, and overall health. These improvements can serve as powerful motivators to continue on their journey, even when faced with setbacks. As they begin to reach their weight-loss goals, they may develop a newfound sense of self-confidence and pride, ultimately realizing that they have the strength to make positive changes in their life. 6. Maintenance: After achieving their desired weight, the protagonist will need to shift their focus to maintaining their new healthy lifestyle. This may mean continuing to educate themselves on proper nutrition and exercise, staying vigilant about emotional triggers that could lead to weight gain, and finding long-term strategies for stress management and self-care. While the specific sequence of events that follow may differ based on the individual, these potential scenarios illustrate the various stages and challenges they might experience as they embark on their weight-loss journey. Each step along the way will likely involve a process of self-discovery, growth, and personal development, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being and quality of life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Domesticated birds raised for meat and eggs, called poultry, are the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans; in 2003, 76 million tons of poultry and 61 million tons of eggs were produced worldwide. Chickens account for much of human poultry consumption, though domesticated turkeys, ducks, and geese are also relatively common. Many species of birds are also hunted for meat. Bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas. The most important birds hunted in North and South America are waterfowl; other widely hunted birds include pheasants, wild turkeys, quail, doves, partridge, grouse, snipe, and woodcock. Muttonbirding is also popular in Australia and New Zealand. Though some hunting, such as that of muttonbirds, may be sustainable, hunting has led to the extinction or endangerment of dozens of species. Now answer this question: What is the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans?","output":"The largest source of animal protein eaten by humans is from birds that we raise for their meat and eggs, which we call poultry.

I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening. So much for my attempt at appearing “classy” and “sophisticated”…. Question: Who was frozen in place?

What is the answer?","output":"The Spaniard who led the expedition that reached Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, in 1519 was Hernán Cortés. Born in 1485 in Medellín, Spain, Cortés was a Spanish conquistador and explorer who played a significant role in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. He entered the world of exploration at a young age and was deeply influenced by the stories of Christopher Columbus and other explorers. In 1504, Cortés embarked on his first voyage to the New World, settling in Hispaniola, which is now the Dominican Republic and Haiti. After spending several years there, he relocated to Cuba in 1511 and took part in the conquest of the island under the leadership of Diego Velázquez. Impressed by his capabilities, Velázquez, who later became the governor of Cuba, appointed Cortés as a clerk to the treasurer and eventually promoted him to the position of a local magistrate. In 1518, Velázquez chose Cortés to lead the expedition to explore and conquer Mexico, a land rich in gold and other valuable resources. However, following a disagreement between the two, Velázquez decided to replace him with another conquistador. Unwilling to give up his opportunity for exploration and conquest, Cortés ignored the orders and set sail for Mexico in 1519 with about 500 men, 11 ships, and a few horses and cannons. Upon arriving in modern-day Mexico, Cortés and his men began interacting with the local tribes and established alliances with some of them, such as the Totonacs and Tlaxcalans – both of whom were enemies of the Aztecs. As he advanced through the territory, Cortés learned about the Aztec Empire and its ruler, Moctezuma II. He also heard about the vast riches of the empire, which further fueled his ambitions. Upon reaching the city of Cholula, events turned violent as Cortés and his men massacred thousands of inhabitants under the pretext of an alleged conspiracy. This display of brutality shocked the other indigenous tribes and further solidified alliances between the Spanish and other local groups against the Aztecs. In November 1519, Hernán Cortés and his men, along with thousands of indigenous allies, finally reached Tenochtitlan. Moctezuma II reluctantly welcomed the Spanish into the city, hoping to learn more about them and their intentions. However, tensions grew, and after a series of events, including a massacre committed by Cortés' men and the arrest of Moctezuma, the Aztec people retaliated, and the Spanish were forced to retreat in 1520 in a battle known as La Noche Triste (The Sad Night). Cortés, undeterred, regrouped his forces and laid siege to Tenochtitlan in May 1521, with the help of his indigenous allies. After a three-month-long battle, the Spanish and their allies conquered Tenochtitlan on August 13, 1521, marking the end of the Aztec Empire and the beginning of Spanish rule in Mexico."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Alfred Cellier (1 December 1844 - 28 December 1891) was an English composer, orchestrator and conductor. In addition to conducting and music directing the original productions of several of the most famous Gilbert and Sullivan works and writing the overtures to some of them, Cellier conducted at many theatres in London, New York and on tour in Britain, America and Australia. He composed over a dozen operas and other works for the theatre, as well as for orchestra, but his 1886 comic opera, Dorothy, was by far his most successful work. It became the longest-running piece of musical theatre in the nineteenth century. Context: In 1885, Cellier composed a song, \\"There once was a time, my darling\\", for a piece produced by George Edwardes, Little Jack Sheppard (1885). Meanwhile he had composed what would become his greatest success, the comic opera Dorothy, with a libretto by B. C. Stephenson. To create the score, Cellier repurposed some of his music from his 1876 failure, Nell Gwynne, which had, nevertheless, received praise for its music. Dorothy had been announced for production at the Royalty Theatre in 1884, but ultimately Edwardes mounted it at his Gaiety Theatre on 25 September 1886. Cellier was in Australia from February 1886 to February 1887, conducting The Mikado and other Gilbert and Sullivan operas for the J. C. Williamson organization and was absent from London during the productions of The Carp, at the Savoy, and Dorothy. Neither the music nor the libretto of Dorothy initially attracted critical praise. The Times wrote, \\"Gentility reigns supreme, and with it unfortunately also a good deal of the refined feebleness and the ineptitude which are the defects of that quality.\\" Stephenson rewrote the lyrics of one of Cellier's old songs, \\"Old Dreams\\" as \\"Queen of My Heart\\"; this helped the work to find success after it transferred in December to the Prince of Wales Theatre. The following year H. J. Leslie took over the production from Edwardes and introduced new stars, including Marie Tempest. Dorothy became an even greater success at the box office and transferred in December 1888 to the Lyric Theatre, built using the profits from the production, where it ran into 1889. Its initial run of a total of 931 performances was the longest of any piece of musical theatre up to that time, longer than even The Mikado, a fact that caused consternation to Cellier's friend Arthur Sullivan. Some critics reconsidered their earlier condemnation, the work became regarded as a classic Victorian piece, and the initially despised plot was traced seriously back to the Restoration playwrights David Garrick and Aphra Behn, and to Oliver Goldsmith and even Shakespeare. Its success led to revivals of some of Cellier's earlier works.  Cellier returned to Australia in 1888 to conduct Dorothy and made a final brief visit there for health reasons in early 1891, together with Stephenson. His last comic operas, Doris (1889, with Stephenson) and The Mountebanks (with Gilbert, produced in January 1892, a few days after the composer's death), were both modestly successful. Also after Cellier's death, Rutland Barrington used some of his music in his 1902 adaptation of Water Babies. Often in ill health throughout his life, Cellier was unable to finish The Mountebanks, and Ivan Caryll completed the score.  Cellier owed much to the influence of Sullivan. He was a fertile melodist, and his writing exhibited elegance and refinement, although he was not able to infuse his music with humour in the way that Sullivan did.  Cellier died at his home in Bloomsbury, London, at the age of 47. He was buried in West Norwood Cemetery. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in this article, including: 1. Alfred Cellier's extensive conducting experience, which included working on original productions of several famous Gilbert and Sullivan works, as well as conducting in various theaters in many different locations like London, New York, America, and Australia. 2. The fact that Cellier's most successful work, the comic opera \\"Dorothy,\\" became the longest-running piece of musical theatre in the nineteenth century, surpassing even \\"The Mikado\\" by Gilbert and Sullivan. 3. The transformation of \\"Dorothy\\" from an initially criticized piece to a classic Victorian piece, with some critics eventually tracing its plot back to famous playwrights such as David Garrick, Aphra Behn, Oliver Goldsmith, and William Shakespeare. 4. Cellier's recurring health issues, which ultimately prevented him from completing his last comic opera, \\"The Mountebanks,\\" requiring Ivan Caryll to step in and finish the score. 5. The influence of Arthur Sullivan on Cellier's work, both in terms of style and melody. Although Cellier's music showcased elegance and refinement, he was not quite as successful at incorporating humor as Sullivan was. These aspects highlight Cellier's career accomplishments, his successful works, and his strong connection with renowned artists during that era.

How unappealing are individuals who behave badly towards others? We show here that children and even infants, although motivated by material rewards, are nonetheless willing to incur costs to avoid “doing business” with a wrongdoer. When given the choice to accept a smaller offering from a do-gooder or a larger offering from a wrongdoer, children and infants chose to accept the smaller offering. It was only when the difference between the offerings was very large that their aversion to the wrongdoer was overcome by personal incentives. These findings show that a willingness to forgo self-interests when faced with wrongdoers is a fundamental aspect of human nature. ||||| Everyone has a price. The phrase dates back to ancient Rome, but a new Yale University study tried to find out if that extends to babies.      Arber Tasimi,a graduate student at Yale’s infant cognition lab, spends a lot of time around that one group of people who should be pure and innocent, if anyone is. He and his colleagues showed a group of 64 babies two puppet shows. One starred a nice puppet who helped the other puppets get toys from a box. The other starred a mean puppet who slammed the box lid closed.      “Even babies as young as 3 months show very strong preferences for the nice character,” Tasimi says. “But the question that I was interested in is, what are babies willing to sacrifice in order to interact with nice characters over mean characters?”      Both puppets offer the baby some crackers. But here’s the twist: he nice puppet’s offering you one cracker. The mean puppet is offering you more. Like two, or four, or eight -- they changed the number up each time. If you’re a baby, what do you do?      “Remarkably, when the mean puppet offers eight crackers and the nice puppet offers one cracker, two thirds of babies will sell out or deal with the devil as we like to call this study,” Tasimi says.      In the past, researchers showed babies preferred the nice puppet over the mean puppets if both offered the same number of crackers. But this is the first experiment to show that the more we’re getting out of the deal, the more we’re willing to, well, \\"forgive\\" the misdeeds of the giver.      We see people presented with this dilemma all the time. Tasimi gives an example from the HBO show The Sopranos, where mobster Tony Soprano’s wife Carmela loves the expensive gifts he gives her, while ignoring some of the bad things he does to be able to afford them.      \\"A common theme in this series is this conflict, this angst that she’s experiencing. Because really, on one hand, she wants to do good,\\" Tasimi says. \\"She wants to punish Tony for the bad things that he does. But on the other hand, she also wants to do well.\\"      Carmela Soprano is a fictional character, but Tasimi says this comes up in our real lives, too.      \\"We’re often put in situations where we’re sort of conflicted,\\" he says. \\"Because on the one hand, we care about our self-interest, oftentimes in the context of material goods. We want more. But on the other hand, we have these moral considerations.\\"      Tasimi and his colleagues did a similar experiment with children between the ages of five and eight, and found similar results: most of those children also held out before they’d take the offer from the \\"devil.\\"      He says there’s good news in these studies. Most of the babies needed a lot of crackers before they’d go with the mean puppet over the nice one, about eight times as many, and 16 in the case of the older kids. So maybe we are born with a price, but at least it’s a high price. ||||| Turns out everyone does have a price — even babies.      Babies as young as 12 months will take a smaller offering from a Good Samaritan than a larger one from a wrongdoer. However, children are much more willing to “do business” with the bad guy when their offer is substantially higher than the do-gooder’s, a new study published in the journal Cognition shows.      “It’s a study I like to call ‘the deal with the devil’” said Arber Tasimi, a graduate student in the Department of Psychology who led this study along with Yale psychologist Karen Wynn.      The experiment that Tasimi and Wynn designed was simple: When given the choice between a smaller and a larger offering, which do children and babies choose? Unsurprisingly, they almost always take the larger amount. But the researchers wanted to know if it matters who was doing the offering — a good guy or a bad guy.      In one experiment, 5- and 8-year-olds were introduced to two characters, one described as mean and the other described as nice. Children were then told that the mean kid was offering them more stickers (either 2, 4, 8, or 16) than the nice kid, who offered a single sticker. When the difference between the offerings was modest, most children were willing to reject the larger number of stickers and deal the nice kid. But, when the offer was upped to 16 stickers, most children were willing to “sell out’’ to the mean kid.      Even 12- and 13-month-olds seem to struggle with this moral dilemma. Tasimi and Wynn showed babies a puppet show involving a puppet attempting, but failing, to open a clear box with a toy inside. On alternating trials, one puppet helped open the box, whereas another slammed it shut. Afterwards, the mean puppet offered two crackers and the nice puppet offered just one cracker. Remarkably, said the researchers, over 80% of babies took the single cracker from the nice puppet. But when the mean puppet’s offer went up to eight crackers, babies showed a greater willingness to deal with a wrongdoer.      “When I tell people about these findings, they often joke that babies and kids are sellouts, but I think the message is less cynical,” Tasimi said. “Even early on, we’re willing to pay personal costs to avoid wrongdoers in favor of do-gooders.”      And, what about those participants who reject any amount from bad guys?      “I think an exciting avenue for future research involves an understanding of how individual differences, even during the first few months of life, influence our judgments of good and bad, right and wrong,” he said.

Donald Trump's presidential campaign has hired... (Associated Press)      Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort is surrounded by reporters on the floor of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Sunday, July 17, 2016. Donald Trump's presidential campaign has hired... (Associated Press)      CLEVELAND (AP) — Donald Trump once promised a \\"showbiz\\" convention, packed with flash, celebrities and a \\"winner's night\\" featuring sports stars and champion coaches.      Instead, the Republican National Convention kicking off Monday is shaping up to be a staid family-focused affair, with a lineup that features everyday Americans, successful business people and four of his five children.      \\"The plan for the Trump campaign for this convention is to help the American people understand more about Donald Trump the man, not just the candidate that they've seen on the campaign trail,\\" his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, told reporters gathered in Cleveland ahead of the convention's kick-off.      Instead of featuring \\"a bunch of Washington politicians,\\" Manafort said the goal was to focus on ordinary people impacted by the current president's policies, along with friends, employees and others who've worked with Trump over the years who can talk about his \\"business acumen and his personal life, his ability to solve problems. \\"      \\"I think the historic nature of the convention will be the impact that family members have in talking about the candidate because we feel that the personal story of Donald Trump is something that needs to be told and it'll be told from their eyes best,\\" he said.      The final speaking schedule, released Sunday evening by the Republican Party, does offer a heavy dose of Republican insiders. Former presidential candidates Ted Cruz, Chris Christie, Scott Walker and Marco Rubio (by video) are on the list, as are a handful of members of Congress. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan will also speak.      As for star power, the offerings are unexpectedly dim. There's Willie Robertson from \\"Duck Dynasty,\\" along with actor Scott Baio, star of \\"Charles In Charge,\\" ''Joanie Loves Chachi\\" and \\"Happy Days.\\" Soap operas get their nods in the form of actor and former Calvin Klein underwear model Antonio Sabato Jr. and Kimberlin Brown, a California avocado farmer best known for her roles on \\"The Bold and the Beautiful\\" and \\"The Young and the Restless.\\"      Trump's campaign has been notable for showcasing his business ventures, including hotels and golf clubs. That pattern will continue at the convention with the inclusion of speakers like Kerry Woolard, the general manager of Trump Winery in Virginia.      The program is designed to present Trump's agenda, while contrasting it with the approaches of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama.      Monday's program, for instance, will focus on security and the risks posed by illegal immigration, with speeches from Pat Smith, the mother of Sean Smith, who was killed in the attack in Benghazi, Libya. U.S. Marine veterans Mark Geist and John Tiegen, who fought that night,, are scheduled, too. Jamiel Shaw, whose son was killed by a man living in the U.S. illegally, will also speak.      Speaking Monday as well will be Trump's wife, Melania, a rare presence on the campaign trail, and his adult children, Ivanka, Don Jr., Eric and the lesser-known Tiffany. Trump's vice presidential pick, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, will speak Wednesday. Trump will deliver his speech accepting the nomination on Thursday.      Last spring, Trump repeatedly blasted the 2012 GOP convention as \\"the single most boring\\" he'd ever seen.      \\"The concept of some entertainment from a great singer, a great group I think would be something maybe to break things up,\\" Trump told The Associated Press in May. \\"You'll be hearing plenty of political speeches. And after a while, you'll say, 'Maybe I want to hear something else.'\\"      At his rallies, Trump often spoke of a \\"winners' evening\\" featuring \\"some of the great sports people I know.\\" He even said he'd be open to a return performance by the actor Clint Eastwood, whose monologue standing next to an empty chair at the 2012 convention was widely panned.      Manafort insisted that the convention would be just as unconventional as the one Trump has long envisioned.      \\"He said it would be a different kind of convention and it will be a different kind of convention,\\" Manafort said. ||||| Actor Scott Baio looks over the podium during a sound check before the evening session of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Monday, July 18, 2016. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) (Associated Press)      The \\"show biz\\" in Donald Trump's Republican National Convention fell considerably short of A-list Monday, kicking off the first of four nights with reality TV hunter Willie Robertson of \\"Duck Dynasty,\\" in a flag-motif head scarf, declaring Trump \\"will have your back.\\"      He was followed in rapid, prime-time succession by actor Scott Baio of \\"Happy Days\\" and \\"Charles in Charles.\\" Baio, who campaigned for Ronald Reagan in his youth, built on Trump's \\"Let's make America great\\" rallying cry with this: \\"Let's make America America again.\\"      Robertson, whose family has amassed millions through hunting ventures in Louisiana and on TV, played the regular-folk card on the Cleveland podium, chiding Trump detractors who \\"don't hang with regular folks like us.\\"      He said he and Trump have three things in common: They're successful businessmen, they have hit TV shows, and \\"we both have intelligent wives who are much better looking than we are.\\"      Trump's wife, Melania Trump, was opening night's keynote speaker.      Both Baio and the big-bearded Robertson, who sneaked into the 2008 GOP convention and described how on Twitter, kept their remarks short and on message.      \\"Donald Trump will always tell you the truth as he sees it,\\" Robertson said.      Baio, in a bright red tie, addressed first-time voters on what it means to be an American. Or rather, what it doesn't mean.      \\"It doesn't mean getting free stuff,\\" he said. \\"It means sacrificing, winning, losing, failing, succeeding, sometimes doing the things you don't want to do, including the hard work in order to get where you want to be.\\"      And Baio answered his own question when asking: \\"Is Donald Trump a messiah? No. He's just a man, a man who wants to give back to his country, America. A country that has given him everything.\\"      He whipped up some boos for Hillary Clinton in laying out the two parties' choices for president, before he called her a \\"woman who somehow feels she's entitled to the presidency.\\"      A third actor was also on deck — the hunky former Calvin Klein underwear model and \\"General Hospital\\" star Antonio Sabato Jr., who has guested as a Chippendale and also appeared on \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" and \\"Melrose Place.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"The Republican National Convention, taking place from July 18-21, is expected to be a \\"family-focused affair\\" instead of the promised \\"showbiz\\" convention; a contrast to the previously mentioned \\"winner's night\\" featuring various celebrities and sporting stars.

Alongside this, there are also many Republican insiders slated to speak at the event such as Ted Cruz, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, Chris Christie, Scott Walker and Marco Rubio (to appear via video).

Context: TL:DR: I un-professionally get mad at a customer and verbally slam the door on her way out. I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers. I get a lecture and a warning, the end.

Help as much as you can. Q:I can use this background: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:  Now, I have a new situation: Dan, a renowned pedologist, visited two farms near his home town.

Questions: Where can you see people enjoying antique transportation? Options: - synagogue - montana - carnival - supermarket - car show Answer:","output":"Based on the given options, the most suitable place where you can see people enjoying antique transportation would be at a car show.  The reason behind selecting a car show as the optimal choice relies on common sense and an understanding of each option. A car show is a public exhibition event where various types of vehicles, often including antique and classic transportation, are displayed. These events typically attract people with diverse interests, including those who are passionate about automobiles, collect antique vehicles, or simply enjoy a unique and entertaining experience. At a car show, people can witness the beauty, history, and engineering marvels of antique transportation up close. The environment allows them not only to appreciate these vehicles but also to engage in conversations with fellow enthusiasts, learn more about automotive history, and sometimes even experience the thrill of riding in these classic modes of transport. Examining the other choices provided, it becomes clear why they do not align with the question's context as effectively as the car show: 1. Synagogue: A synagogue is a place of worship for followers of the Jewish faith. While it may be possible to find antique items in such locations, they are not meant to showcase or celebrate antique transportation. 2. Montana: Montana is a state in the United States of America. Although Montana might have car shows and events showcasing antique transportation, it is not a specific place or event related to the query. 3. Carnival: A carnival is a festive event with amusement rides, games, and various attractions. While a carnival may feature some vintage-style carousels or rides, it is unlikely to focus on the display and appreciation of antique transportation. Carnivals are primarily known for their entertainment value rather than educational or historical significance. 4. Supermarket: A supermarket is a retail establishment that primarily sells food, groceries, and household items. It is not a location where one would expect to see people enjoying antique transportation; rather, customers would visit such a place for shopping and daily consumption needs. In conclusion, among the given options, a car show emerges as the setting that aligns the most with common sense in relation to the question. A car show provides visitors with an opportunity to enjoy antique transportation by witnessing their rich history, unique designs, and well-preserved condition. The other alternatives, such as synagogues, Montana, carnivals, and supermarkets, fall short in providing the immersive experience that a car show delivers in regard to antique transportation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal.

Please answer this question: What boxing class is heaviest - flyweight, bantam weight or feather weight?","output":"The heaviest boxing class among flyweight, bantamweight, and featherweight is the featherweight category. Below is a detailed comparison and overview of the three weight classes: 1. Flyweight: The flyweight division is one of the lighter weight classes in the sport of boxing. The weight limit for professional flyweight boxers generally ranges from 108 pounds (49 kg) to 112 pounds (50.8 kg). The flyweight division officially started in 1909 and has produced some of the most talented, skillful, and fast-paced fighters in the history of the sport. Flyweight boxers typically exhibit incredible speed, agility, and technical skill, as they rely more on these attributes due to their smaller size compared to heavier weight classes. Some notable flyweight boxers in history include Pancho Villa, Jimmy Wilde, Pongsaklek Wonjongkam, and Khaosai Galaxy. Since they are lighter fighters, they are known to employ great footwork, accurate punches, and quick combinations during their bouts. 2. Bantamweight: The bantamweight division is the next category above flyweight, with fighters typically weighing between 115 pounds (52.2 kg) and 118 pounds (53.5 kg). Bantamweight is still considered a lighter weight class, but it consists of larger fighters compared to the flyweight division. Boxers in this weight class possess a blend of speed, agility, and increasing power compared to the lighter divisions. Some famous bantamweight boxers include Carlos Zarate, Eder Jofre, Ruben Olivares, and Nonito Donaire. These fighters strike a balance between the swift combinations of the flyweights and the increased punching power that comes with the higher weight limits. 3. Featherweight: The featherweight division is the heaviest among the three weight classes mentioned. Featherweight boxers have a weight limit that ranges between 122 pounds (55.3 kg) and 126 pounds (57.2 kg). This weight class features fighters who have retained the quickness and agility traits of lower weight classes while possessing even more punching power due to the increased size and strength. A few notable featherweight boxers in history include Willie Pep, Salvador Sanchez, Sandy Saddler, and Prince Naseem Hamed. The bouts in this division often exhibit a high level of technical skill, speed, and increased power, making the featherweight class one of the exciting weight classes in boxing. In conclusion, the featherweight class is the heaviest among the flyweight, bantamweight, and featherweight divisions in boxing, with a weight range of 122 pounds to 126 pounds. As fighters move up in weight, they possess a blend of speed, agility, and power, making each division unique and exciting to watch."},{"instruction":"Q: Given a 'poster' sentence and a corresponding 'response' (often, from Facebook or Reddit)classify the sentiment of the given response into four categories: 1) Positive, 2) Negative, 3) Neutral, and 4) Mixed if it contains both positive and negative.

Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans. E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals. Known as \\"e-cigarettes,\\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum. While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \\"healthy way\\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. \\"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA. CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. That is why the FDA began to test them. The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes. In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected. Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said. The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008. To date, 50 shipments have been stopped. The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \\"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\\"  After reading the above, is \\"Diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What did the FDA find in the e-cigarette samples that were tested?\\"? OPTIONS: (i) no; (ii) yes;","output":"(ii) yes The FDA found diethylene glycol, a chemical used in antifreeze, in the e-cigarette samples that were tested. It is stated in the text: \\"In one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected.\\" This substance is toxic to humans, and its presence raises concerns about the safety of e-cigarettes and their potential health risks. In addition to diethylene glycol, the FDA's analysis also detected carcinogens in some samples, posing further risks to those who use these products. The FDA's concerns primarily stem from the unknown levels of nicotine and other chemicals present in these devices, as they have not been properly submitted for evaluation or approval. Consequently, the agency has been seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the border since summer 2008 to further investigate the potential dangers associated with their use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Bees first secure the perfect spot, such as hollow areas of trees - Bees will begin to chew max until it becomes softened - The chewed up wax will be stored inside of a honeycomb - Worker bees continue chewing and softening wax from within - The chewed up wax is steadily added, making the hive bigger and bigger - The bees will house nectar, honey and pollen within the honeycomb's cells -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose an ideal spot is not found happens, how will it affect more honey is produced.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"If an ideal spot is not found for a beehive, the bees may face difficulty in constructing a proper hive that meets the requirements for honey production, ultimately affecting the overall production. A suitable location for a beehive usually includes an easily accessible, secure area with good airflow and protection from harsh weather conditions. If these factors are not met, one or more aspects of the honey production process may be disrupted. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that disturbances can affect the equilibrium of a system. In this case, the disturbance is the lack of an ideal location for a beehive. The direct and indirect effects on the honey production process can be observed in several ways: 1. Limited space: If the chosen area is too cramped or constricted, it may lead to a smaller hive size, which, in turn, affects the number of honeycomb cells available for storing honey, nectar, and pollen. 2. Temperature and humidity control: Bees require a specific temperature (about 95°F / 35°C) and ideal humidity levels to maintain the conditions required for making honey. An unsuitable location may hinder the bees' ability to regulate these factors, ultimately affecting honey production. 3. Protection from predators: An inadequate spot could expose the hive to predators and parasites, risking the bees' safety and wellbeing. In this case, more energy might be dedicated to defending the hive rather than collecting nectar and making honey. 4. Colony health: A less-than-ideal location may also impact the bees themselves. For example, poor ventilation of a chosen location could promote mold growth and increase disease risk in the colony, which would ultimately affect productivity. 5. Ease of access to resources: A crucial part of honey production is the availability of nearby plant resources. If the selected site is not near enough to these resources, the bees would have to travel longer distances for nectar and pollen, thus making the extraction process longer and more challenging. This, in turn, could cause a decline in honey production. In conclusion, the lack of an ideal spot for a beehive can indirectly and directly affect the honey production process in several ways. Bees might not be able to create healthy, functional hives, which could lead to reduced honey production and lowered colony welfare."},{"instruction":"In this task you will be given a list of integers.

A teenage gymnast who suffered a career-ending spine injury at the age of ten has revealed how she managed to make an unlikely return as one of the sport's top-ranked athletes. Annie Hilton, 14, from Southern California, who is starring in Gatorade's new Win From Within campaign, was working towards earning a place on the US women's national gymnastics team when a simple mistake during a floor routine left her with a fractured neck. But while that injury alone should not have kept her from competing, the pre-teen suffered another devastating blow when doctors diagnosed her with dyslastic spondylolisthesis, a congenital spine disorder which prevented her vertebrae from fusing together. Scroll down for video. Top of her game: Annie Hilton, 14, made an astonishing return to gymnastics after undergoing spinal surgery. Star athlete: The gymnast was just ten when she was forced to take more than a year off in order to recover. Annie was forced to undergo painful surgery in order for doctors to put screws in her spine. The procedure left her bedridden for a number of months, with experts predicting that she would then have to spent another year in recovery. 'Annie had a mishap on floor one day, took off wrong and landed on top of her head,' Southern California Elite Gymnastics Academy coach Kathy Strate explains in the Gatorade video. 'It turned out to be an injury that just needed time to heal, it wasn't in any way a career-ending or serious injury. But as her neck was healing, she noticed that her back was hurting. 'Most kids who take a year or more off do not make a comeback in a sport like this. Gymnastics was over for her.' 'My dream was to compete at World's and to be on the national team for gymnastics,' Annie said. 'When they told me I would have to take a year off, I was devastated.' Down but not out: Annie initially thought that her injury would take just a matter of months to heal. 'Frustrated': Doctors later diagnosed Annie with a severe spinal disorder which required painful and complex surgery. During the first few months of her recovery, Annie was incredibly frustrated and angry at how helpless she felt. 'I like trying to feel like I'm independent, but people had to do everything for me; I couldn't even walk on my own,' she recalled. Her father Dan admits that watching his daughter struggle with just the simplest of tasks was heart-breaking for Annie's family - but to witness her passion slowly start to return as her recovery quickened gave them all the determination and motivation they needed to help her return to her beloved sport. 'I just remember when she was walking across the room three feet, she was so frustrated, she couldn't stand up,' he said. 'But by the time she was walking to the end of the hallway, that was almost when the light switch turned on and she could see she was making progress.' Determination: Annie has had to dedicate endless hours towards ensuring that she was able to regain her skills. Flying high: The teen defied doctors' expectations when she returned to the gym after just 13 months of recovery. After 13 months of recovery, Annie was finally given the all-clear by doctors and told that she could start to try other forms of physical activity, beyond walking. But while many believed that the hardest part of her recovery was over, Annie had to face yet another seemingly impossible battle - returning to gymnastics and attempting to regain all of the skills that she had lost during her time away from the sport. 'When I would reach down to touch my toes, I would get to about my knees,' Annie said. 'My arms especially - I lost all of my upper body strength. 'It was really hard. I felt so weak.' But her determination and unwavering self-belief paid off, and within a year, the teenager was competing - and winning - at national competitions once again. Comeback kid: Annie's goal is to get a full college scholarship so that she can continue competing at the highest level. 'I'm fearless': The young gymnast has managed to overcome every obstacle put in her way. '[Annie] doesn't get down, she just keeps working and working and working,' coach Kathy said. 'I thought that it was very possible that she could compete the next year. And she was ready to go by the first meet. And she competed not one event, but all four events. 'It's the best comeback story I've seen in 25 years. And the way she's going, she's going to reach her ultimate goal, which is to get a full ride scholarship.' 'These things just happen and when they do, you have to be ready, you have to put all of your effort into it,' Annie added. 'What makes me different is that, I'm fearless.'

A key part of the reaction is ensuring that the sodium hydroxide is dissolved in water before adding the other materials. Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction A, and sets the heat to high. Justin can't use high heat for his second reaction, though, because the electricity supply is too weak to have both burners on high. Because of this, Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction B and sets the heat to low.  In which reaction will the sodium hydroxide dissolve faster?  Hint: When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs Answer:","output":"In the given scenario, Justin is conducting a chemical experiment involving sodium hydroxide (NaOH). He is adding NaOH to two different reactions, A and B. In Reaction A, he adds the sodium hydroxide and sets the heat to high, while in Reaction B, he adds the sodium hydroxide and sets the heat to low due to the limitations of the electricity supply. You are asked to determine in which reaction the sodium hydroxide will dissolve faster. As hinted in the question, there are several factors that affect the rate at which a solute dissolves in a solvent. The specific factors mentioned are: 1. Stirring: Agitating the solution helps the solute particles mix with the solvent particles more effectively, increasing the rate of dissolution. 2. Temperature: A higher temperature typically means that solute particles have more energy, which allows them to interact with the solvent particles more frequently and effectively, leading to a faster dissolution. 3. Surface area: A larger surface area of the solute means more contact points for the solute particles to interact with the solvent particles, which can result in a faster dissolution rate. Taking these factors into account, let's analyze the two reactions in which Justin is adding sodium hydroxide. Reaction A: Sodium hydroxide is added and the heat is set to high. This implies that the temperature of the solution for this reaction will be higher in comparison to Reaction B. As a result, the dissolution rate of NaOH should be faster in this reaction due to the increased temperature. Reaction B: Since the electricity supply is weak and Justin cannot use high heat for this reaction, the heat is set to low. This means that the temperature of the solution for Reaction B will be lower compared to Reaction A. This will delay the dissolution of NaOH in this reaction, making it slower compared to Reaction A. Based on the temperature factor and the given information, the sodium hydroxide will dissolve faster in Reaction A, where the heat is set to high. The increased temperature provides more energy to the solute particles, enhancing their interaction with the solvent particles and thus accelerating the rate of dissolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who is a former real estate developer?  Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive. The answer to this question is:","output":"Doris Hillman is a former real estate developer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math problem: Solve -3*k - 55 + 46 = 0 for k. What is the solution?","output":"Alright, this may seem a little tricky but I'll try to make it super easy for you! We have -3*k - 55 + 46 = 0 First, we combine the numbers that are just by themselves, which we call constants. So, we calculate -55 + 46 which = -9.  So, our new equation becomes -3*k - 9 = 0 Next, let's get rid of that -9 from the left side of the equation. To do so, we can add 9 to both sides of the equation.  So, it becomes -3*k = +9 (because 0 + 9 = 9) All that's left is to solve for 'k'. Right now, we've got -3 times 'k' equals 9. So, to get 'k' by itself, we need to do the opposite of multiplying by -3, which is dividing by -3. So, we divide both sides by -3.  So, 'k' equals +9/-3 which equals -3. So, 'k' equals -3. It's just as if you have three ice creams and your friend wanted to take all of them away from you, you would be left with none or in this case, -3, it means a loss of 3 ice creams!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.
