How many gallons does the tank contain when it is completely full?","output":"To solve the problem step by step, let's start by identifying the change in the tank's fill level when 130 gallons of water are added. The tank goes from being one-sixth full to three-fifths full.  First, we calculate the difference in these fractions to understand what portion of the tank's total capacity 130 gallons represent: [ frac{3}{5} - frac{1}{6} = frac{18}{30} - frac{5}{30} = frac{13}{30} ] This tells us that 130 gallons of water fill frac{13}{30} of the tank's total capacity. Let's denote the total capacity of the tank as x gallons. Therefore, we can express this relationship as: [ frac{13}{30}x = 130 text{ gallons} ] To find the total capacity x, we solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation.

How can the line be constructed on the sheet that connects a given point on the sheet with one of the intersection points of the circles?","output":"# Problem: On a sheet, two arcs from circles are given, but their intersection points cannot fit on the paper. How can you construct the line on the sheet that connects a given point on the sheet to one of the intersection points of the circles?   I. Solution 1. Let the given point be (P), and let the circles with centers (O_1) and (O_2) be (k_1) and (k_2), respectively. We need to connect point (P) with one of the intersection points, (M), of (k_1) and (k_2). Our goal is to construct the line (P M). 2. Select 3 points each from the arcs (k_1) and (k_2) that lie on the paper. Using these points, reduce the scale of the circles by half from point (P). If we cannot fit the reduced circles on the paper because their centers do not lie on the paper, or if the intersection point of the reduced circles still does not fit on the paper, reduce the scale further by half. Continue this process until the reduced circles (k_1') and (k_2') have their intersection point (M') fitting on the paper. This process will terminate after a finite number of steps because the radius of the circles and their distance from (P) halve with each step. 3. The reduced circles (k_1') and (k_2') have point (P) as their center and are homothetic to circles (k_1) and (k_2). Therefore, point (M) (the intersection in the original circles) can be obtained by scaling (M') from (P). Thus, points (P), (M'), and (M) are collinear, meaning the line (P M') is the desired line (P M). # Conclusion: Therefore, the line (P M') is the line that connects (P) with the intersection point (M) of the circles.  [ boxed{PM'} ]  II. Solution 1. Draw a circle (k) which entirely lies on the sheet and encloses point (P) and the arcs of the circles (k_1) and (k_2). 2. Invert the plane with respect to this new circle (k). Let’s denote the center of (k) by (O). The inversion will map points outside (k) to inside it and vice versa. 3. Chose three points on each original circle (k_1) and (k_2), invert these points, and the circumcircle of these three inverted points will be the inverted image of circles (k_1) and (k_2). 4. Because point (P) and original circles (k_1) and (k_2) are outside circle (k), their images after inversion, including the intersection points (A') and (B') of the inverted circles, will be inside circle (k). 5. If the inverted point (P'), the intersection (A'), and the center (O) are collinear, then the desired line is (OA'). Inverting (OA') yields the desired line. 6. If points (A', P', O) are not collinear, then find the circumcircle of triangle (A'P'O). This circle’s inverse will be a line that is the desired line (PM). 7. If the circumcircle of (A'P'O) does not completely fit on the paper, reduce the radius of circle (k) and repeat the inversion process until the circumcircle fits on the paper. 8. If the circumcircle of (A'P'O) intersects (k), the line through these intersection points is the desired line. 9. If circumcircle (c) lies entirely within (k), continue looking for another point on (c) invertible onto the paper until you have successfully inverted a point back onto the paper. Conclusion: The line obtained after successful inversion and intersection fitting processes is the desired line connecting point (P) with one of the intersection points of circles (k_1) and (k_2).

These times are x_1 approx 0.88 seconds and x_2 approx 1.16 seconds.

Option B states the ball reaches a height of 5m above the ground after approximately 0.88s. This interpretation directly corresponds to one of the roots (x_1), indicating that it is a correct interpretation of one of the times the ball reaches 5m in height. Option C suggests the ball reaches 5m at 1.16s and will continue to rise, which is incorrect because at 1.16s, the ball is actually starting to descend after reaching its peak height.

By the Lifting the Exponent Lemma (LTE):    [    v_p left( x^k + y^k right) = v_p (x + y) + v_p (k)    ]    Since ( v_p left( 3^n right) = v_p (x^k + y^k) geq 1 ), it follows that ( p ) must divide ( 3^n ), which implies ( p = 3 ). 3. **Identify ( m ):**        Thus, ( x + y = 3^m ) for some positive integer ( m ). We further need:    [    n = v_3 (k) + m    ]    There are two cases to consider:        **Case 1: ( m > 1 ):**        If ( m > 1 ), we proceed as follows:        - Note ( 3^m geq 9 ).     - Suppose ( x > y ).

More precisely, ( x > frac{3^m}{2} ).        - Consider the inequalities:        [    x^k + y^k geq x^k geq left(frac{3^m}{2}right)^k = frac{3^{mk}}{2^k}    ]    Since ( x^k ) and ( y^k ) are increasing functions, we adjust the inequality based on their values.    - However, using the multiplication symbol:        [    x^k geq frac{3^m}{2} 5^{k-1} implies x^{k} + y^{k} geq frac{3^m}{2} 5^{k-1} > 3^m 5^{k-2} geq 3^{m + v_3 (k)} = 3^n    ]    This creates a contradiction. Hence, ( m > 1 ) is not possible.    **Case 2: ( m = 1 ):**        For ( m = 1 ), we have ( x + y = 3 ). Thus, the only coprime pairs ((x, y)) are ( (2, 1) ):    Plugging in:    - For ( x = 2 ) and ( y = 1 ):        [    3^{1 + v_3 (k)} = 1 + 2^k    ]    Notice:    [    3^{1 + v_3 (k)} mid k    ]        Hence ( 2^k + 1 leq 3k ).

Option B: If m is perpendicular to alpha and alpha is perpendicular to beta, it may sound feasible for m to be parallel to beta; however, perpendicularity in this context doesn't lead to a parallel relationship between m and beta.

Since the problem asks for 1, choice boxed{C} is incorrect because the maximum value is actually greater than 1. **For D:** To find the minimum value of frac{1}{4a^2}+frac{1}{b^2}, we consider the given constraint a^2+b^2=1 and apply the AM-GM inequality: [ frac{1}{4a^2}+frac{1}{b^2} geq 2sqrt{frac{1}{4a^2} cdot frac{1}{b^2}} ] Simplifying the right-hand side: [ geq 2sqrt{frac{1}{4a^2b^2}} ] Given a^2+b^2=1, this inequality does not straightforwardly lead to the conclusion needed. Therefore, the step-by-step approach to proving choice boxed{D} is incorrect was not perfectly aligned with the original solution's logic. However, the original solution's manipulation suggests a deeper inequality application, possibly involving more sophisticated techniques than a direct AM-GM application. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the correct choices are boxed{AB}."},{"instruction":"it possible to draw a diagonal on each small square of every face of a Rubik's Cube in such a way that it results in a closed, nonselfintersecting broken line on the surface of the cube?","output":":  1. **Coordinate System Setup**    Place the Rubik’s cube in a Cartesian coordinate system such that the perpendicular edges align with the coordinate axes, and let the edge length of the smaller square of the cube be 1. Therefore, the coordinates of the cube’s vertices are in the form (x, y, z) where x, y, and z independently take values in {0, 3}. 2. **Diagonal Movement Analysis**    When moving diagonally across a small square within a face, one coordinate remains constant while the other two coordinates change by pm 1. This movement results in a change in the sum of the coordinates by an even number (either +2 or -2). 3. **Parity Considerations**    To create a connected path across the diagonals, only vertices whose sum of coordinates have the same parity can be used. Each small square’s diagonal connects two vertices that have the same parity of their coordinate sum. 4. **Traversal Constraints**    To create a closed non-self-intersecting broken line, each vertex corresponding to the sum of coordinates having the same parity must be visited.     However, the extreme vertices of the cube (corners) will have mixed parity. Specifically:    - Vertices (0, 0, 0), (0, 3, 3), (3, 0, 3), and (3, 3, 0) have even coordinate sums.    - Vertices (0, 0, 3), (0, 3, 0), (3, 0, 0), and (3, 3, 3) have odd coordinate sums.    Each of these vertices is shared by three small squares. Visiting a vertex implies crossing at least two diagonals of the small squares which share that vertex, thereby blocking the third diagonal and precluding further movement. 5. **Conclusion**    Thus, it is impossible to draw a closed non-self-intersecting broken line such that each small square of the Rubik's cube has one of its diagonals included.     This proof also implies that even an open broken line following the same rules would necessitate precisely four end points, rendering such a line impossible.

The number of terms in the first n groups is 1 + 3 + 5 + cdots + (2n-1). This sum can be expressed as n^2 because the sum of the first n odd numbers equals n^2. **Statement A: a_{64}=frac{1}{17}** To find a_{64}, we set n^2 = 64 to find the group to which a_{64} belongs. Solving for n, we get n = 8. Therefore, a_{64} is the last term of the 8th group, which has a denominator of 2*8-1=15.

Therefore, the area ( A ) is either an integer or a half-integer. For ( A ) to be an integer, the expression inside the absolute value must be even. 3. **Pigeonhole Principle:**    Consider a large enough grid of points. By the pigeonhole principle, if we color these points with three colors, there will be many points of the same color.

(For example, in the figure, the arcs ( A_{2}A_{6} ) and ( A_{6}A_{10} ) are identically colored.) Prove that if for each division point ( A_{k} ) it is possible to specify two nonintersecting identically colored arcs with a common endpoint ( A_{k} ), then the entire circle can be divided into several identically colored arcs, i.e., the coloring is periodic. First, consider the case when there are only two colors, say red and black.","output":"1. **Terminology and Notation Setup:**    - Let us denote the division points on the circle by capital Latin letters ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ).    - Let small Greek letters represent the colored arcs that lie between these division points.    - Equality ( alpha = beta ) will mean that arcs ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are colored identically.    - We will refer to similarly colored arcs as equal.    - Denote the length of arc ( alpha ) by ( |alpha| ).    - Adopt the walking direction along the circle in a clockwise manner as positive.    - Define an arc ( beta_gamma ) as resulting from appending the start of arc ( gamma ) to the end of arc ( beta ). 2. **Symmetric Arcs and Proving Minimal Arcs:**    - A symmetric arc is one in which equal smaller arcs lie at the start and at the end. Specifically, ( alpha ) is a symmetric arc if there exist arcs ( beta, gamma, delta ) such that ( alpha = beta gamma = delta beta ).    - Lemma 1 states that if an arc ( alpha ) is minimal, then it is not symmetric. Proving this lemma ensures that no minimal arc can be split uniformly into smaller, equal arcs. 3. **Preliminary Steps for the Main Proof:**    - Assume the presented condition that one can always find a pair of non-intersecting equally colored arcs with a common end point for each division point.    - Also, among all the minimal pairs of arcs corresponding to distinct division points, identify a point ( A ) whose arc pair is maximal in length. Denote other endpoints of these arcs as points ( B ) and ( C ). 4. **Main Lemma:**    - If an arc ( A B ) is cut out and points ( A ) and ( B ) are glued together, the new circle will still satisfy the condition of having non-intersecting equally colored arcs with a common end point for each division point.    - The proof involves showing that for any point on the new circle, there exist equal arcs meeting the condition. 5. **Proof by Induction:**    - Conduct induction based on the number of division points ( n ).    - For ( n = 2 ), the periodicity of the coloring is evident.    - Assume the result holds for ( n leq k ) and prove it for ( n = k+1 ).     - If the whole circle is the union of such pairs of arcs, the proof is valid. Otherwise, by gluing point pairs and invoking the main lemma, reduce the number of division points and use the induction hypothesis to conclude periodicity. 6. **Final Steps and Verification:**    - By cutting the arc and gluing points, result in another circle with fewer division points, satisfying the induction hypothesis.    - By using Lemma 3, prove that the period length is consistent with the criterion of minimal arcs and hence establish the periodicity of the entire coloring scheme.

So we have: (3/10)S + (1/8)S = 3400 To solve for S, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 40 (the least common multiple of 10 and 8). We can rewrite the equation as: (12/40)S + (5/40)S = 3400 Combining the fractions, we get: (17/40)S = 3400 Now, we can solve for S: S = 3400 / (17/40) S = 3400 * (40/17) S = 13600 / 17 S = 800 So, the man's total salary is Rs 800.

Definitions: A **main diagonal** of a polygon with an odd number of sides (2n+1) is a segment (A_i A_{i+n}). Here, we use cyclical numbering of vertices so that (A_{i+2n+1} = A_i).  Induction Base Case: For (n = 1), the polygon in question is a triangle, where each \\"main diagonal\\" is one of its sides. The inequality directly follows from the triangle inequality stating that for any triangle (ABC), (AB + BC > AC).  Induction Hypothesis: Assume the statement is true for a convex polygon with (2n+1) sides. That is, for a polygon (K) with vertices (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2n+1}), the sum of the lengths of any set of chosen main diagonals, not sharing endpoints, is less than the sum of lengths of the remaining main diagonals.  Inductive Step: Consider a convex polygon (K) with (2(n+1)+1 = 2n+3) vertices. Select a main diagonal (A_1 A_{n+3}). By definition of \\"main\\", this diagonal splits the polygon into two parts, one with vertices (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{n+3}) and the other up to (A_{2n+3}).  1. **Non-selected Main Diagonals**:    Diagonals such as (A_1 A_{n+2}) and (A_2 A_{n+3}) are non-selected and intersect at some point (P).

The main diagonals for (M) include (A_2 A_{n+2}) and extend as described. 3. **Applying Induction Hypothesis**:    By induction hypothesis, the sum of lengths of the main diagonals chosen in (M) (excluding (A_1 A_{n+3})) satisfies:    [    (s_1 - A_1 A_{n+3}) < (s_2 - A_1 A_{n+2}) - A_2 A_{n+2}    ] 4. **Combining Inequalities**:    Adding the non-selected diagonal inequality to the above:    [    s_1 - A_1 A_{n+3} < s_2 - A_1 A_{n+2} - A_2 A_{n+2} + A_2 A_{n+2}    ]    We simplify to get:    [    s_1 < s_2 - A_1 A_{n+2}    ]    Since the lengths of the diagonals (A_1 A_{n+2}) and (A_2 A_{n+3}) satisfy the conditions laid out, we can conclude as desired:    [    s_1 < s_2    ]    Hence, by mathematical induction, the statement holds for any polygon with (2n+1) sides.     # Conclusion: We have shown that the sum of lengths of any chosen main diagonals of a considered (2n+1)-gon is less than the sum of lengths of the remaining main diagonals.

The distance of a point from a plane parallel to it is equal to the absolute difference in the respective coordinate (here z-coordinate) between the point and any point on the plane. 3. The distance from point P(2, 3, 5) to the plane xOy is therefore given by |5 - 0| = 5. To summarize, the distance is independent of the x and y coordinates of point P and is solely determined by the z coordinate. Hence, the figure formed by the set of all points for which z=1 is a plane passing through (0, 0, 1) and perpendicular to the z-axis; and the distance from point P(2, 3, 5) to the plane xOy is boxed{5}."},{"instruction":"Louise is baking cakes for a gathering.

Then swapping (a_1) and (b_1) would increase the number of cross roads, contradicting the maximal property of the partition (A, B). 4. **Existence of neighbors:**    Thus, such two cities do not exist.

Thus, in every case, replacing ( a ) and ( b ) by ( |a-b| ) does not change the parity of the sum of all numbers on the board. 4. **Final State**:    Given that the sum of all the numbers on the board remains even throughout the series of operations, the last remaining number, when all others have been paired and eliminated, must also be even (since the parity does not change).

The definition of a parabola tells us that the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is equal to the distance from that point to the directrix. The equation of the parabola C is y^2 = 8x, and its focus F is at (2, 0) since the focal length (p) is 2 and the parabola opens to the right (x=p for the focus of a parabola y^2 = 4px). The directrix of the parabola is a vertical line to the left of the focus, and its equation is x = -p, thus for our parabola x = -2. The distance |FM| can be expressed as the horizontal distance from M to the focus, which is x_0 - 2.

Also, |C| = 2 binom{n}{2}, reflecting the number of 2-element subsets. 6. **Sorting and Considering the Differences:**    Without loss of generality, assume 0 = x_1 < x_2 < cdots < x_n = 2 binom{n}{2} and 0 leq y_1 < y_2 < cdots < y_n leq 2 binom{n}{2}. 7. **Sum of Differences:**    Consider the sum:        begin{aligned}    L_n &= sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(x_{i+1} - x_i) + sum_{i=1}^{n-2}(x_{i+2} - x_i) + sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(y_{i+1} - y_i) + sum_{i=1}^{n-2}(y_{i+2} - y_i)    end{aligned}     8. **Assumption of Unique Differences:**    If every  {x_i, x_j }  and  {y_i, y_j }  in  C  have distinct differences:        L_n geq 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + (4n - 6) = 8n^2 - 22n + 15     9. **Alternate Calculation:**    Considering the maximum bounds:        L_n = 2(x_n - x_1) + (x_{n-1} - x_2) + 2(y_n - y_1) + (y_{n-1} - y_2) = 2x_n + y_n + y_n + x_{n-1} + y_{n-1} - 2y_1 - x_2 - y_2 - 2x_1     10. **Estimating Maximum L_n:**     If y_1 = 0, and recalling x_1 = 0, x_n = 2 binom{n}{2}, and y_n leq 2 binom{n}{2} - 1:          x_{n-1} + y_{n-1} + y_n leq 6 binom{n}{2} - 6, quad x_2 + y_2 geq 3          Thus,          L_n leq 4 binom{n}{2} + 2 binom{n}{2} - 1 + 6 binom{n}{2} - 6 - 3 = 6n^2 - 6n - 10      11. **Checking Consistency:**     From:          8n^2 - 22n + 15 leq 6n^2 - 6n - 10          Simplifying this inequality:          2n^2 - 16n + 25 leq 0         12. **Quadratic Discrepancy:**     Converting 2n^2 - 16n + 25 to a complete square form:          2(n-4)^2 - 7          And recognizing that:          2(n-4)^2 - 7 geq 1 > 0 quad text{for} quad n geq 6          This results in a contradiction, hence at least two elements in C must have the same label. **Conclusion:** boxed{text{When } n geq 6, text{ there are at least two elements in } C text{ with the same label.}}"},{"instruction":"Let (ABC) be a triangle and (I) the center of its inscribed circle.

The equation of the line can be written as:      [      y - 1 = m(x - 0) implies y = mx + 1      ]    - The second line passes through the point ((-1, 0)) and is parallel to the first line, so it has the same slope (m).

Thus, [ text{Sum} = frac{1990}{2} (n + (n + 1989)) = frac{1990}{2} (2n + 1989) ] Simplifying this, [ text{Sum} = 1990n + frac{1990 cdot 1989}{2} ] We need this sum to equal ( m ). Therefore, we set: [ 1990n + frac{1990 times 1989}{2} = m ] We solve for ( n ): [ 1990n = m - frac{1990 times 1989}{2} ] [ 1990n = m - 995 times 1989 ] [ 1990n = frac{2m - 1990 cdot 1989}{2} ] [ 1990n = frac{2 cdot 5^{10} cdot 199^{180} - 1990 cdot 1989}{2} ] To make sure ( n ) is an integer, it must be of the form: [ n = frac{5^9 cdot 199^{179} - 1989}{2} ] Thus, by choosing ( n = frac{5^{9} cdot 199^{179} - 1989}{2} ), we can confirm: [ m = 1990n + frac{1990 cdot 1989}{2} ] This completes part (a). 2. **(b) There are exactly 1990 different ways to write ( m ) as the sum of consecutive integers:** Consider writing: [ m = n + (n+1) + cdots + (n+k) ] The sum of these ( k+1 ) terms is given by: [ m = (k+1)n + frac{k(k+1)}{2} ] This can be rearranged into: [ 2m = (k+1)(2n + k) ] Given ( m = 5^{10} cdot 199^{180} ), we express this as: [ 2m = 2^{1} times 5^{10} times 199^{180} ] We require factor pairs of ( 2m ). The prime factorization yields: [ 2m = 2^1 times 5^{10} times 199^{180} ] Among these factors, ( 2m ) has ( 2 times 11 times 181 = 3982 ) factors in total. Removing the pairs where ( b = a ), we get: [ frac{3982}{2} = 1991  ] However, ignoring the pair ((1, 2m)), we find ( 1990 ) different pairs ((a, b)) where each pair generates a unique pair of ( k ) and ( n ). Given that ( b > a ), set ( k = a - 1 ) and ( n = frac{b - a + 1}{2} ) ensuring ( n ) is a natural number. Therefore, we've shown forming exactly ( 1990 ) such sums. **Conclusion:** Thus, ( m ) can be expressed as the sum of 1990 consecutive integers in exactly 1990 different ways.

In total, there are 45 players. How many people play both games?","output":"Let's denote the number of people who play both kabadi and kho kho as x. According to the problem, there are 10 people who play kabadi. This includes people who play only kabadi and those who play both games. Similarly, there are 35 people who play only kho kho. Since some people play both games, they are being counted twice in the total of 45 players. Once in the kabadi count and once in the kho kho count. To find the number of people who play both games, we need to subtract the number of people who play only one game from the total number of players. The total number of players who play kabadi, kho kho, or both is 45. This total is made up of three groups: 1. People who play only kabadi 2. People who play only kho kho 3. People who play both We can express this total as: Total players = Only kabadi + Only kho kho + Both games We know that: Only kabadi = 10 - x (since x people play both, they are not included in the \\"only kabadi\\" count) Only kho kho = 35 (given in the problem) Both games = x (the number we want to find) So, the equation becomes: 45 = (10 - x) + 35 + x Now, let's solve for x: 45 = 10 - x + 35 + x 45 = 45 + x - x (since x - x cancels out) 45 = 45 Since the x terms cancel out, it means that the number of people who play only kabadi is equal to the number of people who play both games. Therefore, the number of people who play both games is the same as the number of people who play only kabadi, which is 10. So, boxed{10}  people play both kabadi and kho kho."},{"instruction":"Let ( p ) be an odd prime number and ( a ), ( n ) be positive integers such that ( a^p  1 ) is divisible by ( p^n ).

If one of the base angles is 80^{circ}, then the other base angle must also be 80^{circ} (since it's isosceles and the base angles are equal). - This means the two base angles together sum up to 80^{circ} + 80^{circ} = 160^{circ}. - Therefore, the vertex angle must be 180^{circ} - 160^{circ} = 20^{circ}. **Case 2:** The 80^{circ} angle is the vertex angle. - If the 80^{circ} angle is the vertex angle, then the base angles must be equal to each other due to the properties of an isosceles triangle. - The sum of the base angles would then be 180^{circ} - 80^{circ} = 100^{circ}. - Since the base angles are equal, each base angle is frac{1}{2} times 100^{circ} = 50^{circ}.

At x = 2, g'(x) = 0, suggesting a potential extremum. For x in (2, +infty), g'(x) > 0, indicating that g(x) is increasing. Since g(x) decreases till x = 2 and then increases, x = 2 is a local minimum. We find the minimum value of g(x) at this point: [ g(2) = frac{e^2}{2^2} = frac{e^2}{4}. ] Since for x > 0, g(x) is always greater than its minimum: [ g(x) geq frac{e^2}{4} > 1, ] which implies that: [ f(x) = g(x) cdot x > 1 cdot x = x. ] Thus, we have proved that f(x) > x for x > 0.

Thus, gold cannot be in coffer 1, 2, or 3. 2. **Analyze the Second Statement:**    - The second statement is \\"A prata está no cofre 1.\\"    - If this statement were true, the gold would be in coffer 2. However, we have already determined that the gold cannot be in coffer 2. Hence, this statement is false. Consequently, the silver is not in coffer 1. 3. **Conclusions from False Statements:**    - We now know that gold must be in either coffer 4 or 5 since it is not in coffer 1, 2, or 3.    - Also, from the false second statement, we conclude that silver cannot be in coffer 1. 4. **Analyze Coffer 4:**    - Suppose gold is in coffer 4.    - Then, the fourth statement \\"O níquel está no cofre cujo número é inferior, em uma unidade, ao que contém o ouro.\\" would be true. This would imply nickel is in coffer 3.    - However, if the third statement \\"O bronze não está aqui.\\" is false and bronze is also in coffer 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, gold cannot be in coffer 4. 5. **Deduce Gold's Position:**    - Since gold cannot be in coffer 1, 2, 3, or 4, it must be in coffer 5. 6. **Validate Gold in Coffer 5:**    - If gold is in coffer 5, the fifth statement \\"A platina está no cofre cujo número é superior, em uma unidade, ao que contém o bronze.\\" is true.    - This means the number of the coffer containing platinum is one unit higher than the one containing bronze. Consequently, the bronze must be in coffer 4 and platinum in coffer 5.    7. **Interpret False Third Statement:**    - The third statement \\"O bronze não está aqui.\\" is false, confirming the bronze is actually in coffer 3.    - Consequently, platinum must be in coffer 4. 8. **Analyze All Pieces:**    - With gold in coffer 5, pertinent false statement analysis, silver must be in coffer 2.    - This leaves us nickel in coffer 1. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{níquel}_1,  text{prata}_2,  text{bronze}_3,  text{platina}_4,  text{ouro}_5} ]"},{"instruction":"Alexa and Katerina stood on a scale together.

In subset P, consider any four distinct elements a, b, c, d.

We will use mathematical induction on n.  Base Case: Let's consider n = 1. For n = 1, the graph should have 2n = 2 vertices. We need two vertices both of which have degree 1. These two vertices can simply be connected by an edge. - Let the vertices be v_1 and v_2, and connect them by an edge (v_1, v_2).  - In this case, deg(v_1) = 1 and deg(v_2) = 1. This forms a simple graph with 2 vertices having the degrees 1, 1. Therefore, the base case holds.   Induction Step: Assume the statement is true for some integer n = k; that is: - There exists a graph G_k with 2k vertices where the degrees of vertices are 1, 1, 2, 2, ldots, k, k. We need to show that there exists a graph with 2(k + 1) = 2k + 2 vertices where the degrees of these vertices are 1, 1, 2, 2, ldots, k, k, k+1, k+1. 1. **Start with the graph G_k** defined for 2k vertices. 2. **Add two new vertices**, let's name them A and B. 3. Connect the vertex A to:    - One existing vertex of each degree from 1 to k.    - Vertices connected to A: v_1, v_2, ldots, v_k. 4. **Degree adjustment**:    - Vertices v_i  (1 leq i leq k) originally having degrees 1, ldots, k will now have degrees 2, ldots, k+1 respectively after being connected to A.    - The vertex A will now have degree k because it's connected to k vertices.     5. **Connect remaining new vertex** B to only A to ensure:    - Vertex A now finally gets an additional degree making its total degree k+1.    - Vertex B gets degree 1 by connecting only to A. Thus, the degrees of the vertices in the new graph G_{k+1} will be: - 1, 1, 2, ldots, k-1 from the original vertices unchanged. - 2, ldots, k, k+1 from the original vertices updated after connecting to A. - Additional k+1 from vertex A and 1 from the vertex B. So the graph now contains 2(k + 1) = 2k + 2 vertices, with the necessary degrees 1, 1, 2, 2, ldots, k, k, k+1, k+1. Therefore, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers n.

Since ( f ) is an odd function, ( fleft( -frac{1}{k} right) = -fleft( frac{1}{k} right) ). Hence,    [    fleft( frac{1}{k+1} right) = frac{1}{k} fleft( frac{1}{k} right).    ] 4. We use recurrence to find ( fleft( frac{1}{k} right) ):    [    fleft( frac{1}{k} right) = frac{1}{(k-1)} fleft( frac{1}{k-1} right) = frac{1}{(k-1)(k-2)} fleft( frac{1}{k-2} right) = cdots = frac{1}{(k-1)!} fleft( 1 right).    ]    Given ( f(1) = 1 ), we have:    [    fleft( frac{1}{k} right) = frac{1}{(k-1)!}.    ] 5.

Simplifying the expression, noting that the binomial coefficient is defined as:    [    C_{99}^{k-1} = frac{99!}{(k-1)! cdot (100-k)!},    ]    we get:    [    fleft( frac{1}{k} right) fleft( frac{1}{101-k} right) = frac{1}{99!} cdot C_{99}^{k-1}.    ] 7. We are summing this from ( k = 1 ) to ( k = 50 ):    [    sum_{k=1}^{50} fleft( frac{1}{k} right) fleft( frac{1}{101-k} right) = frac{1}{99!} sum_{k=1}^{50} C_{99}^{k-1}.    ] 8.

Therefore,    [    sum_{k=0}^{49} C_{99}^{k} = frac{1}{2} sum_{k=0}^{99} C_{99}^{k} = frac{1}{2} cdot 2^{99} = 2^{98}.    ] 10. Finally,     [     sum_{k=1}^{50} fleft( frac{1}{k} right) fleft( frac{1}{101-k} right) = frac{1}{99!} cdot 2^{98} = frac{2^{98}}{99!}.     ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{2^{98}}{99!}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given two points A(x_1,y_1) and B(x_2,y_2) on the graph of the function f(x)= frac {1}{2}+ log _2 frac {x}{1x}.

Part (a):  First, we should find the maximum amount Maria Ivanovna can donate each month. Below are the assumptions and steps that need to be clarified. 1. The various elements of her day are:    - She sleeps 9 hours.    - She works L_i hours as a tutor.    - She spends 2L_i hours on her hobby of knitting.    - She spends k_i hours on rest and household chores.    - The total daily hours are always 24.

For any natural number ( n ), there exist exactly ( n ) cards, each marked with a divisor of ( n ).

Hence, there must be exactly one card where the divisor is ( n ) itself. Thus, each natural number appears on at least one card, which concludes the solution.

The radian measure of each arc is given by: [ mu(A_{k-1}A_k) = frac{4F_{2k+1}}{F_{2k+1}^2 + 1} ] We are essentially looking for the sum: [ sum_{k=1}^infty frac{4F_{2k+1}}{F_{2k+1}^2 + 1} ] Step 1: Simplify the expression inside the sum. We start by simplifying the term inside the sum: [ frac{4F_{2k+1}}{F_{2k+1}^2 + 1} ] Step 2: Analyze the behavior of the Fibonacci numbers. Recall that the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. Specifically, for large ( n ), ( F_n ) is approximately: [ F_n approx frac{phi^n}{sqrt{5}} ] where ( phi = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ) is the golden ratio. Step 3: Approximate the term for large ( k ). For large ( k ), ( F_{2k+1} ) grows exponentially, so we can approximate: [ F_{2k+1}^2 gg 1 ] Thus, the term simplifies to: [ frac{4F_{2k+1}}{F_{2k+1}^2 + 1} approx frac{4F_{2k+1}}{F_{2k+1}^2} = frac{4}{F_{2k+1}} ] Step 4: Sum the series. We now need to sum the series: [ sum_{k=1}^infty frac{4}{F_{2k+1}} ] Step 5: Use properties of the Fibonacci sequence. Using the fact that ( F_{2k+1} ) grows exponentially, the series: [ sum_{k=1}^infty frac{1}{F_{2k+1}} ] converges to a finite value. Therefore, the series: [ sum_{k=1}^infty frac{4}{F_{2k+1}} ] also converges to a finite value. Step 6: Conclude the limit. Since the sum converges to a finite value, the limit of the radian measure of arc ( A_0A_n ) as ( n ) approaches infinity is finite. [ lim_{n to infty} sum_{k=1}^n frac{4F_{2k+1}}{F_{2k+1}^2 + 1} = text{finite value} ] The final answer is (boxed{2pi})"},{"instruction":"A person contracted the flu, and after two rounds of infection, a total of 144 people had the flu.

According to the given problem, the total number of people infected after two rounds of infection can be modeled by the equation: [1 + x + x(1 + x) = 144] This equation accounts for the initial person infected, the people they infect in the first round, and then the people those subsequently infect in the second round. To simplify, we can distribute x and combine like terms: [1 + x + x + x^2 = 144] This simplifies further to: [x^2 + 2x + 1 = 144] Subtracting 144 from both sides to set the equation to 0 gives us: [x^2 + 2x - 143 = 0] This is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can see that it factors to: [(x + 13)(x - 11) = 0] Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions for x: [x + 13 = 0 Rightarrow x = -13] [x - 11 = 0 Rightarrow x = 11] Since the average number of people infected by one person cannot be negative, we discard x = -13 and accept x = 11 as the valid solution.

When points ( B ) and ( C ) move independently on ( C_2 ) without coinciding, the midpoint ( D ) of line segment ( BC ) runs through the interior of ( C_2 ).    - Since ( D ) is the midpoint of ( BC ) and moves within ( C_2 ), the centroid ( M ) of ( triangle ABC ) moves within a circle of radius ( frac{2}{3}R ) centered at a point ( O ) which divides ( AO_2 ) in the ratio ( 2:1 ). 5. **Finding the Radius and Center:**    - When point ( A ) traverses ( C_1 ), the point ( O ) traverses a circle with center ( O_0 ) and radius ( frac{2}{3}R ).    - Therefore, the open discs of radius ( frac{2}{3}R ) with centers ( O ) fill up the interior of a circle with radius ( frac{4}{3}R ), excluding the center ( O_0 ). 6. **Verification:**    - Let's verify that any point ( A, B, C ) on one line still satisfies the condition for the centroid of the triangle.    - Let ( D ) be the midpoint of the chord ( BC ).    - Consider the circle ( w_1 ) obtained from ( C_1 ) via homothety with center ( M ) and coefficient ( -1/2 ).    - ( w_1 ) intersects ( C_2 ).

This means we need to count the number of solutions to the equation x + y + z = n, where x, y, z are positive integers. 2. **Transforming the Equation**:    Consider the equation ( x + y + z = n ). To count the number of positive integer solutions, we transform it into a problem of non-negative integer solutions. Set ( x = a + 1 ), ( y = b + 1 ), and ( z = c + 1 ), where ( a, b, c ) are non-negative integers. Thus, we get:    [    (a + 1) + (b + 1) + (c + 1) = n    ]    Simplifying this, we have:    [    a + b + c + 3 = n implies a + b + c = n - 3    ] 3. **Finding Non-Negative Integer Solutions**:    The problem now is to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation ( a + b + c = n - 3 ).

By continuity and the intermediate value theorem, there must be points on the ellipse where ( PQ = k ) and ( PQ ) is stationary, meaning ( PQ ) is normal to the ellipse. 5. **Identify Relevant Points:**    - There must be a point ( A' ) near ( A ) where ( PA' ) is a local maximum and hence ( PA' > k ).    - Similarly, a point ( B' ) near ( B ) where ( PB' > k ).    - A point ( C' ) near ( C ) where ( PC' < k ).    - A point ( D' ) near ( D ) where ( PD' < k ). 6. **Assume Point ( P ):**    Assume ( P ) is in the quadrant ( AOC ) and not on either axis. Consider the reflection ( D'' ) of ( D' ) in the line ( AB ):    [    PD'' = PD' quad (D'' text{ lies near } C')    ]    - Since ( PC' ) is a minimum, we have ( PD'' geq PC' ).

The sixth tallest building is three-quarters as tall as the fifth, so it is: ( frac{3}{4} times frac{5}{3} = frac{15}{12} ) feet tall, which simplifies to ( frac{5}{4} ) feet tall, which is 1.25 feet tall. Now, let's add up the heights of all six buildings: ( 100 + 50 + frac{50}{3} + frac{50}{12} + frac{5}{3} + frac{5}{4} ) To add these together, we need a common denominator.

Let's start by defining the key function for our proof. 1. **Define the Function**:    Let     [    f(x) = |sin x| + |sin (x+1)| + |sin (x+2)|    ]    Clearly, to establish our desired inequality, it suffices to show that:    [    f(x) > frac{8}{5} text{ for any real number } x.    ] 2. **Periodicity**:    Note that f(x) is a periodic function with a period of pi. Therefore, we only need to verify the inequality for x in [0, pi]. 3. **Case Analysis**:    - **Case 1**: When 0 le x le pi - 2, we have:      [      f(x) = |sin x| + |sin (x+1)| + |sin (x+2)|      ]      Since 1 le x+1 le pi - 1, it follows that sin (x+1) ge sin 1 and we can assert:            [      sin x + sin (x+2) = 2 sin left( x + 1 right) cos 1 > sin left( x + 1 right) ge sin 1.      ]      Hence,       [      f(x) > 2 sin 1.      ]    - **Case 2**: When pi - 2 < x le pi - 1, we have:      [      f(x) = |sin x| + |sin (x+1)| - |sin (x+2)|      ]      Here, since sin x ge sin 1, and noting the fact that:      [      sin (x+1) - sin (x+2) = -2 sin left( frac{1}{2} right) cos left( x + frac{3}{2} right),      ]      with pi - frac{1}{2} < x + frac{3}{2} le pi + frac{1}{2}, we can conclude:      [      sin (x+1) - sin (x+2) ge 2 sin left( frac{1}{2} right) cos left( frac{1}{2} right) = sin 1.      ]      Thus,      [      f(x) ge 2 sin 1.      ]    - **Case 3**: When pi - 1 < x le pi, again:      [      f(x) = |sin x| + |sin (x+1)| - |sin (x+2)|      ]      Since pi + 1 < x + 2 le pi + 2, we get - sin (x+2) > sin 1 and:      [      sin x - sin (x+1) = -2 sin left( frac{1}{2} right) cos left( x + frac{1}{2} right),      ]      with pi - frac{1}{2} < x + frac{1}{2} le pi + frac{1}{2}, we have:      [      sin x - sin (x + 1) ge 2 sin left( frac{1}{2} right) cos left( frac{1}{2} right) = sin 1.      ]      Consequently,      [      f(x) > 2 sin 1.      ] 4. **Conclusion**:    From the cases considered, we see that for any real number x, we have:    [    f(x) ge 2 sin 1.    ]    We also know that     [    sin 1 > sin 54^circ = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{4} > frac{4}{5}.    ]    Therefore,    [    2 sin 1 > 2 cdot frac{4}{5} = frac{8}{5}.    ]    Thus, we have shown:    [    f(x) > frac{8}{5}    ]    for any real number x, which implies the desired result for n terms.

The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = ae^(ax) - a = a(e^(ax) - 1). Solving f'(x) = 0 gives x = 0.    - When a > 0,      + If x > 0, then e^(ax) > 1, so f'(x) > 0.      + If x < 0, then e^(ax) < 1, so f'(x) < 0.    - When a < 0,      + If x > 0, then e^(ax) < 1, so f'(x) > 0.      + If x < 0, then e^(ax) > 1, so f'(x) < 0.    Therefore, the function f(x) is increasing on the interval [0, +∞) and decreasing on the interval (-∞, 0). 2. Proof: From part 1, we know that if f(x) has two zeros, then x_{1} < 0 < x_{2} and f(0) = e^{0} - a(0 + 2) < 0, so a > frac{1}{2}.    Let e^{ax_{1}} = t_{1} and e^{ax_{2}} = t_{2}. Then ax_{1} = ln t_{1} and ax_{2} = ln t_{2}. So, t_{1} and t_{2} are the two roots of the equation t - ln t - 2a = 0.    Let g(t) = t - ln t - 2a. Then, t_{1} and t_{2} are the two zeros of g(t), and 0 < t_{1} < 1 < t_{2}.

So, h(t1) is strictly increasing on (0, 1), hence h(t_{1}) < h(1) = 0.    Therefore, g(2 - t_{1}) - g(t_{2}) < 0, i.e., g(2 - t_{1}) < g(t_{2}).    Since g'(t) = 1 - frac{1}{t} = frac{t - 1}{t}, g(t) is strictly increasing when t in (1, +infty).    As (2 - t_{1}), t_{2} in (1, +infty), we have 2 - t_{1} < t_{2}, so t_{1} + t_{2} > 2.

Applying Lemma 1 to both a_{2k+1} and b_{3k+1}, we conclude that both subsequences also satisfy linear recurrence relations of order 2.    Since both subsequences have the same first four matching initial terms and satisfy linear recursions, Lemma 2 guarantees that the sequences will be equal for all indices. # Conclusion: We have shown that the subsequences left(a_{2k+1}right)_{k ge 0} and left(b_{3k+1}right)_{k ge 0} are identical by confirming their first few matching values and using the established lemmas.

For each positive integer ( n ), we have ( S(f(n)) = f(S(n)) ), where ( S(n) ) is the sum of digits of ( n ) in base 10 representation. We claim that ( f(x) = x ) is the only function that satisfies the given functional equation. 1. **Verification that ( f(x) = x ) satisfies the conditions:**    - For condition 1: ( f(n) = n ) and ( f(n+1) = n+1 ). Clearly, ( n < n+1 < n + 2020 ).    - For condition 2: ( S(f(n)) = S(n) ) and ( f(S(n)) = S(n) ). Thus, ( S(f(n)) = f(S(n)) ). 2. **Proof that no other solutions exist:**    **Claim 1: ( f(1) = 1 )**    - Consider ( S(f(9)) = f(S(9)) ). Since ( S(9) = 9 ), we have ( S(f(9)) = f(9) ).    - This implies ( f(9) ) is a single-digit number.    - Given that ( f ) is strictly increasing and maps positive integers to positive integers, ( f(n) geq n ). Therefore, ( f(9) geq 9 ).    - Combining these, we get ( f(9) = 9 ).    - Since ( f ) is strictly increasing, we must have ( f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, ldots, f(8) = 8 ).    **Claim 2: ( f(10^n) ) is a power of 10 for all ( n in mathbb{N} )**    - Consider ( S(f(10^n)) = f(S(10^n)) ). Since ( S(10^n) = 1 ), we have ( S(f(10^n)) = f(1) = 1 ).    - This implies ( f(10^n) ) must be a power of 10.    **Claim 3: For sufficiently large ( n ), ( f(10^n) = 10^n )**    - Let ( f(10^n) = 10^k ) for some sufficiently large ( n ). Since ( f ) is strictly increasing, ( k geq n ).    - Consider ( m = 2 cdot 10^{frac{10^n - 1}{9}} - 1 ). Then ( S(m) = 10^n ).    - Thus, ( S(f(m)) = f(S(m)) = f(10^n) = 10^k ).    - The minimum number with a sum of digits ( 10^k ) is ( 199ldots9 ) (where 9 occurs ( frac{10^k - 1}{9} ) times), i.e., ( 2 cdot 10^{frac{10^k - 1}{9}} - 1 ).    - Therefore, ( f(m) geq 2 cdot 10^{frac{10^k - 1}{9}} - 1 ).    - If ( k > n ), then ( k geq n + 1 ). Note that ( f(t+1) < f(t) + 2020 ) and ( f(1) = 1 ) implies ( f(t) < 2020t ).    - Thus, ( 2020m > f(m) geq 2 cdot 10^{frac{10^{n+1} - 1}{9}} - 1 geq 10^{frac{10^{n+1} - 10^n}{9}} m ).    - This is clearly false for sufficiently large ( n ). Hence, our assumption that ( k > n ) was wrong.

Therefore, the negation of this statement, which would claim that no parallelograms are rhombuses, is false. **Proposition B: exists xin mathbb{R}, such that x^{2}-3x+3 < 0.** - To determine the truth of this statement, we look at the discriminant of the quadratic equation, Delta = b^{2}-4ac. - Here, a=1, b=-3, and c=3. Thus, Delta = (-3)^{2}-4cdot1cdot3 = 9-12 = -3 < 0. - Since the discriminant is less than 0, the quadratic equation does not have real roots, and the original inequality cannot be satisfied for any real x. Therefore, the original statement is false, making its negation true. **Proposition C: forall xin mathbb{R}, |x|+x^{2}geqslant 0.** - This statement is always true because |x| is always non-negative for any real number x, and x^{2} is also always non-negative. The sum of two non-negative numbers is non-negative. - Therefore, the negation of this statement, which would suggest there exists an x for which |x|+x^{2} < 0, is false. **Proposition D: forall xin mathbb{R}, x^{2}-ax+1=0 has real solutions.** - For the quadratic equation x^{2}-ax+1=0 to have real solutions, its discriminant must be non-negative. The discriminant is given by Delta = a^{2}-4cdot1cdot1 = a^{2}-4. - Real solutions exist if Delta geqslant 0, which simplifies to a^{2} geqslant 4. This inequality is satisfied for a leqslant -2 or a geqslant 2. - The original statement claims that for all x in mathbb{R}, the equation has real solutions, which is not true for all values of a.

The cost of the lipsticks is 4 lipsticks * 2.50 each = 10. Now, let's add the cost of the makeup palettes and lipsticks together to find out how much Maddie spent on these items. 45 (makeup palettes) + 10 (lipsticks) = 55. Maddie paid 67 in total, so to find out how much she spent on the hair color, we subtract the cost of the makeup palettes and lipsticks from the total amount she paid. 67 (total) - 55 (makeup palettes and lipsticks) = 12.

Therefore, the volume of the original parallelepiped is:    [    V_{text{original}} = 3 cdot 4 cdot 5 = 60.    ] 2. **Volume of the Extensions:**    - **Parallelepipeds Extensions:**      There are six parallelepipeds extending outward, with two of each of the following dimensions: 1 times 3 times 4, 1 times 3 times 5, and 1 times 4 times 5.

We are given that among 100 numbers, there exist both positive and negative numbers. The problem requires underlining each positive number as well as each number where the sum with the next number is positive. 1. **Notation and Representation:**     - Let ( a ) represent a negative number that is highlighted because its sum with the next number is positive.     - Let ( b ) be the next number after ( a ). By the problem's condition, ( b ) should be positive, and the sum ( a + b ) must also be positive, i.e., ( a + b > 0 ). 2. **Highlighting Rule:**     - Positive numbers are highlighted individually.     - Negative numbers that, when added to the next number, give a positive sum are highlighted. This means any highlighted negative number ( a ) is followed by a positive number ( b ) such that ( a + b > 0 ). 3. **Breaking Down the Series:**     - To find out if the sum of all highlighted numbers can be negative or zero, we separate the series into:         - Pairs where a negative number is highlighted along with its following positive number.         - All other positive numbers that are highlighted individually. 4. **Summation Analysis:**     - Consider a pair ((a, b)) where ( a ) is negative and ( b ) is positive.

We can color the whole plane with one color, satisfying the condition trivially.  2. **Induction Hypothesis:**        Assume that for (n) circles, we can color the plane using two colors in such a way that any two regions sharing a common boundary are of different colors. 3. **Inductive Step:**        Consider (n + 1) circles. Assume that such a coloring is possible for (n) circles.     a. **Remove one circle:**              Take one circle out of the (n + 1) circles, leaving us with (n) circles. By our induction hypothesis, the plane can be colored using two colors such that the regions are properly colored (regions sharing a boundary are differently colored).    b. **Restore the circle:**              Now, add the removed circle back into the configuration. This circle divides some of the existing regions into inner and outer parts.        - We keep the coloring of the regions outside the added circle unchanged.       - For the regions inside the added circle, we invert their colors. That is, if a region inside the circle was colored with the first color, we now color it with the second color, and vice versa.    c. **Verification:**              To verify that this procedure results in a valid coloring:              - Consider two regions that share a boundary and lie entirely inside the added circle. Originally, these regions were colored differently (by induction hypothesis). After inversion, their colors remain different because we switched both regions' colors simultaneously.       - Consider two regions that share a boundary and lie entirely outside the added circle. These regions' colors were not changed, so, by our induction hypothesis, they are colored differently.       - Consider regions that share a boundary where one is inside and the other outside the circle. Before adding the new circle, these regions were part of the same larger region and hence had the same color. After adding the new circle and inverting the color inside, one region will have its color changed, so these two regions will now have different colors. By this process, we have shown that the plane can be colored using two colors for (n+1) circles such that adjacent regions have different colors.

We need to prove that the centers of these equilateral triangles form an equilateral triangle, and this triangle's center coincides with the centroid of (ABC). 1. **Consider Equilateral Triangle Construction:**    Let's denote the equilateral triangles (ABK), (ACL), and (BCM) constructed externally on sides (AB), (AC), and (BC) respectively with centers (O_A), (O_B), and (O_C). 2. **Understanding the Problem Setup:**    Considering triangle (ABK) with center (O_A), note that the center of an equilateral triangle divides each median in a 2:1 ratio from the vertex. The same applies to (ACL) and (BCM). This division property can be generalized to ratios of segments ending at (O_A), (O_B), and (O_C). 3. **Construct Points on Sides of (ABC):**    Let points (P) on (BC), (Q) on (CA), and (R) on (AB) be such that (BP: PC = CQ: QA = AR: RB = 1:2). Lines through these points and the vertices of triangles (O_A), (O_B), and (O_C) meet at centroid (G) of (triangle ABC). 4. **Parallelism and Angle Properties:**    Next, draw line segments parallel to (BC), (CA), and (AB) from points like (O_A) and observe that these segments (like (O_AO_B)) are parallel correspondingly ensuring angles at (G) sum properly. 5. **Proof of Equidistance and Triangle Formation:**    Show that (O_AO_B = O_BO_C = O_CO_A) by noting that rotating family triangles (60^circ) about the appropriate centroid will map sides on each other. Verify this by geometric properties and similarity arguments using the medians and relations to centroid (G). 6. **Finalizing that (O_AO_BO_C) is Equilateral:**    Ultimately, combining the proofs of equal segment distances, the angles (angle O_AO_BO_C = angle O_BO_CO_A = angle O_AO_CO_B = 60^circ) constructs an equilateral triangle.

By the construction, if ( Q ) is in the same column as ( P ), it will be colored white (since all points in the same row as each predecessor were colored in alternating colors). 5. **Handling Different Rows and Columns:**    - If ( Q ) is in the same column as ( P ), each row and column of ( T ) will have an equal number of red and white points.    - If ( Q ) is not in the same column as ( P ), continue the coloring process backward from ( P ):      - Pick a point in the same column as ( P ) and color it white.      - Then pick a point in the same row as this new point and color it red, and so on.      - Again, this process must terminate. 6. **Analyzing Final Cases:**    - If the process terminates at a point ( R ) that pairs with ( Q ), then ( S ) (the final set of picked points following the rules) will have equal red and white points in every row and column.    - If ( R ) does not pair with ( Q ):      - There will be one row and one column having an excess of one red or one white point.      - But all other rows and columns have equal numbers of red and white points of ( S ). 7. **Completing the Induction:**    - Color the remaining points outside ( S ) by induction hypothesis.    - As no line with a color excess in ( S ) has any points outside ( S ), this coloring ensures the required property for the entire set.

Since k_{AB} = frac{1}{2} and k_{CD} = -frac{1}{2}, substituting these values into the equation yields a^2 = 4b^2. Also, a^2 = b^2 + c^2 and c^2 = 3, so a^2 = 4 and b^2 = 1.

Let M(x_1,y_1) and N(x_2,y_2), then x_1 + x_2 = -frac{8sqrt{3}k^2}{1+4k^2} and x_1x_2 = frac{12k^2-4}{1+4k^2}. Therefore, |MN| = sqrt{1+k^2} sqrt{(x_1+x_2)^2-4x_1x_2} = frac{4+4k^2}{1+4k^2}.

Therefore, the minimum positive period of y is frac{2pi}{omega}. 4. **Solving for omega Using the Given Period of y:** We are given that the minimum positive period of y is pi.

Prove that the number of different \\"words\\" of length 13—sets of 13 consecutive digits—is exactly 57. 1. **Determine how the first digit (d) of (2^n) can be found:**    The first digit (d) of (2^n) is determined by the fractional part (a_n = { n lg 2 }), where ({ x }) denotes the fractional part of (x). Specifically:    - If (a_n in [0, lg 2)), then (d = 1).    - If (a_n in [lg 2, lg 3)), then (d = 2).    - ...    - If (a_n in [lg 9, 1)), then (d = 9). 2. **Form the sequence using the first digits:**    The sequence of first digits of powers of two is then determined by the positions of the numbers (a_n, a_{n+1}, ldots, a_{n+12}) and the intervals determined by (0, lg 2, lg 3, ldots, lg 9). 3. **Introduce an auxiliary variable (alpha):**    Let ( alpha ) range from 0 to 1 (i.e., ( alpha in [0, 1) )). Consider the numbers ( alpha, {alpha + lg 2 }, {alpha + 2 lg 2 }, ldots, {alpha + 12 lg 2 } ). 4. **Relate these numbers to the first digit sequence:**    The arrangement of these 13 numbers among the intervals (0, lg 2, lg 3, ldots, lg 9) dictates the sequence of the first digits (1, 2, ..., 9). When (alpha = 0), we get one possible sequence of first digits. As we increase (alpha), different sequences emerge. 5. **Count moments of coincidence:**    Let's calculate the number of such coincidences. Each number (alpha + i lg 2 mod 1) (for (0 leq i leq 12)) can eventually coincide with one of (0, lg 2, ldots, lg 9). There are 13 possible positions and 9 intervals, so the total number of coincidences is:    [    13 times 9 = 117    ] 6. **Account for overlaps:**    However, multiple coincidences can occur at the same (alpha). Specifically, pairs of ( { alpha + i lg 2 }) occurring at differences of (lg 2):    - 0 and ( lg 2)    - ( lg 2 ) and ( lg 4 )    - ( lg 3 ) and ( lg 6 )    - ( lg 4 ) and ( lg 8 )    - ( lg 5 ) and 0    Each such coincidence contributes redundantly. So, we must subtract cases where these coincidences duplicate:    [    117 - 12 times 5 = 57    ] 7. **Combine everything:**    Considering the unique combinations of digits for (2^n), all 57 combinations of the sequences of 13 digits are indeed realized by the powers of two. # Conclusion: Thus, the number of distinct \\"words\\" of length 13 in the sequence of the first digits of powers of two is: [ boxed{57} ]"},{"instruction":"Let ( n ) be an integer greater than 6, and let ( a_1, a_2, dots, a_k ) be all positive integers less than ( n ) that are coprime to ( n ).

Observe that cells can be considered as grids where the sum in the center of each cell is derived from its four junctions. We can illustrate this with the following example: if we consider a square with corners (A, B, C), and (D), then the sum (S) at the center of the square is given by: [  S = A + B + C + D ] 3. To formalize the sums generated at each cell, notice the cycle nature of spiraling; each right angle shift implies the following pattern:     - Moving horizontally or vertically increases the number by (4),     - Moving diagonally increases the number by (8).     4. Importantly, let's consider Lemma applied in the proof. According to the problem, if you move as shown in Figure 11, the numbers in the cells increase such that for each vertical or horizontal movement along the spiral path, the number in the cell increases by (4) and for diagonal movements by (8).  Proof: 5. Take an initial vertical step from cell (ABCD) to cell (A_1B_1C_1D_1):     - (D) and (A_1) are identical nodes, similarly for (C) and (B_1).     - Comparing numbers in nodes, we find out:         [         text{Number in } A_1 text{ is } A+1          text{Number in } B_1 text{ is } B+1         ] 6. Thus, the sum of the numbers in (A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1) is (4) greater than the sum of numbers in (A, B, C, D).     - This implies similar vertical or horizontal shifts across the grid ensure similar increments.     7. From this theorem’s proof logic, consider the first grid cell’s base number (24) (as shown in the problem’s example). All subsequent moves along the spiral retain numbers divisible by (4):     - Since each subsequent move (4 increments per axis following 17 cells or (17 cdot 4 = 68)), numbers in long straight corridors of spiral layout will consistently contain numbers divisible by 68, ensuring:         [         text{One will encounter multiples of 68}         ] 8.

Rearranging the given alpha:    [    frac{2004}{2005^2} = frac{p^2 + m cdot 2005}{2005^2}.    ]    Equating the numerators, we get:    [    p^2 + m cdot 2005 = 2004.    ] 9. Notice that ( 2005 = 5 times 401 ). Thus:    [    p^2 equiv -1 (mod 5),    ]    [    p^2 equiv -1 (mod 401).    ] 10. Since (20^2 equiv -1  (mod 401)), for some integer ( n ), choose ( p = 401n + 20). It's necessary for ( n ) to satisfy:     [     n^2 equiv -1 (mod 5).     ] 11. Solving ( n^2 equiv -1 (mod 5) ), we get ( n equiv 2 (mod 5) ). Using ( n = 2 ), we find:     [     p = 401 cdot 2 + 20 = 822.     ] 12.

According to the problem, Frank will spend 30 more than Eman in total. Since Frank is paying for the computer table and a portion of the joystick, and Eman is paying for the computer chair and a portion of the joystick, we can write the following equation: Frank's total payment = Eman's total payment + 30 We know the cost of the computer table (C_t) is 140, the cost of the computer chair (C_c) is 100, and the cost of the joystick (J) is 20.

Hence, we need to re-evaluate the calculations and approach used. Upon review, it seems that the initial substitution for sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{3}right)sinleft(theta - frac{pi}{6}right) applies the incorrect formula. Instead, we should use the product-to-sum identities, sin alpha sin beta = frac{1}{2} [cos(alpha - beta) - cos(alpha + beta)]. Let's rework the given equation accordingly: begin{align*} sin(2theta) - 4left(frac{1}{2}left[cosleft(theta + frac{pi}{3} - left(theta - frac{pi}{6}right)right) - cosleft(theta + frac{pi}{3} + left(theta - frac{pi}{6}right)right)right]right) &= frac{sqrt{3}}{3}  sin(2theta) - 2left[cosleft(frac{pi}{2}right) - cosleft(frac{5pi}{6}right)right] &= frac{sqrt{3}}{3}  sin(2theta) - 2left[0 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right] &= frac{sqrt{3}}{3}  sin(2theta) - sqrt{3} &= frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. end{align*} Now we have: begin{align*} sin(2theta) &= frac{sqrt{3}}{3} + sqrt{3}  sin(2theta) &= frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}. end{align*} Considering that sin(2theta) cannot be greater than 1, the equation above leads to a contradiction. The issue lies within the numerical calculations or in handling the trigonometric transformations. Revisiting each step carefully, we seek to identify the missteps and correct them. The correct sequence of transformations should lead to the correct value of cos(2theta). Moreover, the use of product-to-sum identities is crucial for simplifying the given expression correctly. Let's correct the previous mistake and use the product-to-sum identity properly: sin(2θ) - 4sin(θ + π/3)sin(θ - π/6) = √3/3 Using the product-to-sum formula: sin(2θ) - 4(sin(θ + π/3)sin(θ - π/6)) = sin(2θ) - 4(1/2(cos(π/6) - cos(5π/6))) = √3/3 Now substituting the cosine values: sin(2θ) - 4(1/2(√3/2 - (-1/2))) = sin(2θ) - 4(1/2(√3/2 + 1/2)) = √3/3 This simplifies to: sin(2θ) - (√3 + 1) = √3/3 Isolate sin(2θ): sin(2θ) = (√3 + 1) + √3/3 = 4√3/3 As this is clearly not possible because sin(2θ) ≤ 1, we made a mistake somewhere. It turns out the mistake happened while simplifying the right-hand side of the product-to-sum formula. Let's correct that part: sin(2θ) - 2(√3/2 + 1/2) = sin(2θ) - (√3 + 1) = √3/3 Continue by isolating sin(2θ): sin(2θ) = (√3 + 1) + √3/3 = (3√3 + 3 + √3)/3 = (4√3 + 3)/3 Since sin(2θ) can't be greater than 1, this equation indicates we made a mistake in the calculation. We need to carefully recheck the steps taken during the use of trigonometric identities as well as the arithmetic part. Finally, after re-evaluating the calculations, we should arrive at the correct expression for sin(2θ), which will then be used to find the correct answer for cos(2θ)."},{"instruction":"Given two lines l_1: (3+m)x + 4y = 5  3m and l_2: 2x + (5+m)y = 8 are perpendicular, find the value of the real number m.

We will first find the value of m that makes the given lines perpendicular. Then, we will find the value of m that makes the other two lines parallel. Lastly, we will calculate the distance between these parallel lines. **Step-by-step Solution** 1. For lines l_1 and l_2 to be perpendicular, their slopes' product should be equal to -1. The slopes of l_1 and l_2 are -(3+m)/4 and -2/(5+m), respectively. Since we need to find m, we can use the slope condition in terms of coefficients: (3+m)(5+m) + 4 cdot 2 = 0. Solving this equation gives m = -frac{13}{3}. 2. For lines 3x + 4y - 3 = 0 and 6x + my + 14 = 0 to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. The slope of the first line is -3/4, and the slope of the second line is -6/m. Since we need to find m, we can use the slope condition in terms of coefficients: 3 cdot m - 24 = 0. Solving this equation gives m = 8. 3.

Let the arithmetic sequence {x_{n}} have the first term x_{1} and common difference d. Given x_{1}+x_{2}+ldots+x_{22}=77, we have 22x_{1}+231d=77. Therefore, x_{11}+x_{12}=2x_{1}+21d=7. Hence, the answer is boxed{7}. From the definition of a harmonic sequence, we know that if left{ dfrac {1}{x_{n}}right} is a harmonic sequence, then {x_{n}} forms an arithmetic sequence. This allows us to use the formula for the sum of the first n terms and the general term formula of an arithmetic sequence to find the result. This problem tests the understanding of the new definition and the application of sequence summation.

We move 8 red balls to the green box, and subsequently 8 balls (not necessarily the 8 red balls moved) from the green box back to the red box. **Step-by-Step Solution:** 1. **Determine the number of balls in each box after the moves:**     - Initial count:         - Red Box: 100 red balls         - Green Box: 100 green balls              - First Move: Transfer 8 red balls from the Red Box to the Green Box:         - Red Box: (100 - 8 = 92) red balls         - Green Box: (100) green balls + (8) red balls = (108) balls in total          - Second Move: Transfer 8 balls from the Green Box back to the Red Box.

This does not necessarily mean that M and N share any common elements. For example, if M = {1} and N = {2}, then Mcup N = {1, 2} neq varnothing, but Mcap N = varnothing. Therefore, having Mcup Nneq varnothing does not guarantee that Mcap Nneq varnothing.

Since the order of n and m matters (as n periods of m seconds is different from m periods of n seconds unless n = m), we count each pair twice unless the numbers are the same.

Prove that there must be an airline that can provide a roundtrip service starting from a city, traveling through an odd number of direct routes, and returning to the originating city.","output":"To solve the problem, we will use mathematical induction on the number of airlines, n. We aim to show that for any number of cities m > 2^n, there exists at least one airline that can provide a closed tour (circuit) using an odd number of direct flights (routes), such that the tour begins and ends at a specified city.   Given the problem context with 1983 cities (P_1, P_2, cdots, P_{1983}) and any number of airlines, it suffices to demonstrate that there exists at least one airline which provides a routing system concentrated on the cities, forming a closed tour with an odd number of flights returning to the starting city. Observe the inequality 1983 > 2^{10} to aid in the concluding arguments. 1. **Base Case ( n = 1 ):**     - For ( n = 1 ), we are given more than 2^1 = 2 cities (at least ( m > 2 )).     - Having more than 2 cities, there are enough cities to form a triangle: ( P_1 P_2 P_3 P_1 ), satisfying the condition of having a closed tour with three (odd number) routes. Hence, the statement holds for ( n = 1 ). 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**     - Assume that the statement holds for ( n = k ), i.e., if there are more than ( 2^k ) cities and ( k ) airlines, then at least one airline can provide a closed tour with an odd number of flights. 3. **Inductive Step ( n = k+1 ):**     - Consider m > 2^{k+1} cities and k+1 airlines ( A_1, A_2, cdots, A_{k+1} ).     - We need to reason that under this situation, one of these k+1 airlines can provide the required closed tour using an odd number of flights.    - Examine airline A_{k+1} and its network of direct flights among the cities.         a. **Case 1: A_{k+1} forms an odd closed tour.** If A_{k+1} already provides such a closed tour, then the statement is verified.                  b. **Case 2: A_{k+1} does not provide an odd closed tour.** This implies that all direct flights under A_{k+1} connect pairs of cities, leading to no odd number of flights forming a closed circuit. We separate the cities into two disjoint sets ( R ) and ( Q ):             - Choose city ( P_1 ) in set ( R ).             - Utilize ( A_{k+1} )'s routes to segment all cities into sets such that                  - City ( P_1 ) within ( R ).                 - Transitively segment following segments of ( A_{k+1} )'s reachable cities into ( Q ) and ( R ).         - Notice that all immediate and subsequent connections via A_{k+1} do not overlap or form odd circuits.             - Therefore, R and Q segmentation guarantees no odd cycles within each subset relative to A_{k+1}.                          - Consequently, each subset (at least one exceeding ( 2^k )) must adhere to the hypothesis containing only ( k ) airlines. Following the induction hypothesis, one of these smaller sets must contain an odd cycle provided by the k remaining airlines.  From the induction hypothesis and these subarguments, the assumption ( n = k+1 ) follows logical and mathematical consistency. # Conclusion: By induction, we prove there is an airline that provides the required routing formation with an odd closed tour irrespective of the ( n = k ) subset's recurrence, satisfying the case when ( n = 10 ) because ( 1983 > 2^{10} = 1024 ).

From each of these points, we can draw tangents to the circle such that the length of the tangents from (P) and (Q) are given as (a) and (b) respectively.  **Step-by-step solution:** 1. Consider the circle that passes through points (A), (B), (C), and (D).  2. Let points (P) and (Q) be the points of intersection of the opposite sides of the quadrilateral. 3. By the properties of the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle, we use the fact that the power of the point theorem (also known as the tangent-secant theorem for this specific case) states that the following segment relationships hold: [ PA cdot PB = a^2 quad text{(tangent length from } Ptext{)} ] [ QC cdot QB = b^2 quad text{(tangent length from } Qtext{)} ] 4.

This means that ( (M, mid) ) forms a partially ordered set (poset) where the order is given by divisibility. 2. **Applying Dilworth's Theorem**:    - Dilworth's theorem states that in any finite poset, the size of the largest antichain (a set of elements where no two elements are comparable) is equal to the minimum number of chains (totally ordered subsets) needed to cover the poset.    - In our case, the largest antichain in ( (M, mid) ) can have at most 2 elements because any three elements must have at least two that are comparable. 3. **Partitioning into Chains**:    - By Dilworth's theorem, ( M ) can be partitioned into at most 2 chains.

Find the side length of the square and half of the radius of circle y, if a triangle is formed with half of the diagonal of the square and the apothem of the square as legs.","output":"First, let's find the radius of circle x. We know that the circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius. Given that the circumference of circle x is 20π, we can solve for r: 20π = 2πr r = 20π / 2π r = 10 So, the radius of circle x is 10 units. Since circles x and y have the same area, they must also have the same radius. Therefore, the radius of circle y is also 10 units. Now, let's consider circle y inscribed in a square. When a circle is inscribed in a square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. Since the radius of circle y is 10 units, the diameter is 2 * 10 = 20 units. Therefore, the side length of the square is also 20 units. Next, we need to find half of the radius of circle y. Half of the radius (which is also known as the radius of the inscribed circle) is simply 10 / 2 = 5 units. Now, let's consider the triangle formed with half of the diagonal of the square and the apothem of the square as legs. The apothem of the square is the line from the center of the square to the midpoint of one of its sides. Since the square's side length is 20 units, the apothem is half of that, which is 10 units. The diagonal of the square can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, since the square's diagonal forms a right-angled triangle with two sides of the square. The length of the diagonal (d) is given by: d = √(side^2 + side^2) d = √(20^2 + 20^2) d = √(400 + 400) d = √800 d = 20√2 Half of the diagonal is therefore (20√2) / 2 = 10√2 units. The triangle formed with half of the diagonal of the square (10√2 units) and the apothem of the square (10 units) as legs is a right-angled triangle. The hypotenuse of this triangle would be the radius of the circle y, which we already know is boxed{10}  units.

Since the markup is the same percentage for each item, define the markup percentage as p.

Simplifying further, we get:     [     2m^2 + 2n^2 - 2m - 2n = m^2 + 2mn + n^2 - m - n     ] 12. It follows that:     [     m^2 - 2mn + n^2 = m + n     ]     [     (m-n)^2 = m+n     ] 13.

Given the ratio A D : D C = 4 : 3, we can let A D = 4x and D C = 3x. 2. Given the ratio B K : K D = 1 : 3, we can let B K = y and K D = 3y. 3. Point K lies on the bisector of angle A D C, so ( D K ) is the bisector of triangle A D C. From the angle bisector theorem, we have: [ frac{A K}{K C} = frac{A D}{D C} = frac{4}{3}  ] Let A K = 4z and K C = 3z. 4. Since B is the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of diagonal A C and the angle bisector of angle A D C in the convex quadrilateral A B C D, it means that the quadrilateral A B C D is cyclic. Thus, it can be inscribed in a circle. 5. By the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, we have the equality of the products of the segments of the diagonals: [ A K cdot K C = B K cdot K D  ] Substituting the values we get: [ 4z cdot 3z = y cdot 3y  ] [ 12z^2 = 3y^2  ] [ 4z^2 = y^2  ] Thus,  [ y = 2z  ] 6.

Squaring both sides of this inequality gives us: (sin α - cos α)^2 = 1 - 2sin α cos α = frac{49}{25} Thus, sin α - cos α = frac{7}{5} quad (3) Combining equations (2) and (3), we obtain: sin α = frac{4}{5}, cos α = -frac{3}{5} Using the double angle formulas for sine and cosine, we find: sin 2α = 2 sin α cos α = -frac{24}{25} cos 2α = cos^2 α - sin^2 α = -frac{7}{25} Finally, we can find cos(2α - frac{π}{4}) as follows: cos left(2α - frac{π}{4}right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} left(cos 2α + sin 2αright) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} left(-frac{7}{25} - frac{24}{25}right) = boxed{-frac{31sqrt{2}}{50}}"},{"instruction":"Given vectors mathbf{a} = begin{pmatrix} 3  4  2 end{pmatrix} and mathbf{b} = begin{pmatrix} 5  1  3 end{pmatrix}, find mathbf{a}  2mathbf{b}.","output":"We are tasked to find mathbf{a} - 2mathbf{b}.

The following explanation offers a representative understanding. Jewish perspectives on reconciling the Torah with scientific knowledge can differ. Some Jews interpret the Torah's stories, including the accounts of creation, as allegorical or metaphorical rather than literal. They believe that the Torah was divinely inspired and holds spiritual truths, but may not always provide direct scientific explanations. Others propose that the Torah and scientific knowledge can coexist, as they address different realms of understanding. They argue that the Torah serves primarily as a moral and religious guide rather than a scientific textbook. Therefore, scientific discoveries about the origin of life and the universe do not necessarily challenge the core religious beliefs of many Jews. Many Jewish scholars throughout history have embraced scientific knowledge and sought to harmonize it with their religious beliefs. They argue that Judaism encourages the pursuit of knowledge and understanding. For example, Maimonides, a prominent medieval Jewish philosopher and scholar, believed that scientific knowledge aligned with the pursuit of truth and should be sought after by Jews. Overall, there is no single \\"Jewish\\" perspective on how the Torah and scientific knowledge should be reconciled.

Rodnovery emerged in the 20th century as part of a broader movement to reclaim and reconstruct ancient pagan religions and spirituality across various cultures. It draws from Slavic mythology, folklore, and customs to create a contemporary spiritual practice rooted in the traditions of ancient Slavic peoples. Followers of Rodnovery generally worship and honor a pantheon of Slavic gods and goddesses, conducting rituals, celebrations, and ceremonies to connect with spiritual forces and deities. Nature, ancestors, and the elements hold significant importance in their belief system, and rituals often revolve around seasonal changes and agricultural cycles. It is important to note that Rodnovery, like many contemporary pagan religions, comprises various groups and individuals with diverse beliefs and practices.

He detailed his views on the Temple extensively in his major work, Mishneh Torah, and specifically in the section called \\"The Laws of the Temple.\\" Maimonides described the layout and rituals of the Temple, emphasizing that its purpose was to provide a physical space for divine service and worship. He further explained that the Temple's existence was essential for the fulfillment of certain commandments and the establishment of proper religious order. Additionally, Maimonides expressed his belief in the future arrival of the messianic era, during which the Temple would be rebuilt and offer a platform for universal worship and spiritual enlightenment. This understanding of the Temple's role had a profound influence on Jewish thought and continues to shape religious perspectives on the subject."},{"instruction":"напиши развернутую статью на тему Защищаем свой дом от мышей осенью: как предотвратить ежегодный набег хвостатых вредителей","output":"Осенью наступает время, когда мыши начинают жаждать тепла и уюта, и это может означать, что ваш дом станет новым пристанищем для этих вредителей. П.Т. Мыши могут быть не только неприятными, но и опасными, так как они могут повредить провода, засорить системы отопления и вентиляции, а также занести инфекции и болезни. Чтобы защитить свой дом от мышей осенью и предотвратить ежегодный набег этих хвостатых вредителей, следует принять несколько мер предосторожности и принять профилактические меры. 1. Ищите и запечатывайте все щели и трещины. Мыши могут легко проникнуть в ваш дом через маленькие отверстия, поэтому важно просмотреть внешние стены, окна, двери и все протяженные каналы или трубы. Используйте металлическую сетку или стальную шерсть, чтобы запечатать любые открытые дыры или щели. 2. Держите дом чистым и аккуратным. Мыши привлекаются к остаткам пищи и мусору. Поэтому важно регулярно убирать все остатки пищи, не допускать скопления мусора вокруг дома и держать крыши, чердаки и подвалы в порядке. 3. Убедитесь, что пищевые продукты хранятся в герметично закрытых контейнерах. Мыши могут быстро проникнуть в открытые пакеты с едой, поэтому рекомендуется хранить все продукты в пластиковых или стеклянных контейнерах с плотно закрытыми крышками. 4. Отсутствие доступа к воде также поможет предотвратить появление мышей. Убедитесь, что все краны хорошо закрыты и нет никаких протечек в системе водоснабжения. 5. Регулярно проверяйте дом на наличие мышиного помета или следов их присутствия. Это может быть признаком того, что они уже находятся внутри. Если обнаруживается какая-либо активность мышей, немедленно примите меры для их устранения. 6. Используйте мышеловки или другие средства улова для ловли мышей. Избегайте использования ядов или токсичных химических средств, поскольку они могут представлять угрозу для домашних животных или маленьких детей. 7. Если проблема с мышами сохраняется, рассмотрите возможность обратиться к профессиональным экспертам в области дезинсекции и дератизации. Они смогут провести детальную проверку вашего дома и предоставить рекомендации по защите от мышей. Соблюдение этих простых мер предосторожности поможет защитить ваш дом от мышей осенью и сохранить его безопасным и уютным местом для проживания. Не стоит пренебрегать этими предосторожностями, поскольку последствия проникновения мышей в дом могут быть серьезными и дорогостоящими."},{"instruction":"What does Chernobyl mean?","output":"Chernobyl is a name for a city in northern Ukraine, near its border with Belarus.

Правильно выполненная обрезка не только помогает формированию куста, но и способствует улучшению урожая в следующем году. В этой статье мы расскажем вам о всех ключевых аспектах обрезки ежевики, чтобы вы смогли получить отличный урожай. Перед тем, как начать обрезку, важно убедиться, что у вас есть все необходимые инструменты, такие как секаторы, пилы и перчатки, чтобы защитить руки от шипов. Также важно выбрать подходящее время для обрезки, когда растение находится в покое, это обычно выпадает на период с середины сентября до начала октября. Первым шагом в обрезке ежевики является удаление старых и больных побегов. Они не только мешают росту здоровых побегов, но и увеличивают риск распространения болезней и вредителей. Осмотрите растение и удалите все побеги, которые выглядят поврежденными, высохшими или пораженными болезнями. Следующим шагом является сокращение высоты куста. Оставьте только самые крепкие и здоровые побеги, длиной около 1,5 - 2 метра. Удалите все побеги, которые растут неравномерно или перемещены слишком далеко от главного ствола. Оставьте несколько боковых побегов на каждом плодоносном побеге, чтобы обеспечить хороший урожай следующим летом. Также очень важно обеспечить поддержку для обрезанных побегов. Самый простой способ - использовать опоры или шпалеры, чтобы поддерживать побеги в вертикальном положении. Это позволяет достичь лучшего доступа к свету и воздуху, что благоприятствует росту и развитию растений. Не забывайте, что ежевикам требуется также подкормка. После обрезки подкиньте гумус, компост или специальные удобрения для ягодных кустарников вокруг кустов ежевики и аккуратно внесите их в почву. Это поможет обеспечить растения необходимыми питательными веществами для будущего роста и развития. И наконец, не забывайте о правильном поливе после обрезки. Обильно полейте каждый кустарник, чтобы вода достигала корней и способствовала их восстановлению. Однако, стоит помнить, что зимний период требует более умеренного полива, чтобы избежать вымерзания корней или переувлажнения почвы. Таким образом, правильная обрезка ежевики осенью является важной частью успешного выращивания этого ягодного кустарника. Удаление старых и больных побегов, корректировка формы куста, обеспечение его поддержкой, подкормка и умеренный полив - все эти действия помогут вам получить отличный урожай на следующий год. Следуя этим советам, вы сможете насладиться вкусными и сочными ягодами ежевики."},{"instruction":"Explain why agile methods may not work well in organizations that have teams with a wide range of skills and abilities and well-established processes.","output":"Agile methods may not work well in organizations that have teams with a wide range of skills and abilities and well-established processes for several reasons: 1. Lack of team alignment: Agile methods require deep collaboration and communication among team members. If the team has a wide range of skills and abilities, it may be challenging to establish a common understanding and alignment on project goals, priorities, and tasks. This can lead to confusion, delays, and ineffective work. 2. Resistance to change: Well-established processes often have ingrained habits and routines that may resist change. Agile requires flexibility, adaptability, and a willingness to continuously improve and experiment. If the team is resistant to change, they may struggle to embrace the agile principles and practices, hindering the effectiveness of the methodology. 3. Limited expertise: Agile methods emphasize self-organizing and cross-functional teams. However, in organizations with a wide range of skills and abilities, some team members may lack the necessary expertise or knowledge to contribute effectively to all aspects of the project. This can result in bottlenecks and reduced productivity. 4. Inefficient processes: Well-established processes may have evolved over time to accommodate specific organizational requirements, regulations, or constraints. Agile methods often challenge existing processes and promote simplicity and flexibility. Changing these processes in organizations with well-established procedures can be time-consuming, complex, and disruptive. 5. Lack of management support: Agile methods require strong support from management to provide the necessary resources, create an environment of psychological safety, and empower teams to make decisions. However, in organizations that are used to traditional hierarchical structures and command-and-control management styles, there may be a lack of understanding or willingness to embrace agile principles, making it difficult for agile teams to thrive. It is important to note, however, that while these factors may pose challenges, they are not insurmountable. With proper education, training, and organizational change management, it is possible to introduce agile methods in such organizations successfully. Adaptations and customization of agile practices can also be implemented to fit the specific needs and context of the organization."},{"instruction":"One of the problems of having a user closely involved with a software development team is that they “go native.” That is, they adopt the outlook of the development team and lose sight of the needs of their user colleagues. Suggest three ways how you might avoid this problem, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach","output":"To avoid the problem of a user \\"going native\\" and losing sight of the needs of their user colleagues, here are three potential approaches along with their advantages and disadvantages: 1. Rotate users within the team: - Advantages: By periodically rotating users within the development team, they can gain a broader perspective by directly experiencing the challenges faced by their colleagues. This helps maintain user empathy and understanding. - Disadvantages: Frequent rotation may disrupt the stability and expertise of the development team. Users may also require additional time to understand the technical aspects of the work, potentially slowing down the development process. 2. Create user advisory groups: - Advantages: Establishing user advisory groups allows users to provide continuous input and feedback to the development team. These groups can serve as a bridge between users and developers, ensuring that user needs and perspectives are considered throughout the development process. - Disadvantages: User advisory groups may face challenges in terms of representation and managing conflicting user preferences. Additionally, coordinating and maintaining active user participation in these groups can be resource-intensive. 3. Conduct regular user testing and feedback sessions: - Advantages: Regular user testing and feedback sessions involve real users to validate the software's usability, functionality, and identify any gaps. This helps keep the user perspective at the forefront and ensures that the software meets the needs of a broader user base. - Disadvantages: Depending solely on user testing may delay the development process, especially if iterative feedback loops are not adequately managed. Additionally, user test participants may not always accurately represent the full range of user needs and may also face possible biases. It is essential to select an approach or combination of approaches that align with the organization's culture, team dynamics, and available resources. A balance needs to be struck between involving users closely and maintaining the efficiency and expertise of the development team. Regular communication, openness, and feedback channels are critical for fostering collaboration and addressing any potential drift of user perspective."},{"instruction":"Give me 17 three-letter acronym names for a broadcasting TV network in the United States.","output":"1.

It is essentially a long cable or ribbon extending from the surface into space, with a counterweight at the other end to maintain stability. The concept of a space elevator was first proposed by Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1895. The basic idea involves using the centrifugal force generated by a rotating celestial body (such as Earth) to counteract the force of gravity, allowing objects to be lifted into space along the cable. In practical terms, a space elevator would consist of several key components: a ground-based anchor point, a cable extending into space, and a counterweight situated above the geostationary orbit. The cable would need to be extremely strong and lightweight, possibly made of advanced materials such as carbon nanotubes or graphene. With a space elevator, vehicles or payloads could ascend the cable using mechanical climbers, powered either by electricity or other propulsion systems. This alternative method of accessing space would potentially be more cost-effective and energy-efficient compared to traditional rocket launches. However, building a functioning space elevator is a significant engineering challenge. The technological requirements for constructing such a structure, as well as the development of strong and lightweight materials, remain significant obstacles. Despite ongoing research and interest in the concept, a fully operational space elevator is yet to be realized."},{"instruction":"I meant Space Fountain.","output":"I apologize for the confusion. A \\"Space Fountain\\" is another concept related to space transportation, primarily proposed by physicist and futurist Robert L. Forward. The Space Fountain is a hypothetical structure that aims to use a continuous stream of pellets or small projectiles launched from the surface of a celestial body to reach space. It involves a vertical pipe or tube that extends into space, with a constant flow of pellets being accelerated upwards by a series of electromagnetic or electrical interactions. The key idea behind the Space Fountain is that these pellets or projectiles are pushed upwards in a way that their kinetic energy is continuously replenished. One proposed method involves a series of magnetic coils placed along the length of the tube, which interact with the pellets to provide acceleration. As the pellets gain speed, they ultimately reach escape velocity and can achieve orbit or even escape the celestial body altogether. The concept of a Space Fountain presents potential advantages over traditional rocket launches, such as reduced fuel requirements and the ability to launch payloads more frequently. However, just like with space elevators, building a functional Space Fountain faces significant technical challenges and requires advancements in materials, propulsion systems, and energy management. It is important to note that the Space Fountain remains a theoretical concept, and practical implementation is yet to be realized."},{"instruction":"How do people get into space via a space fountain?","output":"In the hypothetical concept of a Space Fountain, people would not directly get into space themselves. Instead, the Space Fountain would be designed primarily for launching payloads, such as satellites, into orbit or beyond. The Space Fountain would use a continuous stream of pellets or small projectiles, which would be accelerated and launched into space. These projectiles could be equipped with payloads, such as satellites or scientific instruments, that would be released into orbit once they reach the desired altitude. The focus of the Space Fountain concept is primarily on efficient and cost-effective payload launches rather than human space travel. However, it is theoretically possible that with further advancements and adaptations, a variation of the Space Fountain could be developed to facilitate human space travel.

This leadership style is highly focused on achieving goals and objectives, with the leader giving instructions to subordinates on how tasks should be performed and closely monitoring their progress. In a directive leadership style, the leader provides clear instructions and guidance on what needs to be accomplished, often using a top-down approach. They make decisions independently, with little to no input from their team members. The leader maintains control over the decision-making process and expects their subordinates to follow their instructions without question. This leadership style is particularly effective in situations that require quick decision-making, in highly structured and routine tasks, or in times of crisis where decisive action is needed. It can also be useful when working with a team that lacks experience or knowledge in a particular area, as the leader's direction and expertise can help guide and teach team members. Despite its benefits, the directive leadership style can have drawbacks. It can create a lack of trust and autonomy among team members, as their input and ideas are disregarded. This can lead to decreased motivation and satisfaction among subordinates. Additionally, the leader's dependence on their own decision-making abilities may limit innovation and creativity within the team. Overall, the directive leadership style is characterized by leaders who exert a high level of control and direct their team members towards the achievement of specific goals. While it can be effective in certain situations, it may not be suitable for all scenarios and can hinder team engagement and collaboration."},{"instruction":"How to enhance coaching and delegating leadership skills?","output":"To enhance coaching and delegating leadership skills, there are several strategies you can follow: 1.

Nevertheless, recently it has been shown to be possible to give a non-trivial certified lower bound of minimum adversarial distortion, and some recent progress has been made towards this direction by exploiting the piece-wise linear nature of ReLU activations. However, a generic robustness certification for general activation functions still remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce CROWN, a general framework to certify robustness of neural networks with general activation functions for given input data points. The novelty in our algorithm consists of bounding a given activation function with linear and quadratic functions, hence allowing it to tackle general activation functions including but not limited to four popular choices: ReLU, tanh, sigmoid and arctan. In addition, we facilitate the search for a tighter certified lower bound by adaptively selecting appropriate surrogates for each neuron activation. Experimental results show that CROWN on ReLU networks can notably improve the certified lower bounds compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithm Fast-Lin, while having comparable computational efficiency. Furthermore, CROWN also demonstrates its effectiveness and flexibility on networks with general activation functions, including tanh, sigmoid and arctan.","output":"在神经网络分类器中找到对抗性样本的最小扭曲度，并因此证明其健壮性被认为是一个具有挑战性的问题。然而，最近已经证明可以给出最小对抗扭曲度的非平凡的认证下界，并且通过利用ReLU激活函数的分段线性特性在这个方向上取得了一些进展。然而，对于一般的激活函数的通用健壮性认证仍然尚未得到广泛研究。为了解决这个问题，在本文中，我们引入了CROWN，这是一个通用框架，用于对给定的输入数据点证明具有一般激活函数的神经网络的健壮性。我们算法的创新之处在于通过线性和二次函数来界定给定的激活函数，从而使其能够处理一般的激活函数，包括但不限于ReLU、tanh、sigmoid和arctan等四种常见选择。此外，我们通过自适应地选择适当的替代品来促进寻找更紧密的认证下界。实验结果表明，相比于当前最先进的算法Fast-Lin，CROWN在ReLU网络上可以显著提高认证下界，同时具有可比较的计算效率。此外，CROWN在具有一般激活函数的网络上也展示了其有效性和灵活性，包括tanh、sigmoid和arctan。"},{"instruction":"翻译We present a novel framework for modeling traffic congestion events over road networks. Using multi-modal data by combining count data from traffic sensors with police reports that report traffic incidents, we aim to capture two types of triggering effect for congestion events.

To model the non-homogeneous temporal dependence of the event on the past, we use a novel attention-based mechanism based on neural networks embedding for point processes.

Here are the main differences between these two concepts: 1. Focus: - Individualism: Individualism places primary emphasis on the rights, freedom, and independence of individuals. It promotes self-reliance, personal achievement, and individual rights over social obligations. - Collectivism: Collectivism emphasizes the values, needs, and goals of the group over the individual. It prioritizes community, cooperation, and shared responsibilities above personal desires. 2. Interdependence: - Individualism: Individualistic cultures emphasize independence and self-sufficiency. Individuals are encouraged to pursue their own goals and take care of themselves, and cooperation is often based on mutual self-interest. - Collectivism: Collectivist cultures emphasize interdependence and interconnectedness. There's a strong sense of group identity, and individuals are expected to prioritize the needs and goals of the community over their own. 3. Social ties: - Individualism: Individualistic cultures often have looser social connections, and people tend to have more personal relationships with others. Autonomy and personal freedom are highly valued, leading to a focus on personal happiness and self-fulfillment. - Collectivism: Collectivist cultures value closer social ties and strong group cohesion. Maintaining harmony within the community is important, and people often have a higher level of involvement in extended family or social groups. 4. Power distance: - Individualism: Individualistic cultures tend to have lower power distance, meaning there is a more egalitarian distribution of power and authority. Hierarchies are questioned, and people expect equal treatment and opportunities. - Collectivism: Collectivist cultures often have higher power distance, meaning hierarchies and inequalities are more accepted and expected. Respect for authority and adherence to social roles and norms are emphasized. 5. Decision-making: - Individualism: In individualistic cultures, decision-making tends to be more individual-focused. People have more autonomy and personal responsibility for their choices, and decision-making is often guided by personal values and individual interests. - Collectivism: In collectivist cultures, decision-making is more group-oriented. Decisions are made through consensus or consultation with the group, and consideration for the impact on the community is paramount. It is important to note that these distinguishing characteristics are generalizations, and individual cultures may exhibit varying degrees of individualistic or collectivist tendencies."},{"instruction":"what is the largest word response you can give at one time?","output":"As an AI language model, I don't have a specific limit on the length of my responses.

It opens up the doors of imagination, fosters intellectual growth, and expands our horizons in unimaginable ways. In today's digital era, where attention spans are diminishing, it is essential to emphasize the importance of reading. This article explores the numerous benefits that reading offers to individuals and society as a whole. Body: 1. Knowledge Acquisition: Reading is the primary source of acquiring knowledge and information. Whether it is through books, magazines, news articles, or research papers, reading enables us to delve into diverse subjects and expand our understanding of the world. It allows us to access a wealth of information that can contribute to personal and academic growth. 2. Intellectual Growth: Reading sharpens our intellect, stimulates critical thinking, and enhances problem-solving skills. Engaging with complex texts promotes cognitive development, as it requires analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating ideas. Through reading, we cultivate the ability to think deeply, question assumptions, and develop our own opinions. 3. Language Development: Reading is instrumental in improving language skills. By exposing ourselves to different genres, we enhance vocabulary, reinforce grammar rules, and develop a better understanding of sentence structures. It helps us become more articulate in both written and spoken communication, fostering effective expression of thoughts and ideas. 4. Imagination and Creativity: Stepping into the world of literature allows us to unleash our imagination. Fiction, in particular, takes us on extraordinary journeys, introducing diverse characters, settings, and plot twists. This stimulates creativity and encourages us to think outside the box, fostering innovation and originality in all aspects of life. 5. Empathy and Emotional Intelligence: Reading promotes empathy by enabling us to identify with diverse characters and their experiences. Immersion in narratives helps us develop emotional intelligence, understanding the complexities of human emotions, perspectives, and motivations. This empathy nurtures our connections with others and improves our ability to relate and interact with people from various cultures and backgrounds. 6. Personal Growth and Well-being: Reading provides an avenue for personal growth and self-reflection. It offers solace, inspiration, and an escape from reality. By exploring characters' journeys and reflecting on their challenges, victories, and failures, we can draw valuable lessons and apply them to our own lives. It also acts as a form of self-care, reducing stress, improving mental well-being, and fostering relaxation. Conclusion: Reading nurtures our minds, fuels our imaginations, and broadens our perspectives. It is an irreplaceable tool for acquiring knowledge, fostering intellectual growth, and promoting empathy. In a world where distractions abound, let us recognize the transformative power of reading and embrace it as an essential vehicle for personal and societal development. So, pick up a book, unlock its enchanting wisdom, and embark on a lifelong journey of discovery through the magic of reading."},{"instruction":"can you speak chinese","output":"Yes, I can speak Chinese."},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene about a P.E. teacher telling his students a story about a weird course he found in a newspaper. He jokingly describes it as \\"getting shot at with a water hose and digging your grave for 18,000 bucks\\" and he uses it as a example on how to not be a P.E. teacher. He also mentions how the instructors there yell at someone for even sighing. He mentions how one of his former students went there and came back with shell shock.","output":"INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY A class of high school students gather around in the gymnasium, their PE teacher, MR. TANAKA, stands before them, holding a newspaper. MR. TANAKA Alright, listen up, everyone! I found something in the newspaper that's too crazy not to share with you all! The students lean in, curious and intrigued. STUDENT 1 (smirking) What is it, Tanaka-sensei? Another one of your quirky stories, I bet! MR. TANAKA (chuckling) Indeed! You could call this one... the most bizarre training course I've ever stumbled upon. Brace yourselves for this: \\"A University of Endurance - A Course in (Beat) Survival!\\" The students exchange puzzled glances. STUDENT 2 (slightly concerned) Survival? What do they teach, Tanaka-sensei? How to avoid wild animals or fend off enemies? MR. TANAKA (smiling mischievously) Oh no, it's way more intense than that! Imagine getting shot at with a water hose and digging your own grave, all for the low, low price of 18,000 bucks! The students burst into laughter, their confusion temporarily lifted. STUDENT 3 (laughing) You're messing with us, right, Tanaka-sensei? No one would actually pay for that! MR. TANAKA (grinning) Well, that's what I thought too, but apparently this course attracts quite the crowd. And believe it or not, they even have P.E. teachers there! Look at me—we're already hanging by a thread in this profession, so this is definitely a \\"Do Not Try at Home\\" situation! The students chuckle, some nodding in agreement. MR. TANAKA (CONT'D) (actual concern) But seriously, folks, I've heard some pretty crazy things about this place. Former students have told me stories of instructors who yell at you for even sighing. Can you imagine the levels of discipline there? It's like they're trying to push you to your absolute limits! STUDENT 4 (mockingly) Sounds like a blast, Tanaka-sensei. Tell us more about these hardened survivors! MR. TANAKA (slightly somber) Well, one of my former students actually went there not too long ago. Came back a changed person, they say. Shell shock, they call it. Poor guy lost all his zest for life and developed a fear of water hoses. Can you believe it? Water hoses! The students fall silent, realizing the potential seriousness behind the strange training course. MR. TANAKA (CONT'D) (shaking his head) So, my dear students, as amusing and absurd as this all may sound, remember, sometimes the line between challenging ourselves and pushing ourselves too far becomes blurred. Let's find strength in moderation and maintain our sanity while doing it! The students nod in agreement, grateful for their eccentric yet caring PE teacher. CUT TO: The students continue their PE class, appreciating the importance of balance and the value of their teacher's advice.
