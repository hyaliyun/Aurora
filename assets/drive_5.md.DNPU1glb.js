Article: Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement of science. In fact, more than 80% of the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained, of which approximately 45% held university posts. It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development. There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world. However, university professors still utilized some autonomy, at least in the sciences, to choose epistemological foundations and methods. For instance, Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction. Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities, and the debates surrounding that adoption, which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change. There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities. Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability, and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources. Now answer this question: The acceptance of new concepts and sciences by universities brought these ideas what?","output":"The acceptance of new concepts and sciences by universities brought these ideas legitimacy, respectability, and support for the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Priyadarshan/Paresh Rawal combo has been golden before with the likes of HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA so I went into the movie (at an Indian multiplex) with high hopes, especially after the slick promos. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL before it, this movie was a huge disappointment. Like others have commented, the premise of the movie, which was already stale to begin with, just gets stretched on and on without any development or additional layering. After a while, you just want the movie to end so you can go home (if I had been watching this at home, it would have been much easier to cut my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is average at best and John Abraham should not try doing comedy again. The comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week.

Background: Magnetism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet. Magnetism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter. When electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom, it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet, with north and south poles and a magnetic field. In most materials, the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions, so overall the material is not magnetic. Examples of nonmagnetic materials include wood, glass, plastic, paper, copper, and aluminum. These materials are not attracted to magnets and cannot become magnets.  Paragraph: Rob got a compass as a present for his birthday. The magnet in the compass made him very interested in how magnets work. To understand magnets better he categorized objects in two groups, group A and group B. In group A all objects were magnetic, but in group B none of the objects was magnetic.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group might act as a magnet, group A or group B?

Question: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.  John was trying to reenact Le Chatelier's principle. To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction.  Which test saw higher concentrations of the products, test C or test D? Answer:","output":"Test C saw higher concentrations of the products.  According to Le Châtelier's principle, when a system at equilibrium experiences stress, it will work to counteract that stress and establish a new equilibrium. In test C, John observed a forward reaction, which indicates that the stress applied to the system favored the forward reaction over the reverse reaction. As a result, the concentrations of the products increased, and the concentrations of the reactants decreased.  In contrast, in test D, John observed a reverse reaction. This observation implies that the stress applied to the system favored the reverse reaction over the forward reaction. Consequently, this would lead to a decrease in the concentrations of the products and an increase in the concentrations of the reactants. In summary, test C experienced a forward reaction that led to higher concentrations of the products, whereas test D experienced a reverse reaction that resulted in decreased concentrations of the products and increased concentrations of the reactants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

En Vogue is an American R&B/Pop vocal group whose original lineup consisted of singers Terry Ellis, Dawn Robinson, Cindy Herron, and Maxine Jones. Formed in Oakland, California in 1988, En Vogue reached number two on the US Hot 100 with the single \\"Hold On\\", which was taken from their 1990 debut album Born To Sing. The group's 1992 follow-up album Funky Divas reached the top 10 in both the US and UK, and included their second US number two hit \\"My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It)\\", plus the US top 10 hits \\" In the late-1980s, Oakland-based production and songwriting duo Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy first conceived the idea of a modern-day girl group in the tradition of The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, The Ronettes and other commercially successful female bands which had flourished in the late 1950s and early 1960s when they were assembling their 1988 compilation project FM2 for Atlantic Records. Foster and McElroy envisioned an entertainment unit with interchangeable but not identical parts in which every member would qualify to take the lead on any given number. Thus, their plan was to recruit singers who possessed strong voices, noticeably good looks, and intelligence. Approximately 3000 women attended the auditions held in 1988, with Dawn Robinson, Cindy Herron, and Maxine Jones making the final cut. Originally conceived as a trio, Foster and McElroy decided to create a quartet after hearing Terry Ellis audition whose plane had been late from Houston, Texas. At first, they selected the band name 4-U but soon shifted to Vogue, ultimately settling on En Vogue, upon learning that another group had already claimed the Vogue moniker.  After forming, the group began working with their producers on their debut album. Recording began in August 1989 and wrapped up in December of the same year. Born to Sing was released on April 3, 1990. The album peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard 200 chart and No. 3 on Billboard's R&B Albums Chart. The first single, \\"Hold On,\\" was released to radio in late February 1990 and became a crossover pop hit, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, and No. 1 on both the R&B singles and Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts. It later went to No. 5 in the UK, and became a hit in Europe. The next two singles, \\"Lies\\" and \\"You Don't Have to Worry,\\" each went to No. 1 on the Billboard R&B charts, while the fourth and final single, \\"Don't Go,\\" charted at No. 3 on the Billboard R&B. The album was later certified triple platinum by the RIAA.  \\"Hold On\\" was awarded a Billboard Music Award for \\"#1 R&B Single of the Year,\\" a Soul Train Award for \\"R&B/Urban Contemporary Single of the Year, Group, Band or Duo\\" and have been nominated for a Grammy Award for Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group.

The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship.      Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey.  Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India.       The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs.      The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost  150.  In the second,   1,500.      \\"And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. \\"       Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to  1,500.      \\"Now the poor performed significantly worse. \\" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average. This is about the loss experienced when a person has not slept for one night.      The scientists then wondered if the same person reacted differently when he was rich and when he was poor. The Indian sugar cane farmers earn most of their money once a year, when the harvest comes in. But the money often does not last through the year.     \\"So they find themselves basically rich after the harvest when the income comes in and poor just before the harvest.      The researchers gave them tests similar to the ones taken by the people in New Jersey. They tested the Indian farmers before the harvest and after.      And the results were much the same as with the mall shoppers.      \\"They performed much more slowly and with many more mistakes when they were poorer than when...

A top-seller in the Canadian and United States educational markets, it was Commodore's first full-featured computer, and formed the basis for their entire 8-bit product line, including the Commodore 64. The first model, which was named the PET 2001, was the third personal computer ever made available to retail consumers, after the Apple II and TRS-80.  - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor.  - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - A 16-bit register can store 2 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 16 bits is -32,768 (-1 × 2) through 32,767 (2 - 1); the unsigned range is 0 through 65,535 (2 - 1). Since 2 is 65,536, a processor with 16-bit memory addresses can directly access 64 KiB of byte-addressable memory.  - A player character or playable character (PC) is a fictional character in a role-playing or video game whose actions are directly controlled by a player of the game rather than the rules of the game. The characters that are not controlled by a player are called non-player characters (NPCs). The actions of non-player characters are typically handled by the game itself in video games, or according to rules followed by a gamemaster refereeing tabletop role-playing games. The player character functions as a fictional, alternate body for the player controlling it.  - The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer that was sold by Commodore Business Machines. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the PET. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers.

The player takes control of hero Brad Zoom 's ship in his quest to save civilization from aliens . The game is full of humor and the intro screen is in magazine style .  - Shoot 'em up (also known as shmup or STG) is a subgenre of the shooter genre of video games. In a shoot 'em up, the player character engages in a lone assault, often in a spacecraft or aircraft, shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up. Some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives. Shoot 'em ups call for fast reactions and for the player to memorize levels and enemy attack patterns. \\"Bullet hell\\" games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles.  - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a .

Answer the following question: Information:  - Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction, distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide, such as manslaughter. Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of \\"malice\\", brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. \\"Involuntary\\" manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent (\\"mens rea\\"), recklessness.  - William Palmer ( 6 August 1824 -- 14 June 1856 ) , also known as the Rugeley Poisoner or the Prince of Poisoners , was an English doctor found guilty of murder in one of the most notorious cases of the 19th century . Charles Dickens called Palmer \`\` the greatest villain that ever stood in the Old Bailey '' . Palmer was convicted for the 1855 murder of his friend John Cook , and was executed in public by hanging the following year . He had poisoned Cook with strychnine , and was suspected of poisoning several other people including his brother and his mother - in - law , as well as four of his children who died of \`\` convulsions '' before their first birthdays . Palmer made large sums of money from the deaths of his wife and brother after collecting on life insurance , and by defrauding his wealthy mother out of thousands of pounds , all of which he lost through gambling on horses .  - Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812  9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity.  - Homicide refers to one human being killing another. Homicides can be divided into many overlapping types, including murder, manslaughter, justifiable homicide, killing in war, euthanasia, and capital punishment and abortion, depending on the circumstances of the death.

Can you tell me the answer to what kind of chemical reaction is rusting of iron??","output":"Rusting of iron, also known as iron corrosion, is an example of a redox (reduction-oxidation) chemical reaction, more specifically, it is a combination of oxidation and reduction processes. In this reaction, iron, being a reactive metal, reacts with oxygen in the presence of water to form hydrated iron(III) oxide, commonly known as rust. The entire process involves electron transfer between the reactants. Let's break down the rusting process in detail. 1. Oxidation of iron: The primary step in the rusting process is the oxidation of iron, during which iron atoms lose electrons to form positively charged iron cations (Fe²⁺). This process can be represented by the equation: Fe (s) → Fe²⁺ (aq) + 2e⁻ Here, iron (Fe) loses two electrons, transforming into Fe²⁺ and releases the two electrons (2e⁻). 2. Reduction of oxygen: In the presence of water, the released electrons are used to reduce oxygen molecules. Oxygen tends to gain the electrons and reacts with water to form hydroxide ions (OH⁻). The reaction can be represented by the following equation: O₂ (g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻ (aq) In this reaction, oxygen and water gain the electrons, forming OH⁻ ions. 3. Formation of hydrated iron(III) oxide (rust): Finally, the Fe²⁺ ions produced in oxidation step react with OH⁻ ions generated in the reduction step to form iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), which then reacts further with oxygen and water to form hydrated iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃·xH₂O), also known as rust. The two combined equations for this final process are: 2Fe²⁺ (aq) + 6OH⁻ (aq) → 2Fe(OH)₃ (s) and 2Fe(OH)₃ (s) + O₂ (g) + 2H₂O(l) → 2Fe₂O₃·xH₂O (s) Putting all the three reactions together, we get the overall balanced equation of the rusting process: 4Fe (s) + 3O₂ (g) + 6H₂O(l) → 4Fe₂O₃·xH₂O (s) Rusting of iron is an exothermic reaction as it releases energy in the form of heat. It is important to note that the rusting process is also greatly facilitated by the presence of salts and acidic substances. In summary, the rusting of iron is a redox chemical reaction that mainly involves the combined processes of oxidation, reduction, and rapid formation of hydrated iron(III) oxide or rust.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes . The name of specific alkanes always ends in - ane . The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane, with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and several other alkanes are listed in Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points.  and the situation: Two brothers studied chemistry in school. Ted studied alkanes, while Ned studied cycloalkanes. They both received grade A.  Answer the following question: Which brother learned more about methane? Answer:","output":"Ted learned more about methane. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The background information states that saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes, and they have specific naming based on the number of carbon atoms. 2. Methane is specifically mentioned as the smallest alkane with just one carbon atom. 3. The situation tells us that Ted studied alkanes, while Ned studied cycloalkanes. 4.

Is \\"The boundaries of Somerset are largely unaltered from medieval times.\\" a good answer to the question \\"How long have the boundaries of somerset remained constant\\"","output":"While the statement \\"The boundaries of Somerset are largely unaltered from medieval times\\" does provide some idea about the constancy of the Somerset boundaries, it can be further elaborated and improved to adequately address the question \\"How long have the boundaries of Somerset remained constant.\\" A more detailed response could be as follows: The boundaries of Somerset, located in South West England, have predominantly remained constant since the medieval era, which is roughly 1,000 years ago. Evidence of Somerset's existence as an independent entity can be traced back to the early Anglo-Saxon period, when it was a key part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex. Somerset's earliest clear boundaries can be dated back to the late 9th century, during the reign of Alfred the Great. At that time, Somerset comprised parts of the ancient British tribal territories, which were later divided into sub-kingdoms. King Ine of Wessex gave these sub-kingdoms fixed boundaries in the 7th century. By the late medieval period, Somerset's boundaries were relatively similar to today's, featuring areas such as Monmouthshire in the north, Wiltshire and Dorset in the east, and Devon in the west. Throughout the centuries, however, subtle boundary alterations have taken place as a result of political, administrative, and social changes. Some examples of these alterations include the merger of the ecclesiastical authorities of Bath and Wells, the division of the county into hundreds, and the establishment of local government districts in 1894 and 1974. The most significant change came in 1974 when a local government reorganization extended Somerset's northeastern border by incorporating the previously separate county of Avon. Despite these modifications, the core of Somerset's boundaries has remained remarkably constant over the past millennium. In conclusion, the boundaries of Somerset have stayed relatively constant for at least 1,000 years, with only minor alterations from the late medieval period up to the present day. While there have been some changes and adaptations in the region's political landscape, the fundamental elements of Somerset's boundaries as recognized in the medieval era remain largely preserved today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law.  - Guatemala is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala. The capital is Guatemala City, which also serves as the national capital.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - El Salvador, officially the Republic of El Salvador (literally \\"Republic of The Savior\\"), is the smallest and the most densely populated country in Central America. El Salvador's capital and largest city is San Salvador. , the country had a population of approximately 6.38 million, consisting largely of Mestizos of European and Indigenous American descent.  - Honduras, officially the Republic of Honduras, is a republic in Central America. It has at times been referred to as Spanish Honduras to differentiate it from British Honduras, which became modern-day Belize. Honduras is bordered to the west by Guatemala, to the southwest by El Salvador, to the southeast by Nicaragua, to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca, and to the north by the Gulf of Honduras, a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea.  - The Darién Gap is a break in the Pan-American Highway consisting of a large swath of undeveloped swampland and forest within Panama's Darién Province in Central America and the northern portion of Colombia's Chocó Department in South America. The gap begins in Yaviza, Panama and ends in Turbo, Colombia, stretching between 100 km and 160 km (60100 miles) long. Roadbuilding through this area is expensive, and the environmental cost is high. Political consensus in favor of road construction has not emerged. Consequently there is no road connection through the Darién Gap connecting North America with South America and it is the missing link of the Pan-American Highway.  - A road is a thoroughfare, route, or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or some form of conveyance, including a motor vehicle, cart, bicycle, or horse.  - The Pan-American Highway is a network of roads measuring about in total length. Except for a rainforest break of approximately , called the Darién Gap, the road links almost all of the mainland countries of the Americas in a connected highway system. According to \\"Guinness World Records\\", the Pan-American Highway is the world's longest \\"motorable road\\". However, because of the Darién Gap, it is not possible to cross between South America and Central America.  - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world.  - Huehuetenango is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala. It is situated in the western highlands and shares borders with Mexico in the north and west; with El Quiché in the east, with Totonicapán, Quetzaltenango, and San Marcos to the south. The capital is the city of Huehuetenango.  - Guatemala City, locally known as Guatemala or Guate, is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Guatemala, and the most populous in Central America. The city is located in the south-central part of the country, nestled in a mountain valley called Valle de la Ermita. In 2009, it had a population of 1,075,000. Guatemala City is also the capital of the local Municipality of Guatemala and of the Guatemala Department.  - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.  - In geography, statistics and archaeology, a settlement, locality or populated place is a community in which people live. A settlement can range in size from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding urbanized areas. Settlements may include hamlets, villages, towns and cities. A settlement may have known historical properties such as the date or era in which it was first settled, or first settled by a particular people.  - Central America is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with South America on the southeast. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west.

Article: On Easter Day, 1722, Dutch explorers   landed on Easter Island  . It was the first time that Easter Islanders had met people from the outside world. The strangers were about to discover something very strange themselves --that they were on an island with hundreds of huge stone statues  . The Dutch explorers wondered where the Islanders had come from and why and how they had built the statues. Now science is putting together the story.     The first people to arrive on the island came there around A.D. 700. The society that developed there was based on fishing and farming to feed the population, which grew to 12,000. Its success showed itself in a way that has become the island's trademark  : hundreds of huge stone figures --the moai.     None of the moai was standing when scientists first arrived. People put them back up later; but how had a Stone Age society ever made, moved and set them up there in the first place? And why?     There are nearly 900 moai on Easter Island, and while the questions about them remain unanswered, no one doubts the years of effort that must have gone into making them.     The real killer of the Easter Islanders came from across the ocean. After 1722, it became popular for explorers to visit Easter Island, bringing diseases.

Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"While these two sentences may seem similar at first glance, they actually convey slightly different information. Let's break down the differences: Sentence 1: \\"Pill Hill became part of Brookline in 1844 when Boston annexed it.\\" In this sentence, Pill Hill is the focus, and it states that it became part of Brookline in 1844 when it was annexed by Boston. This suggests that the area known as Pill Hill was originally a separate entity and was incorporated into Brookline after the annexation. The emphasis here is on Pill Hill's transition from being an independent area to becoming a part of Brookline. Sentence 2: \\"In 1844, Brookline became a part of Pill Hill when it was annexed from Boston.\\" This sentence focuses on Brookline and suggests that it became a part of Pill Hill when it was annexed from Boston in 1844. In this case, it is implied that Pill Hill was an existing area, and Brookline was incorporated into it during the annexation. The emphasis here is on Brookline's incorporation into the larger Pill Hill area. In summary, while both sentences discuss the 1844 annexation, sentence 1 implies that Pill Hill became a part of Brookline, while sentence 2 implies that Brookline became a part of Pill Hill. Although they both describe an event in 1844 involving Pill Hill, Brookline, and Boston, they place the emphasis on different aspects of the annexation and suggest different interpretations of the relationship between Pill Hill and Brookline at that time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage.

People sometimes worry that eating too many soybeans might not be good for them, but they don't think about it as much when they drink milk or eat cheese. 2. The second question is a bit different. It's asking for some fun and interesting facts that have a clear explanation.

Just months later his doctor told him he also had multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that multiplies the body's plasma cells to dangerous levels.  It's a cancer that usually strikes much later in life. Hilaire was 34.  More than 1,100 people who worked or lived near the World Trade Center on 9/11 have been diagnosed with cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

No These two sentences do not mean the same thing. Although both sentences describe an academy with four primary components, the arrangement and names of these components are different in each sentence. In Sentence 1, the academy has a central hall, an east wing, a west wing, and a garden. This implies that the main area of the academy is the central hall with two wings extending to the east and west. In this configuration, the central hall is the core part of the building, with the wings being secondary structures. In Sentence 2, the academy has an east hall, a central wing, a west wing, and a garden. Here, it's different because the main area is now referred to as the east hall, and the central component is a wing instead of a hall. In this scenario, the east hall seems to be a prominent part of the academy, and the central wing is more of a connector between the east hall and the west wing. In both cases, the garden is mentioned as a part of the academy but does not specify its location or relation to the other components in either sentence.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not \\"paid her dues\\" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on Neighbours. Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, \\"If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go.\\"In 1993, Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new \\"look\\" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested that this is part of the reason she entered mainstream pop culture in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected.

Given the question: Information:  - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is the local government council for \\"Na h-Eileanan Siar\\" council area of Scotland, comprising the Outer Hebrides.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - The Sea of the Hebrides is a portion of the North Atlantic Ocean, located off the coast of western Scotland, separating the mainland and the northern Inner Hebrides islands (to the east) from the southern Outer Hebrides islands (to the west). To the north, the Sea of the Hebrides joins The Minch.  - Skye, or the Isle of Skye (or \\"Eilean a' Cheò\\"), is the largest and northernmost of the major islands in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. The island's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous centre dominated by the Cuillins, the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country. Although it has been suggested that the Gaelic \\"Sgitheanach\\" describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name's origins.  - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.  - The Cuillin (Scottish Gaelic: An Cuilthionn or An Cuiltheann) is a range of rocky mountains located on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. The true Cuillin is also known as the Black Cuillin to distinguish it from the Red Cuilin (na Beanntan Dearga, known locally as Red Hills) across Glen Sligachan. The Red Cuilin hills are lower and, being less rocky, have fewer scrambles or climbs.  - The Outer Hebrides, also known as the Western Isles (Scottish Gaelic: ' or ' ), \\"Innse Gall\\" (\\"islands of the strangers\\") or the Long Isle or Long Island (Gaelic: \\"An t-Eilean Fada\\"), is an island chain off the west coast of mainland Scotland. The islands are geographically coextensive with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, one of the 32 unitary council areas of Scotland. They form part of the Hebrides, separated from the Scottish mainland and from the Inner Hebrides by the waters of the Minch, the Little Minch and the Sea of the Hebrides. Scottish Gaelic is the predominant spoken language, although in a few areas English speakers form a majority.  - Scalpay ( Scottish Gaelic : Sgalpaigh or Sgalpaigh na Hearadh i.e. \`\` Scalpay of Harris '' to distinguish it from Scalpay off Skye ) is an island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland .  - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile).    What is the relationship between 'scalpay' and 'the minch'? The answer is:","output":"Scalpay is an island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, and The Minch is a body of water separating the Outer Hebrides from the mainland of Scotland and the Inner Hebrides.

In his youth, Albini's family moved often, before settling in the college town of Missoula, Montana in 1974. Albini formed Shellac in 1992. With bandmates Bob Weston (formerly of Volcano Suns), and Todd Trainer (of Rifle Sport, Breaking Circus and Brick Layer Cake), they initially released three EPs: The Rude Gesture: A Pictorial History (1993), Uranus (1993) and The Bird Is the Most Popular Finger (1994)--the first two EP releases were on Touch and Go, while the third EP was a Drag City label release.  Two years after formation, the Japanese label NUX Organization released a Japan-exclusive live album in CD format titled raivuinDong Jing --an English-language reference to the name Shellac cannot be found anywhere on the CD product, which was not available outside Japan. The live album was followed by five studio albums: At Action Park (1994), Terraform (1998), 1000 Hurts (2000), Excellent Italian Greyhound (2007) and Dude Incredible (2014). All of Shellac's studio albums were released on vinyl as well as CD.  Albini explained in 2010 that Shellac had made a decision early in their existence that they would not play at festivals and this position was articulated to All Tomorrow's Parties (ATP) festival organizer Barry Hogan during the preparation stage of the inaugural ATP event. However, Scottish band Mogwai managed to convince Albini at the time that they were ATP curators and the band was very impressed by the experience: \\"They (ATP) completely changed the festival game.

Question: \\"Who controlled Glatz after the treaty was signed?\\"  Context: \\"The Treaty of Hubertusburg, between Austria, Prussia, and Saxony, was signed on February 15, 1763, at a hunting lodge between Dresden and Leipzig. Negotiations had started there on December 31, 1762.

At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it.

The pair record videos glorifying God and their cause, and bid their unknowing families and loved ones goodbye, while trying to behave normally to avoid arousing suspicion. The next day, they shave off their hair and beards and don suits in order to look like Israelis. Their cover story is that they are going to a wedding.

Q:I have a new situation: John is a biologist. Last summer, he was studying the evolution of two different salamander species, species A and species B. Species A salamander was Gold-striped salamander while species B salamander was fire salamander. He found it interesting that they took different approaches to adapt to different habitats.  But I can use this background: Consider the antlers of the Irish elk, (often supposed to be far too large; in deer antler size has an allometric relationship to body size). Obviously, antlers serve positively for defence against predators, and to score victories in the annual rut. But they are costly in terms of resource. Their size during the last glacial period presumably depended on the relative gain and loss of reproductive capacity in the population of elks during that time. As another example, camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid coloration is displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the necessity for reproduction.Stream-dwelling salamanders, such as Caucasian salamander or Gold-striped salamander have very slender, long bodies, perfectly adapted to life at the banks of fast small rivers and mountain brooks. Elongated body protects their larvae from being washed out by current. However, elongated body increases risk of desiccation and decreases dispersal ability of the salamanders; it also negatively affects their fecundity. As a result, fire salamander, less perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats, is in general more successful, have a higher fecundity and broader geographic range.  What is an answer for this question: Which species would be more successful in reproduction, Species A or species B? A:","output":"To answer the question of which species would be more successful in reproduction, Species A (Gold-striped salamander) or Species B (fire salamander), let's compare their reproductive strategies and success factors. Step 1: Analyze reproductive adaptations - Species A (Gold-striped salamander) has a slender, long body that protects their larvae from being washed out by currents in their stream-dwelling habitat. - Species B (fire salamander) is less perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats but has a higher fecundity. Step 2: Assess limitations - For Species A, the elongated body increases the risk of desiccation, decreases dispersal ability, and negatively affects fecundity. - For Species B, it is not as well adapted to stream-dwelling habitats, so its success is limited in those habitats. Step 3: Evaluate overall reproductive success - Species A has some advantages in reproduction by preventing its larvae from being washed away, but its elongated body leads to several limitations that hinder overall reproductive success. - Species B is less specialized, but its higher fecundity and broader geographic range make it more successful in general. Conclusion: Based on the information provided, Species B (fire salamander) would be more successful in reproduction, as it has a higher fecundity and a broader geographic range, allowing it to reproduce in varied habitats and adapt more easily to changing conditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour.

Question: Process:  - The animal eats large quantities of food that will be stored as fat - Winter comes and the animal finds a place to hibernate - Over a period of days, the animal&#x27;s heart rate and breathing rate drop slowly - Electrical activity in the brain almost ceases completely, though some areas remain active - The animal has entered hibernation mode -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more movement happens, how will it affect HURTING the animal to hibernate properly.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this case involving increased movement during hibernation, can negatively affect an animal's ability to hibernate properly. This is because hibernation is a delicate physiological process, and any deviation from the animal's typical lowered state of activity can have both direct and indirect consequences on an animal's health and energy reserves throughout the hibernation period. Here's a breakdown of how increased movement can hurt the animal during hibernation: 1. Energy consumption: The primary purpose of hibernation is to conserve energy. When an animal's movement increases during hibernation, it will consume more energy, which may not be sustainable during winter months when food resources are limited. This can lead to exhaustion of the animal's fat reserves and even premature death. 2. Disruption of metabolic processes: Hibernation involves a significant decrease in an animal's metabolic processes, including heart rate, breathing rate, and body temperature. Increased movement can disrupt these processes, forcing the animal's body to work harder to compensate, which can further strain its energy reserves and negatively impact its overall health. 3. Inadequate rest and recovery: Reduced brain activity and physical movement during hibernation allow the animal to preserve energy and undergo critical restorative processes, such as tissue repair and immune system maintenance. Increased movement may disrupt these processes, leading to increased susceptibility to illness, injury, and other health issues. 4. Disturbance to hibernating habitat: Excess movement can potentially affect the animal's hibernation environment, making it less suitable for hibernation. This may lead to the animal's exposure to extreme temperatures, predators, or other potential hazards. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of increased movement during hibernation can indeed have direct and indirect effects on an animal's ability to hibernate properly. This disruption can lead to a variety of negative consequences, including heightened energy consumption, disruption of metabolic processes, inadequate rest and recovery, and potential disturbance to the hibernation environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Future of Money and Mobile Commerce If you’re over the age of 20, you’ve likely used a credit card, counted change and maybe even written a check. But is all that about to change? Mobile payment hasn’t become the de facto method of financial transactions just yet, but it is projected to overtake those archaic checkbooks and bank notes you’ve been lugging around. Our friends at SapientNitro have compiled research to create this infographic, which details the past, present and possible future of mobile commerce. The company shares the three types of mobile payments that dominate the marketplace today: m-commerce (uses a mobile browser and online wallets), m-payments (uses mobile apps), and m-wallets (replaces your entire wallet). Furthermore, consumers can access several forms of transaction on their mobile devices, including scannable barcodes, mobile coupons and self-checkout. But are consumers ready to wholeheartedly adopt the latest in mobile payment technology? Adults who are unbanked, for instance, may face a barrier to mobile transactions — there are currently 17 million unbanked adults in the U.S. But many smartphone users welcome the convenience of mobile payments (87% in the UK), while others worry about the privacy factor (79% in Asia). Still, 49% of consumers in the U.S. found shopping on a smartphone awkward. Then again, many people found paper checks awkward and credit cards confusing the first time around. Where do you fall in the mobile payment debate? What kinds of transactions do you handle on your smartphone? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the growing trend of mobile commerce and its potential to overtake traditional payment methods like credit cards and cash.

Finally, the Vikings put the game away as second-string QB Tarvaris Jackson found Rice again on a 34-yard TD pass. The Seahawks tried to rally with a 1-yard TD run by running back Justin Forsett (with a failed 2-point conversion), but the Vikings prevented the Seahawks comeback from advancing any further. With the win, the Vikings improved to 9-1. Brett Favre threw 4 TD passes for the 22nd time in his career (second of the season), breaking the mark set by Dan Marino.

Translate this to English?","output":"The healthcare services in most developing countries are far from adequate to meet the needs of the population. In many developing countries, healthcare systems struggle to provide sufficient services that are capable of addressing the diverse needs of the growing population. These countries often face a disproportionate distribution of healthcare facilities, a lack of well-trained medical professionals, and insufficient funding for healthcare programs. Additionally, they grapple with a high prevalence of infectious diseases, malnutrition, and inadequate sanitation, further exacerbating their healthcare challenges. The inadequate healthcare infrastructure in these countries often leads to limited access to basic healthcare services, resulting in a higher prevalence of preventable illnesses and a higher mortality rate. Rural areas, in particular, are disproportionately affected, as healthcare facilities are often concentrated in urban centers. This forces those living in rural communities to travel long distances to access medical care, incurring high costs and sacrificing significant time in the process. Aside from the lack of physical infrastructure, the shortage of skilled healthcare professionals is a major challenge faced by developing countries. Insufficient training, inadequate compensation, and poor working conditions often result in healthcare professionals choosing to work in private sectors or migrate to more developed countries. This brain drain further strains the already fragile healthcare systems in these countries, leaving a significant gap in the provision of healthcare services. To address these challenges, developing countries require consistent and sustainable investment in their healthcare systems. This can be achieved by investing in the construction of new healthcare facilities, the implementation of comprehensive public health policies, and improving the quality of education and training programs for healthcare professionals. Moreover, collaboration with international organizations and developed countries is essential in the pursuit of knowledge exchange, technical assistance, and financial support in order to strengthen healthcare systems and improve the overall health outcomes of the population. It is crucial for leaders in these countries to prioritize healthcare as a fundamental right for their citizens and work collectively to ensure that healthcare services are accessible, affordable, and effective for all individuals, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical location."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What was the address of Tony Hancock in 'Hancock's Half Hour'?","output":"Tony Hancock, the prominent British comedian, starred in the groundbreaking BBC radio and television series 'Hancock's Half Hour.' Created by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, the show first aired on radio in 1954, later transitioning to television in 1956, and entertained audiences until 1961. In 'Hancock's Half Hour,' Hancock's character lived at 23 Railway Cuttings, East Cheam, a fictional address in a real suburban area in Greater London. East Cheam is part of the London Borough of Sutton. In the series, his residence serves as an essential backdrop to the comedy, encapsulating Tony's desire for a higher social standing amid his middle-class surroundings. Throughout the show, 23 Railway Cuttings is depicted as a dilapidated yet charming house, where Tony lives with fellow resident, and sometimes adversary, Sid James, played by the actor of the same name. The peculiar address adds a touch of absurdity and quirkiness to the show, contributing to the distinctive humor that characterizes 'Hancock's Half Hour.' It is worth mentioning that Sid James later left the show, and Tony's subsequent housemate, played by actor Bill Kerr, was introduced to maintain the dynamic. The success of 'Hancock's Half Hour' can be attributed to its blend of satire, wit, and realistic depiction of post-World War II British society. Hancock's address at 23 Railway Cuttings, East Cheam, played a role in cementing the show's uniqueness and appeal, making it a classic example of British radio and television comedy."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

When we do that, we still have 30 left on the one side (because 30 has nothing to subtract), and on the other side we get 104*v - 99*v. This equals to 5*v (because 104 minus 99 is 5).  So our equation now looks like 30 = 5*v.  Now that we only have 'v' once, we want to find out what number it stands for. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 5 (because 'v' is being multiplied by 5).  When we do this, we find out that 'v' equals 6 (because 30 divided by 5 is 6).

The method of hiding exact meanings is called coding. People have used secret codes throughout history to protect important information. The National Cryptologic Museum celebrated 60 years of cryptologic excellence in 2012. One event there marked the sixtieth anniversary of the National Security Agency. Two former NSA workers shared their memories of operating a code machine called Sigaba.  In 1940, an American woman named Genevieve Grotjan found some information being repeated in Japanese coded messages. Her discovery helped the United States understand secret Japanese diplomatic messages. After the United States understood the code, it was possible to study messages from the Japanese ambassador to Germany and to his supervisors in Japan.  Understanding these messages helped the United States prepare for a possible war in the Pacific with Japan. After the attack on Pearl Harbor. the American naval commander in the Pacific Ocean was Chester Nimitz. His forces were much smaller than the Japanese Naval forces. And the Japanese had been winning many victories. Joseph Rochefort had worked for several months to read the secret Japanese Naval code called JN-25. If he could understand enough of the code, he would be able to give Admiral Nimitz very valuable information.  From the beginning of 1942, the Japanese code discussed a place called \\"AF.\\" Joseph Rochefort felt the Japanese were planning an important battle aimed at \\"AF.\\" After several weeks, he and other naval experts told Admiral Nimitz that their best idea was that the \\"AF\\" in the Japanese code was the American-held island of Midway. Admiral Nimitz said he must have more information to prepare for such an attack.  The Navy experts decided to trick Japan. They told the American military force on Midway to broadcast a false message. The message would say the island was having problems with its water-processing equipment. The message asked that fresh water be sent to the island immediately. This message was not sent in code.  Several days later, a Japanese radio broadcast in the JN-25 code said that \\"AF\\" had little water. Joseph Rochefort had the evidence he needed. \\"AF\\" was now known to be the island of Midway. He also told Admiral Nimitz the Japanese would attack Midway on June 13.The battle that followed was a huge American victory. That victory was possible because Joseph Rochefort learned to read enough of the Japanese code to discover the meaning of the letters \\"AF.\\"  One American code has never been broken. Perhaps it never will. It was used in the Pacific during World War Two. For many years the government would not discuss this secret code. Listen for a moment to this very unusual code. Then you may understand why the Japanese military forces were never able to understand any of it.  The code is in the voice of a Native American. The man you just heard is singing a simple song in the Navajo language. Very few people outside the Navajo nation are able to speak any of their very difficult language.  At the beginning of World War Two, the United States Marine Corps asked members of the Navajo tribe to train as Code Talkers.  The Cryptologic Museum says the Marine Corps Code Talkers could take a sentence in English and change it into their language in about 20 seconds. A code machine needed about 30 minutes to do the same work.  The Navajo Code Talkers took part in every battle the Marines entered in the Pacific during World War Two. The Japanese were very skilled at breaking codes. But they were never able to understand any of what they called \\"The Marine Code.\\"  The Cryptologic Museum has many pieces of mechanical and electric equipment used to change words into code. It also has almost as many examples of machines used to try to change code back into useful words. Answer this series of questions: 1. Have secret codes been used long? 2. What's their purpose? 3.

Copper In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, the origin of the name of the metal from aes сyprium (metal of Cyprus), later corrupted to сuprum, from which the words copper (English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) are all derived.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Eurovision: we Brits just don’t get it The BBC controls our entry because it pays so much to the European Broadcasting Union. For this, we’re guaranteed a place in the final, to the fury of the other nations, who can see how little effort we put into it. Our entry is chosen by an anonymous BBC official, who evidently has a supercilious disregard for the whole show. The corporation is in many ways a national treasure and excels at news, drama, radio and documentaries, but it is baffled by popular culture. It has proven itself to be the Ukip of Eurovision, fielding candidates in a foreign contest that it holds up to ridicule. There are complicated factors at play, and yet the BBC seems blind to them. The winning song needs to cut across the boundaries of 39 countries, with wildly different musical traditions. Eurovision is an annual search for a common currency – everyone wants to do a Lili Marlene. During the war, this tune was popular with troops on all sides, and has become one of the most enduring and evocative songs of the last century. The right Eurovision song can do this, smashing through political, cultural and linguistic boundaries. Abba’s Waterloo has lost none of its explosive power over the decades. Italy’s 1958 entry, Volare, is still sung all over the continent, wherever beer is served late enough. Music is just the first level. The lyrics need to make some kind of sense to 60 million people who speak 32 languages. Or countries can score by going to the other extreme and exude ethnic pride. As the European people have lost interest in “ever closer union”, so Eurovision scores have tended to reward self-proud ethnic styles. Ukraine’s Ruslana won in 2006 with a song that started with the trembitas, an alpine horn used by Hutsul shepherds. Level three lies in the political zeitgeist: the ability of a Eurovision entry to articulate the historical moment. It can be a girl from 1970 Londonderry or 1982 West Germany singing about peace. Finland’s entry is about gay marriage, hoping to capture the mood this year. The Terry Wogan approach to Eurovision – that it is a parade of foreigners for us to laugh at – was entertaining but out of date long before he quit. Eurovision has mutated into a complex musical and political festival with a broader constituency embracing countries the EU is keeping at arm’s length. It is one of the few arenas where countries like Moldova and Armenia can be welcomed into the comity of Western nations. They tend to sing their hearts out as a result, and victory means the world. Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, a protest against the Kremlin’s enduring influence, came months after its Eurovision win. A YouGov poll this week suggests 75 per cent of Brits blame our Eurovision defeats on a discriminatory block vote system. This is nonsense: we do badly because our songs are dreadful. Yet Britain exports music worldwide. Our artists accounted for one in every six records bought in France and Germany last year. Adele, Mumford and Sons and One Direction recorded four of America’s five best-selling albums. Our nation’s musical talent is immense, and much of it as international as the contest itself. This sums up our European problem perfectly: on a people-to-people level, relations are great. But when you get institutions involved, it all turns sour. We could win Eurovision every year, if we chose. We just need to try.","output":"The BBC's control over the UK's Eurovision entry, due to its financial contribution to the European Broadcasting Union, leads to frustration from other nations who perceive minimal effort put into the contest by the UK. The BBC's lack of understanding of popular culture may contribute to this issue. The ideal Eurovision song transcends political, cultural, and linguistic boundaries, as opposed to the dismal performances submitted by the UK in recent years. The UK has immense musical talent and could succeed in the competition if a more serious and dedicated approach were taken."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The East Asia/Pacific region has reached its goals on nutrition, in part due to the improvements contributed by China, the region’s most populous country. China has reduced its underweight prevalence from 19 percent to 8 percent between 1990 and 2002. China played the largest role in the world in decreasing the rate of children under five underweight between 1990 and 2004, halving the prevalence. This reduction of underweight prevalence has aided in the lowering of the under 5 mortality rate from 49 to 31 of 1000. They also have a low birthweight rate at 4%, a rate comparable to industrialized countries, and over 90% of households receive adequate iodized salts. However, large disparities exist between children in rural and urban areas, where 5 provinces in China leave 1.5 million children iodine deficient and susceptible to diseases.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I can use this background: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream...  Now, I have a new situation: Ben visited two states. Washington state, which had many wildfires year-round, and Oregon, state which had almost no wildfires. Ben enjoyed the visit and planned to return.  Answer this question please: Which state had more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke? Answer:","output":"Washington state had more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke.  Given that Washington state experiences many wildfires year-round, it is more likely that the people living and visiting the state would be exposed to the wildfire smoke and its associated pollutants, including carbon dioxide. Due to the prevalence of wildfires in Washington, the concentration of wildfire smoke and its components, such as particulate matter and carbon dioxide, would be higher in the air, posing a greater risk to the health of the individuals in the state. In contrast, Oregon experiences almost no wildfires, which means that the state's air quality would be significantly better and cleaner compared to Washington. The residents and visitors in Oregon would be less likely to inhale carbon dioxide from wildfire smoke, as the occurrence of wildfires and the resultant smoke would be minimal. Therefore, considering the wildfire frequency and the potential exposure to smoke, more people would be inhaling carbon dioxide from wildfire smoke in Washington state than in Oregon. However, it is essential for individuals visiting or living in areas with frequent wildfires to be aware of these potential health risks and take necessary precautions, such as limiting outdoor activities, using air purifiers indoors, and monitoring local air quality to ensure their safety and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Frequently; Given those answer options, answer the question: Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D.

Summary:","output":"The article discusses the phenomenon of partition and its prevalence since 1990, resulting in the creation of 33 new countries from dividing federations, confederations, and countries. These partitions have occurred among nations with homogeneous cultural and religious characteristics, such as in the case of Serbia-Montenegro, as well as nations with more diverse backgrounds. Major examples include the breakup of the Soviet Union into 15 separate countries, the dissolution of Yugoslavia into six new countries, and the division of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Additionally, several other territories have gained independence or discussion of potential partition, such as Palestine, South Sudan, and Scotland, suggesting that this trend of partition is likely to continue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The Bithynians were a Thracian people living in northwest Anatolia. After Alexander's conquests the region of Bithynia came under the rule of the native king Bas, who defeated Calas, a general of Alexander the Great, and maintained the independence of Bithynia. His son, Zipoetes I of Bithynia maintained this autonomy against Lysimachus and Seleucus I, and assumed the title of king (basileus) in 297 BCE. His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle. Their last king, Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and, after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman republic (74 BCE).\\"? The answer to this question is:","output":"Question: Describe the significant events in the history of the Bithynians, including their relationship with surrounding kingdoms and the Roman republic, as well as the roles of key figures like Bas, Zipoetes I, and Nicomedes I. Answer: The history of the Bithynians, a Thracian people living in northwest Anatolia, is marked by a series of significant events and relationships with surrounding kingdoms and the Roman republic. After Alexander the Great's conquests in the region, a native king named Bas emerged as a prominent figure. He successfully defended Bithynia against Alexander's general, Calas, and consequently maintained the independence of the region. Bas' son, Zipoetes I of Bithynia, continued to preserve the autonomy of Bithynia against other powerful leaders, such as Lysimachus and Seleucus I. He assumed the title of king (basileus) in 297 BCE, further cementing the region's independence. Nicomedes I, the son and successor of Zipoetes I, played a pivotal role in the development and prosperity of Bithynia. He founded the city of Nicomedia, which quickly grew in wealth and importance. Throughout his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE) as well as those of his successors, Bithynia maintained its status among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Interestingly, Nicomedes I invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries. However, this decision led to complications when the Galatians later turned against his son, Prusias I. Despite this betrayal, Prusias I managed to defeat the Galatians in battle. The final Bithynian king, Nicomedes IV, struggled to hold his position against Mithridates VI of Pontus. With the help of the Roman Senate, he was restored to his throne but eventually chose to bequeath his kingdom to the Roman republic by will in 74 BCE. This marked the end of Bithynia as an independent kingdom and began its integration into the Roman realm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

But, some newer energy-saving compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs do.  Check the packaging that the bulbs came in for warnings regarding their mercury content.  Energy-saving bulbs typically contain no more than 4 mg of mercury—just enough to cover the tip of a pen. Even if the CFL bulb contains mercury, it might be in gaseous rather than liquid form. LED bulbs don’t contain liquid mercury. Tilt switches (sometimes called “mercury switches”) were used in older appliances to transmit an on/off signal.  Appliances in the home that may contain mercury include chest freezers, televisions, thermostats, washing machines, space heaters, clothes dryers, and washing machines.  Contact the appliance manufacturer or check your user manual to confirm if a given appliance has mercury. Contact an appliance recycler or your local hazardous waste collection center for information regarding the best way to dispose of these appliances. You might be able to locate up to 3 grams of mercury in thermostats. Most normal batteries do not contain mercury.  However, the smaller “button cell” batteries that are used in watches, hearing aids, toys, pacemakers, and other devices still contain mercury.  If you can find a device containing these small batteries, you’ve probably found liquid mercury. Certain pharmaceutical products might contain liquid mercury.  Skin antiseptics, facial creams, contact lens solutions, and some vaccines could contain liquid mercury.  To confirm that your pharmaceutical products contain liquid mercury, check the ingredients label or contact the manufacturer. Clocks from the 1600s or before often used liquid mercury as a pendulum weight.  If you own such a clock, it probably contains liquid mercury. Summary:","output":"This article discusses the presence of liquid mercury in various items, including older incandescent light bulbs, CFL bulbs, home appliances, button cell batteries, pharmaceutical products, and antique clocks, and advises checking packaging, user manuals, or contacting manufacturers for mercury content information and proper disposal methods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: Antennas are characterized by a number of performance measures which a user would be concerned with in selecting or designing an antenna for a particular application. Chief among these relate to the directional characteristics (as depicted in the antenna's radiation pattern) and the resulting gain. Even in omnidirectional (or weakly directional) antennas, the gain can often be increased by concentrating more of its power in the horizontal directions, sacrificing power radiated toward the sky and ground. The antenna's power gain (or simply \\"gain\\") also takes into account the antenna's efficiency, and is often the primary figure of merit. What is the answer to this question: What would most likely be the main concern in making this decision?","output":"The main concern in making the decision of selecting or designing an antenna as discussed in this article is related to the performance measures of the antenna. Specifically, the major factors to consider include the directional characteristics and the resulting gain of the antenna.  The directional characteristics, depicted in the antenna's radiation pattern, tell us about the directions in which the antenna effectively transmits or receives radio waves. It is crucial in making sure the antenna performs optimally for the desired application. The pattern could be highly directional (radiation concentrated in a certain direction), omnidirectional (radiating in all horizontal directions), or something in between.  The resulting gain of the antenna, on the other hand, is related to the concentration of the antenna's power. In the context of this article, even omnidirectional or weakly directional antennas can increase gain by focusing more power in the horizontal directions, rather than wasting it by radiating towards the sky or the ground. It's essential to note that the gain is not just about the power transmitted; it also accounts for the efficiency of the antenna. In fact, the antenna's power gain, often simply referred to as its 'gain,' is often the primary figure of merit. This means it's the most crucial characteristic users refer to when gauging its potential performance. Because of this, the gain directly impacts the ultimate selection or design decision. In conclusion, to make an informed decision when selecting or designing antennas for a specific application, one should focus on understanding the antenna's directional characteristics and its expected gain, as these will directly affect the antenna's efficiency and overall performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically.  and a hint : Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...  Please answer this question : Which village didn't display an observable Allee effect? The answer is:","output":"Village A did not display an observable Allee effect. Village A showed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, which implies that there was no decline in population size and a loss of genetic diversity that could result in an observable Allee effect. The growing population likely maintained or even increased its genetic diversity, contributing to the evolutionary potential and overall fitness of the species inhabiting the village. On the other hand, Village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically, which leads to a higher likelihood of an observable Allee effect. The decline in population size and the isolation of the village could result in a reduction in genetic diversity, potentially causing negative consequences such as genetic bottlenecks, inbreeding depression, and a decrease in the overall fitness of the species living there. This contrast in population dynamics and potential impacts on genetic variation highlights the differences between the two villages, with Village A not displaying an observable Allee effect and Village B more likely to experience it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights.

Dennis had always envied Nelson for his seemingly effortless ability to charm women. It was as if Nelson had some kind of magnetic pull that attracted them to him wherever he went. Dennis, on the other hand, struggled to even string a sentence together when faced with a woman he found attractive. Step one: Assess the situation Dennis knew he had to overcome his awkwardness if he ever wanted to be as confident as Nelson. So, he decided to analyze the situations where he felt the most awkward around women and find ways to improve. Step two: Observe Nelson in action One weekend, Dennis decided to join Nelson on a night out with the intention of closely observing his friend's behavior around women. He noticed how Nelson easily engaged in conversation with them, made them laugh, and maintained eye contact. Step three: Identify the differences Dennis realized that the main difference between him and Nelson was confidence. Nelson appeared self-assured and comfortable in his own skin, which allowed him to be more relaxed and genuine in his interactions with women. Step four: Develop a plan Determined to become more confident, Dennis devised a plan. He would start by joining a public speaking course to help him become more comfortable with speaking in front of others.

They both communicate that in the Aube, there are 365 historical monuments, and of these, 144 have been enrolled or registered and 221 have been classified. Let's break down the similarities and differences to better understand how they both offer the same details. Given Sentences: 1. The Aube has 365 historical monuments, 144 of which are registered and 221 are classified. 2. The Aube has 365 historical monuments of which 144 are enrolled and 221 are classified. In both cases, it is discussed that: - The Aube possesses 365 historical monuments. The term 'Aube' likely refers to a department or geographical region in France, which is known for its historical monuments and significance. This is the primary subject of both sentences.    - There are 144 monuments that are either 'registered' or 'enrolled.' While the terms 'registered' and 'enrolled' are not identical, in context they refer to the same process. This likely suggests that these monuments have met certain legal, cultural, or historical criteria to be officially recognized or listed in some form of registry or roll.  - Lastly, there are 221 monuments that are classified. 'Classified' generally implies these monuments are categorized based on some notable characteristics, criteria or importance, such as historical period, architectural style, cultural significance, etc.  In concise, the two sentences have a tiny lexical variation (registered vs enrolled), but in terms of overall meaning pertaining to the Aube’s historical monuments' status and quantity, they're indeed conveying the same information. The takeaway from both sentences is, within Aube's collection of 365 historical monuments, 144 are recorded in an official listing and 221 have been sorted into categories for their notable attributes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You are to list the elements of A that come after the first i elements. With Python, this can be done through a simple indexing operation(A[i:]). 3. In Python, list indexes start at 0. So, the value i refers to the position (i+1) in the list. With the given task example, you're to list all elements after the 7th position, meaning you start from the 8th element in the list. 4. By following these steps, your answer should be ['9423', '6995', 'M', '1113', 'n', 'z', '8269', 'F', '6247', 'u', 'b', '9745', '427', '769', '4689', 'I'].

Johan van Banchem, was one of the leaders of the lynching of Johan de Witt and Cornelis de Witt on August 20, 1672, he was rewarded for this crime with an appointment as \\"baljuw\\" of The Hague by which office of steward, designated a medieval official and then a national leader, William III? The answer to this question is:","output":"Johan van Banchem was indeed one of the leaders involved in the lynching of Johan de Witt and Cornelis de Witt on August 20, 1672. This violent act occurred during a period of heightened political tension in the Dutch Republic, and the De Witt brothers were blamed for the country's military failures and accused of conspiring against the young Prince William III of Orange. As a result of his participation in the lynching, Johan van Banchem was rewarded with an appointment as \\"baljuw\\" (bailiff) of The Hague. This position was granted to him by Stadtholder William III, who later became King William III of England, Scotland, and Ireland as well. A baljuw, historically a medieval official, played an essential role in the administration of justice and the enforcement of law and order within their appointed jurisdiction. The appointment of van Banchem by William III can be seen as a display of gratitude for his part in the removal of the De Witt brothers, who were perceived by some as obstacles to William III's rise to power. In summary, Johan van Banchem's involvement in the lynching of Johan de Witt and Cornelis de Witt was rewarded with the position of baljuw of The Hague by the future national leader, Stadtholder William III."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Public officials could have been behind a ‘deliberate cover-up’ of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal, MPs will warn today. In a damning report, they call for an urgent investigation into the loss of crucial files on the abuse of at least 1,400 vulnerable young girls by mainly Asian men. Their inquiry into the scandal heard evidence from an anonymous council researcher who had gathered evidence of failures to tackle the abuse. Scroll down for video. Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs committee, has called for an 'urgent investigation' into the loss of files. The woman claimed an unknown person stole a draft report from her office in 2002 which had been set to go to the Home Office. There was no forced entry and access was only through key-coded and locked security doors. Her report had contained severe criticisms of the relevant agencies in Rotherham, with the most serious alleging ‘indifference’ by senior managers. Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs committee, said: ‘The proliferation of revelations about files which can no longer be located gives rise to public suspicion of a deliberate cover-up. ‘The only way to address these concerns is with a full, transparent and urgent investigation.’ One victim of men in the area, of which there are thought to be around 1,400, fell pregnant twice and tried to end her life. The committee’s report added: ‘This is not the first case in which it has been alleged that files relating to child sexual exploitation have disappeared.’ The influential panel also demands new powers of recall for police and crime commissioners after South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright clung to his position for weeks before finally quitting. The full horror of the scandal over 16 years came to light in August in the Jay Report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Okay little buddy, let me explain this to you. Sometimes, there are people who are supposed to take care of and protect others, but instead, they do very bad things.

This includes airplanes which are objects that need to move. 2. The second hint says that \\"airplanes create thrust using propellers, jet engines, or rockets.\\" This implies that one of the ways airplanes can create the necessary thrust to move is through the use of propellers. 3.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.  The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.  A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.  I am facing a new situation today: Dan and Joey bot got into sugaring fruit and veggies, as they are vegan. Dan candied apples, pears, plums and quince. Joey candied ginger, peaches, pineapple and oranges but had some humidity in the room the fruit didn't turn out right.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fruit had a shorter shelf life because of bad preservation, apples or ginger? A:","output":"A: Given the new situation, the ginger had a shorter shelf life because of bad preservation. This is because Joey, who candied ginger, peaches, pineapple, and oranges, had some humidity in the room, which negatively affected the sugaring process.

As he stands up, Rachel floors it and slams into him, sending him flying into a nearby field. At this time, police cars arrive and Rachel leaves the truck to go speak with them, telling Jamie to stay there. But Jamie is too curious and walks over to Michael's lifeless body, taking his hand in hers. Right then, Rachel spots her and yells for her not to touch him. Suddenly, Michael's grip tightens on his knife as he begins to rise. Jamie ducks down as the police begin firing at him. Michael eventually stumbles backwards into an abandoned mine shaft, apparently dead. The police then set up a dynamite, causing the entire shaft to explode, but Michael, who we now know is alive, but mortally wounded, has already managed to crawl out into the river below. Next to the river is a small cottage where a hermit and his pet parrot live. The hermit stands by a stove, stirring something in a pot as the parrot chatters away. Annoyed, the hermit yells at it to be quiet as Michael slowly approaches the cottage outside. The hermit, now suspicious that someone might be outside, ventures out the door, finding nothing at all. As he goes back into the house, Michael suddenly leaps out and grabs him by the neck, but he then falls over, unconscious once again. The hermit stands, shocked, wondering who this strange man in a mask is.The scene then cuts to October 30, 1989, almost a year later. Jamie is in the Haddonfield Children's Clinic, shaking in her bed. She has been attached to several devices and is clearly having a horrific nightmare.

The satellite , which carried a payload of both C band and Ku band transponders , was launched on June 24 , 1993 and operated by PanAmSat Corporation . Control of Galaxy IV was lost on May 19 , 1998 when the satellite 's primary control processor failed . The backup control processor had suffered a previously undetected anomaly , and PanAmSat was not able to regain control of the spacecraft . Galaxy IV was declared a loss on May 20 , 1998 . Failure of the primary control processor was attributed to tin whisker growth , a phenomenon in which tendrils grow from solder , causing an electrical short circuit . Engineers believe that a hole developed in the conformal wax coating over the solder , allowing whiskers to develop . The satellite manufacturer , Hughes , has replaced pure tin plating with nickel to alleviate the problem in newer designs , adding 45 to 90 kg per payload . The loss of this satellite was very disruptive to telecommunications in the United States . Pagers were affected greatly ; service was not restored for days . Wire news services , like Reuters , were also affected . The TV network CBS had to use alternate means of transmitting its programs , as did NPR . At the time of failure , Galaxy IV was in geostationary orbit at 99 ° W. This orbital slot was briefly occupied by Galaxy 4R , and is now occupied by the Galaxy VI satellite . Galaxy IV remains in space .  - An Internet service provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing and using the Internet. Internet service providers may be organized in various forms, such as commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned.  - Univision is an American Spanish language broadcast television network that is owned by Univision Communications. The network's programming is aimed at Latino Americans and includes telenovelas and other drama series, sports, sitcoms, reality and variety series, news programming, and imported Spanish-language feature films.  - In telecommunication, a transponder is one of two types of devices. In air navigation or radio frequency identification, a flight transponder is an automated transceiver in an aircraft that emits a coded identifying signal in response to an interrogating received signal. In a communications satellite, a satellite transponder receives signals over a range of uplink frequencies usually from a satellite ground station, amplifies them, and re-transmits them on a different set of downlink frequencies to receivers on Earth, often without changing the content of the received signal or signals.  - The former PanAmSat Corporation founded in 1984 by Reynold (Rene) Anselmo, was a satellite service provider headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut. It operated a fleet of communications satellites used by the entertainment industry, news agencies, internet service providers, government agencies, and telecommunication companies. Anselmo got the idea for PanAmSat from Norm Leventhal, a communications lawyer in Washington, D.C., to whom he had turned to for advice regarding difficulties he was encountering in getting reasonably priced satellite transmission for his Spanish International Network (SIN), the current-day Univision. Anselmo financed the entire project himself and Leventhal's law firm, hiring Martin Rothblatt for special satellite technical advice, filed for approval from the Federal Communications Commission and lining up an initial satellite from RCA Astro-Electronics and a heavily discounted launch from Arianespace.  - A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. There are over 2,000 communications satellites in Earths orbit, used by both private and government organizations.  - Greenwich is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a total population of 61,171. The largest town on Connecticut's Gold Coast, it is home to many hedge funds and other financial service companies.

Initially reluctant, the group eventually decides to evade the authority of Mikey's older brother, Brandon, and escape for one last \\"Goonie adventure\\".They head down the coast and stumble upon a derelict seaside restaurant that seems to match coordinates set by the map and an old doubloon, unaware that the Fratellis, a family of fugitives, are using the restaurant as their hideout.

Which entity is this text about? , Malcolm Denzil Marshall (18 April 1958 - 4 November 1999) was a West Indian cricketer. Primarily a fast bowler, Marshall is regarded as one of the finest and fastest pacemen ever to have played Test cricket. His Test bowling average of 20.94 is the best of anyone who has taken 200 or more wickets. He achieved his bowling success despite being, by the standards of other fast bowlers, a short man - he stood at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), while most of the great quicks have been well above 6 feet (1.8 m) and many great West Indian fast bowlers, such as Joel Garner, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, were 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) or above. Marshall made his Test debut in the Second Test at Bangalore on 15 December 1978. He immediately developed a career-long antipathy to Dilip Vengsarkar due to his aggressive appealing. Despite doing little of note in the three Tests he played on that tour, he did take 37 wickets in all first-class games, and Hampshire saw enough in him to take him on as their overseas player for 1979, remaining with the county until 1993. He was in West Indies' World Cup squad, but did not play a match in the tournament. Hampshire were not doing well at the time, but nevertheless he took 47 first-class wickets, as well as picking up 5-13 against Glamorgan in the John Player League.  Marshall came to prominence in 1980, when in the third Test at Old Trafford he accounted for Mike Gatting, Brian Rose and Peter Willey in short order to spark an England collapse, although the match was eventually drawn despite Marshall taking 7-24. After 1980/81 he was out of the Test side for two years, but an excellent 1982 season when he took 134 wickets at under 16 apiece, including a career-best 8-71 against Worcestershire, saw him recalled and thereafter he remained a fixture until the end of his international career.  In seven successive Test series from 1982/83 to 1985/86 he took 21 or more wickets each time, in the last five of them averaging under 20. His most productive series in this period was the 1983/84 rubber against India, when he claimed 33 wickets as well as averaging 34 with the bat and making his highest Test score of 92 at Kanpur. A few months later he took five in an innings twice at home against Australia. At the peak of his career, he turned down an offer of US1 million to join a rebel West Indies team on a tour to South Africa, still suffering international sporting isolation due to apartheid.","output":"This text is about Malcolm Denzil Marshall, a West Indian cricketer who was primarily a fast bowler and is regarded as one of the finest and fastest pacemen to have played Test cricket."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The Iraqi revolt against the British, also known as the 1920 Iraqi Revolt or Great Iraqi Revolution, started in Baghdad in the summer of 1920 with mass demonstrations by Iraqis, including protests by embittered officers from the old Ottoman army, against the British occupation of Iraq. The revolt gained momentum when it spread to the largely tribal Shia regions of the middle and lower Euphrates. Sheikh Mehdi Al-Khalissi was a prominent Shia leader of the revolt. Sunni and Shia religious communities cooperated during the revolution as well as tribal communities, the urban masses, and many Iraqi officers in Syria. The objectives of the revolution were independence from British rule and creation of an Arab government. Though the revolt achieved some initial success, by the end of October 1920, the British had crushed the revolt. Although the revolt was largely over by the end of 1920, elements of it dragged on until 1922.

The Eastern land was covered in wetlands, not very good for building or farming on it, but the Western land had a good rich soil good for agriculture.  Which land had fewer wetland plants growing on it?  Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, the Western land would have fewer wetland plants growing on it. The Eastern land is described as being covered in wetlands, which are characterized by hypoxic soils due to flooding. Wetland plants, such as water-lilies, have adaptations like aerenchyma to cope with these low-oxygen conditions, allowing them to thrive in the flooded and hypoxic soils present in wetlands. On the other hand, the Western land has rich soil that is suitable for agriculture. Agricultural land typically requires well-drained soil with good aeration, which implies that there is less likelihood of extensive wetland areas, flooding, or hypoxia. Consequently, the Western land would have a lower abundance of wetland plants, as these conditions are not ideal for their growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, in some cases, a single incorrect letter can result in a hilarious and unintended twist. One such incident occurred in the recent romance novel titled \\"Baby, I'm Yours,\\" written by Susan Andersen. The Unfortunate Typo The novel features a passionate scene between two characters, but an unfortunate typo steals the spotlight. The passage reads, \\"He stiffened for a moment but then she felt his muscles loosen as he shitted on the ground.\\" Of course, the author meant to write 'shifted' instead of 'shitted,' which drastically changed the meaning and mood of the scene. Author's Response Susan Andersen was understandably embarrassed and mortified by the slip in her novel. In a statement addressing the issue, she wrote, \\"Shifted—he shifted!” as a means to apologize to her readers who had purchased the book in e-book form.  Immediate Action Cognizant of the seriousness of the error, Andersen contacted her editor and emphasized the need to rectify the typo in the e-book version promptly. While physical copies of the novel may still carry the mistake, one can hope that the digital versions will have the corrected text. A Lesson for Writers and Editors This humorous incident serves as an important reminder to writers and editors alike – proofreading is a crucial aspect of the publication process. The smallest of mistakes can drastically alter the meaning of a sentence or scene, ultimately affecting the reader's experience. Conclusion In the world of writing, typos are an unavoidable reality, and some can become the source of laughter and storytelling.

Review title: para dormir Product review: Un elenco exhorbitante carente de parlamentos con sentido comun. La historia es buena pero vagamente trabajada. Para un dia de lluvia y a falta de cualquier otra pelicula o evento de ver, pues resuelve. Answer:","output":"This review would decrease the chances of me buying the product. Step-by-step justification: 1. The review is in Spanish, so the first step is to understand it. The title loosely translates as \\"for sleeping\\". This implies that the person who wrote the review may find the product boring or unengaging, which is generally a negative sentiment.     2. The main body of the review translates to something like \\"An exorbitant cast lacking in common sense dialogues. The story is good but vaguely worked. For a rainy day and in the absence of any other movie or event to watch, it solves.\\" This review seems to be about a movie or a show. 3. While the reviewer does note that the story is good, they also criticize the dialogue and describe the story as 'vaguely worked'. These are negative points that lower the overall assessment of the product. 4. The last line suggests that this product would be a last resort - good for a rainy day when there's nothing else to watch. 5. Therefore, the overall tone of the review is more negative than positive, so this would likely decrease the chances of buying the product.  However, it’s worth mentioning that tastes and preferences can be subjective and diverse among different users. What one user might not like might appeal to another. Yet, typically, we assume average preferences for determining how a review might affect potential customers."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Problem:Paragraph- Sent 1: If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. Sent 2: If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. Sent 3: In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Sent 4: Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. Sent 5: No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. Sent 6: In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. Sent 7: In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sent 8: Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. Sent 9: \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. Sent 10: \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? Sent 11: That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\"Sent 12: Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Sent 13: Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Sent 14: Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. Sent 15: She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. Sent 16: West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. Sent 17: \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. Sent 18: \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.  Question: How many defendants were ordered to pay the maximum fine of 1000, and how long after a PFA is filed does the plaintiff have to establish a custody order?. Solution:","output":"Task explanation: 1. Understand the question: The question asks for the number of defendants ordered to pay the maximum fine of 1000 and the duration within which a plaintiff has to establish a custody order after filing a PFA. 2. Extract information from the paragraph: Read through the paragraph to find relevant information: Sent 5 mentions the maximum fine paid was 250. Sent 12 mentions the maximum fine for contempt of PFA is 1000. Sent 15 mentions that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. 3. Craft an incorrect answer: Based on the information extracted, form an incorrect answer that closely relates to the content but does not truthfully answer the question.

Can you fix that?","output":"Certainly, I can fix the sentence that you provided with the correct capitalization. The revised sentence would look something like: \\"A Classic Color That Is Always in Step With the Times and Scientific Research.\\" Let's dissect this sentence to understand why the changes were made: 1. \\"A Classic Color\\": Both 'a' and 'classic color' stand at the start of the sentence, so the letter 'a' needs to be capitalized. Also, 'classic color' is a key segment of the sentence, so both 'classic' and 'color' are capitalized. However, it's not necessarily a requirement to capitalize these words in regular sentences unless it's a title or heading. 2. \\"That Is Always in Step\\": 'That' is a conjunction joining the previous and the following phrases. Generally, we do not capitalize conjunctions, prepositions or articles (a, an, the) unless they are at the beginning of the sentence or title. However, 'is' is a verb, and 'Always' an adverb, 'in Step' being a prepositional phrase marking a point in time linked to style or progression. In title capitalization methods, it's acceptable to capitalize these. 3. \\"With the Times\\": 'With' is a preposition and following above logic, it can be capitalized. 'The' is an article word and it is typically lower case in sentence structures unless it begins the sentence or the sentence intended is a title. 'Times' here refers to different time periods or eras, which makes it a focal point of the sentence. 4. \\"And Scientific Research\\": The word 'and' is a conjunction, allowing it to be lower-case in regular sentences. But in this sentence structure, similar to previous logic, it can be capitalized. 'Scientific Research' are two key words representing a specific field of study, making them important enough to be capitalized in the context of this sentence treated as a title. Do note that capitalization rules can slightly differ based on specific style guides like APA, MLA or the Chicago Manual of Style. The changes made here reflect 'title case' capitalization which is commonly used for titles of books, articles, or chapters. In regular sentence structures, only the first word of a sentence and proper nouns are typically capitalized."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

As the evening progressed, it became increasingly evident that the chemistry between Derrick and Justin was nowhere near what either of them had expected. The awkward silences and forced laughter filled the atmosphere throughout the extravagant candlelit dinner. Derrick, trying to salvage any possible connection, desperately steered the conversation towards topics he believed might pique Justin's interest. Despite his efforts, nothing seemed to work, and Justin became continuously uncomfortable with each passing minute. Having heard so much about Justin through mutual friends, Derrick had found himself incredibly attracted to him on both a physical and personal level before ever meeting. He had thought that a lavish dinner would be the perfect way to impress Justin and potentially stir up romantic sentiments. However, as the dinner unfolded, it became glaringly apparent that the two were remarkably different, and the compatibility that Derrick had initially imagined simply didn't exist. On the other side of the table, Justin, a modest and self-sufficient individual, felt a gnawing sense of guilt as he attempted to endure the failed date with the ever-so-attentive Derrick. To Justin, the ostentatious dinner was not only overwhelming but also felt like an unnecessary waste. As the expensive wine flowed, the weight of Derrick's financial investment in this evening only amplified Justin's feeling of being used, further intensifying his discomfort. Although Justin was genuinely appreciative of Derrick's generous gesture, he couldn't shake the feeling that it was done solely as an attempt to wooing him. The conspicuous disparity between their expectations and reality made it almost impossible for Justin to enjoy what should have been a pleasant, stress-free meal. The fact that he had allowed Derrick to pay for such an overpriced dinner, in spite of their evident lack of spark, only worsened the situation. It left Justin feeling not only emotionally uncomfortable but also guilty that Derrick spent a significant amount of money on this ultimately fruitless encounter. As the night drew to a close, both Derrick and Justin struggled to find a suitable way to bring the intolerably uncomfortable evening to an end. Derrick, utterly disappointed and confused by the lack of connection, found himself questioning what went wrong, while Justin was wracked with guilt, feeling as though he had used Derrick for a meal he had no intention of reciprocating with genuine interest or affection. The perplexing experience would ultimately leave both men cautious and self-aware in their subsequent romantic encounters, reinforcing the importance of compatibility and honest communication over material displays of affection in building a successful relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: What was the capital of the ancient Assyrian civilisation?","output":"The capital of the ancient Assyrian civilization was not static throughout its long history, but rather shifted between several major cities over time, reflecting the varying centers of power and influence within the empire. However, the most well-known and influential capitals of the ancient Assyrian civilization were Ashur, Nimrud (also known as Kalhu or Calah), Dur-Sharrukin, and Nineveh. 1. Ashur: The city of Ashur (also spelled Assur or Asshur) was the original and most ancient capital of the Assyrian civilization. Located on the western bank of the Tigris River in modern-day Iraq, Ashur was an important religious and cultural hub as well as a center of political power. It was named after the Assyrian national deity, Ashur, emphasizing the city's significance to the Assyrian people. The rise of the Assyrian civilization can be traced back to the early second millennium BCE, when Ashur was established as the capital. Although the capital later shifted to other cities, Ashur continued to hold immense religious and cultural importance for the Assyrians, with numerous temples, palaces, and artifacts found in the archaeological remains of the city. 2. Nimrud: The city of Nimrud, also referred to as Kalhu or Calah, became the capital of the Assyrian Empire during the reign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BCE). Nimrud, located upstream along the Tigris River from Ashur, was chosen as the new capital for its strategic military position and fertile soil. Ashurnasirpal II carried out a massive reconstruction of the city, commissioning grand palaces, temples, and monuments adorned with intricate reliefs and sculptures. The famous Northwest Palace, which contained the so-called \\"Banquet Stele of Ashurnasirpal II,\\" was among these grand constructions. Under the patronage of subsequent kings, Nimrud continued to flourish both culturally and politically for more than a century. 3. Dur-Sharrukin: In 717 BCE, King Sargon II decided to create a monumental, purpose-built capital that would exhibit Assyria's wealth and glory. Dur-Sharrukin, today known as Khorsabad, was the result, located about 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) northeast of Nineveh. The city featured numerous grand buildings, including palaces, temples, and administrative structures, all constructed within a monumental walled temenos. The walls themselves were decorated with narrative reliefs, depicting scenes of warfare, hunting, and daily life in Assyria. Despite its monumental scale and architectural significance, Dur-Sharrukin's period as capital was short-lived. Upon Sargon II's death in 705 BCE, his son and successor, Sennacherib, abandoned the city to focus on the expansion and development of Nineveh. 4. Nineveh: Nineveh, located near the modern city of Mosul in Iraq, rose to prominence as the Assyrian capital in the early seventh century BCE during the reign of King Sennacherib. Nineveh was an ancient city, with its roots stretching back to the early 3rd millennium BCE, but Sennacherib transformed it into one of the world's largest and most magnificent cities of its time. He ordered the construction of an extensive aqueduct system, beautiful gardens, and a colossal palace known as the \\"Palace without Rival.\\" Nineveh remained the capital of Assyria until the empire's fall in 612 BCE, when it was sacked by a coalition of the Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians. Notably, Nineveh's grand library under King Ashurbanipal contained a collection of clay tablets with writings in cuneiform script, a trove of priceless information on ancient Mesopotamia that has been essential to modern understanding of the Assyrian civilization. In conclusion, throughout the ancient Assyrian civilization, the capital shifted between several cities, including Ashur, Nimrud, Dur-Sharrukin, and Nineveh. Each of these cities experienced generations of political, cultural, and architectural significance while serving as the capital, reflecting the dynamic and evolving nature of the Assyrian world. Today, their archaeological remains continue to provide invaluable insights into the history and culture of the Assyrian Empire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.  Paragraph: John was pondering about what makes a chemical reaction faster or slower. To find the answer he did two tests, test A and test B. In test A he warmed up the reactants, but in test B he cooled down the reactants. To see a practical example of these tests he conducted two more tests, test C and test D. In test C he kept a food item in the refrigerator, but in test D he kept the same food item on the table top.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would particles of reactants in test A have lower or higher energy than particles in test B? Answer:","output":"The particles of reactants in test A would have higher energy than particles in test B. In test A, John warmed up the reactants, which would cause the particles to have more energy and move faster, resulting in a faster reaction rate. In contrast, in test B, he cooled down the reactants, leading to particles with lower energy and a slower reaction rate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

On August 22, 2010 in rural Ohio, serial killer Edward Scarka is shot to death during a police raid of his farmhouse. At the time of Edward's death, married couple Sarah and John give birth to their son, Miles, in Pennsylvania. Miles shows extreme wisdom and intelligence from quite a young age, and begins speaking fluently before he is even a toddler. When Miles turns eight in 2018, Sarah and John begin noticing behavioral changes in him. One night he plays a prank on his babysitter Zoe, seriously injuring her, but claims no memory of the incident. Days later at school, he attacks a classmate with a wrench he obtains from the janitor's closet. Sarah brings Miles to psychologist Elaine Strasser, and also turns over a tape recording of Miles talking apparent gibberish in his sleep. Elaine gives the tape to a colleague, Arthur Jacobson, an expert on rebirth and reincarnation. Arthur reveals that the gibberish Miles spoke on the tape is in fact Hungarian, and that the words translate to \\"I'll cut your eyes out and watch you die, whore.\\" Unwilling to believe Arthur's assertion that an unsettled spirit is vying for control of Miles's body, Sarah dismisses him. Later at home, the family's dog goes missing, and John becomes infuriated when he finds that Miles has been recording the couple's bedroom with a baby monitor. John leaves to stay with his brother, leaving Sarah alone with Miles in the house. Miles awakens her in the middle of the night, and she finds a swarm of flies in the house. In the basement, Sarah discovers the family's dismembered dog. Miles apologizes, and explains that someone is invading his dreams every night, and that he has to \\"make room.\\" A:","output":"In the given article, the person who attacks a classmate with a wrench is Miles, the eight-year-old son of Sarah and John.

Baldwin has really stooped low to make such movies. The script, the music, just about everything in this movie is a waste of time. The sound FX do not sound real, they stick out way too much (technical gadgets etc.) If they are trying to make a movie about things like this, at least try to get real with it and drop those extra bleeps and beeps, because those gadgets don't really make loud sounds like that. Natural sounds like footsteps and such are non-existent, which gives it a void-like atmosphere. Directing seems to be OK for such a low budget film (I sure hope it was a low budget production), although it does seem fairly amateurish at times. Most characters seem empty and false, they simply haven't casted this movie very well. I'd imagine it would've been a better idea to make Baldwin speak some Spanish than to make Spanish actors speak English, when we all know that theirs is the language which is more vibrant and alive, that is why the actors performance can suffer greatly if an odd language is used.

It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - Strømmens Værksted A/S was an industrial company based in Skedsmo, Norway, specializing in the production of rolling stock. Founded in 1873, it remains as a part of Bombardier Transportation. The plant is located just off Hovedbanen west of Strømmen Station.  - The term rolling stock originally referred to any vehicles that move on a railway. It has since expanded to include the wheeled vehicles used by businesses on roadways. It usually includes both powered and unpowered vehicles, for example locomotives, railroad cars, coaches, and wagons.  - A tram (also known as tramcar; and in North America known as streetcar, trolley or trolley car) is a rail vehicle which runs on tracks along public urban streets, and also sometimes on a segregated right of way. The lines or networks operated by tramcars are called tramways. Tramways powered by electricity, the most common type historically, were once called electric street railways (mainly in the USA). However, trams were widely used in urban areas before the universal adoption of electrification; other methods of powering trams are listed below under \\"History\\".  - Skedsmo is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Romerike. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Lillestrøm. About one third of the municipal population lives in Lillestrøm. Other important towns are Skedsmokorset, Skjetten and Strømmen. A smaller settlement adjoining Lillestrøm is Kjeller.  - Strømmen Station is a railway station on the Trunk Line in Skedsmo, Norway. It is served by the Oslo Commuter Rail line 400 operated by Norwegian State Railways running from Lillestrøm via Oslo S to Asker. The station was opened in 1854 along with the rest of the Trunk Line.  - Trondheim Bilruter or TBR was a municipally owned bus company in Trondheim, Norway between 1951 and 1974. It was merged with the tram operators Trondheim Sporvei and A/S Graakalbanen in 1974 to form Trondheim Trafikkselskap. It is now part of Team Trafikk, a subsidiary of Nettbuss.  - Bombardier Transportation is the rail equipment division of the Canadian firm Bombardier Inc. Bombardier Transportation is one of the world's largest companies in the rail vehicle and equipment manufacturing and servicing industry. The division is headquartered in Berlin, Germany, and has regional offices and major development facilities in Canada (Montreal and Toronto) and the United States (Plattsburgh, New York). Bombardier Transportation has many minor production and development facilities worldwide.  - Nettbuss AS is the largest bus company in Norway, owned by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB).

In addition to bus services in major parts of Norway, it also operates buses in Sweden through subsidiaries.  - Trondheim Sporvei was a municipally owned tram operator in Trondheim, Norway that existed between 1936 and 1974. The company operated the municipal parts of the Trondheim Tramway until it was merged with A/S Graakalbanen and Trondheim Bilruter to create Trondheim Trafikkselskap. That company has become part of Nettbuss, the largest Norwegian bus company in Norway which is owned by Norwegian State Railways (\\"Norges Statsbaner AS\\").  - The Trondheim Tramway in Trondheim, Norway, is the world's most northerly tramway system, following the closure and dismantling of the Arkhangelsk tramways in Russia.

They were delivered in two slightly different batches ; ten in 1948 -- 49 and six in 1955 . On 10 October 1956 , almost all operative trams used by the company were lost to the flames . Subsequently , Trondheim Sporvei ordered the Class 6 from Strømmen . Five engines were salvaged from the fire , and were reused in trams 1 through 5 . The remaining deliveries were numbered 10 -- 32 . The trams delivered with new motors , had four NEBB motors with a power output of 43 kW ( 58 hp ) . The Class 6 remained in service until 1984 , when the Class 8 was delivered . Until then , the Class 7 served as the only tram on the Trondheim Tramway . Four trams and one trailer have been preserved by the Trondheim Tramway Museum .  - Trondheim Trafikkselskap or TT was the city public transport company for Trondheim, Norway between 1974 and 2001. It operated both the city buses, and the Trondheim Tramway until 1988.

The broad meaning of the term, such as in the history of technology and economic history, usually applies to a region or national economy. Broadly speaking, electrification was the build out of the electrical generating and distribution systems which occurred in Britain, the United States, and other countries from the mid-1880s until around 1950 and is in progress in rural areas in some developing countries. This included the change over from line shaft and belt drive using steam engines and water power to electric motors.  - Norges Statsbaner AS, trading as NSB AS and known in English as the Norwegian State Railways, is a government-owned railway company which operates most passenger train services in Norway. Owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, it is also engaged in real estate through Rom Eiendom, bus transport through Nettbuss, cargo trains through CargoNet and Swedish train transport through Tågkompaniet.

It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Trondheim, historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway.

The men round up Sally and her eight students, who range in age from six to fourteen, and force them into a van, claiming they are going to hold the school for ransom. At first Sally urges her students to comply, but she manages to help the children escape during a rest stop. They make their way to a farmhouse where an elderly couple (with no telephone) offers to hide them until the police can be contacted. But when their kidnappers track them down and murder their saviours, Sally knows that their chances of survival are slim.The kidnappers herd the school into a cave, sealing the entrance. Sally encourages the children to be brave and to organise themselves. Travelling further back into the cave, they find an exit and escape, only to find their armed kidnappers in pursuit and furious. The school isolates itself into a second, \\"fortress\\"-like cave at the top of a hill, where they must prepare for the coming night, when the kidnappers will reach them at last. Sally realises that the kidnappers will have to die, and also that she cannot defeat four grown men without help.

Write a title for this article: Getting back on the horse…I mean course After my injury during a training run ahead of a World Cup event in Val d'Isère, France, the first phone call I made was to my parents. The first thing my mom said, after a long deep breath of shock as she knew my dream of competing in a home Olympics — the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games — was over, was “thank God it wasn’t your head.” At the end of the day, it is just a knee, and everyone comes back from ACL injuries, right? Well, sadly, I had a more serious injury than I had expected. It was a full dislocation rupturing my ACL, MCL, PCL, fracturing my tibial plateau, with IT-Band coming off with bone, and losing all the articular cartilage under my knee cap. It took three surgical procedures to put me back together. Still, I got back and raced World Cup downhill again. How did I feel the first time I got in the gate to race? Remarkably normal, this is what I did after all. I felt good, calm, and aggressive. Although I’d never faced such an intense injury of my own, mentally, I’d overcome the injuries of countless other athletes to push out of the gate, so I was well practised by the time I did it for myself. Once I reached the finish line of my first race back, a World Cup in St. Moritz, Switzerland, I did what I always did. I looked up to the scoreboard to see how I fared. I wasn’t very fast, and just as I was about to sulk, I lifted my head… My peers, friends, and the stands full of fans, were cheering and clapping as hard as if I’d won. They knew the work it had taken to get there, to be competing again. It was a beautiful moment, and one I’m thankful to have experienced. During the peak of my career, I had an assortment of quotes in an art collection on my bathroom wall. One always grabbed my attention most. It summed up what I tried to do every day on the hill, “Leap and the net will appear” — Naturalist and nature essayist John Burroughs (Large photos courtesy Kelly VanderBeek and Getty Images)","output":"Title: \\"Overcoming the Odds: A Skier's Journey from Devastating Injury to Triumph on the Slopes\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations. Question: When do you make colomba? Options:  A. not enough information  B. During Chritmas  C. During Thanksgiving  D. During Easter The answer is:","output":"D.

Read this article and answer this question After the Lithuanians were defeated in the Battle of Strėva by the Teutonic Knights in 1348, Liubartas lost all territories except for eastern Volhynia with Lutsk to Casimir and his ally Louis I of Hungary . Liubartas' brothers Algirdas and Kęstutis organized several expeditions to Poland and Red Ruthenia. Lithuanians allied themselves with Muscovy: Liubartas married an unnamed daughter of Konstantin of Rostov, a relative of Simeon of Moscow, and Algirdas married Uliana of Tver, sister-in-law of Simeon. In spring 1351, Lubartas was taken prisoner by Louis, but was released in summer after a truce was agreed upon with Kęstutis. The deal fell through and more military attacks followed in 1352. Another truce, rather favorable to the Lithuanians, was signed in fall 1352: Lubartas received not only Volhynia and Podolia, but also Belz and Chełm. However, already in 1353, Liubartas attacked again. Casimir responded by organizing a large campaign against the pagan Lithuanians with a special permission from Pope Innocent VI. After the campaign did not achieve the desired results, Casimir contemplated an alliance with the Lithuanians. In 1366, Casimir, allied with Siemowit III of Masovia and nephews of Liubartas, resumed the war. As Algirdas was involved in conflicts in the east and Kęstutis fought with the Teutonic Knights, Liubartas had to defend alone and was defeated. In fall 1366, a treaty was signed: Liubartas retained only eastern Volhynia with Lutsk and became somewhat dependent on Poland . Casimir awarded his allies: Yuri, son of Karijotas, received Chełm, his brother Alexander received Volodymyr-Volynskyi, and Yuri, son of Narimantas, continued to rule Belz. How many years passed between Liubartas losing all territories except Volhynia and Lubartas being taken prisoner?","output":"Liubartas lost all territories except for eastern Volhynia in 1348 after the Battle of Strėva. He was taken prisoner by Louis in spring 1351. To calculate the number of years that passed between these two events, subtract 1348 from 1351: 1351 - 1348 = 3 years So, 3 years passed between Liubartas losing all territories except Volhynia and him being taken prisoner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

John Starling Chapple was the office manager, joining Burges's practice in 1859. It was Chapple, designer of most of the furniture for Castell Coch, who completed its restoration after Burges's death. Second to Chapple was William Frame, who acted as clerk of works. Horatio Walter Lonsdale was Burges's chief artist, contributing extensive murals for both Castell Coch and Cardiff Castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls who started with Burges at Cork, completing hundreds of figures for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, worked with him on his two major churches in Yorkshire, and undertook all of the original carving for the Animal Wall at Cardiff.William Gualbert Saunders joined the Buckingham Street team in 1865 and worked with Burges on the development of the design and techniques of stained-glass manufacture, producing much of the best glass for Saint Fin Barre's. Ceccardo Egidio Fucigna was another long-time collaborator who sculpted the Madonna and Child above the drawbridge at Castell Coch, the figure of St John over the mantelpiece in Lord Bute's bedroom at Cardiff Castle and the bronze Madonna in the roof garden. Lastly, there was Axel Haig, a Swedish-born illustrator, who prepared many of the watercolour perspectives with which Burges entranced his clients. Crook calls them \\"a group of talented men, moulded in their master's image, art-architects and medievalists to a man – jokers and jesters too – devoted above all to art rather than to business.\\" contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls?, what is it ?

Mylan, now in the crosshairs over severe price hikes for its EpiPen, said Thursday,... (Associated Press)      NEW YORK (AP) — Mylan, in the face of heated criticism over price hikes for its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment, is bulking up programs that help patients pay for the drug.      The generic drugmaker laid out a plan on Thursday to expand its patient assistance program and offer 300 savings cards for its EpiPen 2-Pak.      There is no change in the price of the treatment, however, which is what has drawn ire both in Congress and from families that have had to shell out increasingly large sums for the potentially life-saving treatment.      Mylan has hiked prices for EpiPen as frequently as three times a year over the past nine years. A two-dose EpiPen package cost around 94 nine years ago but has climbed more than 600 percent to an average cost of 608 in May, according to the Elsevier Clinical Solutions' Gold Standard Drug Database.      Mylan did not immediately return calls from The Associated Press early Thursday about the drug's price.      Mylan N.V. said it's doubling eligibility for its patient assistance program, which it said will get rid of out-of-pocket costs for uninsured and underinsured patients and families. It also noted that the 300 savings card will cover about half the cost patients who would otherwise have to pay the full list price.      Patients will also be able to order the injected emergency medicine for severe allergic reactions directly from the company, to help lower costs, Mylan said.      Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and members of Congress from both parties have been calling on Mylan to address the pricing.      Pharmaceutical and biotech industries can fuel American innovation, and combat debilitating diseases, Clinton said in the statement Wednesday. But she added that \\"it's wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them.\\"      Last year, more than 3.6 million U.S. prescriptions for two-packs of EpiPens were filled, according to data firm IMS Health. That earned Mylan nearly 1.7 billion.      EpiPens are used in emergencies to treat severe allergies that can lead to anaphylactic shock. Roughly 40 million Americans have severe allergies to spider bites, bee stings and foods like nuts, eggs and shellfish. ||||| Drugmaker Mylan is promising to double the eligibility for its EpiPen assistance program following a pricing backlash from consumers, but the company stopped shorted of reducing or capping prices of the emergency allergy treatment.

(NASDAQ, TASE: MYL) today announced it is taking immediate action to further enhance access to EpiPen® (epinephrine injection, USP) Auto-Injector by expanding already existing programs in recognition of those patients who are facing the burden of higher out-of-pocket costs. The company is reducing the patient cost of EpiPen® Auto-Injector through the use of a savings card which will cover up to 300 for their EpiPen 2-Pak®.

Mylan CEO Heather Bresch said, \\"We have been a long-term, committed partner to the allergy community and are taking immediate action to help ensure that everyone who needs an EpiPen® Auto-Injector gets one. We recognize the significant burden on patients from continued, rising insurance premiums and being forced increasingly to pay the full list price for medicines at the pharmacy counter. Patients deserve increased price transparency and affordable care, particularly as the system shifts significant costs to them. However, price is only one part of the problem that we are addressing with today's actions.

In 2015, this resulted in nearly 80% of these patients paying nothing out of pocket for their EpiPen® Auto-Injector. However, as the health insurance environment has evolved, driven by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, patients and families enrolled in high deductible health insurance plans, who are uninsured, or who pay cash at the pharmacy, have faced higher costs for their medicine.      Mylan is taking the following immediate actions to help further address the needs of patients and families:      For patients in health plans who face higher out-of-pocket costs, the company is providing immediate relief by offering a savings card for up to 300 .

Please briefly summarize this news article: Protesters rally for 2nd night against decision in Eric Garner case This article is published in partnership with Time.com. The original version can be found here. Thousands of protesters gathered in major U.S. cities for a second night Thursday to rally against the police-involved deaths this year of unarmed black men, just hours after New York’s mayor announced a citywide police retraining program and one day after the news that a white officer would not be indicted in the death of Eric Garner. A large and rowdy crowd gathered at Foley Square in Lower Manhattan, as similar protests popped up in Washington, D.C., Chicago and elsewhere, echoing demonstrations the night earlier. Garner died in July after officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in a chokehold, an aggressive move that is banned by the New York Police Department. Wednesday’s grand jury announcement, which came just over a week after a similar outcome in the Ferguson, Mo., case involving teenager Michael Brown, sparked an immediate outcry and led a number of activists and elected officials to demand a federal investigation. Attorney General Eric Holder announced Wednesday that the Justice Department had opened a civil rights inquiry into the incident, which was caught on video and later went viral. As footage of the rallies filled news segments Thursday evening, with many protesters chanting Garner’s final words “I can’t breathe,” his mother Gwen Carr opened up about her reaction to the grand jury’s decision not to indict Pantaleo. “I couldn’t believe that they came back and didn’t come back with probable cause to bring this case to trial. I couldn’t even answer a phone call,” she told CNN. “I just wonder… what video was they watching? Because obviously it wasn’t the one the whole world was watching.” Carr said she does not accept Pantaleo’s apology. “He was choking him and my son was begging for his life. That was the time for the apology. He should have got up off of him and let him breathe… I would have still had my son,” she added. “He has no regard for human life if this is the way he treats suspects.” She hopes that Pantaleo will still face charges in federal court.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does \\"It has one of the highest consumption taxes in the world and taxes all imports in lieu of an income tax system.\\" correctly answer the question of What does it do in place of an income tax system?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"It has one of the highest consumption taxes in the world and taxes all imports in lieu of an income tax system.\\" correctly answers the question of what it does in place of an income tax system. This statement suggests that instead of relying on the income tax system, the referred entity has implemented high consumption taxes and import taxes to generate its revenue. Consumption taxes, often known as value-added tax (VAT) or sales tax, are levied on goods and services when purchased. In this case, the entity appears to have one of the highest consumption taxes globally, which can be seen as a substitute for income tax. High consumption taxes can encourage savings and discourage excessive consumption, thus impacting the overall economy. Import taxes are imposed on imported goods and services. By taxing imports, a country can control its international trade activities, protect domestic industries, and generate revenue from international transactions. This tax system can also encourage foreign businesses to produce their goods and services domestically, leading to an increase in domestic production and employment opportunities. In countries that replace income tax with consumption and import taxes, the government's main revenue source shifts from taxing individuals and corporations based on their income to taxing their consumption of goods and services. This tax system has its advantages and disadvantages.  The advantages include promoting a more efficient allocation of resources, reducing tax evasion, and encouraging more savings and investments. On the other hand, the disadvantages include potential regressiveness, where lower-income individuals may end up paying a higher percentage of their income in taxes relative to wealthier individuals. The overall impact on economic growth, social welfare, and government revenue varies depending on specific tax rates and policy implementations.  In summary, the statement accurately answers the question of what the entity does in place of an income tax system. It has one of the highest consumption taxes in the world and taxes all imports, shifting the tax burden from the income generation to consumption and international trade activities. This alternative tax system can have various economic effects and social implications, and its effectiveness depends on how it is designed and applied."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There were calls today to shut down the BlackBerry Messenger service which is thought to have played a key role in helping mobilise looters involved in the riots across London. Mike Butcher, a technology journalist and digital adviser to Boris Johnson, said it was 'unbelievable' that the BBM service had not been disabled. Messages on the service, along with posts on Twitter, helped spread the locations of riots like wildfire and brought hordes of teenagers together to attack neighbourhoods throughout the weekend. Hackney: Smash and grab - A man jump kicks a store front window to get in and loot. Hackney: Looters queue to get in to a convenience store to get hold of its goods. Hackney: Hooded thieves take what they can from inside the store. The messenger service on BlackBerry. handsets, an instant, cheap and safe form of communication, helped. galvanise looters across London and nationwide over the weekend. The. BlackBerry itself is now the smartphone favoured by young people in. this country, and is used by a massive 37 per cent of British teens. Unlike social networks like Facebook and Twitter, messages sent through BBM cannot be traced back to the sender's phone. For the majority of teens with BlackBerrys, BBMS has replaced regular SMS messages which still cost around 10p each to send. BlackBerry UK were forced to deny weekend reports that they planned to disable the service. Research. in Motion, the firm behind BlackBerry and BBM, instead said they would. ‘engage with the authorities’ following the riots. Today, Mr Butcher described the BBM. service as 'text messaging with steroids', as Blackberry itself denied. reports it had planned to disable the messenging service. Mr Butcher had tweeted last night: 'It is unbelievable that @UK_BlackBerry is not shutting down BBM right now.' He told the BBC Today programme this. morning: 'Mobile phones have become weaponised in their capability of. spreading information about where to target next. 'There is evidence that BBM is an. encrypted, very secure, safe, fast, cheap, easy way for disaffected. urban youths to spread messages for their next target. 'It's like text messaging with. steroids - you can send messages to hundreds of people and once it's. gone from your phone it cannot be traced back to you.' BlackBerry UK had to deny reports over the weekend that it planned to shut down the messenging service. The firm instead tweeted that it would help the authorities with their investigation. Mr Butcher said police need to communicate with phone firms like BlackBerry to help anticipate future disturbances. He added: 'BlackBerry itself has said these messages are very hard to trace. Obviously there is going to have to be some kind of communication between the police and companies like BlackBerry to try to get the information befre the riots happen'. Mr Butcher has since removed the tweet from his Twitter feed and qualified his comments on the Today programme by adding that 'you could not shut down BBM because information would still be rooted around'. Young looters were accused of an opportunistic ‘Supermarket Sweep’ motivated by nothing other than greed. Dozens were filmed as they disappeared into the night with their arms laden with plasma TVs, laptops and sports clothes. Claims that rampant lawlessness was motivated by the death of Mark Duggan at the hands of police was quickly exposed as a lie. Some of those involved in attacks on stores in Enfield, Tottenham and Oxford Circus were barely old enough to be arrested. Messages on social networking sites and mobile phones spread like wildfire and brought hordes of teenagers, many covering their faces with masks and hoods, to shops and high streets. In some areas they were left to roam freely, forming queues outside smashed stores and pausing to try on footwear. Pictures of the young thieves posing with their loot were soon posted on the internet accompanied by gloating messages. Last night on Rye Lane in Peckham, a mob of 30 black youths wearing bandanas forced open the metal grill of a jewellers before smashing their way into the shop. Croydon: An Argos store was smashed into and looted on Monday night. [caption. Should BlackBerry Messenger be banned after 'inciting' the riots? Should BlackBerry Messenger be banned after 'inciting' the riots? Now share your opinion. Children, who bystanders say could. have been as young as seven, rushed inside to grab what they could. Scotland Yard revealed that an 11-year-old boy is the youngest of more. than 215 people who have been arrested over the rioting. He has since. been charged with burglary. The vast majority of those arrested. for offences including burglary, violent disorder and theft were aged in. their teens or early 20s. Many. of those involved were rallied by calls spread through mobile phone. messages and social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. One BlackBerry message urged people to arm themselves with hammers and to bring cars, vans and even trollies to help them cart off stolen goods. It added: ‘What ever ends [area] your from put your ballys [balaclavas] on link up and cause havoc, just rob everything. Police can’t stop it.’ Another message referred to Oxford Circus where a mob of about 50 youths attacked several businesses. A policeman said last night that children involved in the rioting and stealing were inspired by video game Grand Theft Auto. The 18-rated computer game is popular among teenagers, with many having the game given to them by their parents. In riot-hit Tottenham a police officer said: ‘These are bad people who did this. Kids are out of control. When I was young it was all Pacman and board games. Now they’re playing Grand Theft Auto and want to live it for themselves.’ The game, which is made by  Edinburgh-based firm Rockstar North, has been criticised for depicting carjackings, drive-by shootings and prostitution. It has also been accused of encouraging juvenile crime in Britain. Players are expected to commit crimes and build up their power in a fictional city by selling drugs and killing rival gangsters. There have been fears that some gamers may try to recreate scenes from the games for real. It called on ‘everyone from all sides of London’ to meet up, smash up shops and get some ‘free stuff’, adding: ‘if you see a fed [police] ... SHOOT!’ Lambeth Council leader Steve Reed condemned the ‘opportunistic looting’ as ‘thieving on a mass scale’. He added: ‘Somebody described it as gangs of kids doing Supermarket Sweep’. This is a reference to the 1990s gameshow in which contestants raced round a store to get as many items in a trolley as they could in a limited time. ‘It was Curry’s where they were after plasma screen TVs and H&M and Foot Locker where it was clothes and trainers,’ said Mr Reed. ‘It was thieving on a mass scale. I’ve heard stories of people actually trying on clothes and using wheelie bins to fill with goods. It wasn’t about social issues, it was an opportunity to go on the rob.’ Police warned that those who used the internet and mobile phones to issue inflammatory rallying calls could face prosecution. Intelligence experts are scouring public messages for evidence of those behind the mayhem. But. they could be impeded by the increased use of encrypted BlackBerry. devices to spread calls to arms among networks of friends. It. has emerged that the ‘shadow social network’ played a key role in. co-ordinated violence in Enfield, Tottenham and Oxford Circus. Police. are trawling through a mass of evidence that some of the worst scenes. were co-ordinated by rioters using mobile phones and the internet. They fear incendiary messages urging thugs to arm themselves with knives and hammers were circulated via BlackBerry devices. Brixton: A pawnbroker is hit by a gang of hooded thieves as a photographer watches on. Brixton: A WHSmith shop on Brixton Road is one of several looted by hundreds of rioters. Dalston: Youths are seen running with boxes near near the area's Kingsland shopping centre. Further updates boasted that police were powerless to stop the carnage as lawlessness spread quickly across London. Looter: Pictures put on Twitter showed some of the rioters using shopping trolleys to carry away stolen items including TVs and mobile phones. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Kavanagh said those caught using Twitter, BlackBerry messaging and other sites to stir up violence could be prosecuted. Asked whether those responsible for ‘inflammatory postings’ could be arrested, he replied: ‘Absolutely. Whether it be verbal communication, a placard or Twitter. This is the emerging way that we do policing.’ The use of BlackBerry smartphones is a worrying development for police because they are very difficult to monitor. They were once the preserve of business people looking to check their emails on the move but the messenger application, known as BBM, has proved irresistible to teenagers. It offers a text message-style service which is instant, free and private where users can exchange updates with individuals or large groups. The application has also been seized on by criminals, and security conscious businesses, because it is very difficult to intercept. Several countries, including the United Arab Emirates and India, have complained that BlackBerry messages are too secure and may be used by terrorists. In Enfield, 17-year-old witness Alice said she received a message on her phone telling people to come armed with knives and hammers. She said: ‘It was all planned. On BBM. there was a broadcast to everyone, which goes to everyone on someone’s. contact list, telling us to meet up with weapons.’ Mark Duggan, whose fatal shooting sparked some of the violence, sent his last message via BlackBerry messenger. He. told his girlfriend that the ‘Feds are following me’ from the back of a. minicab just minutes before the deadly confrontation in Tottenham last. Thursday. A BlackBerry spokesman suggested that the company may help police trace those responsible for stirring up violence. He said: ‘We feel for those impacted by the riots in London. We have engaged with the authorities to assist in any way we can.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In London, there were some riots and looters causing trouble. People believe that a messaging service on BlackBerry phones, called BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), played a big role in helping the looters come together and decide where to cause problems. This is because messages on BBM are private and can't be traced back to the person who sent them. Some people suggested that the BBM service should be shut down, but BlackBerry denied that they plan to do that. Instead, they said they would work with the authorities to help stop the riots."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: As last night's Republican presidential debate over national security issues demonstrated, credibility is crucial to winning a debate. Think of credibility like money you have in a bank. Each time you stretch it thin, you have less the next time you might need it. It is your own personal bank of believability. Knowing your arguments and facts is one way to gain credibility. Mitt Romney fattened his credibility bank account at the expense of Rick Perry, who supported a no fly zone over Syria. Romney argued that a no fly zone over Syria would be pointless since the Syrian government has 5,000 tanks. Romney jokingly said it would make more sense to impose a \\"no drive zone.\\" Jon Huntsman made a similar deposit when he stated that sanctions on Iran would not work since \\"the Chinese aren't going to play ball and the Russians aren't going to play ball,\\" and Iran has already decided to go nuclear. Huntsman's cited the examples of Libya (which gave up its nuclear ambition, and later the government was overthrown with the help of the United States) and North Korea (which has tested nuclear weapons and whose government is still in power.) Another way to maintain credibility is to cite proof for your arguments. Michele Bachmann has said things in previous debates (President Obama wants Medicare to collapse) and in last night's debate (suggesting that the CIA cannot interrogate terrorist suspects any longer because the ACLU is in charge) that were not very credible. These frequent ATM withdrawals hurt Bachmann because a lack of believability spills over. Her disagreement with Rick Perry about whether to give aid to Pakistan should have been an excellent point for her. She showcased her knowledge of the subject, saying that we exchange intelligence information and the United States must have our interest represented. Bachmann called Pakistan \\"too nuclear to fail,\\" and chastised Perry for being naÃ¯ve when he said he would not give Pakistan one penny until it proved it had America's best interests in mind. This was a terrific answer that warranted applause because it was thoughtful, logical and well reasoned. What did she get? Crickets. Why? Because her believability bank is in the red. Ron Paul is an enigma. He can provide such thoughtful answers at one time and later interject completely unsubstantiated statements. He was banking responsibly with his argument that the war on drugs was a failure and a reason for much of the violence in Mexico. Paul reminded us that prescription drugs kill many more people than illegal drugs do and that alcohol is a deadly drug. Paul's argument was factually accurate, even if unpopular with many conservatives. But then Paul writes an overdraft with moderate Republicans by saying things like aid to Africa for malaria or AIDS prevention is \\"all worthless.\\" Paul hit the daily double. Unpopular answer? Check. Wrong on facts? Check. There are countless examples of disease prevention aid being effective. Could aid be more effective? Sure. But that was not Paul's answer. He simply asserted that aid is worthless, but he had no proof. Answering questions with non-answers simply isn't credible. For example, Herman Cain twice last night reached into a very old bag of tricks to answer questions with the standard \\"I'd consult the experts\\" line. Actually, he originally answered a question about terrorist profiling with his support of \\"targeted identification.\\" But when asked a follow-up not 20 seconds later, he retreated by saying he would \\"ask the professionals.\\" Nothing hurts your credibility worse than flip-flopping on the same question and diving into a non-answer. Cain's bank account is probably under a thousand dollars. But that still leaves him 999. Finally, to save credibility, you should be prepared to defend your position when giving a potentially unpopular answer. Newt Gingrich had two answers that the conservative wing of his party might not like, but he defended them well. Gingrich said it was possible to cut some of the military because, \\"If it takes 15 to 20 years to build a weapons system when Apple changes technology every nine months, there's something profoundly wrong with the system.\\" And Gingrich went against the Republican current when he stated that some long-term illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay legally, but without citizenship, in the United States. Romney and others said giving amnesty would be a magnet for more people to come illegally to the United States. Gingrich said we should be humane, and he was ready to take the heat for his stance. Gingrich has enough credibility banked because of his stances on other issues that he was able to withstand the criticism on this one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Todd Graham.

PepsiCo Inc., the world #39;s No. 2 soft- drink maker, said third-quarter earnings increased 35 percent, boosted by sales in Asia and lower taxes.","output":"This passage is about the financial performance of PepsiCo Inc., the world's second-largest soft drink maker, during its third quarter. PepsiCo is a multinational food and beverage corporation that produces a diverse range of products, including popular drinks like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade, as well as snacks like Doritos and Quaker Oats. The passage highlights a 35 percent increase in the company's earnings for the third quarter compared to the previous year. This significant growth can be attributed to two key factors: increased sales in the Asian market and lower taxes. Firstly, the expansion in the Asian market played a crucial role in PepsiCo's overall growth during the third quarter. Asia is a vast and growing market with a rapidly expanding middle class who are increasingly looking for new food and beverage options. This presents a significant opportunity for multinational companies like PepsiCo to introduce their products and cater to the region's evolving taste preferences. By tapping into this market, PepsiCo was able to achieve stronger sales, positively impacting its earnings. Moreover, lower taxes also contributed to the company's increased earnings during the third quarter. The reduction in taxes has multiple implications for PepsiCo. It can enhance the company's ability to invest in research and development, allowing them to develop innovative products which can help maintain a competitive edge in the global market. Lower taxes can also translate into increased profitability, facilitating the distribution of higher dividends to shareholders, attracting more investors, and ultimately driving the company’s stock prices higher. In summary, this passage discusses PepsiCo Inc.'s financial performance during the third quarter, which saw a 35 percent increase in earnings due to robust sales in the Asian market and lower tax rates. This positive outcome reflects the company's strong growth strategy and its ability to capitalize on emerging markets, as well as benefiting from favorable tax conditions.

A 56-year-old woman and her five-year-old grandson miraculously emerged with minor injuries from a car accident after they were both run over on Tuesday in Anapolis in the state of Goias, Brazil. A split second after the accident happens, the youngster gets up and walks over to his grandmother, who is lying on the floor, as if nothing has happened. Both are already home after the accident after being discharged from hospital suffering from minor injuries. The incident was captured on CCTV cameras, which show the moment Vilma do Nascimento and João Pedro Nascimento were hit when a runaway car collided with a stationery vehicle pushing it into their path. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. The car rolls right over the 5-year-old's head. The accident happened as the pair walked up an Anapolis street. The footage shows two people walking side by side in the road, just yards from the pavement. Up ahead, a car approaching the crossroads at speed from a road on the left of the screen crashes into another as it crosses the junction. Despite the efforts of the second car to swerve out of the way, the vehicle coming from the left fails to stop. The impact sends the car careering down the road where it collides with a stationery white car. Seeing the split-second accident unfold just metres in front of them, the grandmother grabs her grandson’s hand and rushes quickly towards the pavement in an attempt to avoid the car, which is hurtling towards them out of control. The white car barrels into Mrs Nascimento and João. The shocking footage shows how in a split second the pair were mown down. Miraculously the boy jumps straight back up and immediately goes to his grandmother's aid. But before they can reach safety the speeding car collides with the parked car shoving it into a reversed curved spin onto the pavement where it slams into the pair. The stationery car has been hit so hard, it races backwards only coming to rest seconds later after it has rolled over the victims twice – the body and head of the child and the legs and back of the women. Even as the accident is happening, the five-year-old manages to raise his head as he looks up to see where his grandmother has fallen – the lower half of his body is already under the car. A fraction of a second later the front wheel of the car rolls over the child’s head continuing over the grandmother’s back as she lays flattened on the floor by the impact. ‘I saw that the car run over him and come towards me. I thought my grandson’s skull had been crushed,’ Mrs Nascimento said in an interview with TV Anhanguera. But within seconds of it happening the youngster stands up making what appears to be an amazing recovery and walks over to his grandmother as if nothing has happened. The child later told reporters that he was more concerned about his grandmother than himself. ‘I thought my grandma had broken her spine and other things,’ he said. A passer-by who rushes to help the victims looks totally bewildered by what has just occured. ‘It was so quick. I tried to run to the sidewalk but unfortunately the stationary car hit us. It was a miracle we survived,’ the grandmother said. ‘I’m sure God’s hand protected us. João doesn’t even look like he’s been hit at all,’ she added showing off the bruises to her grandson’s face. Both are already home from hospital after undergoing a series of examinations. João was discharged on the same evening after the accident with minor abrasions to the right side of his face, chin and ear, and his grandmother was released Wednesday morning suffering from cuts and bruises to her legs and head. ‘The doctors said Joao’s injuries are just superficial. I’m not walking properly just yet but I have no fractures,’ Mrs Nascimento revealed. ‘It’s just amazing. João is already back playing with his friends and everyone is celebrating our survival.’ The drivers involved in the accident have both complained about the lack of signaling at the junction. The motorist who caused the accident denied speeding towards the intersection but admitted a degree of guilt. ‘I wasn’t paying attention as I approached the junction at the time but I don’t believe I was speeding,’ said Henrique Araújo, a sales representative. The other driver, João Birajara Camargo, also a salesman said: ‘I believe it was my right of way but I would have been able to avoid the accident if he hadn’t been speeding. I think he must have been doing at least 40kmph before he hit me.’ Anapolis local authority said it would be installing traffic lights before the end of the week.

Given the question: Article: In 1859, prefix = st1 /ItalyandFrancewere at war withAustria, and Henry Dunant, a young Swiss gentleman, came upon one of their battlefields. For the first time in his life, Dunant saw how heartless war would be. Around him were suffering men untended and left to die where they fell. Henry Dunant went to work at once. Helped by several peasant women, he formed an ambulance service and set up headquarters in a little church. He treated the wounds of Frenchmen, Italians and Austrians alike. When he was asked why he did so, his answer showed a spirit of humanity that was not common in those days. \\"We are all brothers. A wounded enemy is an enemy no longer.\\" With his band of assistants, Dunant helped to save many lives. The \\"gentleman in white\\" (as Dunant was called because he wore a white suit) was looked upon by hundreds of wounded men as an angel.     When Dunant returned toSwitzerland, he could not forget the needless suffering on the battlefield. He thought of a great organization that should be planned to include many nations. It would do its work with the approval of all countries. And it must operate under a sign that all would know: its symbol would be a red cross against a white background. He wrote a book to make the public see the need for this great organization. In the book he included a truthful account of what he had seen on the battlefield. The consequence was that readers were shocked by what he described. After Dunant's hard work, in Geneva on October 26, 1863, all the nations of Europe were invited to a meeting at which it was decided a relief society should be formed in each country. Then the Geneva Convention was made the following year. The nations that signed the Geneva Convention chose the red cross as the symbol for the international organization.     Until his death in 1910, Dunant was always ready to look for a noble cause. And when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the first time in 1901, the honor went to Dunant. No man has deserved it more than the founder of the Red Cross. Question: Dunant planned the organization with an intention to   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"get the approval for relief work from every country\\"? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"get the approval for relief work from every country.\\" Step-by-step justification: 1. In the article, it states that Henry Dunant witnessed the suffering on the battlefield and decided to create a great organization that should be planned to include many nations. 2. It mentions that this organization \\"would do its work with the approval of all countries.\\" 3. The organization's symbol would be a red cross against a white background, which would be recognizable and accepted by all nations. 4. The Geneva Convention was formed, and nations chose the red cross as the symbol for the international organization. From these steps, we can deduce that Dunant planned the organization with the intention to get the approval for relief work from every country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Meanwhile, a Real Housewives star's \\"explosive\\" custody trial has kicked off.) Expand this summary.","output":"Arpad \\"Arki\\" Busson, the ex-fiance of actress Uma Thurman, has reportedly filed an emergency order to gain custody of their two-year-old daughter, Luna. The Manhattan court papers regarding the custody battle are sealed, making it difficult to determine the specifics of the case. Despite the public attention, Uma Thurman's representatives express their hope that a fair agreement for both parties will be reached out of court. The couple had split for the second time back in April, and since then, Busson has been dating actress Kristin Scott Thomas. Uma Thurman and Arki Busson, a London-based French financier, began their relationship in 2007 and announced their engagement in 2008. However, they briefly called off the engagement in 2009 before reconciling. In 2012, the couple welcomed their daughter Luna, but eventually called it quits for the second time in 2014.  Thurman's representative stated, \\"It is unfortunate that this very private discussion regarding Mr. Busson's visitation rights and his participation in decision making has been made public.\\" The privacy of the custody proceedings is essential for the well-being of the two-year-old child, whose best interests should be prioritized in the decision-making process. Custody battles can often have long-lasting effects on the people involved, especially the children. Divorce and separation may create stress and emotional turmoil in a child's life. It is important for both parents to maintain a sense of routine and structure for their child's well-being. Co-parenting can be a challenge, but it is crucial for both parents to put their differences aside for the sake of their child's emotional and mental health. Busson is reportedly seeking visitation rights and decision-making power concerning Luna's upbringing. Ideally, the best outcome for everyone involved would be for both parties to reach a compromise and work together to provide the most stable and loving environment for their daughter. Uma Thurman is widely known for her roles in films such as \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" \\"Kill Bill,\\" and \\"Gattaca.\\" She has previously been married to fellow actors Gary Oldman and Ethan Hawke, with whom she has two children. Arki Busson has two children from his previous relationship with Australian model Elle Macpherson. He is recognized as a successful investor and philanthropist, and is the founder and Chairman of the EIM Group, a fund of hedge funds organization. As the custody battle unfolds, it is essential for both Uma Thurman and Arki Busson to prioritize their daughter's well-being and put her best interests at the center of their decision-making process. Hopefully, a fair and mutually agreeable resolution will be reached, allowing both parents to maintain a healthy co-parenting relationship and provide a loving and supportive environment for Luna as she grows up."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - William Craig ( November 13 , 1918 -- January 13 , 2016 ) was an American academic and philosopher , who taught at the University of California , Berkeley , in Berkeley , California . His research interests included mathematical logic , and the philosophy of science , and he is best known for the Craig interpolation theorem .  - Theoretical computer science, or TCS, is a division or subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing and includes the theory of computation.  - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east.  - First-order logic  also known as first-order predicate calculus and predicate logic  is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as \\"Socrates is a man\\" one can have expressions in the form \\"there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man\\" where \\"there exists\\" is a quantifier and \\"X\\" is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers.  - Logic in computer science covers the overlap between the field of logic and that of computer science. The topic can essentially be divided into three main areas:  - In mathematical logic, Craig's interpolation theorem is a result about the relationship between different logical theories. Roughly stated, the theorem says that if a formula  implies a formula , and the two have at least one atomic variable symbol in common, then there is a third formula , called an interpolant, such that every nonlogical symbol in  occurs both in  and ,  implies , and  implies . The theorem was first proved for first-order logic by William Craig in 1957. Variants of the theorem hold for other logics, such as propositional logic. A stronger form of Craig's theorem for first-order logic was proved by Roger Lyndon in 1959; the overall result is sometimes called the CraigLyndon theorem.  - Philosophy of science is a branch of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of science. The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between science and truth.  - The University of California (UC) is a public university system in the U.S. state of California. Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the University of California is a part of the state's three-system public higher education plan, which also include the California State University system and the California Community Colleges System.  - Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy investigating the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it. Metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions:  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .  - A public university is a university that is predominantly funded by public means through a national or subnational government, as opposed to private universities. Whether a national university is considered public varies from one country (or region) to another, largely depending on the specific education landscape.   - Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics. It bears close connections to metamathematics, the foundations of mathematics, and theoretical computer science. The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems. Mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory. These areas share basic results on logic, particularly first-order logic, and definability. In computer science (particularly in the ACM Classification) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article; see Logic in computer science for those.  - A formal system or logical calculus is any well-defined system of abstract thought based on the model of mathematics. A formal system need not be mathematical as such; for example, Spinoza's \\"Ethics\\" imitates the form of Euclid's \\"Elements\\".. Spinoza employed Euclidiean elements such as \\"axioms\\" or \\"primitive truths\\", rules of inferences etc. so that a calculus can be build using these. For nature of such primitive truths, one can consult Tarski's \\"Concept of truth for a formalized language\\".   - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - In mathematics, model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures (e.g. groups, fields, graphs, universes of set theory) from the perspective of mathematical logic. The objects of study are models of theories in a formal language. A set of sentences in a formal language is called a theory; a model of a theory is a structure (e.g. an interpretation) that satisfies the sentences of that theory.  - Foundations of mathematics is the study of the philosophical and logical and/or algorithmic basis of mathematics, or, in a broader sense, the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics. In this latter sense, the distinction between foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics turns out to be quite vague. Foundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts (number, geometrical figure, set, function, etc.) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.) also called metamathematical concepts, with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Metamathematics is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods. This study produces metatheories, which are mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. Emphasis on metamathematics (and perhaps the creation of the term itself) owes itself to David Hilbert's attempt to secure the foundations of mathematics in the early part of the 20th Century. Metamathematics provides \\"a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and logic\\" (Kleene 1952, p. 59). An important feature of metamathematics is its emphasis on differentiating between reasoning from inside a system and from outside a system. An informal illustration of this is categorizing the proposition \\"2+2=4\\" as belonging to mathematics while categorizing the proposition \\"'2+2=4' is valid\\" as belonging to metamathematics.  - The University of California, Berkeley, (also referred to as Berkeley, UC Berkeley, and Cal) is a public research university located in Berkeley, California. Founded in 1868, Berkeley is the oldest of the ten research universities affiliated with the University of California system, and is often cited as the top public university in the United States and around the world.  - Ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence or reality as well as the basic categories of being and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, ontology often deals with questions concerning what entities exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences. Although ontology as a philosophical enterprise is highly theoretical, it also has practical application in information science and technology, such as ontology engineering.  - Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge.  - Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature.  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.    What is the relationship between 'william craig ' and 'proof theory'? Answer:","output":"William Craig was an American academic and philosopher who taught at the University of California, Berkeley. His research interests included mathematical logic and the philosophy of science. He is best known for the Craig interpolation theorem.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who writes songs with Terry?, using the article: Songwriter Terry Trindale is attracted to Consuelo Croyden, a woman he sees nightly at a Palm Beach casino. He finally works up the courage to approach her and express his feelings, but she rebuffs his advances. When he later accrues a 3,200 gambling debt to her, Consuelo agrees to hire him as her secretary to work off what he owes her. One of Terry's duties is to assume the role of her fiancé in order to discourage the insistent attention of Tony Barling, to whom Consuelo once was engaged, and to keep her from succumbing to her former beau's charms. Tony refuses to believe she loves someone else, and, when he recognizes Terry from the casino, his suspicions are aroused, despite Terry's outward displays of affection for Consuelo. Tony convinces her to join him on a friend's yacht, but Terry reminds her of his responsibility, and keeps her from going. Four weeks later, Consuelo finds herself still saddled with Terry, who has refused to accompany his songwriting partner Chappie Champagne to New York City to promote their latest tune. Consuelo insists she no longer has any interest in Tony, and offers to cancel the rest of Terry's debt so he can join Chappie. Terry departs, and moments later, Consuelo receives a call from Tony and invites him to the house. Instead, it is Terry, who had disguised his voice, who arrives, and he berates Consuelo for her lack of self-control. Complications arise when Tony actually does arrive on the scene and finds Terry, wearing Consuelo's satin pajamas, in bed.

Second question: In which foreign countries can Indians easily get a job as a designer without much of a visa/permit hassle? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: Which countries can an Indian travel to without a visa? As an Indian passport holder, there are several countries you can travel to without obtaining a visa in advance. Some of these countries offer visa-free entry, while others provide a visa on arrival. Here is a list of some countries that do not require a visa beforehand for Indian nationals: Visa-free entry countries: 1. Barbados 2. Bhutan 3. Dominica 4. Fiji 5. Grenada 6. Haiti 7. Maldives 8. Mauritius 9. Micronesia 10. Nepal 11. Saint Kitts and Nevis 12. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 13. Samoa 14. Senegal 15. Serbia 16. Trinidad and Tobago 17. Vanuatu Visa on arrival countries: 1. Bolivia 2. Cambodia 3. Cape Verde 4. Comoros 5. Djibouti 6. Guinea-Bissau 7. Indonesia 8. Jordan 9. Kenya 10. Laos 11. Madagascar 12. Marshall Islands 13. Mauritania 14. Mozambique 15. Palau 16. Saint Lucia 17. Seychelles 18. Somalia 19. Tanzania 20. Timor-Leste 21. Togo 22. Tuvalu 23. Uganda 24. Zambia 25. Zimbabwe Please note that visa policies might change from time to time, and it is always advisable to consult with the respective embassy or consulate before planning your visit. Second question: In which foreign countries can Indians easily get a job as a designer without much of a visa/permit hassle? Getting a job in a foreign country largely depends on the specific skill set, local demand, and the country's visa and work permit policies. While the visa-free and visa on arrival countries listed above offer easier entry for tourism purposes, obtaining a work permit may still require additional documentation and processes. However, some countries have more streamlined processes and favorable policies for skilled professionals, like designers. Here are a few countries where Indians may find it relatively easier to obtain a job as a designer and navigate the visa/permit process: 1. Singapore: The country's Employment Pass and S Pass programs offer a relatively straightforward process for skilled professionals. Singapore has a thriving creative industry and may have job opportunities for designers.   2. Germany: Germany has a program called the EU Blue Card, which makes it easier for highly skilled non-EU professionals to obtain a work permit. The country is known for its design industry, and there may be opportunities for Indian designers to find jobs. 3. Canada: The Express Entry system in Canada is designed to fast-track permanent residency applications for skilled workers, including designers. Moreover, a strong design industry and a multicultural population may make it easier for Indian designers to find jobs. 4. Australia: Australia offers a Skilled-Independent visa (subclass 189), which allows skilled workers to live and work in Australia as permanent residents. Indian designers with relevant skills and experience may find this a suitable option. 5. United Arab Emirates (UAE): Dubai, in particular, has seen a growing design industry in recent years. The UAE offers work visas for individuals with employment offers, and companies in the region may be more inclined to hire Indian professionals due to historical ties and geographic proximity. Please note that while these countries might offer a relatively more accessible visa and work permit process, it is essential to conduct thorough research and refine your job search strategy for each specific country. To answer the last part - No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question focuses on countries Indian passport holders can visit without having to obtain a visa, while the second question is about countries where it might be easier for Indians to find jobs as designers with relatively less visa/permit hassle. The first question pertains to travel, whereas the second question is centered around work opportunities for a specific profession."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Build a movie plot around this: What kid of job does Bob have? He is a truck driver. Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Miles of Destiny\\" Genre: Adventure/Drama/Family Plot Summary: Bob Johnson, a down-to-earth truck driver, discovers a hidden talent and embarks on a life-changing journey which affects not only his life but also the lives of those he meets along the way. He needs to balance his love for the road, responsibilities towards his family, and the pursuit of an unexpected passion as he navigates the winding highways of life, ultimately leading him to find his true purpose. Act 1: Introducing the Protagonist Bob Johnson is a dedicated truck driver with a kind-hearted nature but a mundane life. His job requires him to spend long days on the road, away from his loving wife, Susan, and their two children, Tommy and Emily. Despite the distance, Bob treasures his family and always looks forward to spending quality time with them on weekends. At a rest stop on one of his long hauls, he strikes up a conversation with an old man named Charlie - a retired jazz guitarist who once had a shot at fame but chose to walk away from it for a simpler life. Charlie inspires Bob with stories of his past musical experiences and introduces him to the world of jazz. As they part ways, Charlie leaves behind a harmonica, encouraging Bob to try it out. Act 2: The Discovery Bob, having never played a musical instrument in his life, is intrigued by the harmonica. He starts practicing whenever he gets time, eventually discovering his innate talent and love for music. His dedication to learning and improving earns him a local reputation, and he begins to perform at establishments on his driving routes. Back at home, his family struggles to cope with his growing passion and the time he invests in it. Susan tries to be supportive, but her patience wears thin as Bob's focus begins to drift from his family duties. Tensions rise as Tommy and Emily resent Bob's growing music career, feeling like he is valuing his newfound passion over spending time with them. Act 3: The Turning Point One night, during an impromptu performance at a run-down diner, Bob meets April, a talented and ambitious singer who dreams of making it big. They form an instant connection and start to perform together, their chemistry drawing significant attention. The word spreads, and they soon catch the eye of a major record producer who offers them a life-changing record deal. However, accepting the deal would come at a cost - Bob would need to quit his job as a truck driver and go on tour full-time, drastically changing the lifestyle he's come to know. This forces Bob to face the reality that pursuing his dream might mean putting his family life on the line. Act 4: The Resolution Bob struggles with his decision, but ultimately his love for his family prevails, and he decides to pass on the record deal. As a parting gift, April records a duet they had written together and gives it to Bob as a memento of their brief partnership. Back home, Bob sits down with his family and apologizes for his neglect. He vows to prioritize his family and rekindle the love and companionship that they once shared. The family slowly rebuilds their relationship, with Bob and Susan spending more time together, and Bob even teaching Tommy and Emily how to play harmonica. As time goes on, Bob discovers that he can balance both his love for music and his family responsibilities. He continues working as a truck driver but also starts a local band with fellow musicians, performing at community events and donating proceeds to local charities. The film concludes with Bob's band, \\"Miles of Destiny,\\" performing the song he co-wrote with April at a community fundraiser. As he looks out into the crowd, his eyes meet Susan's, and they exchange a genuine, loving smile, the harmonica solo in the background symbolizing both their unity and Bob's newfound balance in life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose from:  (A). coastal range.  (B). tidal range.  (C). wave length.  (D). apex.","output":"(B). Tidal Range Tidal range is the measure of the vertical distance between the high tide and low tide at a specific location. To accurately determine the tidal range, measurements can be taken in the morning and evening when the tidal events have occurred. Tides are the periodic rise and fall of sea levels caused by gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun and the rotation of the Earth. Tidal forces cause the ocean's surface to bulge on the side facing the Moon and on the opposite side as well. This creates two high tides and two low tides each day, approximately 12 hours and 25 minutes apart. In order to calculate the tidal range, we need to measure the difference between the highest high tide (also known as the high water mark) and the lowest low tide (the low water mark) at a specific location. To accurately do this, we can take measurements at different times of the day. For example, if high tide is at 6 a.m., we would measure the water level at this time. Later in the day, at approximately 6:25 p.m., another low tide will occur, and we would measure the water level again. Comparing the two measurements of high tide and low tide will give us the tidal range. The difference between these two levels indicates the extent to which water levels change due to tidal factors at a specific location on the coast. In conclusion, the correct choice in this scenario is (B). Tidal range, which requires measurements to be taken in the morning during a high tide event and in the evening during a low tide event, in order to accurately determine the difference in the vertical distance between high tide and low tide."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: John is an amateur astronomer. Last week he was observing the sky with his telescope. First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A. Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B.  and a hint : According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:  Please answer this question : Which case would see faster movement, case A or case C? Answer:","output":"Case A would see faster movement.  In Case A, John observed planet Mars, which is closer to the Sun than Jupiter (Case C). The movement speed of a planet depends on its distance from the star it orbits. A planet's year (the time taken to complete one orbit around its star) depends on its distance from the star. The farther a planet is from its star, the longer the distance it must travel, and the slower its speed due to being less affected by the star's gravity.  Mars is closer to the Sun compared to Jupiter. Therefore, it moves faster in its orbit around the Sun than Jupiter does.  To summarize, Case A (Mars) would see faster movement than Case C (Jupiter) due to its closer proximity to the Sun, which causes it to have a stronger gravitational interaction and higher orbital speed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At times I'd have to admit that it was catchy and interesting but then it had its times when a chapter would just go on about absolutely nothing. For example, in chapter ten it is all about the mom worrying and trying to find her son, boring. I think that if they changed the book and took out the boring parts by adding interesting or adventurous themes, people would enjoy it a lot better. Maybe I see this book differently than others, but that's just my own opinion. I would rather recommend this book to adults because it skips around, making it hard to follow when at the same time being boring. Answer: A:","output":"Based on the review, it can be considered a mixed or slightly negative review. The reviewer acknowledges that the book has some catchy and interesting moments but finds that it has more downs than ups, and is overall boring. They believe that it could be better if revised and would recommend it to adults due to its challenging structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Game Hunters: In search of video games and interactive awesomeness To be part of the cast of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, you need to have a sense of humor, actor Nolan North told attendees at a Comic-Con panel devoted to the game. Development studio Naughty Dog played a near-finished cinematic from the game, due for PS3 Nov. 1, during the Friday panel. That was followed by footage of North, who plays main character Nathan Drake, and fellow actors Emily Rose (Elena Fisher) and Richard McGonagle (Victor \\"Sully\\" Sullivan) acting out the scene on the motion-capture stage. \\"We don't look good in these,\\" North warned. McGonagle quipped, \\"If any of you are wearing glasses, this will look a lot better without them.\\" Added North, \\"I believe I was retaining water at the time.\\" The video showed the three actors performing a scene wearing black neoprene body suits and skull caps with adorned markers. Props included a roll of black masking tape and sticks that doubled as an ancient artifact and shotguns. It was met with much laughter from the crowd, as were some outtakes showing the actors making grunting sounds that would be used for audio in other scenes. Rose joked, \\"I feel like someone just walked in on me in the bathroom.\\" \\"Now I know why you didn't show that to us first,\\" McGonagle said to creative director Amy Hennig. \\"We need to get paid a lot more,\\" North added. He explained that the outtakes were not \\"Drake in a bowel movement. … Sometimes we will just capture audio for Taylor's efforts,\\" nodding to fellow panelist Taylor Kurosaki, Naughty Dog's cinematic production lead. (Game Hunters' Mike Snider moderated the panel, which can be watched in its entirety via the above Gamespot video on YouTube.) North compared acting on the mo-cap stage to children playing. \\"We laugh more than you can imagine\\" doing the scenes, he said. \\"In its purest form, good acting is playing.\\" Naughty Dog has created an environment \\"for us to feel safe to be stupid like that,\\" Rose said, who along with North and McGonagle have been working on Uncharted games for five years. \\"It creates for great moments. We have to wear these spandex ball suits, and we have to really care about this round piece of tape (that stands in for the artifact). It creates a wonderful safe place to work and not every place is like that.\\" \\"It's the best job I've ever had,\\" McGonagle said. The rapport between the actors helps the video game come across as an ensemble, character-driven game. \\"The reason the characters are who they are is because they inhabit them,\\" Hennig said. Filming is much like stage performances \\"or like live television or three- or four-camera television where you are acting an entire scene out,\\" she said. \\"I think there is an immediacy there.\\" As many as eight or nine takes might be shot, along with additional audio. \\"It lets the actors play with the material in a way that maybe you don't get to in any other medium,\\" Hennig said. Animators take the raw mo-cap scene and fine-tune the characters, the environment, lighting and other effects. Recording the actors' speaking parts as they act out scenes together helps the studio achieve its goal of creating a cinematic action game. \\"We want people to feel like they are playing a movie,\\" said Naughty Dog's cinematic animation lead Josh Scheer. \\"We are making a game that is not only about running around ancient societies and blowing things up but also human characters with actual personalities and relationships. So much of that comes from the way that all of us have worked together over they years.\\" Among the questions asked the panelists by attendees was whether the cast would consider playing their characters in a movie. The crowd applauded and North pretended to dial his cellphone and said, \\"Get me Neil Burger, please.\\" Burger, whose most recent film he directed was Limitless, is currently working on adapting the first Uncharted game for film. Previously, David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg were attached to the project. When told his voice was \\"awesome,\\" McGonagle admitted, to laughs, that \\"the package is a little worn.\\" Reuniting for a film, Rose said, \\"definitely would be amazing.\\" North added that \\"after five years of doing this character and helping Amy create his persona, Nathan Drake for all intents and purposes is exactly who I am, personality-wise.\\" \\"With more upper body strength,\\" Hennig quipped. Said North, \\"I actually go to the rock-climbing gym now and it's hard.\\" North also revealed that he is working on a behind-the-scenes book called Drake's Journal, chronicling the game's development, that is expected to be released when the game comes out. Readers won't believe \\"the amount of stories from the office where these people put this game together,\\" he said. \\"I liken it to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. You don't know how they make the chocolate, but you love to eat it.\\" What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1.

Please write a short summary for the following article: What Your CEO Is Reading: History of American Growth; Saving Globalization; Ancient Greece vs. 2016 Rio Every week, CIO Journal offers a glimpse into the mind of the CEO, whose view of technology is shaped by stories in management journals, general interest magazines and, of course, in-flight publications. Make the summer games great again? With fears of Zika outbreaks, terrorist attacks and Guanabara Bay “floaters”, the news coverage run-up to the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, commencing tonight, reads like a trip through Dante’s Inferno…on Russian steroids. Could it be any worse? Well, yes, if one considers the original games in Greece, Foreign Policy’s David Clay Large suggests. Far from being a celebration of peace and amateurism, the games were bedeviled by fighting spectators–and the occasional invading army–smelly Spartans and Mt. Olympus-sized doping habits. “Their nostrums included dried mushrooms, exotic herbal concoctions, animal hearts and testicles, and even an opiates-laced juice cocktail,” Mr. Large writes. And while today’s athletes in Rio may have to contend with uncooperative plumbing, ancient athletes had it worse. “Swarms of black flies and other bugs infesting those microbe-laden latrines brought on epidemics of gastroenteritis and diarrhea, often fatal.” Why growth will fall. Or, Bill is bullish. This year’s summer read is an 800-page economic history book that “weighs as much as a small dog,” William D. Nordhaus writes in The New York Review of Books. “The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living Since the Civil War,” by Robert J. Gordon, “one of America’s leading macroeconomists,” tracks the “special century” from 1870 to 1970 where living standards exploded. The book is trending on executive digital bookshelves, and not only for its economic analysis and history, but also for its argument, in the last 200 pages, that the rate of innovation since 1970 has slowed–Silicon Valley visionaries be damned. Mr. Gordon “sees no prospect that we will find a similar set of inventions of such breadth and depth in the near future,” Mr. Nordhaus writes. But Bill Gates, in a blog post, cares to disagree. “My money is on the incredible forces of technological progress at work every day.” Saving globalization and technology from themselves. As support erodes for globalization and technology, the engine’s behind today’s unparalleled prosperity, it is time for businesses to confront “the growing divide between winners and losers,” say Boston Consulting Group’s CEO Rich Lesser, and colleagues Martin Reeves and Johann Harnoss. They suggest a seven-point technology-heavy agenda for business leaders, starting with a new approach to globalization that goes beyond cost-cutting offshoring. “Technology will be crucial,” they write “For example, the use of analytics and robotics could bring manufacturing closer to target markets.” Ultimately, businesses need to “own the narrative,” making the case for globalization and technology but also addressing side effects. “It is time for a credible, inclusive, and trust-inspiring narrative, both for the direction of our societies and the sharing of benefits and opportunity within them.”","output":"Worries about the Zika virus, terrorist attacks and pollution threaten to overshadow the Olympics Games in Rio de Janeiro, but such events were far from straightforward in ancient Greece either, writes David Clay Large in Foreign Policy. The ancient Games included land-grabbing spectators, large numbers of flies spreading illness and athletes who couldn't resist doping, says Large. While the rate of innovation since the 1970s has slowed, according to economist Robert J. Gordon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates begs to differ. As globalisation faces a decline, businesses need to confront the widening divides it has created, according to Boston Consulting Group’s CEO, Rich Lesser, and colleagues Martin Reeves and Johann Harnoss."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What's the full name of the person whose secretary is in love with Mike's friend?  World War II has ended and Major Larry Briggs finds out that his friend Captain Mike Perry has only two months to live due to a head injury. Larry and Sergeant Pete Rocco are determined to show Mike a good time before he dies. For a 10,000 fee, Larry takes a flying job working for Alex Maris, a profiteer. Everything is set until Maris' secretary, Susan Cleaver, shows up to board the aircraft. Mike falls for Susan and Larry convinces her to play along but she has fallen in love with Larry. The first flight is disrupted by Maris arriving a half-hour late with the police right behind. Larry takes off but is forced to make an emergency landing after both engines fail. After checking into a small hotel, the Americans find Police Lieutenant Keon, who is shadowing them, believing that they are smugglers. When Larry sees Mike falling for Susan, he wants the romance to end and despite her carrying 500,000 for Maris, Larry tells her to leave immediately. When Mike longs for Susan, Larry relents and blackmails her into seeing him or he will turn her into Keon. Sailing to Saigon on a boat, Larry tricks Keon by stowing the money away into an envelope he mails to himself, and throws all suspicion off Susan. In reaching Saigon, Larry knows he has fallen in love with Susan even though Mike has proposed to her. At Susan's hotel, an enraged Maris and his valet Simon, hold Larry hostage, demanding the money that has been posted. Bursting in, Pete realizes what is happening, and fights with Simon, but both men fall off a balcony to their deaths. Susan has secretly arranged to retrieve the money from the post office, returning it to Maris. Mike and Larry confront him but in an exchange of gunfire, Mike and Maris are killed.

Please briefly summarize this news article: ‘This Election Changed My Mind About America’ Here are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment. 1. This is what unqualified looks like. [Trump] never expected to win and never planned to govern — he just loved the adulation he got from spreading his brand of hate. Now we have a completely unprepared administration trying desperately to do in 7 weeks what it should have been preparing for over the last 18 months. The disaster begins. — Mike K. in Santa Clara, Calif., reacting to an article about strife within Donald J. Trump’s transition team this week. This comment received more than 4,700 reader recommendations. 2. It seems that Billy Bush has been one of the few to be held accountable for his words and participation in the onslaught of racism and misogyny in the campaign and now post-election appointments. All others are ascending to the highest offices in the land. As a teacher I am already seeing the repercussions of having Teflon individuals in high office have no consequences for their bigoted remarks. When a student in my diverse classroom does not understand why it is hurtful to yell “build the wall” in the middle of class I can blame our leaders. The anti-Semitism, racism, misogyny will continue if we do not hold people accountable. — Sarah in Santa Rosa, Calif. 3. Bravo! Someone who understands the threat that Islam poses to the West. Let’s avoid the mistakes of France, Belgium and other countries where the dominating instincts of the world’s most dangerous religion have been allowed to flourish. — Mark in Los Angeles, reacting to an article about President-elect Trump’s choice of Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser. 4. Hey, I find it really ironic that all the groups that think they have a God-given mandate to enforce “tolerance” are so intolerant of controversial views and people that run counter to their own. Maybe the moral and ethical standards of Mr. Bannon are not that repugnant in the end, like Trump who has said some unfortunate things, as has everyone, that he regrets? If political correctness gets pushed to the maximum, business and progress grinds to a halt in fear of legal accusations that become paralyzing. How many lives have to be ruined by such enforced “correctness”? And what about the controversial manipulators on the other side like [George] Soros, who will hold them to account? — Nutmeg in Brookfield, Mass., reacting to an article about Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, whom President-elect Trump selected as his chief strategist. This comment received more than 100 reader responses. 5. Infrastructure spending, child tax credits, paid maternity leave and dismantling trade agreements....hmm, sounds a bit like some of Bernie’s platform. Slice and dice identity politics are all well and good but, in the end, it is all about the economy. And too many of our fellow citizens are hurting. Wake up, Dems, and return to the party’s FDR roots, or continue to lose. — Ellen Liversidge in San Diego. This comment received more than 390 reader recommendations. 6. This sad news hurts like the loss of a family member. Gwen Ifill’s clarity and moderate tone brought so much to the frantic Washington scene. This is the worst possible moment to lose her special gift for analyzing politics and bringing contending parties together in a civil conversation. — JL in Brooklyn, reacting to an article about the death of Gwen Ifill, the political reporter and PBS “NewsHour” co-anchor, on Monday. This comment received more than 2,200 reader recommendations. 7. I am considering many grad schools in the U.S. for my master course next fall. Before the election, I only looked at the ranking, the alumni’s feedback, the requirements and the fee and campus life. Now, I really have to think about the safety. As an Asian woman, I don’t expect anyone to stop me in the street and tell me to get back to China (which I am not from). So now, although I was so sure about some schools in Texas and Wisconsin, I have to sit down once again, and closely look at the cities, and hope that they are not too red. This election changed my mind about America. — Huyen Phuong Le on The Times’s Facebook page, responding to an article about foreign students questioning whether they should pursue a college education in the United States during the Trump administration. This comment received more than 60 likes. 8. Imagine, for a moment, you are a white male somewhere in America who just lost his job at a factory. Your mortgage is in default, your car is being repossessed, and you wonder whether you’ll be able to find a job, much less one that pays a decent wage. You have no particular animosity towards blacks, gays, women, but you constantly hear the message that as a white, straight male, you are the paragon of privilege and that the hardships in your life are irrelevant or made up. You don’t feel so privileged. Are your struggles and fears really so different from those of the minority groups? It’s easy to see why that person voted for the candidate who acknowledged his fears and against the candidate (and party) who dismissed his concerns because he was not a minority. — Andy in Scottsdale, Ariz., reacting to an Op-Ed essay about whether a focus on identity politics distorted the left’s message during the election. 9. I’m less patient with sexism and talking down and more likely to stand up for others. Gesture-wise, the day after the election, all of the young women in my office dressed in head to toe black. No one coordinated, no one knew that the other women would be dressed similarly, but we all were sending a conscious (sartorial) message of mourning, and it was comforting to see and feel that kind of solidarity. — Katey Laubscher on The Times’s Facebook page, responding to an article about the small gestures in which women found comfort in the days after the election. 10. This is a what locker room talk should be. — Alexa Carey on The Times’s Facebook page, responding to an article about three University of Wisconsin basketball players who have used their status as college athletes to boost political causes.","output":"The top 10 comments of the week on the New York Times' digital platforms, as selected by readers and journalists, include reactions to Donald Trump's transition team, his choice of Lt.

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 17*v - 134*v = 145*v - 2358 for v.","output":"To solve this equation, perform the following steps: 1. Arrange all 'v' terms on one side of the equation: Combine the terms with 'v' on the left-hand side of the equation (17v - 134v), and on the right-hand side, we have (145v - 2358). 2. Combine 'v' terms: 17v - 134v = -117v (subtract 134v from 17v) So, we now have -117v = 145v - 2358. 3. Shift the -117v term to the right side of the equation, to combine all 'v' terms on one side. To do this, add 117v to both sides: -117v + 117v = 145v - 2358 + 117v 0 = 262v - 2358 (since 145v + 117v = 262v) 4. Next, isolate the 'v' term by shifting the constant term to the left side of the equation. Add 2358 to both sides: 2358 = 262v 5. Now, divide both sides by 262 to find 'v': v = 2358 / 262 6. Perform the division to get the value of 'v': v ≈ 9 So, the solution to the given equation 17*v - 134*v = 145*v - 2358 is v ≈ 9."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Ice is water frozen into a solid state. Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color.  - An ice cube is a small, roughly cube-shaped piece of ice (frozen water), conventionally used to cool beverages. Ice cubes are sometimes preferred over crushed ice because they melt more slowly; they are standard in mixed drinks that call for ice, in which case the drink is said to be \\"on the rocks.\\"  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - First Sunday is a 2008 American comedy film written , produced and directed by David E. Talbert , and produced by Ice Cube , who also starred in the lead role . The film co-stars Katt Williams and Tracy Morgan . The film was released in the United States on January 11 , 2008 . Ice Cube , Katt Williams and Clifton Powell had all starred in the film Friday After Next .  - Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.  - Black comedy or dark comedy is a comic style that makes light of subjects that are generally considered serious or taboo. Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes. Black comedy corresponds to the earlier concept of gallows humor.  - Morgan State University (commonly referred to as MSU, Morgan State, or Morgan) is a public research university and historically black college (HBCU) in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Morgan is Maryland's designated public urban university and the largest HBCU in Maryland. In 1890 the university, formerly known as the \\"Centenary Biblical Institute\\", changed its name to Morgan College to honor Reverend Lyttleton Morgan, the first chairman of its Board of Trustees who had donated land to the college. It became a university in 1975. MSU is a member of Thurgood Marshall College Fund.  - David E. Talbert (born February 10, 1966) is an American playwright, author, and filmmaker. He is a graduate of Morgan State University and attended the New York University film program.    What object entity has the relation of 'color' with the subject 'first sunday'?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more wind and rain occur happens, how will it affect Less lighter items float to the top.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more wind and rain would have a direct effect on the process.  The increased wind and rain would lead to more erosion, resulting in an increased amount of sediment being detached from the soil. The stronger water currents caused by the additional rain would likely cause more sediment to roll downhill towards the river, potentially increasing the rate at which heavy items sink to the bottom.  With more wind and rain, the turbulence in the water might also affect the lighter items. The increased turbulence can make it more challenging for them to float on the top and in convection cycles. As a result, less lighter items may float to the top.  Furthermore, the stronger water currents due to the additional rain would likely move the sediment around more rapidly, potentially altering the distribution patterns of the sediment in rivers, lakes, and oceans.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: plastic wrap","output":"When selecting the best solution for the goal of using plastic wrap, it is essential to consider the specific application or purpose for which it is intended. I will discuss two common plastic wrap solutions: standard plastic wrap and reusable silicone food wraps. I will evaluate these options based on several factors such as environmental impact, cost, versatility, and convenience. 1. Standard Plastic Wrap: Standard plastic wrap, also known as cling film or plastic film, is a thin plastic material, usually made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyethylene (PE). It is used for covering food containers or wrapping food items to keep them fresh and prevent cross-contamination. Advantages: - Standard plastic wrap is inexpensive and readily available at most grocery stores. - It easily adheres to various surfaces, providing an airtight seal that helps preserve the freshness of food items. - Due to its transparency, it allows users to easily identify the contents of wrapped food items. Disadvantages: - Standard plastic wrap is single-use, contributing to the increasing problem of plastic waste, especially given its non-biodegradable nature. - Punctures and tears can occur relatively easily, compromising the airtight seal. - Some concerns exist about the possibility of chemical transfer from PVC-based plastic wrap to food items, particularly when used in microwave ovens. 2. Reusable Silicone Food Wraps: Reusable silicone food wraps are an eco-friendly alternative to standard plastic wrap. Made from food-grade silicone, these wraps can be washed and reused multiple times. Advantages: - Reusable silicone food wraps contribute to significantly less plastic waste since they can be used multiple times, unlike single-use plastic wraps. - They are heat resistant, making them safe to use in microwave ovens or for covering hot containers. - Typically BPA-free, silicone food wraps do not release any harmful chemicals into the food, ensuring better food safety. - Their durability allows for a longer lifespan, meaning they can handle more frequent use without tearing or puncturing. Disadvantages: - Silicone food wraps are more expensive than standard plastic wrap, initially, but the price can be offset over time by their reusable nature. - They may not adhere as easily to some surfaces, affecting the freshness and airtight seal of food items. - They may not be as transparent as plastic wrap, which can make it difficult to identify the contents of wrapped items. When comparing these two plastic wrap solutions, it is evident that each has its advantages and disadvantages. However, considering the long-term implications and overall sustainability, reusable silicone food wraps are likely the better option. They offer an environmentally friendly, cost-effective (over time), and safer alternative to standard plastic wrap. As the world continues to grapple with increasing plastic waste and environmental concerns, the need to reduce single-use plastic items has become more pressing. By choosing reusable silicone food wraps, you can contribute to a more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyle while ensuring the freshness and safety of food items. However, if you need a short-term solution or value initial budgetary savings, standard plastic wrap may be the more suitable choice for your needs. Ultimately, the best solution depends on your personal preferences, goals, and priorities when using plastic wrap."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The period marks the governance of the Muromachi or Ashikaga shogunate (\\"Muromachi bakufu\\" or \\"Ashikaga bakufu\\"), which was officially established in 1338 by the first Muromachi shogun, Ashikaga Takauji, two years after the brief Kenmu Restoration (133336) of imperial rule was brought to a close. The period ended in 1573 when the 15th and last shogun of this line, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was driven out of the capital in Kyoto by Oda Nobunaga.  - Historical context. The goal of national unification and a return to the comparative political stability of the earlier Muromachi period was widely shared by the multitude of autonomous \\"daimys\\" during the Sengoku period. Oda Nobunaga was the first for whom this goal seemed attainable. Nobunaga had gained control over most of Honshu (see map below) before his death during the 1582 Honn-ji incident, a coup attempt executed by Nobunaga's vassal, Akechi Mitsuhide. It is not certain whether Nobunaga was killed in the attack or else committed seppuku. The motivations behind Mitsuhide's betrayal was never revealed to anyone who survived the incident, and has been a subject of debate and conjecture ever since the incident.  - The is a period in Japanese history marked by social upheaval, political intrigue and near-constant military conflict. Japanese historians named it after the otherwise unrelated Warring States period in China.

He was the son of Toyotomi Hideyoshi 's chief strategist and adviser Kuroda Kanbei . In 1577 , when Nagamasa was a small child , his father was condemned as a spy by Oda Nobunaga . Nagamasa was kidnapped and nearly killed as a hostage . Takenaka Hanbei ended up rescuing him . After Oda Nobunaga was killed in Honn - ji Incident , Nagamasa served Toyotomi Hideyoshi with his father and participated in the invasion of the Chugoku Region . Nagamasa served under Tokugawa Ieyasu during the Battle of Sekigahara . His men killed Shima Sakon , securing victory for the Eastern army . He also participated in the first Korean campaign ( 1592 -- 93 ) , leading 6000 men . Later he participated in the Osaka Castle campaigns .  - Hideyoshi is noted for a number of cultural legacies, including the restriction that only members of the samurai class could bear arms. He financed the construction, restoration and rebuilding of many temples standing today in Kyoto. Hideyoshi played an important role in the history of Christianity in Japan when he ordered the execution by crucifixion of twenty-six Christians.  - , first called Jbei from his clan and later from his title, was a samurai and general who lived during the Sengoku period of Feudal Japan.

Given the question: -  Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed  What might be the last step of the process? The answer is:","output":"The last step of the process in the renal system after waste filtration and removal is the excretion of urine. After the waste has been separated from the bloodstream, the unwanted substances and excess water combine to form urine within the kidneys. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the final steps leading to the excretion of urine: 1. Collection and concentration of urine: The waste particles and excess water that have successfully filtered through the nephrons within the kidneys are collected in the renal pelvis. This filtrate is concentrated into a more viscous fluid by the reabsorption of the remaining water, electrolytes, and solutes in the renal tubules. 2. Urine transport through the ureters: Once the urine is collected and concentrated in the renal pelvis, it is transported via the ureters (which are muscular tubes extending from the kidneys) towards the urinary bladder. The ureters use coordinated muscular contractions known as peristalsis to propel the urine forward. This process ensures that urine is continuously and unidirectionally moved towards the urinary bladder. 3. Storage in the urinary bladder: The urinary bladder is a hollow, muscular, and expandable sac located in the lower abdomen. It stores the urine until suitable conditions for its expulsion arise. The walls of the bladder contain specialized muscle fibers called the detrusor muscle, which contracts or relaxes based on the volume of urine stored. The bladder can hold approximately 500 to 600 mL of urine. 4. Urine elimination through micturition: The process of eliminating urine from the body is called micturition or urination. When the bladder is filled to a certain capacity, it triggers a sensation for the need to urinate. This sensation is communicated to the central nervous system, which in turn responds by allowing the detrusor muscle to contract, and both the internal and external urethral sphincters to relax. Consequently, urine is expelled through the urethra and out of the body. To summarize, the last step of the process after waste removal in the kidneys involves collecting and concentrating the filtrate into urine, transporting it through the ureters, storing it in the urinary bladder, and finally, eliminating it from the body during urination. This efficient system ensures that the body maintains its fluid balance and proper functioning while simultaneously removing harmful waste substances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future.  Rob always confuses the terms climate and weather. He found it's better to compare them if he needs to learn more about their characteristics. To make things easier, he labeled the weather of his city as char A. Then he labeled the climate of this city as char B. Once finished with learning their characteristics, Rob focused on climate change issues. For that, he labeled the climate of present time as char C and climate just before industrial revolution as char D.  Does char A represent longer or shorter time period than char B? A:","output":"Char A represents a shorter time period than char B. Char A refers to the weather of Rob's city, which describes temporary and short-term atmospheric conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Char B, on the other hand, refers to the climate of the city, which is the long-term average of weather conditions in that location, taking into account patterns and trends over extended periods of time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to English English:","output":"Another factor is the functioning of the Union.  This factor, the functioning of the Union, refers to the way in which a group of states or countries work together under a unified organization or system. There are multiple aspects to consider in understanding the functioning of a Union, including its political, economic, social, and legal dimensions. 1. Political dimension: The formation of a Union requires a consensus among its member states regarding the political structure, decision-making processes, and the distribution of power. Often, a Union would have a central governing body or a set of institutions that facilitate collaboration and coordination in areas such as foreign policy, defense, and political representation. The efficiency and effectiveness of these institutions significantly affect the functioning of the Union. 2. Economic dimension: A Union can also serve as an economic bloc that aims to promote trade, investment, and overall economic growth among its members. This can be done through the implementation of a common market, free trade agreements, or monetary policies. The functioning of the Union in terms of economic integration and collaboration can greatly impact its members' prosperity and competitiveness in the global economy. 3. Social dimension: The functioning of a Union also has social implications, as it can help foster a sense of common identity and shared values among its member states. This may lead to increased cooperation in areas like education, culture, science, and technology. Moreover, a Union can work towards promoting social cohesion and addressing issues such as migration, social inequality, and environmental sustainability, thereby contributing to the overall well-being of its members. 4. Legal dimension: The establishment of a Union typically involves the harmonization of laws and regulations among its member states. This process can enhance legal certainty and create a more predictable environment for businesses, citizens, and other stakeholders. The functioning of the Union in terms of the legal framework and the enforcement of common rules is essential for promoting trust, accountability, and the rule of law. In conclusion, the functioning of a Union is a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses various dimensions, ranging from political to economic, social, and legal aspects. The effectiveness and success of a Union greatly depend on how well its institutions, policies, and mechanisms work together to address the diverse needs and aspirations of its members. As such, understanding the functioning of a Union is crucial for evaluating its potential benefits and challenges, as well as for informing decision-making towards its evolution and development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The News of the World’s ex-legal manager today insisted that he told James Murdoch there was 'direct and hard evidence' that phone hacking extended beyond a single reporter in 2008. Tom Crone said he showed the News International chief a printout of the now-notorious 'For Neville' email at a meeting also attended by the paper’s then-editor Colin Myler. The email, which contained transcripts of illegally intercepted voicemail messages, apparently showed that hacking went beyond a single rogue reporter. Email claims: Tom Crone, pictured giving evidence to the Leveson inquiry yesterday, today said he showed James Murdoch in 2008 there was evidence phone hacking went beyond a single rogue reporter. Mr Crone told the Leveson Inquiry that he had shown Mr Murdoch a number of documents which included the 'For Neville' message during the meeting on June 10, 2008. 'I cannot remember whether they were passed across the table to him, but I am pretty sure I held up the front page of the email,' he said. 'I am also pretty sure that he already knew about it - in terms of it had been described to him already, which I think the other documents that have come out suggest anyway.' Clive Goodman, the News of the World’s former royal editor, was jailed along with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire in January 2007 after they admitted intercepting voicemail messages left on royal aides’ phones. Claims: James Murdoch was shown evidence that phone hacking was more widespread than just one reporter, Tom Crone said. Yesterday the inquiry was told Mr. Murdoch was sent emails which revealed that phone-hacking was ‘rife’ at the. News of the World in 2008. Mr Myler forwarded the executive an email exchange and added the note: ‘Unfortunately it is as bad as we feared’. Today Mr Crone said: 'What was certainly discussed was the email - not described as For Neville, but the damning email - and what it meant in terms of further involvement in phone hacking beyond Goodman and Mulcaire. 'And what was relayed to Mr Murdoch was that this document clearly was direct and hard evidence of that being the case.' Mr Murdoch has insisted that he was not shown the email or told that it proved phone hacking was more widespread at the News of the World than previously thought. The crucial 'For Neville' message is thought to have been intended for Neville Thurlbeck, the paper's chief reporter. The meeting with Mr Murdoch had been arranged to discuss a claim brought by Professional Footballers’ Association chief executive Gordon Taylor over the hacking of his phone by the News of the World, the inquiry heard. Former News of the World editor Colin Myler arrives at the Leveson Inquiry today. Mr Crone said he only 'temporarily' breathed a sigh of relief when the case was settled, adding: 'I was expecting another claim, frankly.' Explaining why the paper’s publishers agreed to pay Mr Taylor £425,000 plus costs, the lawyer said the company wanted to protect its reputation and reduce the likelihood of further expensive litigation. Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked him: 'This might also be interpreted as, to use a blanket term, a culture of cover-up. Would you accept that?' Mr Crone replied: 'No, I don’t think I would. It’s a culture of avoiding reputational damage through bad publicity, but it certainly isn’t a culture of cover-up if the damning documents are in the police’s possession and in fact came from the police.' Mr Crone also said he understood a representative of Madeleine McCann’s family gave the News of the World permission to publish the personal diary of the missing girl’s mother. Kate McCann told the inquiry last month that she felt 'violated' and like 'climbing into a hole and not coming out' when the intensely private journal appeared in the paper on September 14, 2008. Mr Crone said today: 'My understanding was that the representative of the McCanns had given the OK, the permission to the head of the newsdesk at the News of the World, to run the diaries or extracts from the diaries. I think he had emails to support that.' Mr Jay said: 'I have seen some documents which on one interpretation of them broadly support what you are saying.' Separately, appearing before the inquiry today, former News of the World editor Colin Myler said he 'did not recognise' much of the evidence given by Paul McMullan, the paper's ex-deputy features editor. Mr McMullan told the hearing last month that phone hacking was in the public interest, claimed celebrities often 'loved' being chased by journalists, and argued that 'privacy is for paedos'. Mr Myler said today: 'The criminality that took place, if it did take place, at the News of the World, is one thing, and whatever acts that individuals took part in, the full force of the law should take care of them. I'm sure it will. 'Mr McMullan often drifted off into a world of car chases, hacking phones, blagging, doing rather disagreeable things, and that is no world that I recognise.' Mr Myler took over running the News of the World in January 2007 after Andy Coulson resigned as editor when Goodman and Mulcaire were jailed. He spoke of losing his job as the Sunday Mirror's editor in 2001 after publishing an interview that led to the collapse of the first criminal trial of footballers Lee Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate. 'Being an editor is all about learning, and you learn from experience, and sometimes you make the wrong decision. The impact of making the wrong decision as an editor can be severe,' he said.","output":"The News of the World's former legal manager, Tom Crone, claimed that he informed James Murdoch in 2008 of \\"direct and hard evidence\\" of phone hacking extending beyond just one reporter.

Review: I first discovered Alexander Korda's (1940) Fantasy, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD in the early 1950's on a re-issue billed as \\"The Wonder Show of the Century!\\" Both Korda Technicolor films, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on one never to be forgotten program. The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films. The Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. As the years passed, it became more difficult to enjoy the film's color in the way it had originally been presented in. True Technicolor gave way to a Eastman Color process in the middle 1950's. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video. But the Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original Technicolor. The Laser Disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it -- nice, but not as it should be. NOW comes the M-G-M DVD (3 Dec 2002) issue. THE THIEF OF BAGDAD again has the wonderful Technicolor look to it on a DVD that is nothing short of STUNNING!!! It was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the DVD once, I watched it a second time. The only \\"Extras\\" are a Spanish Dubbed version, Sub-Titles in both English & Spanish, and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer. Thank you M-G-M for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release. Now, one can only hope that Korda's FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of Korda's JUNGLE BOOK (to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation) will soon follow on DVD.

Which university, Arizona State University and University of Maryland, College Park, had a fall enrollment of more than 37,000 students in 2010? Answer:","output":"In the fall of 2010, both Arizona State University (ASU) and University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) had large enrollments, reflecting their status as major public research universities in the United States. However, based on available enrollment data, Arizona State University had a significantly higher fall enrollment count of more than 37,000 students compared to the University of Maryland, College Park. Arizona State University is a public research institution with its main campus located in Tempe, Arizona. Established in 1885, ASU has grown to become one of the largest universities in the United States. As of the fall of 2010, ASU's enrollment reached approximately 73,378 students across all its campuses, including undergraduate and graduate programs (source: National Center for Education Statistics). This statistic far surpasses the 37,000 students mark. The University of Maryland, College Park, is a public research university founded in 1856. It is the flagship institution of the University System of Maryland and is one of the leading research institutions in the United States. In the fall of 2010, UMD had a total enrollment of approximately 37,272 students, including 26,826 undergraduate and 10,446 graduate students (source: National Center for Education Statistics).

News article: The hunt for a possible \\"Nazi gold train\\" will begin next week with experts inspecting the suspected site for the first time.      Rumours about two Nazi trains lost since the Second World War have long circulated but never been confirmed.      This summer a pair of local treasure hunters in south-western Poland claimed to have stumbled across a site they insist contains an armoured train coontaining the gold.      Poland's deputy culture minister, Piotr Zuchowski, said in August that he was \\"more than 99 per cent sure\\" one train was there after seeing ground-penetrating radar images.      Officials have since cast doubt on the evidence.      As of next week, however, experts will use measuring equipment and detectors to begin a \\"non-invasive\\" search of the ground.      \\"The experts will be able to use different measuring equipment and detectors but are not allowed to touch the ground,\\" Arkadiusz Grudzien, municipal spokesman, told AFP.      \\"They won't be able to dig, or drill or introduce cameras into the ground. They're only allowed to perform a non-invasive search\\".      Up to three trains are believed by some historians to have arms, art, gold and archives onboard and to have disappeared near the Czech border as the Soviet army advanced in 1945.      The suspected 18 square mile radius of their disappearance includes a network of underground tunnels dug out by prisoners of war, with some historians believing the Third Reich stashed treasure within them.      Experts going out to explore the area will include the two men, Piotr Koper of Poland and Andreas Richter, a German, who originally said they had found the train.      They claimed in August to have discovered a 98 metre long train carriage buried eight to nine metres underground in a railway tunnel after using ground-penetrating technology to scan the area. ||||| Poland 'Nazi gold train' investigators start surveying site in Poland Embankment to be searched with thermal imaging cameras to verify existence of possible cargo of stolen gold and artworks Polish military officials in September seal off the site near Walbrzych, where a second world war armoured train is believed to be hidden      Engineers are set to start surveying a railway embankment in south-western Poland to establish how to dig out a “gold train” that is thought to have been buried there in the dying days of the Third Reich.      The existence of a Nazi gold train, its whereabouts and its cargo – possibly stolen valuables and artworks – remain one of the great unsolved mysteries of the second world war.      “In the past 70 years, three cold war secret services – the United States, the Russian, then the Polish – carried out searches,” said Piotr Koper, a 44-year-old builder who claims to have found the suspected armoured train with a fellow treasure hunter. “We succeeded because we are local people.”      Some historians believe up to three trains laden with arms, art, gold and archives vanished in a 18 sq mile area near the present Czech border as the Red Army advanced in 1945. The strategic area includes Hitler’s command post at the grandiose Ksiaz Castle (formerly known as Fürstenstein) and Project Riese, a suspected secret weapons programme.      Project Riese was a network of underground tunnels and chambers dug out beneath the Owl Mountains by an estimated 30,000 prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners. The earth embankment that will be surveyed this week by teams including one from Krakow’s mining academy rises up alongside the existing Wroclaw-Walbrzych railway line.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest The underground galleries of Nazi Germany‘s ‘Project Riese’ construction project under the Ksiaz castle in Walbrzych, Poland. Photograph: Janek Skarzynski/AFP/Getty Images      It will be checked with magnetic field detectors, thermal imaging cameras and radars. The site, on the outskirts of Walbrzych, has been under police guard since August when Koper and his friend, German-born Andreas Richter, showed the authorities images they had taken with a £7,000 ground-penetrating radar kit.      “Four years ago, we were given information by a witness who was in Walbrzych at the time the train disappeared in April 1945. Radar technology has become affordable so we were able to check the information,” said Koper, who would not reveal if he knew anything about the hiding places of the other two supposed trains.      “The Nazis dug out the embankment, created a junction and laid track to divert the train off to the side. Then they parked the train, which is 90 metres long, removed the rails and put back the soil.”      Since August, the Polish military has cleared vegetation from an area the size of a football pitch. Soldiers have swept for mines and analysed the ground for the presence of poison gas. During the holocaust, Zyklon B – for use in gas chambers – is believed to have been transported on the line.      The treasure hunters’ images show only the outline of what appears to be a train. “We do not know what is inside, only that it is armoured, which suggests a precious cargo,” said Koper. “There could be gold but that is not what interests us. In fact, we were looking for a tunnel when we found the train.”      The men have hired a lawyer and applied to the Polish treasury for a reward of 10% of the eventual value of the train and its contents. “We have worked for four years to get to the bottom of legends that have flown around our city for 70 years. It has become a fascination,” said Koper, who added that he and Richter were well out of pocket for having self-funded all their research.      But others in Walbrzych, a depressed coal mining town with smog-stained blocks of flats and 20% unemployment, are already cashing in. Initial reports of the discovery, in August, brought a stream of tourists bearing metal detectors.      Walbrzych now has a Gold Train Car Wash, a Gold Train Skoda dealership and a line in souvenirs including fridge magnets, stickers, bags and gold ingot paperweights. At the city’s museum, there is a waiting list for gold train mugs.      “I’m no Indiana Jones,” said the district governor, Jacek Cichura, “but my colleagues in the rest of Poland now call me the gold governor. We are in a special economic zone. Life is tough. The young people are leaving to work abroad. But the gold train has brought a tourism boom.”      The influx of visitors is being felt across the district - from the towering Ksiaz Castle to the mist-clad Owl Mountains 10 miles (15km) to the south. According to local legend, the Führer’s castle lair is linked by at least one secret tunnel to Walbrzych and onwards to Project Riese’s underground network. Riese means giant in German, and this was where Hitler’s Wunderwaffe (magic weapons) were supposedly under development.      It is unclear to what extent the underground mega city and arms factory actually functioned and how much of what we know is simply surviving propaganda. But for the past 12 years, carpenter Krzysztof Szpakowski, 56, has dowsed his way to uncovering thousands of metres of passages dynamited into the pine-clad Owl Mountains. Some tunnels are flooded but in others he has found German machine guns and prisoner-of-war graffiti.      An eclectic mix of visitors – from militaria maniacs to bat fanciers – sign up for his guided tours. But Szpakowski himself has the exploration bug. He broke his arm last week when he slipped in one of the Riese’s dank, eerie tunnels.      “This was a closed military area – first Russian, then Polish – until 1991. The soldiers were looking for something. When I was a teenager we knew something had gone on here. But there was no one to ask because all the [German] residents were shipped out of the area and replaced by Poles after the Potsdam agreement.”      Szpakowski, Koper and Richter collaborate in their treasure-hunting by lending each other equipment. But they have different views of what is on board the “gold train”. Szpakowski believes it contains top-secret strategic equipment.      He said: “The Nazis wanted to develop an atomic bomb. They were working on anti-gravity propulsion. There is something on that train that was intended for Riese. We only know 5% of what went on in this part of the world,” he said. ||||| Warsaw (AFP) - Experts will next week begin inspecting the site in the southwestern Polish city of Walbrzych where a Nazi train that could contain looted treasure is allegedly buried, the city said Thursday.      A first group of experts, including the two men who claimed to have found the armoured Nazi train, will likely start their non-invasive search early next week, according to municipal spokesman Arkadiusz Grudzien.      A second group from the Mining Academy in Krakow will follow suit, he said.      \\"The experts will be able to use different measuring equipment and detectors but are not allowed to touch the ground,\\" Grudzien told AFP.      \\"They won't be able to dig, or drill or introduce cameras into the ground. They're only allowed to perform a non-invasive search.\\"      Treasure hunters Piotr Koper of Poland and Andreas Richter, a German, announced in August they had discovered a 98-metre-long (320-foot-long) train carriage buried eight to nine metres underground in a railway tunnel.      They believe the contents are mostly weapons prototypes, though according to local legend they could also include artwork and Nazi documents.      An army unit including a bomb squad completed tests at the site last month and declared it free of hazardous material.      Deputy Culture Minister Piotr Zuchowski said in August he was \\"more than 99 percent sure\\" the train exists after seeing ground-penetrating radar images.      But officials have since cast doubt on its existence, saying there was no credible evidence of it, without giving up their bid to verify the claim.      Rumours of two Nazi trains that disappeared at the end of World War II have been circulating for years, capturing the imagination of treasure-hunters.      The lore is fuelled by a massive network of secret underground tunnels near Walbrzych -- including around the massive Ksiaz Castle -- that Nazi Germany built and where legend has it the Third Reich stashed looted valuables. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The search for a \\"Nazi gold train\\" is set to begin next week near Walbrzych, Poland, with experts inspecting the site for the first time.

Answer the following question: For a moment, Paul wasn't even sure who had walked into the room. Chloe had totally transformed herself since he'd last seen her. She wore a wig for starters, and a very good one. It was light brown and shoulder length. It looked so natural that if he didn't know she had much shorter hair, he would have guessed that she had dyed it. But it was the outfit that made the change. She wore a well-tailored, very professional, gray woman's skirt/blazer combo with a yellow silk blouse. Her wrist sported what looked to Paul's uneducated eye like an expensive and fashionable gold lady's watch from which he thought he detected a glint of diamond. In short, she looked just like the high priced lawyer she was supposed to be. She was certainly the best-dressed person in the room. Chloe reached across the table to shake Greg's hand, stretching forward as she did so.

A: Select from the following. [-] siltation. [-] filtration. [-] biodegradation. [-] bioremediation. The answer is:","output":"Bioremediation.  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminated media, including water, soil and subsurface material, by altering environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade the target pollutants. In many cases, these microorganisms are already present at the contamination sites but aren't exposed enough to the pollutant to effectively degrade it. In such scenarios, bioremediation may be used to help increase population levels and pollutant degradation abilities. On the other hand, biodegradation is a natural process where organic substances are broken down by living organisms into smaller parts. While it's true that biodegradation involves microorganisms consuming pollutants, the term specifically refers to the natural, unaided process, whereas bioremediation includes intentional human intervention to promote the pollutant breakdown. Siltation and filtration are also processes related to the purification or cleaning of environmental resources, but they do not involve the use of microorganisms to consume a pollutant.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history.

The selection of bikes and accessories here is pretty good, but the service was terrible. These were the most unfriendly, annoyed, least helpful people I've ever experienced at a bike shop. They were annoyed that we got there 20 minutes before closing and practically shooed us out the door promptly at 5 'til.

However, the overall sentiment leans heavily towards the negative side due to the terrible service provided by the staff. The reviewer found the employees to be unfriendly, annoyed, and unhelpful, and their experience at this particular bike shop was unpleasant compared to other bike shops they have visited. Moreover, the staff's unwillingness to accommodate a simple request to use a tool and their rude behavior left a sour impression on the reviewer. This sentiment is further emphasized by the fact that they have spent thousands of dollars at other bike shops and are now unwilling to return to this one, despite it being conveniently located near their home. As a result, the review's tone and primary focus on poor customer service support the negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who noted that news of someone's incarceration was spread quickly by another, as planned? from the following article ?  Martin Luther King Jr. was held in the Birmingham jail and was denied a consultation with an attorney from the NAACP without guards present. When historian Jonathan Bass wrote of the incident in 2001, he noted that news of King's incarceration was spread quickly by Wyatt Tee Walker, as planned.  King's supporters sent telegrams about his arrest to the White House. He could have been released on bail at any time, and jail administrators wished him to be released as soon as possible to avoid the media attention while King was in custody.  However, campaign organizers offered no bail in order \\"to focus the attention of the media and national public opinion on the Birmingham situation\\".Twenty-four hours after his arrest, King was allowed to see local attorneys from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.Using scraps of paper given to him by a janitor, notes written on the margins of a newspaper, and later a legal pad given to him by SCLC attorneys, King wrote his essay \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\". It responded to eight politically moderate white clergymen who accused King of agitating local residents and not giving the incoming mayor a chance to make any changes. Bass suggested that \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\" was pre-planned, as was every move King and his associates made in Birmingham. The essay was a culmination of many of King's ideas, which he had touched on in earlier writings. King's arrest attracted national attention, including...

My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn’t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I’m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn’t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven’t set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I’m barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they’ve moved on, but I’m still too scared to find out. It’s an experience I never want to repeat, even though I didn’t actually experience anything. :/ Who had a blackout at the bar? - not enough information - the author of the story - the author's girlfriend - the author's son","output":"The person who had a blackout at the bar is the author of the story.

Article: An inventor seeks to create a new product that serves a specific need and fulfills a role that other products do not. Sometimes an inventor comes up with a wholly new idea, but more often inventions are simply improvements on an older design. With a little imagination and creativity  , an old idea can suddenly become something new. However, creating a new invention means much more than having a brilliant idea. A good designer follows the design process: identifying the challenge, researching and brainstorming ideas , designing a solution, testing and evaluating the ideas, and finally building the product. Designers also use science, math, technology, and engineering to design a tool that satisfies the need they identified. Anyone can be an inventor --even kids! For example, Chester Greenwood was just fifteen years old when he invented a product that changed his life. In fact, his idea was so good that his invention supported him for the rest of his life. You may not know his name, but you probably know his invention --earmuffs  ! The inspiration for his earmuff design came to Chester when he was ice-skating. His ears were cold, and he decided to find a way to keep them warm. With the help of his grandmother, he made a new product to protect his ears and at the age of eighteen, Chester patented his earmuff design. Many other famous inventors started young as well. Margaret Knight --the inventor of the flat-bottomed brown paper bag --is said to have created a safety device for textile looms  when she was just twelve years old. Another example is Thomas Edison, one of the greatest inventors in history, who applied for his first patent when he was just twenty-one years old. Over the course of his life, Thomas Edison patented a total of 1,093 inventions! Question: The example of Chester Greenwood is used to show that   _  .

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms.  and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Please answer this question : Who will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm?

In September 2010, Mikael Åkerfeldt stated that he was writing for a new Opeth album. The band announced on their website that they would start recording their tenth album on January 31, 2011, at the Atlantis/Metronome studios in Stockholm, once again with Jens Bogren (engineering) and Steven Wilson from Porcupine Tree as co-producer.Shortly after mixing was complete on the new album in April 2011, Opeth announced that Per Wiberg was relieved of his duties in the band. In the press statement, Mikael Åkerfeldt explained the decision, saying, \\"Mendez, Axe and Fredrik and I came to the decision that we should find a replacement for Per right after the recordings of the new album, and this came as no surprise to Per. He had, in turn, been thinking about leaving, so you could say it was a mutual decision. There's no bad blood, just a relationship that came to an end, and that's that.\\"Opeth's tenth album, Heritage, was released on September 14, 2011, to generally favorable reviews. The album sold 19,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release and debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200 chart. Heritage debuted at number four in the band's native country of Sweden.Heritage became the second Opeth album to not feature any death growls and had a much more progressive style than previous albums from the band, something that Åkerfeldt had been wanting to do for some time.The first two songs Åkerfeldt wrote for Heritage were in the style of Watershed. After hearing the songs for the first time, Martín Méndez told Åkerfeldt that he would be disappointed if the album continued in that direction. Relieved that Méndez was not interested in doing another conventional Opeth album, Åkerfeldt scrapped the two songs and started the writing process over in a different style. In the press release for Heritage, Mikael Åkerfeldt revealed that he felt as though he had been building to write the album since he was 19 years old.

Mount Cline is a mountain in the western part of Alberta, Canada, north of Saskatchewan Crossing, southwest of Nordegg. Both sentences communicate the following key information: - Mount Cline is a mountain. - The mountain is located in Alberta, Canada. - It is positioned to the north of Saskatchewan Crossing. - It is also located to the southwest of Nordegg. The first sentence emphasizes that Mount Cline is in western Nordegg, whereas the second sentence begins by specifying that the mountain is in the western part of Alberta, Canada.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Michael has become bored with his passive life style, and has decided to take up weight lifting as a hobby. He begins to exercise with weights several times a week. Michael's brother, Robert, isn't as motivated as Michael though. Robert decides to continue being mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months.  But I can use this background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it.  What is an answer for this question: Who will increase the size of their muscles less? Answer:","output":"Robert will increase the size of his muscles less. This is because he exercises with weights only every couple of months, which is not frequent enough to develop and maintain bigger, stronger muscles. In contrast, Michael's decision to take up weightlifting as a hobby and exercising several times a week will lead to a consistent increase in his muscle size and strength, as the regular resistance training challenges his skeletal muscles. Since continued exercise is necessary to maintain muscle growth, Michael's more active lifestyle will result in greater improvements in muscle size compared to Robert's mostly inactive approach."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you tell me the answer to gossip girl who does georgina end up with??","output":"Georgina Sparks, played by Michelle Trachtenberg, is one of the recurring characters in the popular TV series \\"Gossip Girl,\\" based on the book series by Cecily von Ziegesar. Throughout the series, Georgina has a dramatic and twisted storyline which includes multiple relationships, scandals, and schemes. By the end of the series, it is revealed that Georgina ends up with Philip Becker. Philip Becker, portrayed by actor Matt Doyle, is a minor character making his first appearance in the show's fourth season. His storyline crosses paths with Georgina during a time when she finds herself pregnant, claiming the baby's father is a Russian named Serge. However, through a series of interactions and discoveries, it is eventually revealed that the baby's father is not Serge but rather Philip. Georgina and Philip are initially introduced to each other by chance, and it quickly becomes clear that Philip is entirely enamored by Georgina and her wicked charm. Georgina ultimately decides to reveal her true identity to him, and in turn, Philip supports her with her many ploys and schemes. The couple faces many trials and tribulations together throughout the series, but notably, they always manage to find their way back to one another. Not much is known about Philip's character, as he is not as prominently featured as Georgina in the series. However, it is evident from his support for Georgina's antics and resilience in dealing with her chaos that he is a loyal and steadfast partner. In the series finale, it is mentioned that Georgina and Philip are still together, attending the wedding of Blair Waldorf and Chuck Bass. Their relationship has presumably grown stronger with time, overcoming the various obstacles that life in Manhattan's Upper East Side presents. While Philip's subdued nature might seem like an unexpected match for Georgina's chaotic personality, the pairing provides a unique balance between the two characters. Georgina's love life throughout \\"Gossip Girl\\" is tumultuous, to say the least. However, her connection with Philip showcases a more enriching and stable relationship. Despite coming from different backgrounds and having contrasting personalities, they complement each other and ultimately find love, trust, and partnership within their pairing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Johnson wrote: Nothing but ruin and starvation stare one in the face [in the streets of Manchester and the surrounding towns], the state of this district is truly dreadful, and I believe nothing but the greatest exertions can prevent an insurrection. Oh, that you in London were prepared for it. Unknown to Johnson and Hunt, the letter was intercepted by government spies and copied before being sent to its destination. The contents were interpreted to mean that an insurrection was being planned, and the government responded by ordering the 15th Hussars to Manchester. The mass public meeting planned for 2 August was delayed until 9 August. The Manchester Observer reported it was called \\"to take into consideration the most speedy and effectual mode of obtaining Radical reform in the Common House of Parliament\\" and \\"to consider the propriety of the 'Unrepresented Inhabitants of Manchester' electing a person to represent them in Parliament\\". The magistrates, led by William Hulton, had been advised by the acting Home Secretary, Henry Hobhouse, that \\"the election of a member of parliament without the King's writ\\" was a serious misdemeanour, encouraging them to declare the assembly illegal as soon as it was announced on 31 July.   The radicals sought a second opinion on the meeting's legality which was that \\"The intention of choosing Representatives, contrary to the existing law, tends greatly to render the proposed Meeting seditious; under those circumstances it would be deemed justifiable in the Magistrates to prevent such Meeting.\\"On 3 August, Hobhouse conveyed the view of the Attorney-General that the magistrates were incorrect to declare 9 August meeting illegal as it was called to consider the election of a representative and...

Process:  - A stream or river must occur - Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock - Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through - After many years the river may dry up - A dry ravine is left -   suppose the mother does not get an abortion happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER ravines forming.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","output":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. Before we analyze the impact of the supposed perturbation, let's recap the process of forming ravines. The formation of ravines typically involves a series of stages that lead to the development of deep and narrow channels that cut into the landscape. These stages are as follows: 1. A stream or river must occur: This is the initial phase where water starts to flow, forming a channel. 2. Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock: The flowing water carries sediment and other materials that erode the bedrock and soil, resulting in the channel deepening. 3. Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through: Over time, the channel becomes deeper and narrower as more material is removed by the erosion process. 4. After many years, the river may dry up: Eventually, the water source feeding the river may diminish, causing it to dry up. 5. A dry ravine is left: The final result is a dry ravine, which remains as an indication of the former river and the powerful erosive forces that shaped it. Suppose the mother does not get an abortion. While it is not a direct factor affecting the formation of ravines, it could indirectly influence the process. The presence of more people could lead to changes in land use, water consumption, and management of natural resources. Potential consequences include: 1. Altering water flow: An increase in the number of individuals may lead to higher water consumption for agricultural, industrial, or domestic purposes. This could affect the amount of water available in a river system and, in turn, influence the amount of erosion that takes place. 2. Changing land use: A growing population could result in land being converted to agricultural or urban usage, leading to deforestation and the removal of vegetation. This might impact the stability of the soil, accelerating erosion and increasing the likelihood of ravines forming. 3. Magnifying human impact: The indirect effects of a larger population may exacerbate ecological disturbances, such as pollution and habitat destruction, which could compromise the overall health of the river system and its ability to support the formation of ravines. It's essential to note that these indirect impacts do not directly modify a particular step in the process of ravine formation. Rather, they create broader, more complex changes in the surrounding environment that can influence the formation of ravines on a larger scale."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Kidder, one of five children, was born in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, the daughter of Jocelyn Mary \\"Jill\\" (nee Wilson), a history teacher, and Kendall Kidder, an explosives expert and engineer. Kidder also spent time growing up in Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador. Her mother was from British Columbia, Canada, and her father was from New Mexico, United States. She is of Welsh and English descent. Context: Kidder made her film debut in a 49-minute film titled The Best Damn Fiddler from Calabogie to Kaladar (1968), a drama set in a Canadian logging community, which was produced by the Challenge for Change. Her first major feature was the 1969 American film Gaily, Gaily, a comedy starring Beau Bridges. She appeared in a number of TV drama series for the CBC, including guest appearances on Wojeck, Adventures in Rainbow Country, and a semi-regular role as a young reporter on McQueen, and as a panelist on Mantrap which featured discussions centered on a feminist perspective. During the 1971-72 season, she co-starred as barmaid Ruth in Nichols, a James Garner western, which aired 22 episodes on NBC.  In the late 1960s, Kidder was based in Toronto, and in 1970, relocated to Vancouver. During an August 3, 1970 interview on The Dick Cavett Show, Kidder stated that she was ambivalent toward having a film career, and was considering working as a film editor in the future. She appeared in \\"Such Dust As Dreams Are Made On\\", the first pilot for Harry O which aired in March 1973. She was a guest star in a 1972 episode of the George Peppard detective series Banacek.  After moving to Los Angeles, Kidder was cast opposite Gene Wilder in Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx (1970) as an exchange student in Ireland who becomes the love interest of a poor horse manure collector in Dublin whom she almost runs over with her car. After filming in Ireland, Kidder relocated to New York City to further study acting. A year later, she returned to California, and was cast in the Brian De Palma cult classic Sisters (1973), which gained notoriety for both director and Kidder, who as leading lady, portrayed conjoined twins. Kidder had been in a relationship with De Palma at the time, and had been roommates with co-star Jennifer Salt in Los Angeles. She then starred in the slasher film Black Christmas in 1974, for which she won a Canadian Film Award for Best Actress; followed by a role as a prostitute in the Terrence Malick-scripted The Gravy Train (1974). She received another Canadian Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in the war drama A Quiet Day in Belfast (1974).

Process:  - The bird picks a tree - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside - The nest is done.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less steam is created happens, how will it affect MORE/LARGER nests.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The process of nest-building by birds typically involves the following steps: 1. The bird picks a tree 2. The bird collects twigs and other refuse 3. The bird makes a flat base with twigs 4. The bird makes sides with twigs and other things 5. The bird adds softer material to the inside 6. The nest is done. Now, let us consider the perturbation hypothesis: \\"suppose less steam is created happens, how will it affect MORE/LARGER nests\\". The perturbation scenario seems to be focused on the presence or absence of steam in the environment.  To evaluate the potential effects of the assumed perturbation on the nest-building process, it is essential first to understand the role of steam in nest construction (if any) and the scenarios in which steam could be produced.  Steam is formed when water is heated to its boiling point and undergoes a phase change from liquid to gas. There are few instances where steam could naturally occur in a bird's nesting environment: 1. Geothermal features such as hot springs or geysers might create areas with steam. 2. Steam could be produced by human-generated sources like industrial processes, power generation, or heating systems. In the context of bird nest-building, steam is not an essential component of the construction process. The materials typically used by birds - twigs, leaves, plant fibers, mud, and other found materials – do not have a direct relationship with steam or its effects. As a result, it is unlikely that the presence or absence of steam would have a direct impact on nest-building. However, there could be indirect effects of the presence or absence of steam on the construction of MORE or LARGER nests. For example: 1. If less steam is produced in a particular area, it might indicate an overall reduction in human activities and industrial processes. This could lead to a cleaner environment, which could indirectly benefit bird populations by improving air quality, reducing pollution, and giving them access to more natural resources to build their nests. 2. The availability of water sources might influence nest-building. An increase or decrease in steam production could affect the availability of water sources nearby the nesting sites, which could lead to more or fewer birds inhabiting the region. Improved access to water sources could encourage birds to build larger and more complex nests. 3. In the case of birds that tend to build their nests near geothermal features like hot springs, less steam production could signal changes in geothermal activity. This could impact the surrounding vegetation and microclimate, which might influence the materials and location choices for nest-building. Birds may need to adapt their construction techniques or materials to suit the changing environment. In conclusion, the presence or absence of steam does not have a direct effect on the process of nest-building by birds. However, there could be indirect effects on the construction of more or larger nests through environmental changes, access to natural resources, or shifts in suitable habitats caused by changes in steam production. It is important to consider the specific habitat, species of birds, and local conditions to determine the potential impacts of changes in steam production on nest-building behavior."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

McQueary reported the incident to Joe Paterno -- but never called police.Paterno -- who also did NOT go to the cops -- was fired last night for not living up to his moral obligation to the child.Bradley says he was unsure if McQueary will be coaching from the sidelines or if he will be up in the booth on Saturday. ||||| STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — When Mike McQueary went to Penn State Coach Joe Paterno ’s house on the morning of March 2, 2002, he was a graduate assistant — the lowest rung on the coaching ladder beneath Paterno. Still, McQueary, 28 years old and a football lifer, had aspirations of one day becoming a head coach, maybe even at Penn State.      A former quarterback for Paterno, he had once been a fan attraction for his shock of bright orange hair and his State College roots. Popular and known for an easygoing, collegial manner, he was beginning the baby steps toward his dream job.      Nine years later, what McQueary told Paterno at that meeting — he had seen a former senior football coach molesting a young boy in the football building’s showers — has figured prominently in the most ignominious episode in university history.      On Wednesday night, Paterno, who had hoped to remain as coach for the final three games of the season, was fired. Graham B. Spanier, the highly regarded and long-serving president of Penn State, was removed. Penn State’s athletic director has already been charged by the authorities. The campus is in turmoil. And there is a football game Saturday that could determine the team’s season.      In an ugly episode that has torn at the soul of a proud university, set off criminal investigations and ended the career of one of the sport’s most accomplished and revered coaches, McQueary has occupied among the strangest of positions: he could be the star witness in the coming criminal cases against senior officials at the university; he has become the target for widespread criticism for not having acted more decisively himself nine years ago; and he could well be on the sideline Saturday for the game against Nebraska, helping execute a game plan devised by the coach he once dreamed he might succeed. A Penn State victory would leave it in position to reach a major bowl game.      Jerry Sandusky, a former defensive coordinator under Paterno, has been charged with sexually abusing eight young boys over a 15-year-period. According to findings laid out by state investigators, only two Penn State employees were known to have witnessed Sandusky committing a sex crime: a janitor, who now has dementia and is not competent to testify, and McQueary.      “It’s not that he’s not willing,” John J. McQueary, his father, said about his son’s public silence. “I think it’s eating him up not to be able to tell his side, but he’s under investigation by the grand jury. He’ll make it. He’s a tough kid.”      McQueary’s parents, John and Anne, moved the family to State College when Mike was 6 and immediately bought season tickets for Nittany Lions football games. A former medical corpsman with the Navy’s special warfare operations, John became a physician assistant, and later, the chief operating officer of a large medical and surgical group in State College. He was also a renowned coach in the State College area himself in youth sports.      When Mike turned 13, his father talked the Penn State quarterback, John Shaffer, into coming by Mike’s birthday party to throw a football with him. As a gift, Shaffer threw Mike a new football as he left the party.      Tom Cestone, who lives on the cul-de-sac where the McQuearys raised their family, said his principal recollection of Mike was that he was always playing football in the yard. “He was a fiery kid,” Cestone said.      Another neighbor, 87-year-old Virginia Walker, said she also recalled Mike playing football with friends. “He comes from a close family, a nice family,” she said. “He’s a real decent kid, and he’s always been somewhat of a leader.”      In high school, McQueary was a star, and as a senior he led the State College Area High football team to a 13-1 record.      “He set high standards for himself and he was stellar in his attitude, his principles and his goals,” said Ron Pavlechko, who was the State College Area football coach for 19 years and later became the school’s athletic director. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The article discusses the case of Mike McQueary, a former Penn State assistant football coach who allegedly witnessed the rape of a pre-teen boy by Jerry Sandusky, a former defensive coordinator, in the locker room in 2002. McQueary reported the incident to head coach Joe Paterno but did not contact the police. Paterno, who also did not report the incident to law enforcement, was subsequently fired. Despite widespread criticism, McQueary continued to serve as a receivers coach during a game against Nebraska. The case led to the firing of other senior university officials, including Penn State President Graham B. Spanier, and has caused turmoil within the university and its football program. McQueary potentially holds a significant role as a witness in the criminal cases against the implicated officials, while also dealing with the backlash for not taking more decisive actions when the incident took place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which lake will have less dead zones?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.","output":"Based on the given information, Lake Costanza is likely to have fewer dead zones compared to Lake Montopeke. The reason for this can be explained by the differences in rainfall patterns experienced by the two farms neighboring these lakes. The farm next to Lake Montopeke receives rain on a regular basis, which leads to more frequent dissolving of fertilizers in the soil. As this dissolved fertilizer gets carried away by runoff, it ends up in Lake Montopeke. This process leads to an increased presence of nitrogen in the lake, which facilitates the growth of algae. When these algae die, decomposers utilize the oxygen in the water, ultimately creating dead zones in the process. In contrast, the farm adjacent to Lake Costanza hardly experiences any rainfall. This results in less dissolution of fertilizer in the soil and consequently less runoff carrying it into Lake Costanza. With a lower concentration of nitrogen entering the lake, there would be less algae growth, leading to fewer dead zones. In summary, due to the difference in rainfall experienced by the two farms, Lake Costanza is expected to have fewer dead zones than Lake Montopeke."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: STOCKHOLM, Oct.11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese writer Mo Yan has won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature, announced Peter Englund, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy in Stockholm on Thursday. The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012 is awarded to Chinese writer Mo Yan \\"who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary,\\" said Englund at a press conference. Mo Yan, a pseudonym for Guan Moye, was born in 1955 and grew up in Gaomi in Shandong province in eastern China.His parents were farmers. As a 12-year-old during the Cultural Revolution he left school to work, first in agriculture, later in a factory.In 1976 he joined the People's Liberation Army and during this time began to study literature and write.His first short story was published in a literary journal in 1981. \\"In his writing, Mo Yan draws on his youthful experiences and on settings in the province of his birth.This is apparent in his novel Hong gaoliang jiazu (1987, in English Red Sorghum 1993),\\" said the academy in a statement of Mo's biography. The book consists of five stories that unfold and interweave in Gaomi in several turbulent decades in the 20th century, with depictions of bandit culture, the Japanese occupation and the harsh conditions endured by poor farm workers, according to the biography.Red Sorghum was successfully filmed in 1987, directed by famous Chinese director Zhang Yimou. Through a mixture of fantasy and reality, historical and social perspectives, Mo Yan has created a world reminiscent in its complexity of those in the writings of William Faulkner and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, at the same time finding a departure point in old Chinese literature and in oral tradition, the academy commented in the biographical statement. In addition to his novels, Mo Yan has published many short stories and essays on various topics.In spite of his social criticism, he is seen in his homeland as one of the foremost contemporary authors, the statement added. Dozens of his works have been translated into English, French and... Question: Mo Yan started to earn his life_.

John has been struggling with the memories of his deceased wife, Sarah, and two children, Emily and Max. Seven years ago, they were all brutally murdered in their home, an incident that occurred during the weekend he was on a business trip. John is riddled with intense guilt and plagued by vivid nightmares of their murders. One day, at his regular therapy session, John's psychiatrist, Dr. Miller, suggests an experimental drug that might help him overcome his traumatic memories. John hesitates but ultimately decides to take the drug, hoping to find some solace in his life.  Act 2: After starting the drug treatment, John experiences a dramatic change. His nightmares become more vivid and frequent, and he starts seeing glimpses of his family around town. Confused and scared, he seeks help from Dr. Miller, who is genuinely puzzled by these symptoms. Dr. Miller suggests John to stop taking the drug and continue with therapy. However, while wandering through town one day, John sees a woman who looks strikingly similar to his deceased wife, Sarah. He follows her until she enters a house, which turns out to be an old abandoned mansion on the outskirts of the town. He watches her from afar, and upon a closer look, John is convinced - she is Sarah. Obsessed with unveiling the truth, John starts investigating the past. He finds an old newspaper article about a spiritualist group that used to live in the mansion. Rumor has it that they could bend reality and erase memories. Act 3: John, now obsessed with the mystery, teams up with a young journalist named Kate, who has been researching the spiritualist group for her article. Together, they discover the group's dark history and the shocking truth - some of the spiritualist group members are still alive, hiding in plain sight throughout the town. By delving deeper into the mysterious occurrences, they unveil the horrifying truth. The spiritualist group had abducted John's family to perform an experimental ritual, wiping out their existence from everyone's memories, including John's. The final stage is called \\"The Veiled Reality,\\" where the abducted person will find their own way back into the real world with no one remembering their existence in the past.

Complete the passage. (CNN)Twelve years ago, Rachel Miller was lost when it came to her son John. The 7-year-old was profoundly disabled because of his autism. Unable to speak, he withdrew from people at school and, worse, from his family. In March 2003, Miller was introduced to Jeff Hancock, a one-on-one therapist for people with autism, and things started to feel a little more manageable. Hancock was hired to be John's companion. The two would go people-watching at the mall in Stuart, Florida, on the weekends. Hancock chatted throughout their excursions, even though John couldn't talk back. Their relationship evolved when Hancock introduced John to the Special Olympics in Martin County. Hancock, a longtime volunteer for the organization, and Miller decided John should get involved in sports after they saw a rare sight: Whenever John was running or being active, he was smiling. Jeff probably saw that with us,\\"","output":"Miller speculates, thinking back on their early days together. \\"He must have noticed that sports had a big impact on John, that they brought him joy and helped him break out of his shell.\\" According to Miller, that was when they knew they needed to find an outlet or activity through which John could expand his horizons and fully tap into his potential. As it turned out, the Special Olympics turned out to be the perfect platform for John's transformation. With Hancock's guidance, John began participating in a variety of sports and activities specially tailored for people with intellectual and physical disabilities. In the beginning, John's primary focus was on track and field events. He found a sense of empowerment and enjoyment through running and jumping, which helped further develop his physical capabilities and boost his self-confidence. Over time, he expanded his repertoire to include basketball, swimming, and even volleyball. In each sport, John received guidance and support from qualified coaches and volunteers at the Special Olympics, who were committed to helping him grow both athletically and personally. \\"John's progress was nothing short of remarkable,\\" Miller recounts. \\"His social skills improved dramatically, and he began making friends through the organization. He still couldn't communicate verbally, but he had developed a non-verbal language, a way of connecting with others that transcended words.\\" An essential factor in John's growth was the bond he formed with Hancock. Having a one-on-one therapist who was dedicated to exploring his passions and overcoming his challenges made a significant difference in John's life. Hancock became not only a source of support for John but also a mentor, a friend, and a role model. \\"Jeff truly believed in John, and he instilled that belief in him,\\" Miller says. \\"That sense of confidence and trust began to permeate every aspect of John's life. He started to believe in himself and recognize his own abilities, and that was truly priceless.\\" Over the years, John's participation in the Special Olympics has had an immeasurable impact on his life. He has won numerous medals and awards, which fill the family's trophy case, but more importantly, the organization has helped him discover the incredible potential he held within. The once withdrawn, non-communicative boy has transformed into a confident and proud athlete who has made lifelong connections with friends, teammates, and coaches. As for Rachel Miller, she can hardly put into words the gratitude she feels for both the Special Olympics and Jeff Hancock. \\"They have given my son a chance to shine, to find his place in the world, and to achieve things we never thought possible,\\" she says. \\"The Special Olympics has changed our lives, and we will forever be thankful for the opportunities and the memories it has given us.\\" As John continues his journey through the world of sports and beyond, one thing remains constant – the unwavering love and support of his family, especially his mother Rachel Miller. Together with the Special Olympics and outstanding individuals like Jeff Hancock, they have paved the way for other families facing similar challenges, proving that there is hope, and that even with profound disabilities, one can still find joy, success, and a sense of belonging in this world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Its importance stems from its sculptor, its message, the era in which it was created, and the design of its reflecting pool by Howard Van Doren Shaw. Robert Jones, director of design and construction for the Art Institute of Chicago at the time, stated in 1999 that Time was the first finished art piece to be made of any type of concrete.The sculpture is located a few blocks from Taft's studio, the Lorado Taft Midway Studios, now a Chicago Landmark and National Historic Landmark, located at 60th Street and Ingleside Avenue. Other notable sculptures nearby include Henry Moore's National Historic Landmark Nuclear Energy, which is on the site of the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction at the University of Chicago. Jackson Park, connected to Washington Park and Time by the Midway Plaisance, hosts the Chicago Landmark Statue of The Republic; at one time the Midway Plaisance, Jackson Park and Washington Park were jointly known as \\"South Park\\".There is little agreement on the dimensions of Time, with various sources describing it as between 102 to 127 feet (31.1 to 38.7 m) long. One of the few precise estimates describes it as 126 feet 10 inches (38.7 m) long, 23 feet 6 inches (7.2 m) wide and 24 feet (7.3 m) tall.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.) In 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance... Answer:","output":"The first name of the person whose relationship with Shostakovich was described as \\"tender\\" is Galina.

One day after a mass shooting killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his support for a plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire Monday, Trump promised his supporters that, if elected, he would use the executive powers to \\"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\\" Although the suspected Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was an American citizen, Trump suggested immigrants from the Middle East can come to the U.S. and radicalize people who are already here, or work to convince them online. \\"The media talks about homegrown terrorism,\\" Trump said. \\"But Islamic radicalism ... and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or don't like it.\\" Refugees and immigrants from conflict ridden Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya could \\"be a better, bigger more horrible version than the legendary Trojan horse ever was,\\" Trump said.

Make this proper case.","output":"The region watered by the Sepik River is a fascinating area that holds immense interest for the lifestyle and culture of its inhabitants. These communities have unique customs involving their relationship with crocodiles which play a significant role in their culture and identity. Crocodiles are considered to be sacred creatures by the people living along the Sepik River. This belief has shaped their practices and traditions in a variety of ways. One of the most striking examples of the crocodile's influence on the local culture can be seen in the practice of skin scarification. This process involves making deliberate cuts on a person's body to create elaborate patterns that resemble the rugged skin of a crocodile. Skin scarification is performed primarily on young men, usually during their initiation into adulthood. The process is not only about aesthetics but also serves as a rite of passage. It is an essential part of their cultural identity and is believed to imbue them with the strength and power of a crocodile. Despite the social and cultural significance of this practice, there are instances where individuals may struggle to control the infection caused by the cuts made during the scarification process. Proper hygiene and medical care are vital for avoiding complications, but accessibility to these resources may be limited in certain areas along the Sepik River. A lack of sterilization at the time of the procedure, as well as inadequate aftercare, can result in infections that, if left untreated, can lead to severe consequences. Infections can cause the affected area to become swollen, red, and painful, potentially posing a risk to the individual's overall health if the infection spreads. Although there are risks associated with the practice of skin scarification, it remains a deeply rooted cultural tradition for the communities living along the Sepik River.

The answer to this question is:","output":"To determine which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb, I will compare their energy consumption and efficiency. Step 1: Understand the types of lights mentioned. - A vapor light typically refers to a high-intensity discharge (HID) light, like a high-pressure sodium (HPS) or metal halide (MH) lamp. These lights produce light by creating an electric arc through vaporized gases. - A regular light bulb generally refers to an incandescent light bulb that produces light by heating a filament wire to a high temperature until it glows. Step 2: Compare energy consumption and efficiency. - Vapor lights (HID lights) are more energy-efficient compared to regular incandescent light bulbs. Vapor lights produce more lumens per watt, which means they produce more light while using the same amount of energy. In other words, they use less energy to produce the same amount of light as an incandescent light bulb.

The answer is:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"light energy.\\" The correct answer is \\"inorganic substances\\" and other essential nutrients. Inorganic substances, such as water, minerals, and electrolytes, are indeed essential for various body processes. They play vital roles in maintaining the body's proper functioning, including fluid balance, bone formation, nerve transmission, and muscle function. In addition to inorganic substances, there are also organic nutrients that are essential for body processes. These include: 1. Carbohydrates - They are the primary source of energy for the body, providing fuel for physical activities and brain function. 2. Proteins - They are the building blocks of the body and are essential for growth, maintenance, and repair of cells, tissues, and organs. 3. Fats - They are a secondary source of energy and are essential for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, hormone production, and insulation of the body. 4. Vitamins - These are organic compounds, needed in small amounts, that play critical roles in metabolic processes, immune function, and overall health. There are two categories of vitamins: fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and water-soluble (B vitamins and vitamin C). 5. Light energy - Although not a direct nutrient, light energy is essential for maintaining the body's circadian rhythm and the synthesis of vitamin D when the skin is exposed to sunlight. In summary, essential nutrients for body processes include inorganic substances such as water, minerals, and electrolytes, as well as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and vitamins.

The first question is about the process and duration of an aircraft carrier coming to a stop, while the second question is about how an aircraft carrier maintains its level during operation. 1. How does an aircraft carrier stop itself and how long does it take to come to a complete stop? Step 1: Cut Engine Power To stop the aircraft carrier, the first step is to reduce its engine power. This will slow down the ship, gradually reducing its forward momentum. Step 2: Apply Reverse Thrust Next, the process of applying reverse thrust may be utilized. The propellers of the ship can be reversed, generating thrust in the opposite direction. This will help to slow the ship down more quickly. Step 3: Use Anchors If needed, anchors can be deployed to help bring the aircraft carrier to a complete stop. Anchors create significant drag through water resistance, helping to slow the ship down. Step 4: Consider Factors The time it takes for an aircraft carrier to come to a complete stop depends on various factors, including its speed, displacement (size/weight), and weather conditions. On average, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier can take about 3-5 minutes to stop, traveling at around 30 knots, and covering approximately 1 mile of distance before coming to a complete stop. 2. How does an aircraft carrier stay level? An aircraft carrier stays level primarily through a well-designed hull, advanced ballast control systems, and sophisticated stabilization systems. Step 1: Hull Design The hull of an aircraft carrier is designed to provide a large, stable platform that is able to evenly distribute weight across the water surface. The ship's overall shape and size help to keep it level in most conditions. Step 2: Ballast Control Inside the hull, there are chambers that can be filled or drained to adjust the weight distribution of the ship. By adjusting the ballast, it is possible to maintain a level position despite changes in the weight and distribution of equipment, aircraft, and personnel. Step 3: Stabilization Systems Modern aircraft carriers are equipped with advanced stabilization systems such as fin stabilizers and/or gyroscopic stabilizers. These systems help to counteract the rolling motion caused by waves and wind, keeping the deck as level as possible during operations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The hot iron I'm scared shitless off it  Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","output":"Based on the content and context of the tweet, it appears to convey a mixture of negative emotions. Here is a detailed analysis of the sentiment in this tweet: 1. Fear: The user explicitly states that they are \\"scared shitless off it,\\" referring to the hot iron. Fear is a potent negative emotion, and in this case, it seems to stem from a possible fear of getting burned or injured by the hot iron. 2. Discomfort: The user mentions that this is \\"the only part I hate,\\" which implies that they are uncomfortable with the idea of using a hot iron. The word \\"hate\\" also suggests a strong aversion, and that they have strong negative feelings towards this specific aspect of whatever task they are performing. This could be due to the potential pain or damage a hot iron can cause. 3. Frustration: Although not explicitly stated, it is possible to infer a sense of frustration from the tweet, as the user seems to be bothered by the fact that the hot iron is an inevitable part of the process they are undergoing. They may feel that there's no other feasible option and are forced to use the hot iron, even though they would prefer not to. 4. Vulnerability: The use of casual language and the admission of fear in this tweet may also indicate a sense of vulnerability. It can be assumed that the user feels vulnerable while handling the hot iron, which could lead to anxiety and hesitation that further adds to the negative sentiment in the tweet. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet is predominantly negative, with the key emotions involved being fear, discomfort, frustration, and vulnerability. The user seems to struggle with using a hot iron and feels apprehensive about the process, likely due to the potential risks and unpleasant experiences associated with it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.

Context: The United States occupation of Nicaragua from 1912 to 1933 was part of the Banana Wars, when the US military forcefully intervened in various Latin American countries from 1898 to 1934. The formal occupation began in 1912, even though there were various other assaults by the U.S. in Nicaragua throughout this period. American military interventions in Nicaragua were designed to stop any other nation except the United States of America from building a Nicaraguan Canal. Nicaragua assumed a quasi-protectorate status under the 1916 Bryan-Chamorro Treaty. But with the onset of the Great Depression and Augusto C. Sandino's Nicaraguan guerrilla troops fighting back against U.S. troops, it became too costly for the U.S. government and a withdrawal was ordered in 1933.

The Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George is a British order of chivalry founded on 28 April 1818 by George, Prince Regent, later King George IV, while he was acting as regent for his father, King George III.  It is named in honour of two military saints, St Michael and St George.  The Order of St Michael and St George was originally awarded to those holding commands or high position in the Mediterranean territories acquired in the Napoleonic Wars, and was subsequently extended to holders of similar office or position in other territories of the British Empire. It is at present awarded to men and women who hold high office or who render extraordinary or important non-military service in a foreign country, and can also be conferred for important or loyal service in relation to foreign and Commonwealth affairs.  The Order includes three classes, in descending order of seniority and rank:  It is used to honour individuals who have rendered important services in relation to Commonwealth or foreign nations. People are appointed to the Order rather than awarded it. British Ambassadors to foreign nations are regularly appointed as KCMGs or CMGs. For example, the former British Ambassador to the United States, Sir David Manning, was appointed a CMG when he worked for the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), and then after his appointment as British Ambassador to the US, he was promoted to a Knight Commander (KCMG).

Choices:  - burned - polished - carved - composted - nailed  The rationale to choose \\"polished\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Polishing a piece of wood involves smoothing and buffing its surface, often applying a glossy finish, like lacquer or wax. This process can make the wood's surface reflective, allowing you to see your reflection in it. Here's a brief explanation for each of the choices: - Burned: When wood is burned, it turns into charred and blackened material with an uneven surface. This doesn't create a reflective surface, so you won't be able to see your reflection. - Polished: As mentioned earlier, polishing a piece of wood smooths and buffs its surface while often adding a glossy finish. This process creates the potential for a reflective surface where you can see your reflection. - Carved: Carving wood is a process in which material is removed to create a specific design or shape. Carving does not necessarily make the surface reflective, and it could even create a more uneven surface. Therefore, you're unlikely to see your reflection in a piece of carved wood. - Composted: Composting is a process in which organic materials, like wood, decompose into a nutrient-rich material to enhance soil quality. During this process, the wood breaks down and loses its original form, so it won’t have any reflective surface for you to see your reflection in. - Nailed: Nailing refers to the action of fixing or joining objects together using nails. This doesn't involve altering the surface of the wood to create a reflective surface, so you won't be able to see your reflection in a piece of nailed wood.

But more often than not there is a chain of events leading up to the misfortune-frustration, tiredness or just bad temper-that show what the accident really is, a sort of attack on oneself. Road accidents, for example, happen frequently after a family quarrel, and we all know people who are _ , so often at odds with themselves and the world that they seem to cause accidents for themselves and others. By definition, an accident is something you cannot predict or avoid, and the idea which used to be current, that the majority of road accidents are caused by a minority of criminally careless drivers, is not supported by insurance statistics. These show that most accidents involve ordinary motorists in a moment of carelessness or thoughtlessness. It is not always clear, either, what sort of conditions make people more likely to have an accident. For instance, the law requires all factories to take safety actions and most companies have safety committees to make sure the regulations are observed, but still, every day in Britain, some fifty thousand men and women are absent from work due to an accident. These accidents are largely the result of human error or misjudgment-noise and fatigue, boredom or worry are possible factors which contribute to this.

The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that. Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now.

Hypothesis: The Huntsville State Prison will be executing an Canadian Citizen","output":"Based on the context provided, we can draw the following hypothesis: The Huntsville State Prison is scheduled to execute a Canadian citizen, Mr. Stanley Faulder, on December 10, 1998. The context indicates that the House is requesting the government to convey their concerns about the violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations in Mr. Stanley Faulder's case. The violation in question appears to have occurred due to his status as a Canadian citizen. The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations is an international treaty that defines a framework for consular relations between independent countries, and part of its mandate is to ensure that foreign nationals who are arrested or detained receive essential information regarding their right to communicate with their consular post. In the given context, it seems that the case of Mr. Faulder might have overlooked this provision. Furthermore, the House is requesting not only that their concerns be conveyed to the governor of the state of Texas, Hon. George W. Bush, and the parole authorities of the state but also that they express their respectful request for the execution to be stayed. The reason behind this request is to ensure that due process has been followed and that a judicial review of the case takes place before any irreversible action is carried out. In conclusion, the hypothesis that the Huntsville State Prison will be executing a Canadian citizen, specifically Mr. Stanley Faulder, is supported by the context provided. However, it should be noted that the House is actively attempting to address the violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations in this case and is seeking a stay of execution pending a judicial review to ensure that due process has been followed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the full names of the people who completed the first high-rise building in Chicago? ?  The Monadnock was commissioned by Boston real estate developers Peter and Shepherd Brooks in the building boom following the Depression of 1873–79. The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission. Burnham and Root would become the architects of choice for the Brooks family, for whom they would complete the first high-rise building in Chicago, the 10-story Montauk Building, in 1883, and the 11-story Rookery Building in 1888.

Article: The casual Friday concept   was one of the first signs that strict dress rules for offices were starting to relax. The principle of casual Fridays seems to have appeared around the 1950s. It was probably in response   to the changing attitudes towards workplaces. Over time, some offices have relaxed their dress rules even more by using a \\"business casual\\" dress rule. On casual Fridays, employees   may wear clothes which are considered to be \\"business casual\\", meaning they still obey certain standards  . Clothes must be clean and in good condition, with no spots. Men are generally allowed to wear casual trousers and bright-colored clothes, and in some offices they may be allowed to wear button-down shirts or polo shirts, with or without a tie. Women often wear neat skirts or dresses; casual trousers are common and generally allowed to wear, except in very formal workplaces. As a general rule, extremely casual clothes, like jeans, shorts, T-shirts, tank tops, and so on, are not encouraged on casual Fridays. Employees are still expected to make an effort to look professional, out of respect for their offices and their customers. Many people feel that casual Fridays are good for employees'mood because they encourage employees to express their individuality   and feel more comfortable in the offices. Others feel that business casual clothing and the concept of casual Fridays don't show respect for the workplaces. Casual Fridays are dealt with differently, depending on the industry and the nation. The technology industry, for example, is well known for casual clothes in general, while major financial companies still dislike casual clothes. Question: In general, on casual Fridays, as an employee in a company you can wear   _  .

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Jason Rezaian, a 38-year-old dual Iran-US citizen, and his Iranian wife Yeganeh Salehi, were taken into custody on Tuesday evening, the paper said. Two freelance photographers, also US citizens, were being held too. Western news organisations, including the BBC, have great difficulty operating in Iran, with journalists facing detention and surveillance. \\"We are deeply troubled by this news and are concerned for the welfare of Jason, Yeganeh and two others said to have been detained with them,\\" Washington Post foreign editor Douglas Jehl said in a statement. Mr Rezaian, who is from California, has been the Post's Iran correspondent since 2012. Ms Salehi works as a correspondent for the National, an English-language newspaper based in the United Arab Emirates. Their detention was confirmed by Iran's Chief Justice Gholamhossein Esmaili, who said they were being questioned but did not give a reason for the arrests, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Mr Esmaili said the judiciary would release more details on the detention following \\"technical investigations\\", and said Iranian security forces are \\"vigilant towards all kinds of enemies' activities\\". The detentions of Jason Rezaian and Yeganeh Salehi came as the Iranian authorities step up pressure on independent journalists and bloggers. A number of people have been summoned to Tehran's Evin prison in recent months on charges of involvement in propaganda against the state. Those detained include four female reporters - Marzieh Rasouli, Sajedeh Arabsorkhi, Reyhaneh Tabatabaei and Saba Azarpeik. The media rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders says there are currently 64 journalists and social media users imprisoned in Iran. The Iranian authorities have long kept the media under strict control, but arrests and intimidation intensified after the 2009 democracy protests. When President Rouhani took office in August 2013 a number of reporters were released from prison, and Ministry of Intelligence representatives in his new cabinet seemed to have taken a more relaxed approach towards the media. But at the same time journalists have come under renewed pressure from the judiciary and the Revolutionary Guards, who operate outside the government's jurisdiction. President Rouhani has so far said nothing about the latest wave of arrests. A reporter in Tehran for a Western news outlet who has been a friend of Mr Rezaian for five years said the couple had expressed no concern over their security or fears they would be detained. \\"They were just working hard and only talked about how they enjoyed reporting from here,\\" the reporter told the BBC. \\"This is also a surprise, because the atmosphere in general had appeared to become more open for foreign news outlets, at least, with more foreign journalists getting visas and accreditation.\\" Threats against BBC The reporter said that the handful of dual-national journalists operating in Iran are now quite nervous following Mr Rezaian's detention. Authorities in Iran frequently detain or harass journalists working for Western news organisations, and westerners with dual citizenship are typical targets. Iran-based family members of BBC journalists have been questioned by intelligence services, and authorities have attempted to intimidate London-based BBC Persian staff by setting up false Facebook pages on which BBC staff members purport to admit to sexual misconduct or to spying for the UK. Last year, Iran warned the families of 15 BBC Persian Service journalists that their relatives must cease working for the BBC in London, and in some cases the lives of the staff were threatened. In 2009, Iranian-American reporter Roxana Saberi was held for five months after being arrested for purchasing a bottle of wine. She had worked as a freelancer for the BBC and for US radio network National Public Radio. The same year, a reporter for AFP was held for several days. Summary:","output":"A man named Jason and his wife Yeganeh, who are both reporters, were taken into custody along with two other people. The place where they live, Iran, can be difficult for reporters because sometimes they get detained and watched. People are worried about their well-being, and it is not clear why they were arrested. This is happening in a time when Iran is putting more pressure on journalists, and many of them have been sent to prison. Things seemed to be getting better for foreign journalists lately, but this latest arrest has made some of them nervous."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I am not familiar with Ming-liang Tsai movies, and I am very familiar with art cinema; I grow up in the seventies times of Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others. Art movies then were really ART; like paints. People did it to express their inner feelings, not really worried about if other people understand anything. They were beyond commercial values; just look some old Antonioni (or early Picasso) and you will understand. Tian bian yi duo yun (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with that. It is an opportunistic movie, intended to fool festival judges and critics, playing many things without saying anything. The story makes no sense. The lack of water makes the government to promote the use of watermelons to hydrate. A girl in desperation, steal water from the public bathrooms WC. There is also a porno start (neighbor) trying to make a movie with an actress he does not seems to feel comfortable with. There is some romantic awakening between the girl and the porno star. The mess ends with a sexual scene (not pornographic) that many people feel shocked about, but I believe it is less provocative than you can see in American Pie or History of Violence. The two main characters never talk. Sometimes, a musical number 60 style appears and explains (through a song) what is happening in characters minds. These video clips, are really welcomed because the previous scene, without dialog or music only people looking at each other, takes sometimes 4, 5 or even more minutes which in movie times is TOO MUCH.  There is also a few bits about \\"the difficult to make sex without love\\", the \\"selfish mind of the porno industry\\".  It is obvious, this movie intended (get away with it) to fool festival juries and critics. It have a few pseudo-shocking scenes (within the limits of Taiwan censorship) and many subjects are open, but nothing is concluded or goes anywhere.  These tricks, got the movie a few (disputed) important prices in film festivals and get the movie an undeserved commercial success (I see the movie in France and the theater was packed).  However, please, do not be fooled. There is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed in this movie. It is boring and empty; really a fraud to public.

Clayton Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Breath of Life\\" Genre: Sci-Fi/Drama/Adventure Plot: The year is 2071, and mankind has successfully established a thriving colony on Mars. Clayton, a brilliant and dedicated aerospace engineer, finds himself at the forefront of interplanetary travel. After years of hard work, he is chosen as one of the six astronauts that NASA will send on a deep-space mission to explore the existence of life on a distant exoplanet called Elysium-9. The intense training and preparation have forged a strong bond between the six astronauts, who come from different countries. Each one of them has their own unique personality and brings something valuable to the team. As the mission begins, they leave behind their families and Earth, embarking on a perilous journey—knowing that they won't return for at least a decade. Months into their mission, the spacecraft they are on, the BEACON, encounters an unexpected cosmic dust storm, causing significant damage to the onboard life support system, specifically the oxygen generator. The astronauts are faced with a dire situation—it quickly becomes apparent that there isn't enough oxygen left for the entire crew to survive until they complete their mission. Clayton, the engineering genius that he is, tackles the challenge head-on. With limited resources and time ticking away, he must either fix the oxygen generator or find an alternative solution to ensure that the mission can continue and all astronauts can survive. Amidst the pressure, the team's unity and trust are put to the extreme test, as some crew members begin to prioritize personal survival over the mission's success. As the crew approaches Elysium-9, they receive a faint signal from the exoplanet's surface, indicating possible life. Intrigued and spurred on by hope, Clayton works tirelessly, finally managing to create a makeshift oxygen-filtration system utilizing a unique bacterium native to Elysium-9. While this system doesn't provide enough oxygen for the entire crew, it gives Clayton the wrenching responsibility of deciding to whom the remaining oxygen should be given. Realizing the moral implications, Clayton must grapple with determining the value of one life over another, examining each crew member's potential contribution to the mission's success. The difficult decision weighs heavily on Clayton, further driving the crew apart as suspicions and arguments arise, threatening to dismantle the unity that has carried them so far. Ultimately, Clayton makes the tough decision, resulting in two crew members being placed in cryogenic stasis for the rest of the mission. The remaining crew members, inspired by Clayton's courage and selflessness, get to work analyzing the now-accessible resources on Elysium-9.

Question: Information:  - Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. Literally, \\"professor\\" derives from Latin as a \\"person who professes\\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank.  - The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current campus opened in 1916 and extends over along the northern bank of the Charles River basin.  - MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) is a research institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology formed by the 2003 merger of the Laboratory for Computer Science and the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Housed within the Stata Center, CSAIL is the largest on-campus laboratory as measured by research scope and membership.  - Electrical engineering is a field of engineering that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the later half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electric power distribution and use. Subsequently, broadcasting and recording media made electronics part of daily life. The invention of the transistor, and later the integrated circuit, brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object.  - Silvio Micali ( born October 13 , 1954 ) is an Italian - born computer scientist at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a professor of computer science in MIT 's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science since 1983 . His research centers on the theory of cryptography and information security .  - Data integrity is the maintenance of, and the assurance of the accuracy and consistency of, data over its entire life-cycle, and is a critical aspect to the design, implementation and usage of any system which stores, processes, or retrieves data. The term \\"data integrity\\" is broad in scope and may have widely different meanings depending on the specific context even under the same general umbrella of computing. This article provides only a broad overview of some of the different types and concerns of data integrity.  - Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek \\"kryptós\\", \\"hidden, secret\\"; and \\"graphein\\", \\"writing\\", or \\"-logia\\", \\"study\\", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.  - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Thousands of teenagers will be able to move to a new wave of \\"studio schools\\" at the age of 14 to improve their chances of finding a job in UK. Twelve new-style schools are open to act as a bridge to the workplace and cut the number of NEETs. Under plans, schools will operate longer days and work outside standard school terms. Each teenager will be expected to spend between four hours and two days a week on work placements with business related to the school and a personal coach will be sent to the teenagers to act as a school \\"line manager\\". The reforms   are put forward because of the fears that too many teenagers are finishing full-time education at present but they are short of the skills needed to succeed in the workplace. According to a recent report, more than two thirds of employers   believe school and college leavers have less important employability skills, while 55% say they are unable to manage their time or daily routine. And the number of NEETs who are not in education has hit a record high, with almost one-in-five young people being left without a job or a training place. The Department for Education will tell the public the building of 12 studio schools - providing for around 3,600 teenagers - in areas such as Liverpool, Stevenage, Stock-on-Trent and Fulham, west London. Each one will be connected to the local employers. Under plans, teenagers will be able to move out of ordinary schools to attend them between the ages of 14 and 19. The government said all subjects would be taught \\"through projects, often prepared with employers\\" - with rules such as science being connected directly to local engineering companies or hospitals. Schools will operate a longer day to give teenagers a better understanding of the needs of the workplace. Along with their studies, students will carry out work placements for four hours a week, rising to two days a week of paid work for those aged 16 to 19. They will also get the chance to take professional qualifications   connected directly to the needs of local employers. Options: A The worry about educated teenagers short of working skills.

Although the design of the dome was working perfectly as per the user's statement, there were a few significant drawbacks that led to the negative experience. Firstly, the plastic hooks that came with the product failed to support the weight of the user's bird feeder. This resulted in the feeder crashing to the ground, causing damage to an expensive item valued at 100. Such an unfortunate event could have been avoided if the hooks were made of stronger material or if the user had known the limitations of the product beforehand. Moreover, the user has observed other domes available in the market that feature metal hooks, which could potentially be a better and more reliable alternative for hanging bird feeders. This indicates that the user is leaning towards recommending those alternative products with metal hooks over the current product in question. In conclusion, considering the user's experience and the issues highlighted in the review, it is evident that the user would not recommend this particular product to others. The failure in terms of durability and structural integrity has led to the destruction of an expensive bird feeder, and the user advises potential buyers to explore alternative options with metal hooks for better performance and reliability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Gather materials - A cutting knife or offset spatula (a thin, flat tool) - Wax or parchment paper - A cutting board or flat surface - Optional: Cooking spray or a small amount of oil/butter Step 2: Prepare the dessert - Place the dessert on a cutting board or a flat surface that is easy to clean. - If the dessert is very sticky or difficult to handle, place a sheet of wax or parchment paper between the dessert and the cutting surface to prevent it from sticking. Step 3: Prepare the cutting tool - Use a sharp, non-serrated knife or an offset spatula as your cutting tool. To prevent the dessert from sticking to the tool, you can lightly coat the blade or spatula with cooking spray or a small amount of oil/butter. Alternatively, you can dampen the knife with water before cutting. Step 4: Cut the dessert - Make sure your hands are clean and/or wear disposable gloves to handle the dessert. - Determine how many portions you want to cut the dessert into and decide on their size and shape. - Firmly press the cutting tool down through the dessert, using a smooth, consistent motion. - After each cut, clean the tool by wiping it with a damp cloth, and reapply the cooking spray/oil/butter or dampen with water as needed to prevent sticking. Step 5: Transfer and serve - After cutting the dessert into the desired portions, use a spatula or your hands (if wearing gloves) to carefully transfer each piece onto a serving plate. - If the dessert is still sticky, consider placing a piece of wax or parchment paper between the dessert and the serving plate to prevent it from sticking. - Enjoy your neatly sliced sticky dessert!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They tour a luxurious, four-story brownstone and are shown, among other things, the master bedroom which houses an interesting commodity: a panic room. Lydia Lynch (Ann Magnuson), the realtor, explains that the previous owner was a reclusive millionaire who built the hidden panic room as a safeguard against intruders. It's protected with four-inch walls and an impressive security system built in complete with a separate phone line and security cameras situated throughout the townhouse. However, despite Sarah's intrigue, Meg is apprehensive about the room. Still, pressured by the tight market and assured that the home will quickly close, Meg decides to move in right away. After some light unpacking and a pizza dinner, they settle in for the night. Meg checks her daughter's watch, designed to track her blood sugar and keep her type 1 diabetes in check, before retreating to her room to bathe and down a bottle of red wine, clearly distraught over the move and her recent divorce. She attempts to wire the phone system in the panic room but gives up and goes to bed as rain falls outside.Later that night, three men break into the house. Junior (Jared Leto), the grandson of the previous owner and Burnham (Forest Whitaker), an employee of the security system with which the panic room was fitted, intend to steal the 3 million in bearer bonds stored in a floor safe inside the panic room. Burnham is distressed to see, however, that Junior has recruited a buddy of his named Raoul (Dwight Yoakam) to assist in the heist. Burnham argues over Raoul's presence, saying that he knows nothing about him and the plan was for just two of them to quietly go in, get the money, and get out.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden.

A North Korean soldier looks south from the North side at the truce village of Panmunjom, South Korea, July 22, 2015.      SEOUL North Korea has erected a new, taller launch tower at its missile base, possibly in preparation for firing a long-range rocket to mark an important national anniversary in October, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported on Wednesday.      The 67-metre (220-ft) tower will be able to accommodate the launch of a longer-range missile than the rocket test-fired in December 2012. That launch was widely considered successful in putting an object into space orbit, the Yonhap report said.      North Korea is banned under U.N. Security Council resolutions from conducting tests that use ballistic missile technology but has defied international warnings and sanctions to pursue missile and nuclear programs.      \\"Our assessment is that the North will use the newly upgraded Tongchang-ri (missile) launch pad to launch a long-range missile larger than Unha-3,\\" Yonhap quoted a South Korean government source as saying.      Unha-3 refers to the long-range rocket fired in 2012 from the base near its west coast.      The launch is likely to come around the 70th anniversary of the founding of the North's ruling Workers' Party on Oct. 10, the source was quoted as saying.      South Korea's Defense Ministry could not immediately confirm the report but an official said they were seeking to verify it.      North Korea is believed to be developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) but is seen as years away from deployment. It is also working to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to mount on a delivery vehicle.      (Reporting by Jack Kim; Editing by Paul Tait) ||||| SEOUL, July 22 (UPI) -- North Korea has built an extension to a rocket-launching platform near the China border in what Seoul said is preparation for a rocket launch ahead of a major anniversary.      Construction began in late 2013 on a preexisting 50-meter launch pad at Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Tongchang-ri, North Pyongan Province, and the work of adding 17 meters to the site is near completion, an unidentified Seoul official told Yonhap on Wednesday.      The purpose of the extension is to launch missiles twice the size of the Unha-3, according to South Korean news outlet Daily NK.      The Unha-3 is an expandable carrier rocket that was launched in 2012 and fell into the Yellow Sea. The debris of a second stage launch fell into the Philippine Sea after an object had entered orbit.      Another Seoul government source said intelligence indicated North Korea was producing long-distance rockets in a Pyongyang munitions factory and that South Korea had credible information Kim Jong Un had ordered the launch of a \\"satellite\\" to mark the 70th anniversary of the Workers' Party of North Korea.      Activities at Pyongyang Mirim Airport showed preparations for a large-scale military inspection by Kim Jong Un. Scud missiles, 240-mm rocket launchers, artillery, armored vehicles and transportation equipment had been assembled.      South Korea expects any launch around the Oct. 10 anniversary would be used as a provocation against Seoul.      \\"We are closely watching the construction in Tongchang-ri,\\" South Korean Defense Minister Kim Min-seok told Yonhap.      North Korea insists the site, which has audio, video and data connections to Pyongyang's control centers is for a \\"peaceful satellite launch.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"North Korea has reportedly erected a new, taller launch tower at its missile base, in what South Korea's Yonhap news agency suggests could be preparation for firing a long-range rocket to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the country's ruling Workers' Party on October 10th.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve the equation 18*q - 545 = 60*q - 41 for q, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the variable 'q' on one side of the equation by moving all terms involving 'q' to one side and all constants to the other side.  First, we can subtract 18*q from both sides of the equation to move all the 'q' terms to the right: -545 = 42*q - 41   (since 60*q - 18*q = 42*q) Step 2: Isolate 'q' by moving the constant from the right side of the equation to the left side. To do this, we can add 41 to both sides of the equation: -545 + 41 = 42*q -504 = 42*q Step 3: Solve for 'q' by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'q', which is 42 in this case: -504 / 42 = q q = -12 So, the value of q is -12."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Who had more troops in Iraq in 2003, the United States, or the Kurdish militia?\\"  Context: \\"After the lengthy Iraq disarmament crisis culminated with an American demand that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein leave Iraq, which was refused, a coalition led by the United States and the United Kingdom fought the Iraqi army in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you provided suggests that more greenhouse gas production will occur, and we will examine how this might affect cleaner air quality and if there are any direct or indirect effects on the overall process. 1. Impact on cleaner air quality:  Increased production of greenhouse gases will have a negative impact on cleaner air quality. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), contribute to air pollution and can exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular health problems among the population. Higher concentrations of CO2 in particular, emitted mainly from fossil fuel combustion in power plants, vehicles, and industrial processes, will lead to increased smog, acid rain, and ground-level ozone, all of which reduce air quality. 2. Direct effects on the process:  As human activities add more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, the process of heat radiation being trapped in our atmosphere increases. This leads to a rise in the Earth's temperature, known as global warming or climate change. Higher greenhouse gas concentrations directly influence the energy balance within Earth's atmosphere by absorbing and reradiating more thermal energy, affecting heat exchange between Earth's surface and the atmosphere, and potentially intensifying weather-related events such as storms, floods, and droughts. 3. Indirect effects on the process:  The increase in greenhouse gas emissions can also have several indirect effects on the process. For example, higher temperatures due to global warming may lead to: - Melting polar ice caps, causing sea levels to rise and increasing the risk of coastal flooding. - Changes in ecosystems, affecting species distribution and potentially causing extinctions. - Disruptions in agriculture and food supply, as changing climate patterns affect crop production and availability of freshwater resources. - Increasing prevalence of vectors (e.g., mosquitoes) that transmit diseases, thereby impacting human health. In conclusion, increased production of greenhouse gases will have a negative impact on cleaner air quality and will both directly and indirectly affect the process of solar radiation absorption, heat radiation, and temperature regulation on Earth. It is crucial to implement strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to protect air quality and prevent further consequences related to climate change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: When the inquiry finally emerged in its full two million words, in the chaotic aftermath of the EU referendum, its analysis was polite. But it was firmly critical of the decision-making process and behaviour of the UK government both in the run-up to, conduct of, and aftermath of one of the most controversial conflicts in British foreign policy - what many now regard as one of the UK's biggest foreign policy mistakes. In the immediate aftermath of the inquiry itself, Sir John, a former Whitehall permanent secretary who had worked for decades at the highest level of government, declined to take further part in the debate, as his and his panels' conclusions were digested. But in the run-up to the report's anniversary, he agreed to speak for the first time about the inquiry's conclusions, its criticisms and consequences for us all. Exactly a year ago, he produced two million words in 12 volumes, to detail a seven-year long study of the tumultuous political and diplomatic events in the run-up to, conduct, and aftermath of the 2003 Iraq War. But what was implicit in the lengthy pages of that document is now crystal clear in his personal, succinct and unvarnished view of the hours of evidence, thousands of documents, and witness accounts of one of the country's most significant public inquiries. He defends its duration, its conduct, and believes strongly that the work could stop another rush to war in the future. Sir John told me believes the \\"rising generations\\" of the military have understood and absorbed the lessons of the inquiry so much that they would demand and insist that future governments would be required to be more rigorous, more thorough in their examinations of the case for war. He explained his exhaustive criticism of the relationship between Tony Blair and George W Bush, his shock on seeing their private correspondence for the first time. He also spoke of his own relief at how the families of those killed in the conflict received his report when it was finally published. But he speaks plainly on perhaps the most fundamental political question of all, the role of the former prime minister. When asked if Tony Blair had been as straight with the country and the inquiry as he ought to have been, Sir John told me, 'any prime minister taking a country into war has got to be straight with the nation and carry it, so far as possible, with him or her. I don't believe that was the case in the Iraq instance.\\" He went on to say he believed Tony Blair had given an \\"emotional truth\\" to the inquiry, and had been \\"suffering\\" during its sessions - Tony Blair was always, he said ,\\"the advocate\\" for whom, \\"persuasion is everything\\". A spokesperson for the former prime minister referred us to his comments when the inquiry was published, when he said the report showed there were no lies, and no deceit, but that he took responsibility for the criticisms of how decisions had been made. You won't be surprised, having undertaken such a huge task, that Sir John speaks on a massive range of issues concerned with the Iraq war. The conflict may have begun 14 years ago now, the inquiry taking longer than the war itself. But for our politics, our diplomacy, and our military, this new more personal account will still resonate today. Summary:","output":"Sir John Chilcot, who led the seven-year inquiry into the British government's conduct in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq War, believes that future generations of military leaders would insist that governments are more thorough and rigorous in their examinations before going to war. Speaking to the BBC, Chilcot said of former Prime Minister Tony Blair: \\"Any prime minister taking a country into war has got to be straight with the nation and carry it, so far as possible. I don't believe that was the case in the Iraq instance.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Question: \\"What tiny section of the organ in a person's head that is concerned with sentimental experiences is located just below the thalamus?\\"  Context: \\"Emotions are thought to be related to certain activities in brain areas that direct our attention, motivate our behavior, and determine the significance of what is going on around us. Pioneering work by Broca (1878), Papez (1937), and MacLean (1952) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the limbic system, which includes the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures. More recent research has shown that some of these limbic structures are not as directly related to emotion as others are while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The tiny section of the organ in a person's head that is concerned with sentimental experiences and is located just below the thalamus is the amygdala. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The user is asking for a specific brain structure involved in emotions, located below the thalamus. 2. The given context mentions the limbic system, which is known to be involved in emotional processing. 3. Within the limbic system, the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, and hippocampi are mentioned. However, these areas are not specifically located below the thalamus. 4. The amygdala, which is not mentioned in the context but is part of the limbic system, is a well-known brain structure involved in emotional processing and is located just below the thalamus. 5.

Please answer the following question: As many of you will have seen, unfortunately the Ubuntu Edge campaign did not reach our goal of 32million. The final total reached was 12,812,776. I am hugely proud and thankful to everyone who pledged, supported the campaign, wrote about it, and helped to spread the word. Some have described us not meeting the goal as a “failure”. I don’t see it that way. Let’s be honest: 32million was always an incredibly ambitious target. We would have liked to have done it for less money, but building a F1 superphone doesn’t come cheap (and remember that the 32million didn’t include any costs for software engineering and project management…Canonical were providing that for free). It was an ambitious target, but disrupting an industry is ambitious in itself, and we gave the crowd-funding campaign our best shot. The story does not end here though. I am not surprised that we didn’t hit this ambitious 32million target, but I am surprised at what we did achieve. We broke all the crowd-funding records, garnered media attention across CNBC, Engadget, The Independent, TechCrunch, the BBC, T3, Stuff, The Verge, The Guardian, Wired, pandodaily, Fast Company, Forbes, The Telegraph and more. Every single person who put their support into the Ubuntu Edge campaign should be proud of their achievements and we are all thankful for your tremendous and inspiring support. One thing to be critically clear about is that the Ubuntu convergence story does not end here. We are as voraciously excited and committed to bringing this Free Software convergence story to the world as ever before; our work with OEMs, Carriers, and ISVs continues apace. We have fantastic work going on across all fronts, and we are on track to have a 1.0 release of the Ubuntu Phone platform in October.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: How does Gail's husband give the information to Hector? ?  As part of a plan to launder billions of dollars in London, \\"the Prince\\" – the head of the Russian Mafia – creates a new bank and has its financial oligarchs sign over their accounts to him. The first oligarch to do so is murdered alongside his family by a blue-eyed assassin. Poetics lecturer Perry MacKendrick  and his barrister wife Gail are on a holiday in Morocco to try and salvage their marriage after Perry slept with one of his students. Perry strikes up a friendship with Dima, a hearty and boisterous Russian with an eidetic memory. The two men bond over drinks and tennis before Dima invites both MacKendricks to his daughter's birthday. At the birthday party, Dima gets Perry alone and gives him a USB stick that links corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. He fears for his life after hearing of his fellow oligarch's fate, and pleads with Perry to turn the USB stick over to MI6 when he returns to London. Perry turns the information over to MI6 agent Hector, the investigator in charge. The information provided by Dima enables Hector and his supervisor Billy to witness a meeting between the Prince and corrupt politician Aubrey Longrigg. Billy refuses to sanction an investigation on a chance meeting. Hector continues regardless and recruits the MacKendricks to help stage a chance encounter with Dima in France. There, Dima provides all the names of his clients and confirms each banker and politician involved has received £5 million each for their endorsement of the new bank, with Longrigg receiving £30 million. Dima refuses to provide the bank account numbers that would verify the corruption until he and his family have been granted asylum in London.

Movie plot title: Harakiri Movie plot: Edo, 1630. Tsugumo HanshirÅ arrives at the estate of the Ii clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him SaitÅ Kageyu (RentarÅ Mikuni), the Daimyo's senior counselor, tells HanshirÅ the story of another rÅnin, Chijiiwa Motome â formerly of the same clan as HanshirÅ. Motome arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as HanshirÅ. Infuriated by the rising number of \\"suicide bluffs\\", the three most senior samurai of the clanâYazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuroâpersuaded SaitÅ to force Motome to follow through and kill himself. Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, HanshirÅ insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, HanshirÅ is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of SaitÅ and the Ii retainers, HanshirÅ successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuroâthe three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. After provoking their laughter by calling bushido a facade, HanshirÅ recounts his story to SaitÅ and the Ii retainers. He did, he admits, know Motome after all. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shogun. His Lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, HanshirÅ planned to die alongside him. To prevent this, HanshirÅ's closest friend performed seppuku and left a letter assigning to HanshirÅ the guardianship of his teenage sonâMotome.

Question: Information:  - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects  either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole.  - Robert Andrews Millikan (March 22, 1868  December 19, 1953) was an American experimental physicist honored with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1923 for the measurement of the elementary electronic charge and for his work on the photoelectric effect.  - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown.  - George Ellery Hale (June 29, 1868  February 21, 1938) was an American solar astronomer, best known for his discovery of magnetic fields in sunspots, and as the leader or key figure in the planning or construction of several world-leading telescopes; namely, the 40-inch refracting telescope at Yerkes Observatory, 60-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, 100-inch Hooker reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson, and the 200-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Palomar Observatory.  - The Association of American Universities (AAU) is an international organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education. It consists of 60 universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada.  - Amos Gager Throop (; 18111894) was a businessman and politician in Chicago, Illinois during the 1840s and 1850s. Most famously he was known for being a staunch abolitionist prior to the Civil War. In Chicago he lost two campaigns to be that city's mayor in 1852 and 1854. In both elections he was the nominee of the little-known Temperance Party, facing tough opposition from the Democratic Party. At the time of the Great Chicago Fire Amos was the city treasurer. He was instrumental in securing financing from New York to rebuild the wooden frontier town into a city of brick and mortar. Grateful Chicagoans renamed Main Street to Throop Street. Many years later and after moving to California, he was finally elected mayorof Pasadena, California in 1888.  - Wallace Leslie William Sargent FRS ( February 15 , 1935 -- October 29 , 2012 ) was a British - born American astronomer and the Ira S. Bowen Professor of Astronomy at California Institute of Technology .  - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.  - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.  - A vocational school, sometimes called a trade school or vocational college, is a post-secondary educational institution designed to provide vocational education, or technical skills required to perform the tasks of a particular and specific job. Vocational schools are traditionally distinguished from four-year colleges by their focus on job-specific training to students who are typically bound for one of the skilled trades, rather than providing academic training for students pursuing careers in a professional discipline. While many schools have largely adhered to this convention, the purely vocational focus of other trade schools began to shift in the 1990s \\"toward a broader preparation that develops the academic\\" as well as technical skills of their students.  Australia. Vocational schools were called \\"technical colleges\\" in Australia, and there were more than 20 schools specializing in vocational educational training (VET). Only four technical colleges remain, and these are now referred to as \\"trade colleges\\". At these colleges, students complete a modified year 12 certificate and commence a school-based apprenticeship in a trade of their choice. There are two trade colleges in Queensland; Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Australian Industry Trade College and one in Adelaide, Vergalargona rico, Technical College, and another in Perth, Australian Trades College.  - The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center located in La Cañada Flintridge, California and Pasadena, California, United States.  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - Pasadena is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of 2013, the estimated population of Pasadena was 139,731, making it the 183rd-largest city in the United States. Pasadena is the ninth-largest city in Los Angeles County. Pasadena was incorporated on June 19, 1886, becoming only the second city to be incorporated in what is now Los Angeles County, after Los Angeles (April 4, 1850). It is one of the primary cultural centers of the San Gabriel Valley.  - Arthur Amos Noyes (September 13, 1866  June 3, 1936) was a U.S. chemist, inventor and educator. He received a PhD. in 1890 at Leipzig under the guidance of Wilhelm Ostwald.  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - The California Institute of Technology (abbreviated Caltech) is a private doctorate-granting university located in Pasadena, California, United States. Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán. The university is one among a small group of Institutes of Technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences.

A: Afterwards Caesar turned his attention to the Pompeian stronghold of Hispania (modern Spain) but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Julius Caesar's armies crossed the river Rubicon in 49 BC, marking the beginning of a civil war between Caesar and Pompey, who was representing the Roman Senate. This event is very significant in Roman history, as crossing the Rubicon signaled Caesar's defiance towards the Senate and his intentions to forcefully gain power within the Roman Republic. Leading up to these events, Caesar had been consolidating power through his conquests in Gaul (modern-day France and Belgium). As his term as the Governor of Gaul was ending, the Senate instructed Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome without any armed forces. By crossing the Rubicon, Caesar was committing a provocative act of war, since Roman generals were not allowed to bring their armies from their provinces to Rome. Knowing that he had many supporters in Rome, Caesar proceeded with his plan and crossed the river Rubicon with his legions. This led to a civil war that lasted from 49 to 45 BC, ultimately culminating in Caesar's victory and the collapse of the Roman Republic. After crossing the Rubicon, Caesar went on to campaign against various opponents, including his rival Pompey who fled to Greece. Caesar pursued Pompey and defeated him in the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC. Pompey was later assassinated in Egypt, leaving Caesar as the unchallenged leader of the Roman world. Caesar continued his campaigns, eventually defeating the remaining Pompeian forces in Spain and North Africa, which solidified his power and sparked the transition from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire. In summary, Julius Caesar's armies crossed the river Rubicon in 49 BC, a decisive event that initiated the Roman Civil War and ultimately led to Caesar's rise as the supreme ruler of Rome, replacing the Roman Republic with the Roman Empire."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

As the Civil War closes, Lincoln mentions his concern that the country's dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice, \\"Go West, young man,\\" which, mercifully, the film didn't erroneously attribute to Horace Greeley, as a number of others did. But then, he gets assassinated, and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the American Indians. In the meantime, we see Wild Bill Hickock, who interacts with a small boy, while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the Mississippi. Wild Bill uses a Bowie knife, which he eventually gives to the boy, calling it an \\"Arkansas Toothpick,\\" which in reality was a different type of knife, though both were used throughout the frontier. Hickock eventually meets Buffalo Bill Cody, who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man. Cody has just gotten married, and is bringing his bride to the Old West to settle down. When they arrive at their destination, they run into Calamity Jane, who has a crush on Hickock. She looks at Cody's wife, and asks Buffalo Bill, \\"Is this your mopsy?\\" The line was one that caused the Hayes Board some problem, since one definition of \\"mopsy\\" was prostitute. Demille wanted the line in, and one of his aides pointed out that in Beatrix Potter's books about Peter Rabbit, three of the rabbits were Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail. He pointed this out and asked the censors to identify \\"the rabbit of ill virtue.\\" It worked; the line stayed in. The Indians were getting restless, in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the Eastern financiers. Cody and Hickock were asked to help scout the area, so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area. Cody led the troops; Hickock went to check out the activities of an Indian chief, who was an old acquaintance, and who was leading some of the hostile Indians. Calamity Jane gets captured, and Hickock gets captured trying to save her. They are brought to the chief, and although neither would talk, torture applied to Hickock breaks Calamity Jane's willpower, and she tells the route Cody is using. The two are released, and Hickock joins up with Cody and his forces, in part to alert them they're walking into a trap. With Hickok's help, they hold off the Indian attack. Hickock decides to go after the gun runners, and finally takes them prisoner. As they're waiting for authorities, Hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards. There are numerous historic anomalies in the film, but it retains the flavor of legend. Pretty good for the 1930s. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

Article: After the Union of Horodło the Lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with the Polish szlachta, and over time began to become more and more polonized, although they did preserve their national consciousness, and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots. In the 16th century some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were of Roman extraction, and the Lithuanian language was just a morphed Latin language. This led to paradox: Polish nobility claimed own ancestry from Sarmatian tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies to Romans. Thus new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led that in the 16th century the new term to name Lithuanian nobility appeared šlėkta—a direct loanword from Polish szlachta. From the view of historical truth Lithuanians also should use this term, šlėkta (szlachta), to name own nobility, but Lithuanian linguists forbade the usage of this Polish loanword. This refusal to use word szlachta (in Lithuanian text šlėkta) complicates all naming. Now answer this question: What did the polish szlachta become more of?","output":"The Polish szlachta became more like the Lithuanian nobility after the Union of Horodło. They became more equal and shared similar status. However, the Lithuanian nobility started to become more polonized, which means they became more like the Polish szlachta in culture and language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The agreement came after two weeks of talks between the leaders at the 21st Conference in Paris, France. As part of the Paris agreement, countries said they would cut down on pollution However, according to the terms of the deal, countries that don't do this will not be punished, or fined. Instead,the document is meant to show that governments around the world take climate change seriously and are willing to work together to fight global warming. World leaders have met many times to discuss climate change. But, the 21st Conference of Parties, or COP21, which began on November 30 in Paris, was the first time they agreed on a global, legal pact  . Before the conference, each nation was asked to create plans on how to reach the shared goal. The pact that was signed allows countries to decide the best way to cut down their gas pollution. No matter how they decide to go green, each country must report honestly on all of their efforts. Every five years, nations must look at the work they've done and submit new plans on how they will improve over the next five years. In the pact, the countries pledge to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted  by human activity to the levels that trees,soil and oceans can absorb naturally. It urges countries to spend trillions of dollars on creating new energy sources, like solar and wind power. It also requires countries to raise at least  100 billion each year to help developing countries. However, critics of the pact say it is not detailed enough, and doesn't include specifics about how the plan will be enforced and how improvements will be measured. The pact does include one large, specific goal: how countries will aim to keep global temperatures from rising more than 3. 60degF(20degC) by 2100. Nonetheless,the agreement is considered by many world leaders to be a major victory. The U. N. has been working more than two decades to convince governments to work...

Appropriate verb form: \\"Holding\\" is the present participle form of the verb \\"hold,\\" which works well with the continuous action required in the competition (i.e., keeping the arm extended and holding the object). In contrast, \\"lift up,\\" \\"pick up,\\" and \\"lifting\\" share a common notion of moving an object from a lower to a higher position, which is not the primary focus of the competition. \\"Hold onto,\\" on the other hand, is somewhat ambiguous in this context and does not provide as clear an image of the competition's challenge as \\"holding\\" does."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"I've been tryin' to reach you.\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, the phrase \\"I've been trying to reach you\\" can be translated as \\"Snažím se tě dovolat\\" or \\"Snažil jsem se tě dovolat.\\"  Let's break down the first translation, \\"Snažím se tě dovolat\\": 1. \\"Snažím se\\" means \\"I am trying\\" or \\"I've been trying.\\" The verb \\"snažit se\\" (to try) here is in its present tense, 1st person singular form (reflecting \\"I\\" as the subject). 2. \\"tě\\" is the pronoun \\"you\\" in the accusative case, serving as the direct object of the verb. 3. \\"dovolat\\" is the infinitive form of the verb \\"to reach (by phone)\\". The root \\"volat\\" means \\"to call,\\" and the prefix \\"do-\\" strengthens the meaning, making it \\"to successfully call\\" or \\"to reach.\\" The second translation, \\"Snažil jsem se tě dovolat,\\" conveys a similar meaning but with a slight difference in tense: 1. \\"Snažil jsem se\\" means \\"I was trying\\" or \\"I tried.\\" The verb \\"snažit se\\" here is in the past tense, 1st person singular form (reflecting \\"I\\" as the subject), and the past participle \\"snažil\\" matches the gender of the speaker – masculine in this case; for a female speaker, it would be \\"snažila jsem se.\\" 2. \\"tě\\" and \\"dovolat\\" remain the same as in the first translation. Both translations are correct, and the choice depends on whether you want to convey the ongoing effort of trying to reach someone (present tense: \\"Snažím se tě dovolat\\") or the action that occurred in the past (past tense: \\"Snažil jsem se tě dovolat\\")."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The exchanges were ferocious, mainly attacking the media, whose dishonesty, he said, was out of control. It included the moment when he told an African-American journalist to set up a meeting between him and a group of black lawmakers, suggesting that they knew each other. It started when April Ryan asked the president about including the Congressional Black Caucus in discussions about issues related to the African-American community. Ms Ryan, who is White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks, first used the group's acronym CBC, but Mr Trump apparently did not recognise it. Then he asked her: \\"Do you want to set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours?\\" \\"No, no, I'm just a reporter\\", she answered. The exchange came minutes after Mr Trump said he was the \\"least racist person\\". The CBC expressed dismay at Mr Trump's comments. Democratic Congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina says they contained \\"an element of disrespect\\", according to the Associated Press. Some of the group's members shared their reactions on social media, along with President Obama's national security adviser and former US ambassador to the UN Susan Rice. Mr Trump finished his answer by accusing Democratic representative Elijah Cummings, a senior member of the caucus, of being told not to meet with him. But CBC said on Twitter it had sent a letter to Mr Trump before his inauguration, but that it had never got a response. After the news conference, Ms Ryan gave TV interviews in which she said she did not feel insulted by the president's remarks - and that she was \\"old school\\" and not supposed to be in the news. Later, she came back to Twitter to announce that a meeting between Mr Trump and the CBC might take place, although no date had been set. But by then, Mr Trump's comments had created a wave of responses from social media users. This was not the only awkward moment of the press conference. Mr Trump had a long exchange with Jim Acosta from CNN, which he again described as \\"fake news\\", called the BBC \\"another beauty\\", and told reporter Jake Turx, from Jewish publication Ami Magazine, to sit down after he asked a question about anti-Semitism. In that exchange, which came before Ms Ryan asked her question, Mr Trump said: \\"Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person you've ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person.\\" He then interrupted Mr Turx - \\"Quiet, quiet, quiet\\" - and accused his opponents of some of the anti-Semitic acts. Summary:","output":"During a turbulent press conference, US President Donald Trump asked African-American journalist April Ryan to set up a meeting between him and the Congressional Black Caucus, seemingly assuming that they knew each other.

Wolf island displayed lots of evidence for natural selection, and had a large variety of species inhabiting it.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which island had animals that displayed more beneficial heritable traits?  Hint: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.

Context: After the four failed expeditions on Junkceylon, Bodawpaya gave up on wars with Siam, and now looked to the small states to the west. The first target was Manipur, which had regained independence from Burma since 1782. In February 1814, he sent an expedition force to place his nominee Marjit Singh to the Manipuri throne. The Manipuri army was defeated after heavy fighting, and its raja Chourjit Singh fled into Cachar. However, Marjit Singh revolted after Bodawpaya died in June 1819. The new king Bagyidaw sent an expedition force of 25,000  in October 1819. Gen. Maha Bandula reconquered Manipur but the raja escaped to neighbouring Cachar. In November 1820, the fallen raja's forces laid siege to the Burmese garrison at Imphal, and withdrew only when Burmese reinforcements were approaching. Nonetheless, the raja continued to raid Manipur with British support using his bases from Cachar and Jaintia, which had been declared as British protectorates, to the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1824. Question: Who did British support?

After Marjit Singh's revolt against the Burmese in 1819 and the reconquering of Manipur by General Maha Bandula, Chourjit Singh continued his efforts to reclaim the Manipuri throne with the backing of the British. By providing support and offering territories such as Cachar and Jaintia as bases for Raja Chourjit Singh's military operations, the British sought to counterbalance the influence and power of the Burmese Empire in the region. This collaboration and the ongoing conflicts between the Burmese and the British-backed forces eventually contributed to the outbreak of the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1824."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Intreged with his new neighbors, Charley begins to spy on them.One day, a young woman (obivously a call girl) shows up at Charley's house by accident looking for another address and Charley directs her to the house next door. The next morning at school, Charley sees a news broadcast about the police finding \\"another murder victim\\" from an unknown serial killer who decapitates female victims and drains the bodies of blood.Another evening later, Charley, suspecting something sinister about his new neighbors, spies on the house next door and sees Jerry Dandridge bitting the neck of a young teenage girl. He tells his mother what he saw, but she passes it off as Charley's imagination. Charley tries to tell his friend \\"Evil Ed\\", and girlfriend Amy Peterson, but neither of them believe him, and begin to worry about Charley's mental well being.Another day later, Charley calls the police with information about one of the murder victims and a detective accompanies him to the house where they meet Billy Cole, Jerry Dandridge's \\"roommate\\" who lets them in and shows them around the house. Finding nothing, the detective decides to leave, but Charley tells him to check the basement, which Billy seem adament about letting them go down there. The detective forces Charley to leave with him and tells him not to ever call on him again, thinking that Charley has an overactive imagination.Suspecting that Jerry Dandridge is a vampire, he seeks advice from Evil Ed about how to fight vampires. Evil Ed tells him, from watching movies and documentaries about suspected vampires, that vampires are super strong, have no heartbeat or pulse, have vulnerabilites to holy water and crosses. They also cast no reflection in a mirror and they and can only be killed by fire, decapitation,... My question: Who does Jerry kiss and possess?

Movie title: Porky's Context: A group of Florida high school students plan on losing their virginity. They go to Porky's, a nightclub out in the Everglades, believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. Porky takes their money but humiliates the kids by dumping them in the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, who turns out to be Porky's brother, arrives to drive them away, but not before his minions extort the rest of their money and cause them more embarrassment. After Mickey (who returned to Porky's for revenge) is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually succeeding in sinking his establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase after the group, but they make it across the county line (out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction), where they are met by a group of the local police officers, one of whom is Mickey's older brother Ted, and the high school band. After Ted repeatedly damages Porky's car, he says that all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle will be dropped if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys were too young to be legally allowed in Porky's in the first place, Porky and his brother have no choice but to agree. The film ends with the group getting their revenge and Pee Wee finally losing his virginity. In a subplot, the boys also peep on female students in their locker room shower. After (apparently) several unsuccessful attempts, Tommy, Billy and Pee Wee finally see several girls showering, but Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at a particularly fat girl (who has been blocking his view) to move so he can see. While a few girls run out, most stay, finding the situation funny. To test their attitude, Tommy sticks his tongue out through his peephole, but gets it smeared with soap. Infuriated, he drops his pants and sticks his penis through the opening just before female coach Beulah Balbricker (who has a running feud with Tommy) walks...

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The two questions mentioned are similar, but they are not exactly the same. The first question asks about the differences between C++ and C++11, while the second question asks about the differences between C++11 and Visual C++11. Let's address the differences between the various versions of C++: 1. The Difference between C++ and C++11: C++11 is an updated version of the C++ programming language introduced in 2011. It offers several new features, improvements, and modifications compared to the prior version of C++. Some of the notable changes introduced in C++11 are: A. Language Features:    a. auto keyword: Allows the compiler to deduce the type of a variable, making the code more concise and easier to read.    b. decltype: A feature that deduces the type of an expression.    c. nullptr: A new keyword representing a null pointer constant, making code safer and more expressive.    d. strongly typed enums: Improved enumeration type to provide better type-safety.    e. static_assert: Compile-time assertions to check for programming errors and inconsistencies early.    f. Range-based for loop: A new type of loop, making iterating over containers more convenient and readable.    g. rvalue references and move semantics: Enable more efficient usage of resources, especially when working with temporaries.    h. variadic templates: Allows the creation of templates that take a variable number of arguments, making it easier to write generic code.    i. lambda expressions: Anonymous functions that can be defined within the code, improving flexibility and expressiveness of the language. B. Library Features:    a. Standardized multithreading support: A set of libraries to ensure that C++ code is portable across different platforms and environments.    b. Smart pointers: Added to cope with resource management and memory leaks more effectively, including unique_ptr, shared_ptr, and weak_ptr.    c. Regular expressions: Standard library support for working with regular expressions to parse and manipulate text.    d. new container classes: Forward list, unordered_map, unordered_set, etc., to address various programming use-cases.    e. Tuple: A new library type that allows grouping of heterogeneous elements into a single object.    f. Improved algorithms and random number generation support. 2. The Difference between C++11 and Visual C++11: The phrase \\"Visual C++11\\" could have two different interpretations:    a. Visual C++ version 11: Referring to Microsoft's Visual Studio 2012 IDE, which supports the C++11 standard and offers additional features specific to the Microsoft ecosystem.    b. Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler: A compiler that is part of Visual Studio and supports the C++11 standard. The focus is on the compiler rather than the IDE. The essential difference in the second question is about the features that a specific implementation of the C++11 standard (e.g., the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler) may or may not fully support, as well as additional tooling and library features unique to the Microsoft ecosystem. In conclusion, the first question asks about differences between two language standards (C++ and C++11), while the second question is about the differences between a language standard (C++11) and a specific development tool (Visual C++11) that implements that standard."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The altitudes of the triangle intersect at the orthocenter (H). 2. **Midpoints of the Altitudes:**    The midpoints of the altitudes from vertices (A), (B), and (C) to the opposite sides are given by:    [    M_A = frac{1}{2}left(a + frac{1}{2}left(a + b + c - frac{bc}{a}right)right)    ]    and similarly for (M_B) and (M_C). 3. **Simplify the Midpoints:**    Simplifying the expression for (M_A):    [    M_A = frac{1}{2}left(a + frac{1}{2}(a + b + c - frac{bc}{a})right) = frac{1}{2}left(a + frac{a + b + c - frac{bc}{a}}{2}right) = frac{1}{2}left(frac{2a + a + b + c - frac{bc}{a}}{2}right) = frac{3a + b + c - frac{bc}{a}}{4}    ]    Similarly, we can find (M_B) and (M_C):    [    M_B = frac{3b + a + c - frac{ac}{b}}{4}, quad M_C = frac{3c + a + b - frac{ab}{c}}{4}    ] 4. **Collinearity Condition:**    The midpoints (M_A), (M_B), and (M_C) are collinear if the determinant of the matrix formed by these points is zero:    [    begin{vmatrix}    3a + b + c - frac{bc}{a} & frac{3}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} - frac{a}{bc} & 1     3b + a + c - frac{ac}{b} & frac{3}{b} + frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{c} - frac{b}{ac} & 1     3c + a + b - frac{ab}{c} & frac{3}{c} + frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} - frac{c}{ab} & 1    end{vmatrix} = 0    ] 5. **Simplify the Determinant:**    Simplifying the determinant, we get:    [    begin{vmatrix}    2a - frac{bc}{a} & frac{2}{a} - frac{a}{bc} & 1     2b - frac{ac}{b} & frac{2}{b} - frac{b}{ac} & 1     2c - frac{ab}{c} & frac{2}{c} - frac{c}{ab} & 1    end{vmatrix} = 0    ] 6. **Factor the Determinant:**    It turns out that this determinant factors as:    [    sum_{text{cyc}} left(2a - frac{bc}{a}right)left(frac{2}{b} - frac{b}{ac}right) - left(frac{2}{a} - frac{a}{bc}right)left(2b - frac{ac}{b}right) = -frac{(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)(a + b)(b + c)(c + a)}{a^2 b^2 c^2}    ] 7. **Conclusion:**    The determinant is zero if and only if (0 in {a + b, b + c, c + a}).

The main diagonals of the table are those diagonals that run from the top left corner to the bottom right corner and from the top right corner to the bottom left corner.  1. **Understanding the Problem:**    - We need to fill a 2020 times 2020 table with elements from the set {-1, 0, 1}.    - The sums along the rows, columns, and both main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right, top-right to bottom-left) should all be distinct. 2. **Row and Column Sums Constraints:**    - The maximum sum for any row or column occurs when all entries are 1, and the sum would be 2020.    - The minimum sum for any row or column occurs when all entries are -1, and the sum would be -2020.    - Thus, the sum of any row or column must lie in the range [-2020, 2020]. 3. **Diagonal Sums Constraints:**    - There are 4039 main diagonals in total:      - There are 2019 diagonals from ((0,0)) to ((i,2020-i-1)), for i ranging from 0 to 2019.      - There are 2020 diagonals from ((i,0)) to ((2020-i-1,2020-1)), for i ranging from 0 to 2020-1. 4. **Possible Sums for Rows, Columns, and Diagonals:**    - There are 2020 rows, 2020 columns, and 4039 diagonals. Therefore, there are a total of 2020 + 2020 + 4039 = 8079 sums that need to be distinct.    - Each sum must be within the range [-2020, 2020] which provides 4041 possible distinct values.  5. **Calculation of Possible Distinct Sums:**    - To have all sums be distinct, we need at least 8079 distinct values.    - However, there are only 4041 possible distinct values in the range [-2020, 2020].    - Since 8079 > 4041, it is not possible to assign distinct sums to rows, columns, and diagonals within this range. 6. **Conclusion:**    - Given that 8079 required distinct sums exceed the 4041 possible distinct sums within the range, it is impossible to fill the table such that all row sums, column sums, and main diagonal sums are different.

When k neq 0, we get by using the properties of the sum of roots of a quadratic equation that x_1 + x_2 = frac{6}{k}, and since the average of the roots frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 3, we get frac{6}{k} = 6, hence k = 1.

This implies a specific pattern for the placement of red squares. 1. **Initial Observation**:     - There cannot be two red squares with a common side. Let us prove this by contradiction. Suppose there are two red squares that are adjacent:          [     begin{array}{|c|c|}     hline     textcolor{red}{R} & textcolor{red}{R}      hline     end{array}     ]          - Using this configuration, place this pair within any (2 times 3) or (3 times 2) rectangle. There are no legal places left in that rectangle to accommodate another pair of red squares to make the total exactly two, contradicting the given condition. 2. **Red Square Placement**:     - Consider a red square placed at ((i, j)). The two diagonally adjacent squares must be as follows:          [     begin{array}{|c|c|c|}     hline     * &   & *      hline       & R &       hline     * &   & *      hline     end{array}     ]          - ( * ) denotes squares that cannot be red.

Consider all acute-angled triangles with the given side ( AB ). 2. Let us denote (angle ACB) as the largest angle of the triangle ( triangle ABC ). 3. For ( angle ACB ) to be the largest angle in ( triangle ABC ), this means the side ( AB ) must be the largest side. 4. Thus, by the properties of an acute-angled triangle, both ( angle A ) and ( angle B ) are less than ( 90^circ ). 5. This implies point ( C ) must lie within the region where the angles produced by vertices ( A ) and ( B ) remain acute, excluding the region inside the semicircle with diameter ( AB ). 6.

Let's denote the initial rows as follows in binary form (0 for even, 1 for odd):     [     begin{aligned}     text{Row 1:} & quad 1010      text{Row 2:} & quad 1101      text{Row 3:} & quad 1000      text{Row 4:} & quad 1110      text{Row 5:} & quad 1010      end{aligned}     ] 2. Observe that the pattern begins to repeat from the 5th row onwards, matching the 1st row:     [     begin{aligned}     text{Row 1:} & quad 1010      text{Row 2:} & quad 1101      text{Row 3:} & quad 1000      text{Row 4:} & quad 1110      text{Row 5:} & quad 1010      text{Row 6:} & quad 1101      text{Row 7:} & quad 1000      text{Row 8:} & quad 1110      text{Row 9:} & quad 1010 text{ (and continues repetitively)}     end{aligned}     ] 3. By noticing the repeating pattern, we can deduce that following this repetitive nature, the parity (even or odd state) of numbers will cyclically recur. Therefore, the sequence of values repeats every four rows. 4. Analyze the structure in each row within the period of four rows. Each encoded row of \\"0\\" and \\"1\\" means the presence of even and odd numbers, respectively, in the original rows. 5. Verify the rows for even numbers:     [     begin{aligned}     text{Row 1:} & quad 1010 & (text{2, 4 odd}) & (1, 3 even)     text{Row 2:} & quad 1101 & (text{1, 2, 4 odd}) & (3 even)     text{Row 3:} & quad 1000 & (text{1 odd}) & (2, 3, 4 even)     text{Row 4:} & quad 1110 & (text{1, 2, 3 odd}) & (4 even)     end{aligned}     ] 6. In each row within these periods (starting from the third row and onwards), there are always integers that are even (i.e., '0' in the binary form, meaning even). Conclusion: From the above reasoning, we've shown that from the third row onward, there are always even numbers present.

Using the second point, we can substitute the value of C into the equation for M: M = C - 10 M = 100 - 10 M = 90 Since Mark has 90 cards and Lloyd has the same number of cards as Mark, L = M = 90. Now, they need to collect 80 more cards to have a total of 300 cards.

[ 1,000,000 = 10^6 = (2 cdot 5)^6 = 2^6 cdot 5^6 ] We need to distribute the six 2's and six 5's among three integers (a), (b), and (c) such that (a cdot b cdot c = 1,000,000). 1. **Distributing the 2's:**    We need to distribute 6 factors of 2 among (a), (b), and (c). This is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:    [ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 6 ]    where (x_1), (x_2), and (x_3) represent the number of 2's in (a), (b), and (c) respectively. The number of solutions is given by the stars and bars theorem:    [ binom{6+3-1}{3-1} = binom{8}{2} = 28 ] 2. **Distributing the 5's:**    Similarly, we need to distribute 6 factors of 5 among (a), (b), and (c).

The number of solutions is:    [ binom{8}{2} = 28 ] 3. **Combining the distributions:**    The total number of ways to distribute both the 2's and the 5's is:    [ 28 times 28 = 784 ] 4. **Accounting for overcounting:**    Since the order of (a), (b), and (c) does not matter, we need to account for overcounting. We need to consider the cases where some of the numbers are equal:    - **All three numbers are equal:** There is only one way to have (a = b = c). This occurs when:      [ a = b = c = sqrt[3]{1,000,000} = 100 ]    - **Two numbers are equal:** We need to count the number of ways to distribute the factors such that two numbers are equal and the third is different. This can be done by choosing two of the three numbers to be equal and distributing the factors among them. There are:      [ binom{3}{2} = 3 ]      ways to choose which two numbers are equal. For each choice, we need to distribute the factors such that:      [ x_1 + x_2 = 6 quad text{and} quad y_1 + y_2 = 6 ]      The number of ways to do this is:      [ binom{7}{1} times binom{7}{1} = 7 times 7 = 49 ]      Therefore, the total number of ways for two numbers to be equal is:      [ 3 times 49 = 147 ] 5. **Subtracting the overcounted cases:**    The total number of ways without considering the order is:    [ 784 - 147 - 1 = 636 ] 6. **Dividing by the number of permutations:**    Since we have overcounted by considering all permutations, we need to divide by the number of permutations of three distinct numbers, which is (3!):    [ frac{636}{6} = 106 ] Therefore, the number of ways to express (1,000,000) as a product of exactly three integers greater than 1 is: [ boxed{106} ]"},{"instruction":"Prove that for that for every positive integer   n , the smallest integer that is greater than   (sqrt {3} plus{} 1)^{2n}  is divisible by   2^{n plus{} 1} .","output":"To prove that for every positive integer ( n ), the smallest integer that is greater than ( (sqrt{3} + 1)^{2n} ) is divisible by ( 2^{n+1} ), we will use the properties of the sequences involving roots and their conjugates. 1.

Base case: (a_1 = 4) and (a_2 = 14), both are divisible by (2). 10. Inductive step: Assume (a_k) and (a_{k+1}) are divisible by (2). Then:     [     a_{k+2} = 4a_{k+1} - a_k     ]     Since (4a_{k+1}) is divisible by (8) and (a_k) is divisible by (2), (a_{k+2}) is divisible by (2). 11.

Without loss of generality, assume ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) are red neighbors. Then ( S_i ) and ( S_{i+1} ) are red neighbors if ( i ) is odd and blue neighbors if ( i ) is even.

Let (O) be the center of the circular cross-section of the cylinder, (E_1) be the point where the cylinder touches the line (e), and (E_2) be the point where the rod (AB) touches the cylinder.

The relationship between BD, TD, and SD is given by the formula: BD = TD + (TD^2 / SD) Given that BD = Rs. 288 and SD = Rs. 1440, we can plug these values into the formula to find TD: 288 = TD + (TD^2 / 1440) To solve for TD, we can rearrange the equation: TD^2 + 1440 * TD - 1440 * 288 = 0 Now, we can solve this quadratic equation for TD. Let's first calculate the constant term: 1440 * 288 = 414720 So the equation becomes: TD^2 + 1440 * TD - 414720 = 0 This is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = 1440, and c = -414720.

Since 6^1 = 6, we can see that: 6^(1 - 2) = 6^(-1) = 1/6 But we need the result to be 3, and since 6^1 = 6, we can deduce that: 6^(exponent - 2) = 6/2 = 3 Therefore, the exponent must be such that: 6^(exponent - 2) = 6^1 So, exponent - 2 = 1 Finally, solving for the exponent: exponent = 1 + 2 exponent = 3 The exponent is boxed{3} ."},{"instruction":"what rate percent on simple interest will rs . 750 amount to rs . 975 in 5 years ?","output":"To calculate the rate of interest, we can use the formula for simple interest: Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) × Rate (R) × Time (T) / 100 We are given: Principal (P) = Rs. 750 Amount (A) = Rs. 975 Time (T) = 5 years The amount (A) is the sum of the principal (P) and the simple interest (SI), so we can write: A = P + SI We can rearrange the formula for SI to solve for the rate (R): SI = A - P R = (SI × 100) / (P × T) First, let's calculate the simple interest (SI): SI = A - P SI = 975 - 750 SI = Rs. 225 Now, we can calculate the rate (R): R = (SI × 100) / (P × T) R = (225 × 100) / (750 × 5) R = 22500 / 3750 R = 6 Therefore, the rate of interest is boxed{6%}  per annum."},{"instruction":"A sports equipment store sold ping pong rackets for a total of 686.

For safety and traffic flow, a distance of 20 m is maintained between two adjacent cars when 0 < x leq 12, and a distance of left(frac {1}{6}x^{2}+ frac {1}{3}xright) m is maintained when 12 < x leq 25. Let y (s) be the time taken from the moment the first car's front enters the tunnel to the moment the last car's rear leaves the tunnel. (1) Express y as a function of x. (2) Find the minimum value of the time y for the team to pass through the tunnel, and the speed of the team when this minimum is achieved.","output":"(1) According to the problem, for 0 < x leq 12, the distance between adjacent cars is 20 m. For 12 < x leq 25, the distance between adjacent cars is left(frac {1}{6}x^{2}+ frac {1}{3}xright) m. Therefore, when 0 < x leq 12, the total distance that the team takes to pass through the tunnel includes the length of the tunnel, the length of all cars, and the distance maintained between adjacent cars: y = frac {2725 + 5 times 31 + 20 times (31 - 1)}{x} = frac {3480}{x}. When 12 < x leq 25, the total distance taken by the team is the sum of the length of the tunnel, the length of all cars, and the safety distance between each pair of cars, given by the formula above: y = frac {2725 + 5 times 31 + left(frac {1}{6}x^{2} + frac {1}{3}xright) times (31 - 1)}{x} = 5x + frac {2880}{x} + 10. Thus, the function y(x) can be represented as: y(x) = begin{cases} frac {3480}{x}, & 0 < x leq 12  5x + frac {2880}{x} + 10, & 12 < x leq 25 end{cases}. (2) For 0 < x leq 12, the expression for y is frac {3480}{x}. At x = 12 m/s: y_{min} = frac {3480}{12} = 290, s. For 12 < x leq 25, the expression for y is 5x + frac {2880}{x} + 10. By using the AM-GM inequality a + b geq 2sqrt{ab}, where a and b are positive, we get: y geq 2sqrt{5x cdot frac {2880}{x}} + 10 = 2sqrt{14400} + 10 = 250, s. Equality holds when 5x = frac {2880}{x}, which gives x = 24 m/s. Hence, at the speed x = 24 m/s: y_{min} = 250, s. Since 290 > 250, the absolute minimum time is achieved at x = 24 m/s, and we have: boxed{y_{min} = 250, s.} Therefore, the minimum time y for the team to pass through the tunnel is 250 seconds, and the speed of the team at this minimum time is 24 m/s: boxed{text{The team's speed is 24 m/s.}}"},{"instruction":"f left(x+yright)^{3}xyleft(x+yright)=left(x+yright)cdot A, then A is ( ) A: x^{2}+y^{2} B: x^{2}xy+y^{2} C: x^{2}3xy+y^{2} D: x^{2}+xy+y^{2}","output":"To find the expression for A in the equation left(x+yright)^{3}-xyleft(x+yright)=left(x+yright)cdot A, we start by expanding and simplifying the left-hand side of the equation: begin{align*} left(x+yright)^{3}-xyleft(x+yright) &= left(x+yright)left[left(x+yright)^{2}-xyright]  &= left(x+yright)left[x^{2}+2xy+y^{2}-xyright]  &= left(x+yright)left[x^{2}+xy+y^{2}right]. end{align*} Given that left(x+yright)^{3}-xyleft(x+yright)=left(x+yright)cdot A, by comparing the two expressions, we can deduce that: begin{align*} A &= x^{2}+xy+y^{2}. end{align*} Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{text{D}}."},{"instruction":"A man whose bowling average is 12.4 takes 7 wickets for 26 runs and thereby decreases his average by 0.4.

The midpoint D of side BC has coordinates obtained by taking the average of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of B and C respectively. So the coordinates of D are D left(frac{10+2}{2}, frac{4+(-4)}{2}right) = D(6, 0). The slope m of line AD can be calculated using the coordinates of points A and D: m = frac{8-0}{7-6} = 8. Therefore, the equation of the median from B to side AC, which is the same as line AD, passes through point D(6, 0) and has a slope of 8. The equation in point-slope form is y - 0 = 8(x - 6). Simplifying this, we get the standard form as: 8x - y - 48 = 0. Thus, the equation of the median on BC is boxed{8x - y - 48 = 0}. (2) To find the equation of the line containing the altitude from B to side AC, we first determine the slope of line BC. Using the coordinates of B and C, the slope k of BC is calculated as k = frac{4 - (-4)}{10 - 2} = 1. Since the altitude from B to AC is perpendicular to BC, its slope will be the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC. Thus, the slope of the altitude is -1. The equation of the altitude line passes through point B(7, 8) and has a slope of -1. The equation in point-slope form is y - 8 = -1(x - 7). Simplifying this equation, we get the standard form: x + y - 15 = 0. Therefore, the equation of the altitude from B to AC is boxed{x + y - 15 = 0}."},{"instruction":"the circle odot O, select n points A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{n} on its circumference (where n is an integer and n geq 3).

For each prime ( p ), if ( p_1 = pk + r ) with ( 0 < r < p ), and ( d = pa + b ) with ( 0 < b < p ), the set ( S = {d, 2d, ldots, pd} ) forms a complete residue system modulo ( p ).

The key to solving this problem is to determine the range of angles based on the fact that the triangle is an acute triangle, the internal angle sum theorem, and the relationship B=2A. **Solution** Step 1: According to the sine theorem, we have dfrac{AC}{sin B}= dfrac{BC}{sin A}. Since B=2A, simplifying gives dfrac{AC}{2sin Acos A}= dfrac{1}{sin A}, which means dfrac{AC}{cos A}=2. Step 2: Since ∆ABC is an acute triangle and C is an acute angle, we have A+B > dfrac{π}{2}. Given B=2A, we get A+2A > dfrac{π}{2} and 2A=B < dfrac{π}{2}, thus solving for A gives  dfrac{π}{6} < A < dfrac{π}{4}. Therefore,  sqrt{2} < 2cos A < sqrt{3}.

Therefore, angle ABO = angle ACO = 90^circ. 2. **Recognize the Cyclic Quadrilateral**:      Since angle ABO and angle ACO are both right angles, the sum of angle ABO and angle ACO is 180^circ.

Therefore, we can write the integral as a sum of integrals over these intervals:    [    int_{1}^{x} [u]([u]+1)f(u) , du = sum_{k=1}^{[x]-1} int_{k}^{k+1} k(k+1)f(u) , du + int_{[x]}^{x} [u]([u]+1)f(u) , du.    ]    Note that for ( u in [k, k+1) ), ([u] = k), and for ( u in [[x], x] ), ([u] = [x]). 2. **Simplify the integrals:**    [    int_{1}^{x} [u]([u]+1)f(u) , du = sum_{k=1}^{[x]-1} k(k+1) int_{k}^{k+1} f(u) , du + [x]([x]+1) int_{[x]}^{x} f(u) , du.    ] 3. **Compare with the right-hand side:**    The right-hand side is given by:    [    2sum_{i=1}^{[x]} i int_{i}^{x} f(u) , du.    ]    We can split this sum into two parts:    [    2sum_{i=1}^{[x]} i int_{i}^{x} f(u) , du = 2sum_{i=1}^{[x]-1} i int_{i}^{x} f(u) , du + 2[x] int_{[x]}^{x} f(u) , du.    ] 4. **Simplify the sums:**    For ( i leq [x]-1 ), the integral (int_{i}^{x} f(u) , du) can be split as:    [    int_{i}^{x} f(u) , du = int_{i}^{i+1} f(u) , du + int_{i+1}^{x} f(u) , du.    ]    Therefore,    [    2sum_{i=1}^{[x]-1} i int_{i}^{x} f(u) , du = 2sum_{i=1}^{[x]-1} i left( int_{i}^{i+1} f(u) , du + int_{i+1}^{x} f(u) , du right).    ]    Notice that the term (int_{i+1}^{x} f(u) , du) will be included in the next sum, leading to a telescoping series. Thus, we can simplify:    [    2sum_{i=1}^{[x]-1} i int_{i}^{x} f(u) , du = 2sum_{i=1}^{[x]-1} i int_{i}^{i+1} f(u) , du + 2sum_{i=1}^{[x]-1} i int_{i+1}^{x} f(u) , du.    ]    The first sum simplifies to:    [    2sum_{i=1}^{[x]-1} i int_{i}^{i+1} f(u) , du = sum_{i=1}^{[x]-1} 2i int_{i}^{i+1} f(u) , du.    ]    The second sum is a telescoping series and simplifies to:    [    2sum_{i=1}^{[x]-1} i int_{i+1}^{x} f(u) , du = 2sum_{i=2}^{[x]} (i-1) int_{i}^{x} f(u) , du.    ]    Combining these, we get:    [    2sum_{i=1}^{[x]-1} i int_{i}^{x} f(u) , du = sum_{i=1}^{[x]-1} 2i int_{i}^{i+1} f(u) , du + sum_{i=2}^{[x]} 2(i-1) int_{i}^{x} f(u) , du.    ]    Adding the last term:    [    2[x] int_{[x]}^{x} f(u) , du.    ] 5. **Combine and compare:**    Combining all terms, we get:    [    2sum_{i=1}^{[x]} i int_{i}^{x} f(u) , du = sum_{i=1}^{[x]-1} 2i int_{i}^{i+1} f(u) , du + sum_{i=2}^{[x]} 2(i-1) int_{i}^{x} f(u) , du + 2[x] int_{[x]}^{x} f(u) , du.    ]    This matches the left-hand side:    [    int_{1}^{x} [u]([u]+1)f(u) , du = sum_{k=1}^{[x]-1} k(k+1) int_{k}^{k+1} f(u) , du + [x]([x]+1) int_{[x]}^{x} f(u) , du.    ]    Therefore, we have shown that:    [    int_{1}^{x} [u]([u]+1)f(u) , du = 2sum_{i=1}^{[x]} i int_{i}^{x} f(u) , du.    ] (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Among the following propositions, the correct ones are (　　)   (1) A polyhedron that has two parallel faces, with all other faces being parallelograms, is a prism.

The similarity of triangles ABC and Q L P is given by the fact that both triangles share right angles and the angles subtended by the identical arc of the circumcircle passing through B. The angle at A in ABC matches the angle at P in QPL, hence the triangles’ similarity by AA (Angle-Angle) criterion. 5.
