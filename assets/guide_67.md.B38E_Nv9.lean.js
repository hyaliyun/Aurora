Expect viburnum snowball bushes to blossom in May. Heavy pruning should only be done at this time since you can easily destroy next year’s flowers by removing old wood. Deadheading, or cutting off the flowers, won’t harm viburnum. However, doing it isn’t necessary and prevents the plant from growing berries. The oldest branches are the thickest, woodiest ones. They may produce side shoots or have flaky bark that make them easier to recognize. Using a clean, sharp pair of shears, cut as close to the soil as you can to completely remove the shoots.  At most, remove no more than ⅓ of the shoots. Usually, this means removing 1 to 3 shoots at a time. Leave behind the thinner, fresher shoots coming up from the plant’s base. These will rejuvenate your viburnum. Although the snowball flowers bloom on old wood in viburnum plants, the oldest shoots produce weak flowers and are safe to remove. Viburnum often grows well when it is left alone, so you may not need to do routine trimming. If your bush gets too large or begins extending out of its spot in your yard, use clippers to reduce its size. Cut the branches as needed.  Remember to only perform hard trimming in spring, after the bloom, to avoid damaging the bush’s buds the next year. You can trim the branches this way to maintain the snowball bush’s rounded shape or sculpt it into a hedge. Viburnum snowball bushes grow relatively quickly, so they can become too tall or crowded. If your bush needs serious work, use shears to trim the shoots and branches back. You can also cut out the larger, older shoots to thin the plant.  The best time to do this is around May, after the flowers bloom, although it can be done anytime as needed. After trimming back the plant, you may want to wait and watch it grow back. Then you can see where you need to thin out the branches. By maintaining the bush regularly, you likely won’t need to do this. Examine your snowball bush throughout the year to look for broken or rotting branches. With a sharp pair of shears, cut out the damaged parts. If possible, cut above the nodes, which are where new leaves and branches grow off of the old branches. This routine trimming should be done year-round to keep your snowball bush healthy and thriving. Summary:","output":"So kiddo, a viburnum snowball bush is a really cool type of plant that blooms beautiful flowers in May. Just imagine a snowball fight in the summertime! Now, these plants are very particular about when and how you cut them. Just like how you wouldn't want to cut your hair too short, we don't want to cut too much off of these plants either. We only prune, or cut, a lot off the bush after the flowers bloom in the springtime, and we should only cut about a third of the old, thick branches that come from the bottom of the plant. They're like the grandpas of the plant - old but very important.  Now, except for spring, most of the time the plant likes being left alone, just like you when you're playing with your toys, right? But sometimes they grow too big and we need to trim them a little bit, kind of like how your hair needs a trim when it grows too long. And kiddo, it's very important to look out for any branches that look sick or broken, and they need to be cut off so the whole plant can stay healthy. It's like when you get a boo-boo and we clean it up to keep you healthy! So, all in all, taking care of a viburnum snowball bush is a bit of work, but seeing its beautiful snowball-like flowers makes it all worth it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Take note of heavy eye contact. See how close they get to you. Look at their hand gestures. Pay attention to awkward behavior. See if they mirror your behavior.","output":"Title: Interpreting Nonverbal Communication: Spot the Signs to Unravel the Message Introduction In the realm of human communication, words are just a part of the story. Nonverbal cues, including eye contact, body language, and facial expressions, often reveal more about a person's thoughts and feelings than their spoken words. Recognizing and accurately interpreting these subtle signs can help you understand someone's intentions, build rapport, and even avoid misunderstandings in various settings. In this article, we'll delve into five important nonverbal cues that you should be aware of in order to enhance your communication skills. 1. Heavy Eye Contact One of the most important aspects of nonverbal communication is eye contact, as it can reveal sincerity, confidence, or an attempt to establish connection. If someone maintains heavy eye contact with you, it can imply that they are genuinely interested in what you are saying or trying to assert dominance and establish a position of power. Alternatively, averted or minimal eye contact might suggest discomfort, dishonesty, or disinterest.  2. Physical Distance Pay attention to how close someone gets to you as an indication of their comfort level and emotional state. People who feel at ease and connected with you are more likely to position themselves closer to you, whereas those who feel discomfort or disinterest may keep their distance. It's essential to respect cultural differences and personal boundaries while evaluating the proximity factor in nonverbal communication. 3. Hand Gestures Hand gestures can add nuance and depth to a spoken message or even convey entire ideas without the use of words. For instance, open gestures usually signal a friendly and approachable attitude, while closed gestures, such as crossing arms, might signify defensiveness or resistance. Similarly, pointing fingers or aggressive hand movements can indicate an assertive or dominating disposition. Observing an individual's hand gestures can provide valuable insights into their emotional state and thought process. 4. Awkward Behavior Nervousness, doubt, or anxiety can manifest in a range of awkward behaviors such as fidgeting, shifting postures, touching the face, or rapid blinking. If someone exhibits these or similar actions, they might be struggling with their emotions or trying to conceal their true thoughts. Offering a reassuring and empathetic response can alleviate tension and create a more comfortable environment for genuine communication. 5. Mirroring The subtle act of mirroring is when one person unconsciously mimics the behavior, expressions, or posture of another. In psychological terms, this phenomenon can indicate rapport, trust, and likability between the individuals involved. Noticing when someone mirrors your actions can help you assess the strength of your connection and adjust your communication style accordingly. Conclusion Being attentive to nonverbal cues is crucial in fostering effective communication. By identifying and understanding these subtle signs, you can gain a deeper comprehension of others' thoughts, feelings, and intentions. In turn, developing this skill will enhance your ability to navigate social situations, build stronger relationships, and communicate more effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Before the opening of the Cape Cod Canal in 1914,the only way ships could leave Boston was on a route around Race Point--the northern tip of Cape Cod.However,navigation during the 18th century was a nightmare,because the floating cross current  around Race Point caused countless accidents.So building a lighthouse to lighten the place was very necessary. As early as 1808,the people of Provincetown requested a lighthouse on Race Point,but it took Congress eight years to react when they finally paid  8,000 on April 27,1816 to build a lighthouse --Race Point Light,which was located in the town of Provincetown,Massachusetts.It was first built of stone 25 feet high with no foundation and its light was 30 feet above the sea.It was equipped with one of the nation's earliest revolving lights. Actually,there were two other lighthouses on Cape Cod,but they were hit by a storm in October 1841.In the following year,Race Point Light was examined by I.W.P.Lewis,who realized the light's importance.He said,\\"The light should be useful to all ships leaving Boston.However,its _ power is so weak that people would hardly be able to differentiate it from the lights set on the ships which stay in the bay,or close by.It hasn't played its role as a lighthouse well.\\" The result was that old lighthouse was destroyed and a new iron lighthouse with a proper foundation was put up to take its place.The new lighthouse was 45 feet high.Although the original keeper's house was in good repair,it was destroyed too and a new one was built.Today the lighthouse has been automated and Race Point Light is still an active aid to navigation. You can park at Race Point Beach and walk about 45 minutes to the lighthouse.Sunset at Race Point Light is one of the Cape Cod's most popular scenes.And at times whales can be seen in the lighthouse.For reservations to stay one night in the keeper's house at Race Point call(508)487-9930.

Step 2: Use provided context 18th street's station is provided as an example in the context, along with details about the lines and crossings. From the context, we can gather that this station is likely situated within a city rather than between states. Step 3: Analyze the purpose of the subway system Subway systems are typically designed to provide transportation within a city or metropolitan area. They handle high volumes of commuter traffic within a relatively compact geographical area. Inter-state travel, on the other hand, typically covers larger distances and might require different modes of transportation, like rail, buses, or air. Step 4: Identify the reason for the limitation Subway systems are not built to span the vast distances between states in order to keep construction and maintenance costs reasonable. Additionally, given the high costs and infrastructure complexities, there's simply no practical need for subways to stretch to other states when other transportation modes are more efficient. Step 5: Formulate a coherent answer Subway systems, such as the one in the context with the 18th Street station, are not designed to take you to another state primarily because they serve to transport people within a city or metropolitan area. The infrastructure and construction costs of creating a subway system that spans across states would be significant and impractical compared to the more efficient modes of transportation already in place for such distances, like rail, buses, or air travel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Why is Ben Jealous stepping down from the NAACP?","output":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They are instead related to two different aspects of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The first question, \\"What are some activities of the NAACP?\\", is seeking information about the types of activities and actions that the NAACP takes or organizes. The NAACP is a civil rights organization that was established to fight for the rights of African Americans and people of color in the United States. These activities could pertain to a range of areas including legal, social, educational, economic or political. The NAACP undertakes various activities such as public demonstrations, advocacy work, educational programs, and legal aid services, among others. Their initiatives could also include lobbying for policies or laws that protect the rights and promote the welfare of people of color. This question is therefore asking for a description or examples of these sorts of activities. On the other hand, the second question, \\"Why is Ben Jealous stepping down from the NAACP?\\", is a very specific query about a particular individual related to the NAACP. Ben Jealous is a former president and chief executive of the NAACP who served from 2008 to 2013. This question is asking about the reasons that led to his departure from the organization. It requests information that pertains directly to Jealous’s decisions, motivations, or circumstances that led to his stepping down, and may thus require knowledge or research into events, statements or sources from that particular time period. Jealous announced his plans to step down in 2013, citing personal reasons related to spending more time with his young family. However, his departure could also be contextualized within his career trajectory, his accomplishments during his tenure, or developments within the NAACP or wider civil rights movement at that time. So, while both questions are related to the NAACP, they ask for different kinds of information - one a general overview of the association's undertakings, and the other a precise inquiry about an event involving a notable figure within the NAACP. It implies that the person asking the questions has the knowledge of Ben Jealous's affiliation with the NAACP, while the first question can be asked by someone with basic or no knowledge of the NAACP's operation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: My daughter was away at college preparing for her final exams and nursing boards. I knew that my daughter’s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred. I thanked her for the 14 years she had been one of my daughter’s closest companions and I held her as she took her last breath. I was afraid my daughter was going to be angry with me when I told her that i made the decision with out giving her time to say goodbye.

(CNN) -- After six and a half days of deliberation, an Australian jury convicted a surgeon dubbed \\"Doctor Death\\" in the deaths of three of his patients, Australia's national news agency said. Indian-born Dr. Jayant Patel, 60, was found guilty of three counts of manslaughter and one count of grievous bodily harm in a Queensland Supreme Court, the Australian Associated Press said. He had pleaded not guilty in the deaths of Mervyn Morris, Gerardus Kemps and James Phillips and in the bodily harm of Ian Vowles. He entered the courtroom with his wife, Kishoree Patel, also a doctor. He stood with his head cast low and appeared calm as the verdicts were read out, AAP said. The controversy over Patel in Australia mounted when concerns about his competency were voiced in OPTIONS: - AAP's state legislature. - Australia's state legislature. - Australian's state legislature. - Australian Associated Press's state legislature. - CNN's state legislature. - Doctor Death's state legislature. - Gerardus Kemps's state legislature. - Ian Vowles's state legislature. - Indian's state legislature. - James Phillips's state legislature. - Jayant Patel's state legislature. - Kishoree Patel's state legislature. - Mervyn Morris's state legislature. - Oregon's state legislature. - Patel's state legislature. - Portland's state legislature. - Queensland's state legislature. - Supreme Court's state legislature.","output":"Queensland's state legislature.

The Oklahoma House of Representatives and Oklahoma Senate are the two houses that make up the bicameral state legislature. There are 101 state representatives, each serving a two-year term, and 48 state senators, who serve four-year terms that are staggered so only half of the Oklahoma Senate districts are eligible in each election year. Legislators are elected directly by the people from single member districts of equal population.

Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words \\"okla\\" and \\"humma\\", meaning \\"red people\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, \\"The Sooner State\\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as \\"Oklahomans\\", or informally \\"Okies\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.  - As general terms, Indian Territory, the Indian Territories, or Indian country describe an evolving land area set aside by the United States Government for the relocation of Native Americans who held aboriginal title to their land. In general, the tribes ceded land they occupied in exchange for land grants in an area purchased by the United States federal government from Napoleonic France, the Louisiana Purchase. The concept of an Indian Territory was an outcome of the 18th- and 19th-century policy of Indian removal. After the Civil War, the policy of the government was one of assimilation.  - The House of Lords of the United Kingdom, referred to ceremonially as the House of Peers, is the upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

The Choctaw language belongs to the Muskogean language family group. The Choctaw are descendants of the peoples of the Hopewell and Mississippian cultures, who lived throughout the east of the Mississippi River valley and its tributaries. About 1,700 years ago, the Hopewell people built Nanih Waiya, a great earthwork mound, which is still considered sacred by the Choctaw. The early Spanish explorers of the mid-16th century encountered Mississippian-culture villages and chiefs. The anthropologist John Swanton suggested that the Choctaw derived their name from an early leader. Henry Halbert, a historian, suggests that their name is derived from the Choctaw phrase \\"Hacha hatak\\" (river people).  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress which, along with the House of Representatives, the lower chamber, composes the legislature of the United States.  - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house.

The name comes from the ancient Roman Senate (Latin: \\"Senatus\\"), so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: \\"senex\\" meaning \\"the elder\\" or \\"the old one\\") and therefore allegedly wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class.  - A lower house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature, the other chamber being the upper house.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia.

I've been keeping count of how often people sing around the house these days. The fact is, they don't. My earliest memories are of my mother crooning lullabies  in a gentle low voice as she rocked each infant in turn. She said she \\"didn't have a singing voice,\\" but her low, wavering alto will always mean comfort to me. Every time I have sat through the night with a feverish body or held a pre - schooler through a nightmare, the melodies returned, words appearing and disappearing like fragments of a dream but held together by the hum  of love.

If I had my way, new parents would learn the songs themselves, throw out their stereos, and give their child the gift of their own sleepy voices through the midnight hours. These days, when we go on a trip, my daughters take along tiny personal stereos and headphones. They are lost in their private worlds, and I can't help wishing that at least here, in the car my girls would be forced to listen to their mother's voice again, sure I'm out-of-tune songs that they might then pass down to another generation. Those sophisticated earphones have robbed them of something I think every kid should carry from childhood car trips into adulthood. I drove away from that party humming, and all the way home the good old songs kept tumbling out. Damm it  , I thought, why did I ever stop singing in the car and start turning on the radio ? Why don't I sing anymore while I'm doing the dishes? I'm going to pull those stereo wires right out of the wall when I get home. We're going to sing grace before meals, sing carols around the piano, sing in the shower instead of switching on that waterproof radio that stole away our voices and our souls.

Mary's mother, who is blind, enters the room and Bigger panics at the thought of being caught with a white woman. He accidentally kills Mary by placing a pillow over her head to keep her quiet. Still frightened, Bigger disposes of the body in the furnace, possibly because he feels he would not get a fair trial for the accidental death of a white woman.

According to reports, a PE teacher stands accused of taking advantage of a drunken woman and raping her, as stated by the prosecution at the trial. The case has drawn significant public attention, and the stakes are high for both the accused and the victim. This article will delve into the details of this incident to examine the broader implications of sexual assault among educators and the measures that need to be taken to protect vulnerable individuals. The Case Unfolds In the United Kingdom, a jury heard the case of a male physical education (PE) teacher who was accused of raping a woman under the influence of alcohol. The prosecution claims that the defendant took advantage of the woman's inebriated state during their encounter and proceeded to sexually assault her. The accused has denied the allegations, suggesting he had consensual sex with the woman. The incident raises questions about the responsibilities and conduct of educators – especially those who serve as role models for young people. While the case is still ongoing, the public debate around it highlights the importance of developing a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to such incidents. Sexual Assault in Educational Settings: A Larger Issue Unfortunately, sexual assault within educational settings is more common than we would like to admit. Teachers, who often spend more time with students than their own families, are generally expected to uphold a high standard of ethical and professional conduct. However, there are known cases of teachers abusing their positions of authority to engage in inappropriate relationships or, as in this case, act on sinister intentions towards vulnerable individuals. In a society where trust and safety are paramount, such incidents involving educators can engender fear and anxiety amongst the general public. These emotions, in turn, can have serious consequences for schools, parents, and most importantly, the young people who look up to these authority figures. Preventive Measures in Schools and Communities The current case involving the PE teacher demonstrates the need for schools and communities to adopt more stringent measures when it comes to hiring and monitoring the conduct of their educators. Thorough background checks and continuous monitoring of teachers' behavior can help identify potential signs of misconduct or abuse. Similarly, schools should regularly educate students on the importance of consent and promote an atmosphere where victims feel comfortable speaking out and seeking help if they believe they have been victimized. Open communication channels allow for prompt reporting of any concerns or incidents while maintaining the privacy and safety of all parties involved. Beyond Institutional Responsibilities While schools bear a significant responsibility in ensuring the safety and welfare of their students, the issue of sexual assault extends beyond the confines of educational institutions. Communities, families, and individuals must be vigilant about recognizing warning signs and providing support for those who have experienced sexual assault. On a broader level, society needs to engage in candid conversations about consent, boundaries, and the many forms that abuse can take. Promoting awareness, education, and open dialogue can help break down the stigma attached to discussing these sensitive topics and foster an environment where everyone feels empowered to step forward and seek help. Conclusion The ongoing case involving the PE teacher accused of rape serves as a stark reminder of the importance of discussing sexual assault within the context of educational settings. As the trial unfolds, it is crucial for society to use these types of cases as learning opportunities, emphasizing the need for schools, communities, and individuals to work together to create a safer and more inclusive environment. Taking necessary steps to prevent and address sexual assault is not just a moral imperative, but also a vital component in ensuring the well-being of our communities and future generations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The race in the AFC West continued to heat up in December, especially when the Chiefs took on the San Diego Chargers on prime-time national television.  The Chiefs entered the game fighting to keep their playoff dreams alive while the San Diego Chargers looked to secure the home field advantage in the playoffs. The game was scheduled to be broadcast on CBS at 1pm San Diego time, but on December 4, the game was officially chosen to be aired on NBC Sunday Night Football at 8:15 ET (6:15 San Diego time) as part of the league's new \\"flex scheduling\\" policy.  The game marked the first time the Chiefs appeared on NBC Sunday Night Football, their first prime-time game in San Diego, and their first game to be aired on NBC since facing Denver in the AFC Divisional Playoff Game at Arrowhead on January 4, 1998. Publicity fueled the Sunday night match when Chiefs defensive end Tamba Hali claimed the Chargers were a \\"finesse team\\" eight weeks ago after Kansas City beat San Diego 30-27 at Arrowhead Stadium in week 5.  The game was the last time the Chargers lost before their seven-game winning streak leading into week 14. Prior to kickoff, there was a video tribute and moment of silence for Hunt, who died Wednesday night of complications from prostate cancer. He was 74. The Chiefs had \\"LH\\" decals on the backs of their helmets.  The Chiefs opted for white pants in honor of Lamar Hunt. The Chiefs got their start in Kansas City wearing white on white when playing on the road and some players appealed to coach Herm Edwards to go to the traditional look Sunday night. After getting one sack in the previous two games and none in last week's loss to Baltimore, the Chiefs were able to put some pressure on Philip Rivers in the first half. James Reed and Tamba Hali each had a sack, and the Chiefs would have had a third, but Rivers was penalized for intentional grounding when he unloaded the ball.  The Chiefs did not allow Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers to complete a pass until early in the second quarter when he threw for 18&#160;yards to Vincent Jackson.  The Chargers still led 7-3 at the time. Tomlinson broke three NFL records: single-season scoring (186 points), single-season rushing touchdowns (28) and consecutive multitouchdown games (eight).  Tomlinson's 85-yard touchdown run in the second quarter was the game's deciding play. It gave the Chargers a 14-3 lead with less than 3&#160;minutes until halftime.  The Chiefs never recovered from the botched blocked punt and let the Chargers run away with their eleventh win of the season and homefield advantage in the playoffs. Trent Green finished the game 23 of 41 with 185&#160;yards passing, no touchdowns and one interception.  It was Green's fourth loss in six games after returning from his injury in week one.  Lawrence Tynes was the only scorer for the Chiefs, kicking three field goals from 45, 52 and 24&#160;yards out. The game was the Chiefs' third straight loss as they fell to 7-7 and the Chargers' eighth straight win as they improved to 12-2. Answer this question based on the article: How many of Green's passes were incomplete?","output":"Based on the article, Trent Green completed 23 of his 41 passes. So, the number of his incomplete passes would be 41 - 23 = 18 incomplete passes."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

A month later and they charged me (surprise, surprise) but I figured they'd try this so I called the magazine subscription and find it's not them who charged me but the actual store. This means, the cashier signed me up for a loyalty program for their store (which is what I got charged for) and a magazine subscription which would charge me in another month. I cancelled the magazine subscription easily but the store loyalty program person wasn't giving in without a fight. I let her go on for 5 minutes about how much money I'd save by continuing my membership because I get that it's her job so I let her do it. However, after I said no I'd rather cancel she kept talking over me. I tried a few times to ask about cancelling and getting a refund and she continued to talk over me. I finally raised my voice and said, \\"hey, you need to stop. I can't get a word in because you keep talking over me.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - \\"Plug Tunin'\\" is the debut single by the influential hip hop trio De La Soul. A remixed version appeared on their album \\"3 Feet High and Rising\\".  - De La Soul is an American hip hop trio formed in 1987 on Long Island, New York. The group is best known for their eclectic sampling, quirky lyrics, and their contributions to the evolution of the jazz rap and alternative hip hop subgenres. The members are Posdnuos, Dave and Maseo. The three formed the group in high school and caught the attention of producer Prince Paul with a demo tape of the song \\"Plug Tunin'\\". With its playful wordplay, innovative sampling, and witty skits, the band's debut album, \\"3 Feet High and Rising\\", has been called \\"a hip hop masterpiece.\\"  - \`\` Stakes Is High '' is a single by De La Soul released in 1996 from their album Stakes Is High .  - Stakes Is High is De La Soul's fourth full-length album, released on July 2, 1996. The album marked a change in the group's sound and direction as it was their first release not to be produced in collaboration with Prince Paul. \\"Stakes Is High\\" was mainly produced by the group themselves with additional tracks provided by Jay Dee, DJ Ogee, Spearhead X and Skeff Anslem. It received mostly strong reviews but little commercial success.  - 3 Feet High and Rising is the debut studio album by American hip hop trio De La Soul. It was released on March 14, 1989, by Tommy Boy Records and Warner Bros. Records. It marked the first of three full-length collaborations with producer Prince Paul, which would become the critical and commercial peak of both parties. It is consistently placed on 'greatest albums' lists by noted music critics and publications. Robert Christgau called the record \\"unlike any rap album you or anybody else has ever heard.\\" In 1998, the album was selected as one of \\"The Source Magazine's 100 Best Rap Albums.\\"  - Long Island is an island located just off the northeast coast of the United States and a region within the U.S. state of New York. Stretching east-northeast from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (which comprise the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, many people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Brooklyn and Queens) colloquially use the term \\"Long Island\\" (or \\"The Island\\") exclusively to refer to the NassauSuffolk county area collectively, which is mainly suburban in character. More generally, \\"Long Island\\" may also refer collectively both to the main Island as well as its nearby, surrounding outer barrier islands. North of the island is the Long Island Sound, across from which lie the states of Connecticut and a small part of Rhode Island across the Block Island Sound. Across the Sound, to the northwest, lies Westchester County on mainland New York. To the west, Long Island is separated from the Bronx and the island of Manhattan by the East River. To the extreme southwest, it is separated from the New York City borough of Staten Island and the U.S. state of New Jersey by Upper New York Bay, the Narrows, and Lower New York Bay. To the east lie Block Island and numerous smaller islands.  - Alternative hip hop (also known as alternative rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music that encompasses the wide range of styles of hip hop that have not become identified as mainstream. AllMusic defines it as follows: \\"Alternative rap refers to hip hop groups that tend not to conform to any of the traditional forms of rap, such as gangsta, bass, hardcore, pop, and party rap. Instead, they blur genres  drawing equally from funk and rock, as well as jazz, soul, reggae, country, electronic, and even folk.\\"    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'stakes is high ' exhibits the relationship of 'record label'.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Following the Taliban prisoner swap that led to the release of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told Fox News that 30% of the detainees released from the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay \\"have already gone back into the fight.\\" It's a figure that has been frequently repeated in recent days, but is it true? It depends on who is doing the counting. According to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which regularly releases an unclassified summary report about former detainees, as of January this year, 104 of the 614 detainees (17%) released from the prison have engaged in \\"terrorist activities,\\" while another 74 (12%) are suspected of doing so. It is impossible to assess the validity of the U.S. government's claim, referenced by McCain, that nearly 30% of the released detainees are confirmed or suspected of engaging in terrorist activity because the government has not publicly released the names of any of these detainees for the past five years. The U.S. government defines a \\"confirmed\\" terrorist or insurgent as based on a \\"preponderance\\" of information pointing to that conclusion, while someone  in the \\"suspected\\" category is based on plausible but unverified or single source reporting to that effect. In order to shed some light on exactly which graduates from Guantanamo have joined a militant group or engaged in some other kind of terrorist activity, the New America Foundation analyzed Pentagon reports, news stories, and other publicly available documents to create a list of former detainees who have \\"returned to the battlefield.\\" The list can be found here. The New America list documents a much smaller number than does the U.S. government. Of the 620 former detainees who have been transferred from the prison camp, we have identified 15 former Guantanamo detainees (2.5%) who are confirmed to have engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities against the United States or its citizens, while there are 21 individuals (3.5%) who are suspected of engaging in such activities. We also identified 18 former detainees (3%) who are confirmed or suspected of involvement in militant attacks against non-U.S. targets. Taking all three categories together, the New America list finds only a third as many Guantanamo prisoners have returned to the battlefield, compared to the U.S. government estimate. A recent example of this is British citizen Moazzam Begg, a former Guantanamo prisoner released in 2005, who was arrested in December on terrorism charges related to the Syrian civil war. He has denied the charges. It's important to note that the vast majority of individuals who are confirmed or suspected to have militant groups were released under the George W. Bush administration, a fact that is missing from much of the current commentary. For the purposes of our study, for a former detainee to be considered \\"confirmed\\" that he had joined a militant group, there had to be a preponderance of information claiming he was directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activities. For those \\"suspected\\" of such acts, there were plausible but unverified accounts about their involvement in such activities. While it is certainly possible there are some former detainees participating in terrorist and insurgent activities who have not been identified publicly, we are confident that our numbers are reasonably accurate because groups like al Qaeda and the Taliban are eager to trumpet the identities of released Guantanamo detainees who join their ranks, as it is a propaganda coup for them, and the media is also quick to highlight such stories. Based on our findings, even if you combine all of the released detainees who are confirmed or suspected of taking part in any form of militant activity anywhere in the world, the total comes to 54, or 8.7%, which is much lower than the 30% being cited by the U.S. intelligence community and members of Congress. This percentage is also much lower than the recidivism rate of criminals within the United States, which currently stands around 67.5%,  according to the most recent statistics by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Some of the Guantanamo prisoners who were released by the Bush administration are certainly quite dangerous.  Said Ali al-Shiri, who co-founded al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in 2009, was transferred to Saudi Arabia in 2007. Shiri completed the kingdom's rehabilitation program and promptly headed to Yemen, where he became AQAP's deputy commander. He was killed in a U.S. drone strike last year. Another example is Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul (who also goes by the name Mullah Zakir), who has emerged as one of the top Taliban commanders. Rasoul was also transferred from Guantanamo to Afghanistan in 2007 by the Bush administration and rejoined the Taliban shortly after the Afghan government released him from custody. Under Obama,  the U.S. State Department and U.S. Defense Department use comprehensive threat assessments to determine a detainee's eligibility for release.  This has contributed to the fact that of the 88 prisoners released under Obama, we were only able to find publicly available information about one of those who had joined a militant group: Abdul Hafiz, who was returned to Afghanistan and is accused of fighting for the Taliban and targeting Afghan aid workers. (The intelligence community claims five Obama-era releasees have joined militant groups.) Of course the  high-ranking Taliban prisoners released in the exchange for Sgt. Bergdahl are not just low-level militants and President Obama himself has admitted that they might pose some future threat. \\"Is there the possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us? Absolutely. There's a certain recidivism rate that takes place,\\" Obama said. But these men are not being released freely into Afghan society. They have been transferred to the custody of Qatar, which is a rich, efficient police state and they have been banned from travel for a year. Assuming that ban holds, by the time they are able to travel back to Afghanistan, there will no longer be any U.S. combat presence as American combat soldiers are all pulling out at the end of December 2014. So any potential threat that those five Taliban officials might pose to American targets in Afghanistan will be much smaller by then. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

I will answer both questions separately to provide a detailed understanding.  Disadvantages of Democracy: While democracy is considered an ideal form of government where power is vested in the hands of the people, it does have its drawbacks. Here are some of the disadvantages of democracy: 1. Slow decision-making: In a democratic system, multiple factions have to debate and agree upon any policy or decision. This can result in delayed decision-making and slow progress on issues. 2. Populism and short-termism: Since leaders are elected through popular votes, politicians may cater to the short-term interests of the public instead of considering long-term consequences and making unpopular but necessary decisions for the nation's well-being. 3. Voter influence and misinformation: The public can be influenced by false or misleading arguments made by politicians and media. As a result, voters might make decisions based on misinformation, emotional appeals, and biased perspectives. 4. Tyranny of the majority: Majority rule can lead to the suppression of minority rights and interests. This can result in unfair treatment or infringements on the rights of minority groups. 5. Corruption and cronyism: The competition for votes and resources can sometimes lead to corruption, bribery, and nepotism among politicians, diverting resources away from important state issues and allowing well-connected individuals to reap benefits at the expense of others. India: A Democracy or a Republic? India is a democratic republic, which means it is a combination of both democracy and republic. The citizens of India have the right to choose their leaders through free and fair elections, making it a democratic country. Additionally, India is a republic because it has a president as its head of state, elected by an electoral college representing the people, rather than a hereditary monarch. In conclusion, the two questions address different aspects of democracy. The first question details the disadvantages of democracy, while the second delves into the classification of India as a democratic republic. Therefore, the answer to the given options is 1).

Posing as a \\"casting agent\\", he would incite them to commit sexual acts. Dynes, who is originally from Dungannon, County Tyrone, but now lives in a hostel in Ballymena, County Antrim, pleaded guilty to 41 sex charges, including making and possessing indecent images of children. He also admitted inciting children, some of whom were younger than 13 years old, to engage in a sexual act as well as four charges of voyeurism. The judge at Dungannon Crown Court said the public would be better protected by extending the supervised licence period to allow Dynes to undergo a full course of treatment, instead of returning him to prison for a month or two. The court was told that Dynes has lost his job, marriage and his home as a result of his offending. \\"All of that is now gone, solely due to your own criminal behaviour,\\" the judge told him. \\"The offences effectively ruined your life. That is entirely your own fault.\\" He added that the images Dynes owned and created were of \\"real-life children... who have been sexually abused so that people like you can view them\\". \\"No one should be in any doubt, that market would not exist but for people like you.\\" Dynes was caught on his own recording equipment while installing it in a bedroom, which then filmed a female carrying out private acts. A camera was also installed by Dynes in a workplace kitchen, which resulted in \\"up-skirt\\" filming. The defendant had spent 14 months remanded in custody in prison, which the judge said was the equivalent of a 28-month sentence. The judge imposed a sentence of three years and one month on all counts, and set the period of custody at 13 months followed by 24 months supervision. He said this was the minimum necessary for Dynes to complete the tailored sex offenders order that he needed. He said the sentence would punish him for his criminal behaviour, serve as a deterrent to others and lead to his not committing any further offences. The judge also said any breach of the heavily-monitored supervision would see him returned to prison for the full period of the sentence. The judge added that as the internet continued to impact upon the modern world, \\"the law will continue to develop in this area\\". Dynes was put on the sex offenders' register for life and will be subjected to terms of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) that will monitor him for the next 10 years. He was arrested as part of Operation Jarra, a joint operation between the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). His home was searched in June 2015 and a forensic examination of his computers revealed 1,133 indecent images. An NCA officer told an earlier court hearing that the investigation had revealed Dynes was chatting with boys and girls online and trying to incite them into committing sexual acts. The officer described the matter as \\"one of the most serious cases of sexual exploitation of children encountered by the agency\\". Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Michael Dynes, 39, posed as a casting agent and lured young people through online advertisements for life models, inciting them to commit sexual acts on webcams. Dynes pleaded guilty to 41 sex charges, including making and possessing indecent images of children, inciting children to engage in sexual acts, and voyeurism. The court at Dungannon sentenced him to three years and one month, with 13 months in custody followed by 24 months of supervision. Dynes was also added to the sex offenders' register for life and will be under a Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) for the next 10 years.

Answer the question:   Will weighed himself on a scale. He weighs less than last year. His force of gravitational attraction increased or decreased? A:","output":"Given the information that Will weighs less than last year, it can be concluded that his force of gravitational attraction has decreased. To provide a detailed explanation, let's first understand the concept of gravitational attraction and its relationship with mass. Gravitational attraction is the force that exists between two masses that have a certain distance between them. In simpler terms, it is the force that pulls objects with mass towards each other. This force is governed by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points. The formula for calculating gravitational force (F) is: F = (G * m1 * m2) / r^2 where - G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2), - m1 and m2 are the masses of two objects experiencing the force of attraction, - r is the distance between the centers of mass of the two objects. When we talk about a person's weight, it is actually the force of gravitational attraction between the person (their mass) and Earth (its mass). In this case, m1 represents the person's mass, m2 represents Earth's mass, and r is the distance between the person and the center of Earth. Since the Earth's mass (m2) remains constant and the distance from Earth's center (r) is roughly the same for humans living on the surface, the weight of the person (F) is directly related to their mass (m1). As Will now weighs less than last year, his mass (m1) has decreased. Since the other factors in the equation—Earth's mass and the distance from its center—remain constant, the change in Will's mass directly results in a change in the force of gravitational attraction. If his mass has decreased, the force of gravitational attraction (i.e., his weight) has also decreased, following the relationship established by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: The North Avenue Irregulars Context: Reverend Michael Hill (Edward Herrmann) and his two children arrive in a fictional California town. He is there to serve as the new minister at the North Avenue Presbyterian Church. The secretary/music director for the church, Anne (Susan Clark), is wary of the changes Hill intends to implement. Hill wants to get people involved, and asks Mrs. Rose Rafferty (Patsy Kelly, in her final movie role) to handle the church's sinking fund. On his first Sunday, Hill learns from Mrs. Rafferty that her husband Delaney (Douglas Fowley) bet all the sinking fund money on a horse race. Hill delivers a sermon less than 15 seconds long, then rapidly escorts Mrs. Rafferty out the church as astonished worshipers watch. She leads him to the bookie, hidden behind a dry-cleaning shop, and meets Harry the Hat (Alan Hale, Jr.), who recommends that Hill let the bet ride. Hill's horse loses and he is thrown out of the betting parlor. Hill summons the police, but the booking joint has been skillfully removed. That evening, Hill delivers a tirade against the organized crime in the city during a local television broadcast. He is chastised by his presbytery superiors for the tirade, and is urged to go out and build church membership in the area. His only success is with a rock band called Strawberry Shortcake, who he recruits to \\"jazz up\\" the music at church; Anne resigns as music director.

Detroit techno developed as the DJ The Electrifying Mojo did his radio program, which fused eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound. This sound, also influenced by European electronica (Kraftwerk, Art of Noise), Japanese synthpop (Yellow Magic Orchestra), early B-boy (breakdancing) Hip-Hop (Man Parrish, Soul Sonic Force) and Italo disco (Doctor's Cat, Ris, Klein M.B.O.), was further pioneered by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, known as the Belleville Three.

Before she leaves, she stops by the organ factory in town, and places on their organ for them. The place she is going to has an organ made from the same factory as well. When the Factory owner requests that Mary come back some time to play for them again, she claims she will not be returning.Mary then takes off on her trip. As she nears Salt Lake City, Utah, her vision is drawn to a dark pavilion lying back a ways towards the horizon. As she glances out the passenger side window, she is shocked to see a man staring in at her! Mary turns away and looks back, but the figure is soon gone. However, Mary is shocked again when the same figure appears on the road in front of her, causing her to drive off the road. Collecting herself, Mary gets back on the road, and heads towards Salt Lake City.Mary rooms at a residence, presided over by a woman named Mrs Thomas (Frances Feist). There is another person rooming at the house, a rather slimy warehouse worker named John Linden (Sidney Berger).After putting her things in her new residence, Mary goes off to the church to meet the Minister (Art Ellison). She practices on the organ, but after some time, stops and sits by a window to contemplate. The Minister asks her if she would like to take a ride with him to an appointment. Mary also makes a request that since the appointment is outside of town, if they could drive by the pavilion... The answer to this question is:","output":"The Minister is the one who hears the strange music, denounces it as \\"profane\\" and insists upon her resignation. In the movie \\"Carnival of Souls,\\" Mary begins to play haunting and eerie tunes during her organ practice at the church. These tunes are inappropriate for the church setting and are the reason why the Minister expresses his concerns regarding the music. Consequently, he insists that Mary resigns from her position as the organist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the individual known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies?, using the article: Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The individual known for their highly regarded work with the Pixies, as suggested in your shared passage, is Deal. However, to be precise and provide a full name, this almost certainly refers to Kim Deal. Kim Deal was a primary member of the Pixies, playing bass and providing vocals, before later forming the band The Breeders, which is responsible for the release of the album 'Pod', as mentioned in your text. She is indeed highly regarded for her contribution to the Pixies and their influence on the alternative rock scene."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, The Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic.  - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938  November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle.  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it.  - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.  - Augustus \`\` Gussie '' Clarke ( born 1953 ) is a reggae producer who worked with some of the top Jamaican reggae artists in the 1970s and later set up his own Music Works studio .  - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Eclipse Comics was an American comic book publisher, one of several independent publishers during the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1978, it published the first graphic novel intended for the newly created comic book specialty store market. It was one of the first to offer royalties and creator ownership of rights, and the first comics company to publish trading cards.  - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938.

If \\"A shirtless male shaving in front of a mirror.\\", does this mean that \\"The male in the shirt shaves his mustache in front of a mirror.\\"?  -- yes; -- it is not possible to tell; -- no;","output":"The phrase \\"A shirtless male shaving in front of a mirror\\" does not necessarily mean \\"The male in the shirt shaves his mustache in front of a mirror.\\" There are a few important distinctions to consider. Firstly, the initial phrase specifies that the male individual is shirtless, which means he is not wearing a shirt. The second phrase, however, identifies that the male is in a shirt, suggesting he is wearing one. Therefore, there is a direct contradiction in the clothing status of the male individual in the two descriptions. Secondly, the first phrase generally says the male is shaving but doesn't specify what he is shaving. He could be shaving his face, chest, or even head. The second phrase, however, is more specific, stating that the male is shaving his mustache. This introduces a level of detail not present in the first phrase, which makes a significant difference in interpreting the two sentences. Since the context, specifics, and wording of both phrases are different, it's reasonable to conclude that \\"A shirtless male shaving in front of a mirror\\" doesn't necessarily equate to \\"The male in the shirt shaves his mustache in front of a mirror.\\" While there is a common element - a male individual shaving in front of a mirror - the specifics regarding the state of clothing and the area being shaved differ markedly. Therefore, my response would be -- no; the two phrases do not mean the same thing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Colonial records of French and Spanish slave ships and sales, and plantation records in all the former colonies, often have much more information about slaves, from which researchers are reconstructing slave family histories. Genealogists have begun to find plantation records, court records, land deeds and other sources to trace African-American families and individuals before 1870. As slaves were generally forbidden to learn to read and write, black families passed along oral histories, which have had great persistence. Similarly, Native Americans did not generally learn to read and write English, although some did in the nineteenth century. Until 1930, census enumerators used the terms free people of color and mulatto to classify people of apparent mixed race. When those terms were dropped, as a result of the lobbying by the Southern Congressional bloc, the Census Bureau used only the binary classifications of black or white, as was typical in segregated southern states. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What do genealogists use to trace African American families after 1870?","output":"After 1870, genealogists use a variety of resources to trace African American families. Some of the most important sources include: 1. Census records: Starting from the 1870 U.S. Federal Census, formerly enslaved African Americans were enumerated as individuals, providing valuable information about families, occupations, and residences. Census records from 1870 onwardserve as a primary source for genealogists to trace African American family lineages and connect ancestors to specific locations. 2. Vital records: Birth, marriage, and death records often contain important information for genealogists. These records became more widely available and standardized after the Civil War, providing crucial data for tracing African American families. 3. Freedmen's Bureau records: Established in 1865, the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, colloquially known as the Freedmen's Bureau, generated a vast collection of records pertaining to newly freed African Americans. These documents include labor contracts, educational efforts, medical assistance, and many other aspects of life during Reconstruction. The records can be useful for genealogists to trace individual and family histories. 4. Military records: African American men who served in the United States Colored Troops (USCT) during the Civil War have service records, pension files, and other military-related documents that can be used to trace family histories. Additionally, military records from subsequent conflicts, such as World War I and World War II, can also provide genealogists with important information. 5. Land records: Property deeds and related land documents can provide extensive information about landownership and family relationships, helping genealogists reconstruct African American family histories. 6. Local and state archives: Court records, wills, probate documents, voter registration lists, city directories, and other materials held in local and state archives can be invaluable resources for genealogists researching African American families. 7. Church records: African American churches have often played a central role in family and community life, and many have maintained records of baptisms, marriages, and funerals, which can be valuable resources for genealogists tracing family histories. 8. Newspapers and periodicals: Articles, obituaries, and classified advertisements in African American newspapers and periodicals can provide useful information for genealogists to trace families and individuals. 9. Oral histories: Many African American families preserved their stories and traditions through oral history. While not always documented through official records, these narratives can be invaluable in filling gaps and providing context for genealogical research. 10. Slave narratives and biographies: Personal accounts written by or about formerly enslaved people provide a wealth of information about individual lives and experiences. These accounts can be an essential resource for genealogists tracing African American families during and after slavery. By utilizing these sources, genealogists can effectively trace African American families and individuals after 1870, reconstructing family histories and uncovering important connections to their ancestors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Build a movie plot around this: What size are Bob and sally at the end Normal size Answer:","output":"Title: The Incredible Shrinking Adventure Plot Summary: Bob and Sally, a fun-loving and adventurous couple, stumble upon a hidden laboratory in the heart of an ancient mysterious forest. Inside the lab, they discover a strange device that accidentally shrinks them down to the size of insects. As they embark on an incredible journey to return to their normal size, Bob and Sally must navigate through a world filled with wonder and danger that they've never seen before. Act 1: Bob and Sally, two nature enthusiasts, are on a camping trip to explore the beauty of the ancient forest. They come across an uncharted path that leads them to a hidden laboratory, overgrown with vegetation, and covered in dust and cobwebs. Intrigued by their discovery, they cautiously step inside and accidentally activate a mysterious shrinking device. Within moments, they find themselves reduced to the size of insects, and the machine appears to be damaged and malfunctioning, rendering it useless. Act 2: As the reality of their situation sets in, Bob and Sally realize that they must find a way to reverse the shrinking process and return to their normal size. They set out on a journey through the now-gigantic forest, encountering various animals they once knew well but now seem like monstrous threats. Along the way, they meet new friends in the form of other bugs who help them navigate through their new world and teach them valuable life lessons. Their journey is filled with numerous obstacles and challenges, like crossing a raging river avoided by predators and enduring torrential rainstorms. Through teamwork and determination, Bob and Sally persist, always keeping their eyes on the ultimate goal: returning to their normal size. Act 3: As Bob and Sally make their way through the forest, they come across a scientist named Dr. Iris, who has been searching for the hidden laboratory for years. The lab once belonged to her grandfather, a genius scientist who passed away before he could reverse the effects of the shrinking device. Together, the trio returns to the laboratory with the new knowledge gathered during Bob and Sally's incredible journey. They manage to repair the shrinking device and carefully use it to return themselves to their regular size. Relieved but forever changed by their experience, Bob and Sally share a heartfelt farewell with their newfound insect friends before rejoining the human world. In the end, Bob and Sally's incredible shrinking adventure becomes a story of self-discovery, where they learn their strength, resilience, and the importance of looking at the world from a new perspective.

Answer based on context: The Vikings traveled to Green Bay in week 12 to face a Packers team missing quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who had suffered a fractured left collarbone three weeks earlier. After successive punts from each side started the game, the Packers were the first to score as backup QB Scott Tolzien ran in for a 6-yard touchdown, but two field goals from Blair Walsh and a 1-yard touchdown run for Adrian Peterson meant the Vikings took a 13-7 lead into halftime. They extended their lead midway through the third quarter as Christian Ponder hit tight end Rhett Ellison for a 12-yard touchdown, and Walsh made it a 16-point lead with a 29-yard field goal on the second play of the fourth quarter. The Packers pulled the struggling Tolzien after the Ellison touchdown and replaced him with the recently re-signed Matt Flynn. Flynn then led the Packers on three consecutive scoring drives in the fourth quarter, starting with a 3-yard touchdown run for Eddie Lacy. Flynn's pass to Andrew Quarless on the two-point attempt fell incomplete, but Flynn was able to find Jarrett Boykin for a 6-yard touchdown on the next drive to reduce the Vikings' lead to three points. Inside the two-minute warning, Flynn combined with James Jones for a 28-yard completion on 4th-and-6, setting up Mason Crosby for the game-tying, 27-yard field goal. The Packers won the overtime coin toss and took the opening possession down to the Minnesota 2-yard line before having to settle for a field goal, only for Walsh to respond with a 35-yard effort. The two sides then exchanged possession as neither was able to put together a significant drive and the game ended in a 26-26 tie.

The nation's largest group of pediatricians on Monday urged its members to \\"firmly oppose boxing for any child or adolescent.\\"  In a statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) said thousands of boys and girls take part in the sport in North America, despite risks of serious brain and facial injuries. The group's position was approved by some experts.  \\"There is very little one can do in order to increase the chance of having a healthy brain when you get old,\\" said Dr. Hans Forstl, who has studied boxing injuries.  \\" One of the best things you can do is avoid boxing.\\" He said.  According to the new statement, published in the journal Pediatrics, information from Canada shows a rise in boxing injuries over the past decade.  Pat Russo, a retired police officer who runs a boxing gym in Brooklyn, New York, said injuries are rare in amateur boxing. After 26 years and training thousands of kids, he has seen just one split lip among his students.  \\" If the gym is run properly, injuries are at an absolute minimum,\\" Russo said. \\"Football is ten times more dangerous. While tennis or football might also help kids gain confidence, boxing holds a special attraction for children in poor neighborhoods, because it allows them to act tough while in trouble.\\"  Dr. Robert Cantu, a surgeon at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Massachusetts, said AAP's attitude makes sense for upper-class and middle-class kids.  \\" Clearly boxing is safer today than it was 20 or 30 years ago, but it is still a very risky activity,\\" he said.  \\"For kids in poor areas, however, the situation is different,\\" said Cantu. \\" The most dangerous thing for the majority of people in boxing is just where they live.

Step-by-step translation and justification: 1. \\"It was not such an easy task\\" - \\"Se ei ollutkaan niin helppo tehtävä\\" - 'It was not' translates to 'Se ei ollut', added 'kaan' to emphasize the surprise (not after all), - 'such an easy' to 'niin helppo', and - 'task' to 'tehtävä'. 2. \\"and I am grateful\\" - \\"ja olen kiitollinen\\" - 'and' translates to 'ja', - 'I am' to 'olen', and - 'grateful' to 'kiitollinen'. 3. \\"that we managed to cooperate\\" - \\"että onnistuimme yhteistyössä\\" - 'that' translates to 'että', - 'we managed' to 'onnistuimme' (the 'we' is implied in the verb conjugation), - 'to cooperate' to 'yhteistyössä' (in cooperation). 4. \\"in an objective manner\\" - \\"objektiivisella tavalla\\" - 'in an' translates to 'lla' suffix, - 'objective' to 'objektiivinen', and - 'manner' to 'tavalla'. 5. \\"and to seek out\\" - \\"ja pyrkimään löytämään\\" - 'and' translates again to 'ja', - 'to seek' to 'pyrkimään', and - 'out' is added emphasis, so 'löytämään' is used (to find). 6. \\"the widest possible common ground\\" - \\"mahdollisimman laajan yhteisen pohjan\\" - 'the widest possible' translates to 'mahdollisimman laaja', - 'common' to 'yhteisen', and - 'ground' to 'pohjan' (used as a base, foundation). 7. \\"on what is not an entirely straightforward issue\\" - \\"sellaisessa asiassa, joka ei ole täysin yksinkertainen\\" - 'on' translates to 'ssa' suffix ('in'), - 'what is not' to 'joka ei ole', - 'an entirely' to 'täysin', and - 'straightforward issue' to 'yksinkertainen asia'. By combining all the translated parts together and making sure the sentence structure and grammar are correct, we get the final translation: \\"Se ei ollutkaan niin helppo tehtävä, ja olen kiitollinen, että onnistuimme yhteistyössä objektiivisella tavalla ja pyrkimään löytämään mahdollisimman laajan yhteisen pohjan sellaisessa asiassa, joka ei ole täysin yksinkertainen.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: About 20 properties in Cardigan, Ceredigion, have been affected by \\"significant flooding\\" with a hotel hit for the second time this year. Eleven flood alerts include north, west and south Pembrokeshire and Lower Teifi and the Western Cleddau. The Met Office has issued a \\"be aware\\" warning as more heavy rain is expected across Wales on Saturday morning. In Cardigan, St Mary Street was reported to be knee-deep in flood water in places. The Angel Hotel which was hit for the second time this year. Heavy rain sent surface water pouring through the hotel's ground floor from front to back. The hotel had only recently been repaired after flooding at the start of this year. Fire crews began pumping water out of properties after the alert was raised at 08:00 GMT but no property was evacuated. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service had crews from Cardigan, Crymych, Fishguard, Newcastle Emlyn and Llandysul dealing with the incident. Ceredigion council said the county's flood plan has been put into operation and St Mary's church hall in Cardigan had been opened to residents. It said: \\"The rainfall experienced in the south of the county this morning was exceptional with rainfall intensities of 32mm per hour reported by the Met Office. \\"The highway surface water systems are designed to accommodate expected rainfall intensities but perhaps not the very exceptional rainfall circumstances as experienced earlier today.\\" Pembrokeshire council said it took more than 100 flood-related calls, with the north and north east of the county the worst affected, particularly St Dogmaels, Newport and Dinas. Fire crews were called to pump out water at five of the properties in Dinas, Solva and St Dogmaels. Natural Resources Wales had issued a flood warning for Solva but this has since been stood down. In a statement, Pembrokeshire council said: \\"Roads were reported flooded up to knee high in several places, and there were road closures at St Dogmaels and Devonshire Drive, near Tenby. \\"Many of the road flooding issues have been caused by debris dislodged in the heavy rain causing culverts to block. \\"Other problems have been caused by vehicles driving through deep water, causing 'bow waves' to wash into and flood properties. \\"Several of the flooded roads have had drain covers dislodged.\\" Surface water was reported on The Square at Fishguard, between West Street and High Street. Flooding and poor driving conditions were reported between Fishguard and Eglwyswrw as well as elsewhere on the A487 at Newgale and Roch. Dyfed-Powys Police said there were many other reports of flooding in Ceredigion, and conditions on the A487 were \\"particularly bad\\".

The domestication of the wild turkey can be attributed to the indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica, particularly the Mayans and the Aztecs. The wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is native to North America, and its domestication began in ancient Mesoamerica, around 800 BC to the early AD period. The Mayans and the Aztecs played a significant role in the domestication of wild turkeys, raising them for their meat and feathers. These domesticated birds were not only a source of food but also played a part in religious and ceremonial activities. The Mayans used the turkey's meat in everyday cooking and considered the birds sacred. In contrast, the Aztecs often used turkeys as ritual offerings to their gods, proving their deep cultural significance. Additionally, turkey feathers were incorporated into clothing, headdresses, and other items for decorative purposes. European explorers, like the Spanish conquistadors, came across domesticated turkeys during their explorations and conquests in the Americas. They took some of these birds back to Europe in the early 16th century, where they quickly gained popularity as a new source of poultry. The European domesticated turkeys diverged from their Mesoamerican counterparts due to selective breeding, creating the modern turkey variety we are familiar with today. In summary, the answer to the question \\"Who domesticated the wild turkey?\\" is a description that refers to the indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica, specifically the Mayans and the Aztecs, who were responsible for the domestication of the wild turkey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - Place the water in a pot - Cover the pot with a slightly too large cover - Place a larger pot under the first - Heat water to evaporation - Water vapor will collect on the lid - Drip into the second pot as fresh water - Salt is left behind in the original pot.  Question: suppose More salt will drip inside the fresh water pot. happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"To answer the question, let's analyze the process step by step and the potential perturbation on the amount of salt removed from the water: 1. Place the water in a pot: The amount of salt in the water will initially affect the efficiency of the process, but in itself, it does not affect the efficiency of salt removal. 2. Cover the pot with a slightly too large cover: Suppose more salt drips inside the fresh water pot. This indicates that there might be an issue with the cover, as it is not supposed to allow salt to pass through. However, since the evaporated water is supposed to be salt-free, this perturbation should ideally have no effect on salt removal from the water. 3. Place a larger pot under the first: This step doesn't influence the amount of salt being removed from the water. 4. Heat water to evaporation: This step helps separate salt from the water. If more salt drips into the fresh water pot, it would mean that the evaporated water is not salt-free, indicating that the evaporation process is not entirely efficient, and would result in less salt being removed from the water. 5. Water vapor will collect on the lid: If more salt drips into the fresh water pot, it suggests that the lid may not be functioning correctly, leading to less effective salt removal from the water. 6. Drip into the second pot as fresh water: If more salt drips into the fresh water pot, the perturbation suggests a lesser separation of salt from the water, resulting in reduced salt-removal efficiency. 7. Salt is left behind in the original pot: If more salt drips into the fresh water pot, this could indicate that not enough salt is being left behind in the original pot, which would mean less salt is being removed from the water. Overall, if more salt drips into the fresh water pot, it will influence the process by reducing the efficiency of salt removal from the water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nolan's crew is looking for a great white shark for a local aquarium, but a scientist named Ken (Robert Carradine) is targeted by the shark. An orca comes and kills the shark, saving Ken. This switches Nolan's target to the orca. While Nolan is on the journey with his crew, he tries to capture what he believes to be a bull orca, but mistakenly harpoons a pregnant female. Nolan and his crew get the orca on board, where she subsequently miscarries. The captain hoses the dead fetus overboard as the male orca looks on screaming. Seeking release of his near-dead mate, the male orca tries to sink the ship. One of Nolan's crew members, Novak (Keenan Wynn), cuts the female off the ship, but the male leaps up and drags him into the sea, too. The following day, the orca pushes his now dead mate onto shore. Alan Swain (Scott Walker) berates Nolan on his actions after finding the dead whale. Nolan denies responsibility, but Swain and the villagers eventually find out his involvement. The villagers insist that he kill the orca, as his presence is causing the fish vital to the village's economy to migrate. The orca then terrorises the village by sinking fishing boats in broad daylight and then breaking fuel lines, thus destroying the village's fuel reserves. Dr. Rachel Bedford (Charlotte Rampling), a colleague of Ken and a whale expert, shows him how similar whales are to humans and tells Nolan that, \\"If he [the orca] is like a human, what he wants isn't necessarily what he should have.\\" Nolan confesses to Bedford that he empathises with the whale, as his own wife and unborn child had previously been killed in a car crash caused by a drunk driver.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which group of larvae had fewer changes in their RNA sequence?  The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't.  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

On my seventh birthday, my parents bought me a second-hand ZX Spectrum and, in a foretaste of my life to come, I immediately set about learning how to use it to get attention. It's a sign of how rapidly technology develops that my crappy Spectrum, with its 48k of memory, already had 12k more storage power than the computer that had guided the Apollo 11 moon landing eighteen years earlier* With power like that, there seemed to be no limit to what I could do. While my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house. From that day on, the possibilities offered by technology to both subvert the norm and get attention had me hooked. Years later, at secondary school, I convinced my English teacher, Mr Coen, to teach me desktop publishing, ostensibly to work on the official school magazine, but in reality to produce an alternative underground version - complete with less than flattering articles about teachers and fellow pupils and distributed via the publicly accessible shared hard drive that was supposed to be used for collaborative coursework. That particular stunt got me banned from the school computer room for half a term. And then, in 1997, I discovered the Internet. Throughout history, every fame-hungry media dickhead has found his preferred medium for pursuing fame and wealth (in that order). For Tony Parsons - and Hitler, for that matter - it was books.

I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before.

While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine.

Step 1: Analyze the words. \\"Too\\" -> implies an excess or something more than desired. \\"Long\\" -> in this context, it refers to a length, duration, or extent of something. \\"Shake\\" -> a common, physical action that could have different meanings depending on the context (e.g., shaking hands, shake off something). Step 2: Investigate potential contexts. Without any specific context, this phrase may be a bit ambiguous. It could refer to a handshake that lasted too long or the time taken to shake off dirt, thoughts, or emotions. Therefore, the context should be considered to better understand its connotation. Step 3: Determine the positive or negative sentiment. Assuming the most common context (handshake), \\"too long to shake\\" might describe an uncomfortable or awkward situation when a handshake lasts longer than socially accepted or desired. Based on these steps, I would say that the phrase \\"too long to shake\\" would generally be considered negative due to the excess implied by the word \\"too\\" and the potential awkwardness or discomfort associated with a prolonged action.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: IN the 1960s, mainframe computers posed a significant technological challenge to common notions of privacy. That’s when the federal government started putting tax returns into those giant machines, and consumer credit bureaus began building databases containing the personal financial information of millions of Americans. Many people feared that the new computerized databanks would be put in the service of an intrusive corporate or government Big Brother. “It really freaked people out,” says Daniel J. Weitzner, a former senior Internet policy official in the Obama administration. “The people who cared about privacy were every bit as worried as we are now.” Along with fueling privacy concerns, of course, the mainframes helped prompt the growth and innovation that we have come to associate with the computer age. Today, many experts predict that the next wave will be driven by technologies that fly under the banner of Big Data — data including Web pages, browsing habits, sensor signals, smartphone location trails and genomic information, combined with clever software to make sense of it all. Proponents of this new technology say it is allowing us to see and measure things as never before — much as the microscope allowed scientists to examine the mysteries of life at the cellular level. Big Data, they say, will open the door to making smarter decisions in every field from business and biology to public health and energy conservation. “This data is a new asset,” says Alex Pentland, a computational social scientist and director of the Human Dynamics Lab at the M.I.T. “You want it to be liquid and to be used.” But the latest leaps in data collection are raising new concern about infringements on privacy — an issue so crucial that it could trump all others and upset the Big Data bandwagon. Dr. Pentland is a champion of the Big Data vision and believes the future will be a data-driven society. Yet the surveillance possibilities of the technology, he acknowledges, could leave George Orwell in the dust. The World Economic Forum published a report late last month that offered one path — one that leans heavily on technology to protect privacy. The report grew out of a series of workshops on privacy held over the last year, sponsored by the forum and attended by government officials and privacy advocates, as well as business executives. The corporate members, more than others, shaped the final document. The report, “Unlocking the Value of Personal Data: From Collection to Usage,” recommends a major shift in the focus of regulation toward restricting the use of data. Curbs on the use of personal data, combined with new technological options, can give individuals control of their own information, according to the report, while permitting important data assets to flow relatively freely. “There’s no bad data, only bad uses of data,” says Craig Mundie, a senior adviser at Microsoft, who worked on the position paper. The report contains echoes of earlier times. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, passed in 1970, was the main response to the mainframe privacy challenge. The law permitted the collection of personal financial information by the credit bureaus, but restricted its use mainly to three areas: credit, insurance and employment. The forum report suggests a future in which all collected data would be tagged with software code that included an individual’s preferences for how his or her data is used. All uses of data would have to be registered, and there would be penalties for violators. For example, one violation might be a smartphone application that stored more data than is necessary for a registered service like a smartphone game or a restaurant finder. The corporate members of the forum say they recognize the need to address privacy concerns if useful data is going to keep flowing. George C. Halvorson, chief executive of Kaiser Permanente, the large health care provider, extols the benefits of its growing database on nine million patients, tracking treatments and outcomes to improve care, especially in managing costly chronic and debilitating conditions like heart disease, diabetes and depression. New smartphone applications, he says, promise further gains — for example, a person with a history of depression whose movement patterns slowed sharply would get a check-in call. “We’re on the cusp of a golden age of medical science and care delivery,” Mr. Halvorson says. “But a privacy backlash could cripple progress.”","output":"\\"Big Data and Privacy: Navigating the Path to a Smart, Data-Driven Society\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: When travelers think of an Adriatic cruise, scenes of Venice, Italy--its canals, bridges, piazzas, and stunning architecture--come to mind. It's one of the most popular cruise destinations in Europe. And for many, the sail-away from Venice, through its Giudecca Canal, is an awe-inspiring experience. Venice may be known as La Serenissima, or \\"the most peaceful,\\" which, however, isn't entirely accurate these days. Venetians have been increasingly concerned about the impact of tourism and the potential for an environmental disaster off its shoreline due to the number of cruise ships that enter and exit its lagoon . That's why earlier last month, Venice announced a new policy to forbid the transit  of cruise ships to the city via the Giudecca Canal. It's not that the city wants to shun the cruise industry altogether: It simply wants to force traffic further away from the landmarks along the shoreline. City officials say that most ships will now transit the Contorta Sant'Angelo Canal. Additionally, the city is _ the size of ships that can visit Venice, as well as the total number of ships that call on it on a daily basis. As of January 2014, Venice plans to reduce the visitations of larger ships (those that are 40,000 tons or heavier) by 20 percent. This effectively caps the number of ships that can enter per day to five. In November, ships heavier than 96,000 tons will not be allowed to enter Guidecca Canal at all. How the city plans to carry out the new five-ships-per-day rule remains to be seen and have yet to be announced. Which ships will be allowed passage? Will it be first-come, first-served? However they proceed, cruise line executives want their passengers to know that Venice will remain a regular port of call--even if the transit to and from the city must evolve.

Complete the following sentence. In the town where Donald lives discrimination happens to people like Brian often,","output":"In the town where Donald lives, discrimination happens to people like Brian often, as they are unfortunately targeted and judged based on their ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status, rather than being recognized for their individuality, character or the unique strengths they possess. This regrettable practice of discrimination stems from a combination of ignorance, stereotypes, and an inability to embrace diversity and acceptance within the community. The prevailing cultural norms and social prejudices that exist within the town subtly encourage this discriminatory behavior, creating an environment in which marginalized individuals like Brian must navigate their daily lives while constantly feeling unwelcome, judged, or alienated. Furthermore, this atmosphere breeds fear and mistrust, discouraging open communication and understanding between different groups, further perpetuating and reinforcing these negative attitudes. Institutional bias can also contribute to the discrimination faced by individuals like Brian. This systemic issue infiltrates various aspects of community life, from housing, education, and employment to healthcare and the criminal justice system. Consequently, many people who face discrimination may also experience significant disparities in access to resources, opportunities, and overall quality of life. The impacts of this discrimination extend beyond the immediate emotional distress it causes; they can manifest in long-term physical, psychological, and social consequences. Enduring the frustration, sadness, and anger that come with constant discrimination can lead to anxiety, depression, and even a sense of hopelessness. Such an environment may hinder the personal and professional growth of affected individuals, limiting their potential and aspirations. The constant struggle for acceptance and equal treatment can also strain relationships, not only within the families of the targeted individuals but also across the entire community, further dividing its inhabitants. To challenge and dismantle the existing discrimination in Donald's town, it is crucial for its residents to advocate for change and promote inclusivity. By creating safe spaces for open dialogue, where people can share their experiences and learn from one another, the community can collectively develop empathy, understanding, and respect for everyone's unique identities and perspectives. Education aimed at dispelling stereotypes and addressing prejudices is also essential, as it allows for the reconsideration of long-held, harmful beliefs. Moreover, local institutions should review their policies and practices to identify and eradicate any existing disparities in resources or opportunities. Legal support and protection must be available for individuals like Brian who experience discrimination, while those who perpetrate this unfair treatment must be held accountable. In conclusion, in the town where Donald lives, discrimination happens to people like Brian often, stemming from a complex interplay of ignorance, prejudice, and systemic bias. To create a more just, equitable, and inclusive society, it is imperative for all members of the community to engage in an ongoing process of education, dialogue, and advocacy, ensuring that no one is held back by unfair judgments or mistreatment based on superficial factors. Only then can people like Brian truly thrive and reach their full potential, ultimately enriching and strengthening the entire community."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Please answer the following question: What is the publication that called the Elgin shoemaker the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\"?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Since the abolition of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\", and writing: Some minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling. From 1988 to 2000, the two western towers... Answer:","output":"The publication that called the Elgin shoemaker (John Shanks) the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\" is the Inverness Courier.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: Why is the minister disappointed in the current commissioner, prompting him to bring in a new one? he has ties to the underworld A:","output":"Title: Undercurrents Genre: Crime, Drama, Thriller Plot Summary: In the heart of the bustling metropolis, a city's grimy underworld threatens the lives of its citizens, seeping into the very corridors of power. Struggling to maintain the fragile balance of law and order, a bold and idealistic minister must confront his own sense of morality as he discovers that the commissioner at the helm of the police force has dangerous ties to the criminal networks ruling the city from the shadows. As the line between right and wrong begins to blur, the minister must make an impossible choice: should he preserve his own integrity, or risk the greater good to protect the city he loves? Plot: The movie opens with the city thriving with life, its streets lined with pedestrians and traffic. A news report plays in the background, highlighting the city's recent spike in crime, including a new criminal syndicate that has wormed its way into the core of the metropolis. The idealistic Minister of Security, Jonathan Reed, is shown standing on a rooftop, gazing out at cityscape with determination in his eyes. Commissioner Harold Dawson leads the city's police force, characterized by his brusque attitude and absolute control. Under his leadership, the crime rate has soared, with cases remaining unsolved and the city suffocating under the criminal syndicate's grip. Unbeknownst to the public, Dawson has made a deal with the syndicate's mysterious and powerful head: in exchange for his compliance and selective enforcement, Dawson receives immense financial benefit. One day, a dedicated undercover journalist named Amber Wright, whose own life had been marred by the tragedy of crime, uncovers the truth about Dawson's association with the criminal underworld. She risks her life to provide her findings to Minister Reed, who is stunned and horrified to learn of Dawson's treachery. This revelation throws Reed into internal turmoil - while he understands the dire consequences of removing the commissioner from power, he believes that he must uphold the values of truth and justice that he has sworn to serve. Reed makes the difficult decision to confront Dawson and demand his resignation. However, the commissioner, desperate to secure his position and retain the extralegal perks he enjoys, threatens to reveal Minister Reed's own personal and professional secrets, trapping him in a web of escalating tension and danger. Realizing that direct action against Dawson is untenable, Reed decides to recruit a new, fearless commissioner, named Samantha Vega, who is unaware of the complexities and deceit that shroud the city's administration. Samantha begins her term with the unwavering commitment to bring justice to the city, and despite Reed's initial reticence, he begins working closely with her. Together, they form an alliance, devising strategies to take down both Dawson and the criminal syndicate. This treacherous journey pushes Reed and Vega to the limits of their physical and moral capacities. As they confront the moral gray areas of their own actions, they realize the cost of pursuing justice is never black and white. In a thrilling and climactic confrontation, Reed and Vega are forced to battle the syndicate head, who has taken Amber Wright hostage in a derelict warehouse. As the stakes rise and the body count mounts, Reed and Vega stand on the precipice of justice, facing the choice between sacrificing the life of one journalist to take down the crime lord or risking the entire city's safety by saving her. Ultimately, they find a way to save Amber just as the syndicate's lair collapses, the crime lord arrested and Dawson's treachery exposed. The film closes with a shot of the city in the dawn light, a glimmer of hope in the darkness. As Reed and Vega watch the sunrise, they are simultaneously strengthened and humbled by their experiences, knowing the fight for justice is never-ending--but it is a fight they are willing to shoulder together. With hellfire behind them and battle-scarred hearts, they join hands and step into a future that, while uncertain, promises shining rays of hope for a city now in their care."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question: What is probability theory ? Would the answer to this question be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","output":"The answer to the question \\"What is probability theory?\\" would be a description, as probability theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of random phenomena and the quantification of uncertainty. It is a foundational element of many disciplines, including statistics, economics, finance, computer science, and physics. Probability theory focuses on the study of situations in which randomness and uncertainty play crucial roles. It provides a mathematical framework to understand the likelihood of various outcomes in such situations. The heart of the theory lies in the concept of a probability space, which is a mathematical model describing a random experiment and its possible outcomes.  In probability theory, probabilities are assigned to events, which are sets of possible outcomes. The probabilities need to satisfy a few axioms, such as non-negativity, normalization, and additivity. As the name suggests, the non-negativity axiom requires the probability of any event to be non-negative. The normalization axiom states that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes must equal one, reflecting the certainty that some outcome must occur. The additivity axiom stipulates that if two events are mutually exclusive (meaning they cannot both occur at the same time), the probability of either event occurring is the sum of their probabilities. Within the domain of probability theory, there are several different interpretations of probability, including the frequentist interpretation, the Bayesian interpretation, and the subjective interpretation. The frequentist interpretation, which is the most traditional, views probability as the long-run frequency of events in repeated trials of a random experiment. The Bayesian interpretation, on the other hand, views probability as a measure of an individual's rational degree of belief in the likelihood of an event. Finally, the subjective interpretation regards probability as a personal expression of uncertainty based on an individual's judgment and available information. Probability theory has numerous applications and is used in various fields. In statistics, for instance, it underlies the methods employed for making inferences and predictions from data. In engineering and science, probability theory is used for modeling and understanding the behavior of complex systems with randomness embedded within. In finance, it is widely used for risk management, asset valuation, and portfolio construction. In computer science, it plays a key role in the development of machine learning algorithms and the efficient design of algorithms that depend on randomness. In conclusion, the answer to \\"What is probability theory?\\" is a description of a mathematical theory concerned with understanding and quantifying randomness, uncertainty, and the likelihood of various outcomes in different situations. It is a fundamental aspect of numerous disciplines and has widespread applications throughout science, engineering, and social sciences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: colorado, eyrie, treetop, wilderness area, mountainous terrain  Why is \\"mountainous terrain\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Mountainous terrain\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. Firstly, it is essential to understand the natural habitat and behaviors of bald eagles to comprehend why this location is logical. Bald eagles are commonly found in North America, particularly in areas with access to water sources such as lakes and rivers, and often in regions with mountainous terrain. Thus, the geography associated with their habitat already connects them with mountainous landscapes.  Secondly, bald eagles are well-known for their exceptional eyesight, which is around four to eight times sharper than that of humans. This superior vision allows them to spot prey from great distances. In a mountainous environment, they can perch high up on cliffs or treetops, granting them an elevated position with a panoramic view of their surroundings. This allows them to see for miles around, searching for potential sources of food or observing their territory against predators or competing eagles. A higher vantage point in a mountainous terrain provides a clear line of sight with minimal obstacles, making it easier for them to spot prey or potential threats. Moreover, mountainous terrains provide ample nesting opportunities for bald eagles. They frequently choose to build their nests in large trees or rocky cliffs, which can also be found in high altitude regions. In these locations, eagles are better protected from ground predators, and their nests are less likely to be disturbed by human activities. Comparing the possible answers provided - \\"Colorado\\" is a specific state where bald eagles can indeed be found, but it doesn't categorically answer the question about where a bald eagle could see for miles around. \\"Eyrie\\" refers to an eagle's nest, which could be in a location that offers visibility for miles, but it isn't as inclusive as mountainous terrain. \\"Treetop\\" can be an advantageous viewpoint for bald eagles in many places but is also not as broad an answer as mountainous terrain. Lastly, \\"wilderness area\\" is a more general term for unexplored and undisturbed natural environments, which could be suitable for eagles, but doesn't necessarily entail a high vantage point offering expansive views. Therefore, \\"mountainous terrain\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense as it encompasses several key factors: the natural habitat of bald eagles, the elevation and vantage points required for their superior vision to work effectively, the security of a high altitude nesting location, and the general adaptability of bald eagles within mountainous regions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A taxi driver at the airport immediately gets word to Frank Ginetta (Kirk Douglas), who hides, armed with a gun, until he realizes that the visitor he's been warned about is actually his kid brother, Vinnie (Alex Cord). Frank happily welcomes his brother and takes him home, catching up on old times. But his wife, Ida (Irene Papas), reminds him that \\"they're going to send someone,\\" suggesting that perhaps Vinnie is the one. In a flashback, Frank recalls better times in New York, beginning with Vinnie's homecoming from military service and subsequent marriage to Emma Bertolo (Susan Strasberg). The father of the bride, Dominick Bertolo (Luther Adler) is a Mafia don, as is the groom's brother, Frank. And among those paying their respects as guests at the wedding are mob leaders like Egan (Murray Hamilton), Rotherman (Val Avery) and Levin (Alan Hewitt), who are the equals of Frank and Dominick in the New York region's organized crime. These capos within the Organization meet as a board to coordinate their business. The majority becomes increasingly unhappy with Frank's position, as he seems opposed to every new idea. Frank also dispenses justice on his own in the old Sicilian fashion, without seeking approval from the others. They, not being of Sicilian origin, are trying to leave behind the old traditional methods, such as when two of Frank's hit men kill a stool pigeon in the marshes and leave him tied to a chair with a canary stuffed in his mouth â as a warning to others who might talk too much. Frank still fondly remembers his father, who also was a mafioso who was assassinated in a hit. Vinnie is more of a businessman, and takes sides with the other board members in ventures they intend to pursue without his brother. Frank resents this, striking Vinnie for defying him and insisting to the board that Vinnie will have no part in what they have planned.

A fortnight before her eighteenth birthday, she picks an argument with her mother about her coming home late after the Christmas Party. Her mother tells her to stay within limits and arrive home in time. She is reluctant to abide by the rule and after much negotiation demands that she would listen to everything if she gets to meet her father.

Summarize this article: Ricciardo beat Rosberg by 0.169 seconds as Hamilton salvaged third after a troubled session in which he suffered an engine problem in final qualifying. The issue meant Hamilton only had one run to everyone else's two and could manage only 0.320secs off the pace. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel took fourth ahead of Force India's Nico Hulkenberg. Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix is live on the BBC Sport website and radio 5 live from 13:00 BST Hamilton had to be wheeled back to the Mercedes garage after his car lost power in the pit lane at the start of the top 10 shoot-out. But he was actually fastest of all in the first sector on his final lap of the session, after doing three build-up laps to try to get the ultra-soft tyres in the best condition. However, his pace dropped off in the final two sectors and he was left to rue yet another technical problem affecting his season. He is 43 points behind Rosberg in the championship, after problems affected his results in three of the first four races - all of which the German won - before the two crashed out together on the first lap in Spain two weeks ago. Hamilton said: \\"I don't really know what to say right now. It was a difficult qualifying but the good thing is I did get out to do a lap, so it is not as bad as some of the races have been. \\"I'm grateful to be up in third and I will do what I can to salvage what I can from today's result.\\" Ricciardo's pole time, the first of the Australian's F1 career, marks an impressive debut for a new, upgraded Renault engine which is worth an extra 30bhp. It is still not quite as powerful as Mercedes' engine but it is close enough for the excellence of the Red Bull chassis in slow corners to make up the difference. Allied to Ricciardo's liquid but exuberant attacking style, it made for a formidable combination around the demanding Monaco street circuit. \\"I knew coming into the weekend we had a strong chance and it looked good from Thursday,\\" Ricciardo said. \\"I feel like I have been driving well the last few races but hadn't got maximum reward. I came into the weekend feeling I could be in this position now. \\"It feels good. I have always enjoyed this place. We have a good package and it is nice to make the most of it.\\" Ricciardo has chosen an alternative strategy for the race - he will start the grand prix on the slower super-soft tyre, using the ultra-soft in the second stint. That means he can run longer before his pit stop and may be able to control the race even more easily than would anyway be the case from pole. Ricciardo's team-mate Max Verstappen crashed heavily early in the first session and will start 21st. The Dutchman, who won the last race in Spain on his debut for Red Bull, misjudged his entry to the second part of the Swimming Pool complex and clouted the barrier on the inside with his right front wheel. That broke his front suspension, and threw him across the track, over the kerbs of the second part of the corner and into the wall. The 18-year-old said: \\"Of course that is not the way you want to start for tomorrow. \\"I turned in a bit too early, broke the suspension and then couldn't recover from it. It's a case of misjudgement - that is all. A miscalculation - I just misjudged the grip a little bit.\\" Further down the field, McLaren's pre-event prediction that they would get both cars into the top 10 fell flat. Fernando Alonso did manage it, qualifying 10th, but team-mate Jenson Button was only 13th. McLaren were surprised by the pace of the Force India and Toro Rosso cars, who they had not expected to be so quick. Behind Hulkenberg, Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari was sixth, but will start 11th because of a five-place penalty for a gearbox change. Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz was seventh, ahead of Force India's Sergio Perez, the second Toro Rosso of Danill Kvyat and Alonso.

Burgundy color is a dark red or a red wine color which may look brown in some lighting. However, the suggested answer does not provide any insights into the hue, shade, or characteristics of burgundy as a color.

Lord God Almighty! Early in the morning, our song shall rise to Thee... As Greg sang and conducted the 4/4 pattern, which he could do in his sleep, his mind began to wander. Shouldn't he feel guilty about what he was thinking last night while kissing Cynthia on the couch? His actions had been within the bounds of acceptable behavior. He had nothing to be ashamed of in that regard. But what about his thoughts? It wasn't what he did with Cynthia--it was what he wanted to do. He didn't want to dishonor her or his commitment to God. But his feelings had been only natural. God created humans and gave them sexual desire. Wasn't it okay to want to have sex, as long as you didn't actually do it? Then he remembered the passage from Matthew 5:28. But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.

He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts.

Fast forward to almost a year since that fateful incident - it quickly spiraled into a massive sex scandal that not only dominated headlines but led to the end of Woods' marriage and a hiatus from his golfing career. While the conversations last year were centered around scandal, this year's Thanksgiving table talk may highlight themes of redemption. Tiger Woods acknowledged the hardships of the past year in a statement on his official website: \\"Obviously, this has been a very difficult year for me and my family, on and off the golf course.\\" Despite this public recognition, Woods has been tight-lipped when it comes to certain aspects of the saga, particularly declining to speak with Florida highway patrol troopers for a third time. This choice to maintain privacy in dealing with the Florida highway patrol troopers seems consistent with his overall approach to managing the repercussions of the sex scandal and his personal issues. Over the past year, Woods has taken slow, calculated steps towards repairing his public image and re-establishing his footing in both his personal life and professional pursuits. While Woods' management of the situation may be far from perfect, his efforts to address these issues openly, make amends, and push forward serve as a testament to his desire for redemption. For instance, he has sought therapy and reportedly devoted more time to being closer to his two children. As he gradually eases back into golf, Woods seems intent on rebuilding and redefining his brand and career. As time has passed, the focus has shifted from Tiger Woods, the unfaithful husband to Tiger Woods, the golf legend seeking redemption. Amidst the public scrutiny and personal turmoil, Woods has shown resilience in facing the consequences of his actions. This year's Thanksgiving conversations may revolve around Tiger Woods' journey and the challenges he has faced and overcome, proving that everyone deserves a chance at redemption. Will this road to redemption lead him back to the pinnacle of his golf career? That remains uncertain. However, what is evident is Woods' determination to navigate these murky waters and reintegrate himself into the world of golf, which continues to inspire a new round of conversations about growth, perseverance, and the power of human resilience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus Canberra Institute of Technology.In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available.

Plants are 'factories'. They make food from sunlight, water and things in the soil   and air. Plants feed all other living things. Animals can only use the sun's energy after it has been changed into food by plants. Some animals feed directly on plants, others eat smaller animals.

He belonged to the House of Wettin, a dynasty of German counts, dukes, princes, and rulers that date back to the 10th century. He was the son of John George I, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach, and his mother was Johannetta of Sayn-Wittgenstein. John William III was raised in the Lutheran faith, which had a significant impact on both his public and private life. In 1698, John William III succeeded his father, John George II, to become the Duke of Saxe-Eisenach, a state within the Holy Roman Empire. He ruled the duchy for 31 years until his death in 1729. The reign of John William III was characterized by his involvement in matters related to the administration and the growth of Saxe-Eisenach. He worked towards maintaining stability within the duchy and forging alliances with other states to ensure its progress and prosperity. During his tenure as Duke, John William III had several spouses. He married Amalie of Saxe-Weissenfels, Marie Christine Felizitas of Leiningen-Dagsburg-Falkenburg-Heidesheim of Nassau-Dietz, Christine Juliane of Baden-Durlach, and Magdalene Sibylle. These marriages resulted in the birth of multiple children, some of whom went on to hold important positions in various regions across the German states. His issue included Wilhelm Saxe-Weissenfels, Karoline, who became the Landgravine of Hesse-Philippsthal, Prince Anton Gustav, Princess Heinrich, and several others. Apart from being a skilled administrator, John William III was also interested in the arts, most notably music and theatre. He was an avid patron and supported many artists during his reign, contributing to the cultural life that distinguished Saxe-Eisenach. Upon his death on 14th January 1729 in Eisenach, John William III was succeeded by Wilhelm Heinrich, who continued the legacy of the House of Wettin in Saxe-Eisenach. John William III left a lasting impression on his duchy by maintaining stability, fostering alliances, and patronizing the arts. His life and reign stand as a testament to the significance of a robust and adaptable leadership in a changing world during the late 17th and early 18th centuries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But parents are usually the ones buying the phones. According to a July 2012 study, 56% of parents of children aged 8 to 12 have given their children a cellphone. The number goes up with age. The study just proves what many people already guessed: many kids, if not most, have their own cellphones. According to a recent survey, 12 is the magic number. It is the most common age for kids to get their first cellphone. But 13% of children aged 6 to 10 already have one. People who are for kids' using cellphones, including many parents, notice that cellphones help kids keep in touch with their friends and families. They believe that cellphones are an important tool in a dangerous situation. Kids can reach their parents at all times. And some people say having a cellphone helps teach kids to be responsible. Some cellphones designed for kids can be set to only work when parents approve  . What's the harm in that? But other people are worried about the health and safety effects of kids' cellphones. They believe that kids with cellphones will spend less time playing outside with friends, and that sending text messages or making phone calls while doing homework makes it difficult for kids to concentrate. They say that kids are spending too much time texting instead of talking to each other. \\"Our brains developed to communicate face to face,\\" says Gary Small, a teacher at the UCLA School of Medicine, in California. \\"A lot of this is lost with texting.\\" Another worry is cyber bullying  , which is on the rise as more kids use e-mail and text messages to communicate. And some experts are worried about possible health risks. They worry that energy waves produced by cellphones could be harmful to young people. To be safe, parents should not let them talk long on the phone.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person that plots with Denise? , can you please find it?   Terry asks his boss's wife Sylvia to his apartment after an office party and the two go to bed. Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window.  At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement. As he leaves, he sees Carl's distinctive truck parked outside and rushes in again. He is too late, however, for in the dark she has been stabbed fatally and dies in Terry's arms.  He takes refuge with Denise, who first seduces him and then offers him a chance to redeem himself. She wants revenge, and with him devises a plot to provoke Carl into another attack.

Der bestehenden Doppelmoral zwischen einerseits der strengen Regelung einer Substanz auf dem Gemeinschaftsmarkt zum Schutz der Umwelt und der Gesundheit der europäischen Bürger und andererseits der Möglichkeit, ohne Vorsichtsmaßnahmen und ohne jegliche Verpflichtung zur Aufklärung über die Gefahren damit einen freien Handel mit Drittländern zu betreiben, musste ein Ende gesetzt werden. Which language is this?","output":"This passage is written in German. Here is a detailed translation and analysis of the text: The passage discusses a double standard that exists with respect to the strict regulation of substances in the common market to protect the environment and health of European citizens, while on the other hand, allowing unrestricted trade with third countries without precautionary measures or any obligation for explaining the dangers involved. The key themes and components of the discussion are as follows: 1. Doppelmoral (double standard): This term points out the perceived hypocrisy in the regulation of substances within a shared market compared to trade with third countries. The passage argues that there should not be a double standard in these two scenarios. 2. Strenge Regelung einer Substanz (strict regulation of a substance): The passage highlights the strict regulations imposed on substances within the common market. These regulations are in place to protect the environment and health of European citizens. 3. Gemeinschaftsmarkt (common market): This term refers to the internal market within the European Union (EU) where goods, services, capital, and labor can move freely. This system has unified regulations that aim to promote competition and protect the interests of its citizens. 4. Schutz der Umwelt und der Gesundheit (protection of the environment and health): This phrase emphasizes the objective of the strict regulations within the common market, which is to safeguard the environment and health of the European citizens. 5. Handel mit Drittländern (trade with third countries): This refers to trade with countries that are not part of the EU's common market. The passage points out the contradictory position of having unrestricted trade with third countries, without any precautionary measures in place or an obligation to educate about potential dangers. 6. Vorsichtsmaßnahmen (precautionary measures): The text argues that precautionary measures should be taken when trading with third countries in the same way they are applied within the EU's common market. 7. Aufklärung über die Gefahren (explanation of the dangers): This phrase advocates for informing parties involved in trade with third countries about the potential hazards and risks associated with substances being traded, ensuring that they are aware of the possible consequences. In summary, the passage is in German and expresses concerns about the double standard in regulating substances within the EU's common market for the protection of the environment and health, while not applying the same level of precaution or transparency when trading with third countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds.  Which farm used fewer herbicide-resistant seeds? A:","output":"Valley farm used fewer herbicide-resistant seeds. In order to thoroughly understand the answer, let's take a closer look at the farming methods used by both farms. Hill farm relied on the use of genetically modified organisms (GMO) seeds. These seeds are created with desired traits such as higher yields, resistance to diseases, and resistance to herbicides. The main reason for using GMO seeds is to improve crop management, as they allow farmers to spray herbicides more efficiently without damaging the crops. In the case of Hill farm, genetically modified crops, which have been engineered to be herbicide-resistant, were chosen to achieve this goal. Valley farm, on the other hand, opted for organic methods and exclusively used non-GMO seeds. Organic farming follows strict regulations, ensuring that all materials used in the process are derived from natural sources and free of synthetic chemicals. Non-GMO seeds are those that have not been modified genetically but rather developed through traditional plant breeding techniques. While these non-GMO seeds might possess some natural resistance to certain pests and diseases, they would not have been specifically engineered to possess herbicide resistance as GMO seeds are. It is important to differentiate between organic and non-GMO farming practices. Both approaches avoid the use of GMOs, but organic farming also prohibits the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemically derived products. Valley farm followed organic farming methods, which means that they not only avoided using GMO seeds but also strictly abide by organic regulations for all aspects of their farming process. In summary, Valley farm used fewer herbicide-resistant seeds, as they chose non-GMO seeds in line with their organic farming approach. Hill farm, by using genetically modified seeds, purposefully opted for herbicide-resistant crops to improve crop management."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Great Simple n awesome\\" Answer:","output":"★★★★★"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the topic that this about: Reuters - U.S. stocks hovered around thebreak-even mark, bonds fell and the dollar recovered a bit onTuesday just hours before the Federal Reserve was expected toraise U.S. interest rates for the fifth time this year.","output":"The topic of this excerpt is focused on recent fluctuations within the U.S. financial markets, particularly surrounding the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates for the fifth time this year. In this situation, the U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar all experience notable changes as a result of this economic policy decision. To understand this topic in greater detail, we can break it down into several key components: 1. U.S. Stocks Market: The excerpt mentions that the stocks are hovering around the break-even mark, which indicates that investors may have mixed feelings about the effect of the upcoming interest rate hike on the stock market. A higher interest rate can lead to higher borrowing costs for companies, which in turn can lead to a decline in corporate earnings. This may put pressure on stock prices as investors worry about the potential negative impact on the companies they have invested in. Additionally, higher interest rates can also make fixed-income investments more attractive, potentially leading some investors to shift their money away from equities in search of safer, higher-yielding investments. 2. U.S. Bonds Market: Government bonds (such as treasury bonds) also face their own challenges arising from increasing interest rates. When interest rates rise, bond prices tend to fall – especially for bonds that have longer maturities. This is because as interest rates move higher, newly issued bonds will offer higher yields, which makes the older bonds less attractive to investors. As a result, the value of the older bonds falls on the market, leading to the decline in bond prices. 3. U.S. Dollar: The excerpt mentions that the dollar has recovered a bit ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates. This is because interest rates hikes can influence the strength of a currency. When interest rates rise in a country, it typically attracts more investors, leading to an increased demand for the domestic currency. This increased demand can result in a positive effect on that country's currency, causing its value to rise in relation to other currencies. Therefore, the expectation of a U.S. interest rate hike could lead to a recovery in the value of the U.S. dollar. 4. Federal Reserve's Decision on Interest Rates: The Federal Reserve, as the central banking system of the United States, plays a significant role in steering the country's monetary policy, regulating financial institutions, and maintaining the stability of the financial system. One critical aspect of its responsibilities is determining the appropriate interest rate levels, which can have far-reaching effects on the economy. In this scenario, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise U.S. interest rates for the fifth time this year. This decision is likely driven by the ongoing recovery of the U.S. economy, attempts to keep inflation in check, as well as aiming to prevent the economy from overheating. In summary, the topic of this excerpt is focused on the interconnected nature of the U.S. financial markets and the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates for the fifth time this year. As seen in the reaction of the stock, bond, and currency markets, increases in interest rates can create notable shifts in investor behavior, while also shaping the overall health and direction of the economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it.

Context: We gave Tiger swimming lessons in our plastic wading pool. I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other.

Article: (CNN) -- The hidden skeleton of a woman who had been missing for 28 years came to light when a contractor cleaned out a vacant home in the Town of Poughkeepsie, New York.      The gruesome find was uncovered behind a 'false wall' in the basement of the home the woman had shared with her late husband, police said.      Joann Nichols' remains were found inside a large plastic bin, inside a plastic bag and wrapped in a sheet, said Dr. Kari Reiber, the Dutchess County Medical Examiner.      \\"The body was skeletonized and the hands were tied with rope. ... A large area of the right side of the skull was also missing,\\" Reiber said.      Sealing the body in the plastic bin behind a false wall might have been enough to mask the smell as the body decomposed, she said.      Members of the medical examiner's office removed the body after it was found Friday and were able to identify Nichols through dental records. An autopsy showed the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head, according to Reiber.      Nichols, a 55-year-old former first-grade teacher at Gayhead Elementary School in Hopewell Junction New York, was reported missing on December 21, 1985, by her husband, James Nichols.      Police said he called in the report after his wife didn't show up for a hair appointment at a beauty parlor earlier that day. The next day the couple's vehicle was discovered in the parking lot of a shopping center in the town.      Police Chief Thomas Mauro said an intensive investigation followed, but the woman was never located. The case had remained open since 1985 and was reviewed annually by police, he said.      James Nichols was found dead in the home on December 27 after concerned neighbors called police because they had not seen him in several days. He was 82 and died of natural causes, police said.      Officers said they found the house filled with personal items, debris and garbage.      No one in Nichols' family came forward to claim his body or take control of his estate, so Dutchess County Commissioner of Finance Pamela Barrack was appointed as temporary administrator, according to Barrack's attorney, Kelly Traver.      \\"We were only able to locate two family members of Mr. Nichols, but they were not able to claim his body,\\" Traver said.      Nichols was buried by the Dutchess County Department of Community and Family Services in an unknown location, Traver said.      The Town of Poughkeepsie Police Department said it has not closed the case and will continue to examine the new forensic evidence.      \\"It's now safe to say James Nichols is a suspect in this case,\\" said police Capt. Paul LeComte.      The Town of Poughkeepsie surrounds the City of Poughkeepsie in southeastern New York State, about 70 miles north of New York City.

Sentence 1: After Izumi drew some early character designs for Hibiki , Izumi wanted to continue the story and start a manga with Maeda as the artist . Sentence 2: After Izumi drew some early character designs for Hibiki , Izumi wanted to continue the story and start a manga with Maeda as an artist . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"Yes, these two sentences convey the same general information but with a subtle difference in emphasis related to Maeda's role as the artist. In both sentences, Izumi is depicted as having drawn early character designs for Hibiki and then wanting to continue the story by starting a manga project with Maeda. In Sentence 1, the phrasing \\"with Maeda as the artist\\" suggests that Maeda is a specific, predetermined artist that has been chosen for this collaboration. It implies that Maeda has an established role or reputation as an artist, and Izumi is confident in their decision to work together on this project. In Sentence 2, the phrasing \\"with Maeda as an artist\\" places slightly less emphasis on Maeda's role in the project. It is more ambiguous about the nature of the collaboration and could imply that Maeda may be one of several artists considered for the project or that Maeda may be an aspiring artist or newly introduced to the project. This subtle difference in wording underlines the uncertainty over the exact nature of Maeda and Izumi's collaboration. In conclusion, both sentences convey similar information about Izumi's intentions to create a manga based on the character designs they initially drew for Hibiki. There is a subtle distinction in describing Maeda's involvement, with Sentence 1 emphasizing Maeda's established role as the artist and Sentence 2 being more ambiguous and potentially open to interpretations regarding Maeda's role in the project. Despite these slight differences, the overall message remains the same in both sentences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Here is a goal: To keep your basement from smelling musty, How would you accomplish this goal? Possible answers: i. use a dehumidifier during humid months. ii. use a humidifier during humid months.","output":"To accomplish the goal of keeping your basement from smelling musty, I would choose the option i. use a dehumidifier during humid months.  Here are the steps and justifications: 1. First, I would identify when the humid months are in your specific location, as these can vary depending on geographic location and climate. This is important to know because high humidity levels can contribute to the musty smell in basements. 2. Once I know the humid months, I would purchase a dehumidifier if you don't already own one. A dehumidifier is an appliance that helps to remove excess moisture from the air, which is critical in reducing the mustiness in basements. The justification for choosing a dehumidifier over a humidifier is that a humidifier adds moisture to the air, which would exacerbate the musty smell rather than alleviate it. Using a dehumidifier during humid months will keep the humidity levels in the basement in check and reduce the likelihood of mold and mildew growth. 3. I would then determine the appropriate size and capacity of the dehumidifier needed for your basement. This depends on the size of the basement and the extent of the humidity problem. The purpose of this step is to ensure that the dehumidifier is effective at removing the excess moisture from the air and properly managing the humidity levels. 4. Once the dehumidifier is in place, I would monitor and maintain it regularly, emptying the collected water as needed and keeping filters clean. Ensuring proper maintenance of the dehumidifier is important to keep it functioning optimally and to prevent any additional issues from arising due to a poorly maintained appliance. 5. Finally, I would also recommend taking steps to improve air circulation in the basement, such as using fans or opening windows if possible. Increasing airflow can help to prevent stale air and moisture buildup, which contributes to the musty smell. Proper ventilation is key to maintaining a fresh-smelling basement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Question: who is the sox star knuckleball pitcher? Movie title: Eight Men Out Movie plot: In 1919, the Chicago White Sox are considered the greatest team in baseball and, in fact, one of the greatest ever assembled to that point, behind their greatest star, Joe Jackson. However, the team's owner, Charles Comiskey, is a skinflint with little inclination to reward his players for a spectacular season. When gamblers \\"Sleepy\\" Bill Burns and Billy Maharg get wind of the players' discontent, they offer a select group of Sox â including star knuckleball pitcher Eddie Cicotte, who led the majors with a 29-7 win-loss record and has an earned run average of just 1.82 â more money to play badly than they would have earned by winning the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Cicotte's motivation for being involved was because Comiskey refused him a promised 10,000 should he win 30 games for the season. Cicotte was nearing the milestone until Comiskey ordered team manager Kid Gleason to bench him for 2 weeks (missing 5 starts) to rest the 35-year-old veteran's arm for the series. A number of players, including Chick Gandil, Swede Risberg, and Lefty Williams, go along with the scheme. Jackson is depicted as being not bright and not entirely sure what is going on. Buck Weaver, meanwhile, is included with the seven others but insists that he wants nothing to do with the fix. When the best-of-nine series begins, Cicotte (pitching in Game 1) deliberately hits Reds leadoff hitter Morrie Rath in the back with his second pitch in a prearranged signal to gangster Arnold Rothstein that the fix was on (Rothstein allegedly financed the fix). Cicotte then pitches poorly and gave up 5 runs in four inningsâfour of them in the 4th, including a triple given up to Reds pitcher Walter \\"Dutch\\" Ruether. He is then relieved by Gleason, though the Sox lose the first game 9â1. Williams also pitched poorly in Game 2, while Gandil, Risberg and Hap Felsch made glaring mistakes on the field. Several of the players become upset, however, when the various gamblers involved fail to pay their promised money up front. Chicago... The answer is:","output":"The Sox star knuckleball pitcher in the movie \\"Eight Men Out\\" is Eddie Cicotte. He was portrayed as one of the key players involved in the infamous 1919 Chicago White Sox scandal, also known as the \\"Black Sox Scandal.\\" Cicotte had an outstanding season with a 29-7 win-loss record and an earned run average of just 1.82. However, he becomes involved in the scheme to intentionally lose the World Series because team owner Charles Comiskey denied him a promised 10,000 bonus for winning 30 games that season. The movie \\"Eight Men Out\\" is based on the real-life events surrounding the 1919 Chicago White Sox, who were considered one of the greatest baseball teams at that time. Team owner Charles Comiskey's financial mistreatment of the players led to their dissatisfaction, which ultimately made them susceptible to the offers of gamblers Bill Burns and Billy Maharg. They end up conspiring with some of the players, including Eddie Cicotte, to intentionally lose the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for more money than they would have earned by winning. The movie presents a dramatized depiction of the events leading up to the scandal, the actual games, and the aftermath. Key characters in the story are Eddie Cicotte, Joe Jackson, Chick Gandil, Swede Risberg, Lefty Williams, and Buck Weaver. The film showcases the players' struggles as they become involved in the scheme and face the consequences of their actions. In summary, the Sox star knuckleball pitcher in the film \\"Eight Men Out\\" is Eddie Cicotte, who played a crucial role in the 1919 Black Sox Scandal. The movie provides an engaging portrayal of the real-life events and the personal struggles of the players involved in one of the most infamous scandals in the history of baseball. Considering the historical significance and the intriguing plot, \\"Eight Men Out\\" might be a worthwhile investment as it captures the attention of audiences interested in sports, history, and drama."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In central and northern Italy and in Flanders, the rise of towns that were to a degree self-governing stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations. Commercial cities on the shores of the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League, and the Italian Maritime republics such as Venice, Genoa, and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean.[V] Great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern France during the period, allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants. In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered, famously described in The Travels of Marco Polo written by one of the traders, Marco Polo (d. 1324). Besides new trading opportunities, agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in crop yields, which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand. Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, first in Italy and later in France and other countries. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, allowing risk to be shared among merchants. Accounting methods improved, partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping; letters of credit also appeared, allowing easy transmission of money.

Based on the given categories, this text fits best under \\"office holder.\\" The text mentions specific roles he holds - MLA and Minister - which are offices within the government. Therefore, this is the most appropriate category for the text. Here's my reasoning process: 1. The text is primarily about a person, Rajendra Darda, and his official roles, not about a company, educational institution, artist, athlete, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film, or written work. 2. Darda isn't described as a mean of transportation, so we can rule that category out. 3. Although Darda has a role in education, he himself is not an educational institution, so we can rule out that category.  Finally, the description of his work as an MLA and Minister matches the definition of an \\"office holder\\", which is generally understood to mean someone who is appointed or elected to an office and who makes decisions as part of that office. So, based on this analysis, the correct category for the text is \\"office holder\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This article: Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) is a set of four similar oil paintings by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders. Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres (150 by 230 in), the first painting was completed in 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Pančevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements. contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the painting that was completed in 1896 and presented to Patriarch Gerogije later that year?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The name of the painting that was completed in 1896 and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year is \\"Migration of the Serbs\\" (Seoba Srba)."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The Maritimes had a population of 1,813,102 in 2011.  - Homer Dodge Martin (October 28, 1836  February 12, 1897) was an American artist, particularly known for his landscape paintings. Examples of Martin's work are in many important American museums.  - Clarence Chatham Cook (September 8, 1828  June 2, 1900) was a 19th-century American author and art critic.  - James Renwick Brevoort ( July 20 , 1832 -- December 15 , 1918 ) was an American artist known for his landscapes painted in the Hudson River School style .  - Romanticism (also the Romantic era or the Romantic period) was an artistic, literary, musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850. Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature, preferring the medieval rather than the classical. It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, the aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography, education, and the natural sciences. It had a significant and complex effect on politics, and while for much of the Romantic period it was associated with liberalism and radicalism, its long-term effect on the growth of nationalism was perhaps more significant.  - The Hudson River School was a mid-19th century American art movement embodied by a group of landscape painters whose aesthetic vision was influenced by romanticism. The paintings for which the movement is named depict the Hudson River Valley and the surrounding area, including the Catskill, Adirondack, and the White Mountains; eventually works by the second generation of artists associated with the school expanded to include other locales in New England, the Maritimes, the American West, and South America. Overview. Neither the originator of the term \\"Hudson River School\\" nor its first published use has been fixed with certainty. The term is thought to have originated with the \\"New York Tribune\\" art critic Clarence Cook or the landscape painter Homer Dodge Martin.

Traditionally, the concertmaster of a symphonic orchestra plays what instrument?","output":"Traditionally, the concertmaster of a symphonic orchestra plays the violin, specifically the first violin. The concertmaster holds a vital and prestigious position within the orchestra, having a significant impact on the overall performance and quality of the ensemble. The concertmaster serves as the leader of the first violin section and is typically the most skilled and experienced violinist in the group. This role comes with various important responsibilities, such as ensuring the entire orchestra's sound coherence and interpreting the conductor's musical intentions.  Here are some additional duties of a concertmaster: 1. Leading the tuning process: Before the performance begins, the concertmaster initiates the process of tuning the entire orchestra. The oboist typically provides a reference pitch, usually the A440, and the concertmaster signals the other sections to follow suit. 2. Bowing coordination: The concertmaster is in charge of coordinating the bowing techniques and styles within the string sections to maintain a cohesive visual and auditory presentation. In collaboration with the section leaders and sometimes the conductor, the concertmaster may mark the bowings on their sheet music for the other players to follow. 3. Serving as the liaison between the conductor and the musicians: The concertmaster acts as a bridge between the conductor and the orchestra. They may clarify the conductor's instructions or address any concerns the musicians may have. 4. Representing the orchestra in public settings: The concertmaster often speaks on behalf of the ensemble during public events, award ceremonies, and other social engagements. 5. Taking on the role of a soloist: Occasionally, the concertmaster may be featured as a soloist in the orchestral repertoire. This can include violin concertos or pieces that highlight the talents of the first violinist. 6. Supporting the conductor during rehearsals: The concertmaster facilitates the rehearsal process by assisting with musical decisions, communicating the conductor's intentions, and helping maintain focus within the group. 7. Mentoring and supporting young musicians: In some instances, the concertmaster may also provide mentorship and guidance to young or new players in the orchestra, helping them acclimate to the ensemble setting. In conclusion, the concertmaster of a symphonic orchestra traditionally plays the first violin and is a critical figure within the musical ensemble. Serving as a leader, mediator, and artist, the concertmaster helps ensure a harmonious and cohesive performance, contributing significantly to the overall success of the orchestra."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: MSPs who act as aides to Scottish government ministers will no longer be able to sit on committees which scrutinise their bosses. Article:","output":"Title: New Policy Bars MSP Aides from Sitting on Committees Scrutinizing Their Bosses Introduction: Following recent developments, Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) who work as aides to Scottish government ministers are now prohibited from holding positions on committees that oversee their superiors. This new policy aims to promote transparency, accountability, and impartiality within the parliament. Body: Background In the past, it has been a common practice for MSPs to serve as aides to government ministers while also being members of parliamentary committees tasked with scrutinizing their bosses' actions and decisions. This arrangement raised concerns about the potential for conflict of interest and the ability of the committees to critically challenge and assess the government's performance. Reasons for the Change The decision to implement this policy comes as part of ongoing efforts to foster a more open and accountable political environment in Scotland. By limiting the involvement of MSP aides in the committees that scrutinize their bosses, it is believed that the transparency of the decision-making process will improve, thereby reducing possible biases and promoting public trust in political institutions. Effect on Committees Committees play a vital role in holding the government accountable for its actions and ensuring that policies align with the public's best interests. With the introduction of this new policy, these committees will be better equipped and more effective in carrying out their responsibilities. Eliminating potential conflicts of interest ensures that MSPs can maintain a more objective stance when evaluating and critiquing their superiors' initiatives. Benefits to the Public The public will also stand to gain from this reform as it increases confidence in the political system, ensuring that the scrutiny process is conducted without bias and in a manner that fosters integrity. In a time when skepticism and mistrust of political institutions are prevalent, policy changes such as these can help restore the public's faith in its governing bodies. Conclusion: Removing MSP aides from committees tasked with evaluating their bosses is a step in the right direction for promoting transparency and eliminating potential conflicts of interest in Scottish politics. By taking this initiative, the Scottish Parliament is sending a clear message that it is committed to upholding the principles of accountability and impartiality in its decision-making processes. This move will benefit both the government and the public by fostering a more transparent and effective system, bolstering the credibility of parliamentary committees, and increasing overall trust in political institutions."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Why do women like to sleep on men's chests? Are men superior to women? If so, in what ways? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"The task at hand appears to be analyzing the user's given queries and providing a detailed response to each of them. 1. \\"Why do women like to sleep on men's chests?\\" - This query is seeking a sociological and psychological clarification.  Step 1: Analyze the question – The question is asking about a preference that some women might have. The preference might not be universal, implying that the reasons could vary largely based on individual experiences and contexts. Step 2: Generate a response - Based on sociological and psychological insights, the reasons can include seeking comfort, security, and a sense of intimacy. The physical closeness and the rhythmic sound of the beating heart can create a calming effect and induce sleep. 2. \\"Are men superior to women? If so, in what ways?\\" - This question is requesting an evaluation of the superiority concept in a gender context.  Step 1: Analyze the question – It's important to note that the question implies a comparison between genders, potentially heading into a sensitive area hence should be handled with utmost care and respect for both genders.  Step 2: Generate a response - If we were to use the principles of human rights and equality, it's crucial to stress that no gender is superior to the other. Both men and women can excel and show competence and superiority in different areas based on their individual skills, capabilities, and preferences.  3. \\"Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?\\" - This question is prompting a linguistic and semantic analysis. Step 1: Analyze the question – A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words.

Today, we are going to talk about a problem that some big banks in America have. You know how you have a piggy bank at home to save your money? Well, these big banks are like huge piggy banks where many people keep their money. But, these banks have a problem. They can't figure out how to save themselves. Let's learn more about it. Once upon a time, many years ago, there was a big problem in America called the \\"Financial Crisis.\\" A lot of people lost their money because these big banks made some mistakes. Since then, the people who make the rules said, \\"Okay, banks. Now, you have to be more careful with the money and keep some extra just in case.\\" But guess what? Even though the banks promised to be more careful, they are still having trouble doing that. They can't seem to figure out the best way to save themselves if another big problem like the Financial Crisis happens again. One of the reasons is that these big banks are like giant puzzles. They have lots of different parts, and they do many different things. Some parts of the bank lend money to people, while others help people invest their money. Because these banks have so many pieces, it's hard for them to see the whole picture and make the right choices. Another reason is that these big banks sometimes forget to work together. They might not share their ideas about how to save money with each other. Or, they might even compete with each other, like kids playing a game. But in this game, everyone needs to work together to make sure they don't lose their piggy banks. Some smart grown-ups have been thinking about how to help these big banks. They have some ideas like making the banks keep more money in their piggy banks, or encouraging them to work together as a team. In the end, these big banks need to learn how to make better choices and work together to keep everyone's money safe. Just like how you take good care of your piggy bank, they need to learn how to take care of the big piggy banks too. We hope you enjoyed learning about America's big banks and their problems! Remember, even big banks can make mistakes, but if they work together and learn from their mistakes, they can become better at keeping everyone's money safe.

Q: Abstract: Although osteoarthritis (OA) generally is considered a disorder of mechanical origin, the common occurrence of chronic mononuclear cell infiltrates in the synovium in conjunction with immunofluorescent evidence for immune-reactant products in cartilage of surgical case specimens (knees, hips, and peripheral joints) has suggested the local involvement of immune processes in the arthritis. Further, the findings of polyarthropathy in the majority of these cases have indicated the propensity for a systemic disorder. Wide variations were noted in both synovial and cartilage immune changes, quite different to those found in rheumatoid arthritis, along with the frequent asymptomatology of the many joints involved. These features, with and without other causative factors, suggest that immune reactions of local and/or systemic origin occur at times in a population at risk for joint degradation.

Which movie is the following review about? FD2, despite some imaginative fatalities, is less a movie than a slick video game.","output":"The review is about the movie \\"Final Destination 2,\\" released in 2003 and directed by David R. Ellis. This film is a sequel to the successful 2000 horror film \\"Final Destination\\" directed by James Wong. The franchise is well-known for its unique premise, which revolves around a group of people who miraculously escape a catastrophic event due to a premonition experienced by one of them, only to be hunted down and killed off one by one in a series of graphic and often elaborate accidents as death seeks to correct the disruption to its design. \\"Final Destination 2\\" follows a similar pattern to the first film; the protagonist, Kimberly Corman (played by A.J. Cook), experiences a premonition of a catastrophic multiple vehicle pile-up on a highway. She is able to prevent a group of people from being involved in the accident, only to later discover that they were meant to die. Like its predecessor, the movie is primarily focused on the elaborate death sequences and the tension as the characters try to figure out how to cheat death. The review is critical of the film, comparing it unfavorably to a \\"slick video game\\" instead of a traditional film experience. This perspective can be due to the movie's insistence on showcasing imaginative and intricate fatalities. The movie heavily relies on these death scenes, which serve as the main attraction for the audience seeking thrills and suspense. While these set-pieces may be inventive and visually appealing, they do not entirely make for a cinematic experience that prioritizes character development, storytelling, and meaningful dialogue. Moreover, the \\"slick video game\\" comparison may extend to the movie's aesthetics, which are characterized by polished visuals, fast-paced editing, and exaggerated camera movements, resembling a frenetic energy commonly found in video games. The franchise continued to follow this format up until its fifth installment, \\"Final Destination 5,\\" released in 2011. Consequently, some viewers may find this approach lacking the substance or depth they expect from a full-length feature film. To summarize, the review is about the movie \\"Final Destination 2,\\" criticizing its emphasis on inventive death scenes and visual style over a more traditional narrative structure and character development. This approach, while potentially entertaining for fans of the genre, leaves the movie feeling more like a \\"slick video game\\" than a memorable film experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the answer: Which radioactive element, atomic number 89, is the first alphabetically in a list of naturally occurring elements?","output":"The radioactive element with an atomic number of 89, and the first alphabetically in a list of naturally occurring elements, is Actinium. Actinium is a silver-colored, radioactive, metallic element that was discovered in 1899 by the German chemist Friedrich Oskar Giesel. Its name is derived from the Greek word \\"actinos,\\" which means \\"beam\\" or \\"ray,\\" reflecting its radioactive nature. Actinium is found in trace amounts in uranium ores and thorium ores. It is usually produced as a byproduct of uranium decay in a nuclear reactor. Due to its scarcity on Earth, the element has limited applications, but it does serve as a neutron source and has shown potential uses in cancer treatment.  Actinium has 29 known isotopes, ranging from Ac-206 to Ac-234. The most stable isotope is Actinium-227, with a half-life of approximately 21.77 years. Actinium-227 decays to Francium-223 by emitting alpha particles, as well as to Thorium-227 by beta decay. These radioactive decay processes can produce hazardous levels of radiation, necessitating careful handling when working with Actinium. Due to its radioactive nature, Actinium's uses are primarily limited to research and specialized industrial settings. One of the most prominent applications of Actinium is in the production of neutrons. When Actinium is bombarded with neutrons, it produces great amounts of additional neutrons, which can be used in various experiments and processes. One of the most promising applications of Actinium is in the medical field. Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT) utilizes Actinium-225, an alpha-emitting isotope, to target and destroy specific cancer cells without damaging nearby healthy tissues. Actinium-225, due to its short half-life of approximately 10 days, decays quickly, minimizing long-term side effects. In summary, Actinium, with atomic number 89, is the first naturally occurring element alphabetically in a list of elements. It is a radioactive metal discovered in 1899, and while it has limited applications, it does serve as a neutron source in various processes and demonstrates promise in cancer treatment through Targeted Alpha Therapy. Given its radioactive nature, handling Actinium safely requires extreme care."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They come upon a strange circle of trees, each with a door representing a holiday. Jack opens the Christmas door and they're sucked in, landing in Christmastown. Jack is curious about everything he sees there, but finds it all delightful and wants to be part of it.Back in Halloweentown Jack calls a town meeting, where he describes what he saw in Christmastown.

He reveals that Damien is the Antichrist and that the box contains a warning and the means to kill Damien. As Morgan is unconvinced, Bugenhagen takes him to the ruin of Yigael's wall, showing him an ancient depiction of the Antichrist with Damien's face. Morgan is convinced, but the two are buried alive as a tunnel collapses.Seven years later, 12-year old Damien (Jonathan Scott-Taylor) is living with his uncle, industrialist Richard Thorn (William Holden) and his wife, Ann (Lee Grant) at a large house outside of Chicago, Illinois.

Morgan Stanley Sees Daylight Morgan Stanley enjoyed a two-day respite at the end of this week from the seemingly inexorable selling pressure that sent its shares down 83.2% since last autumn, but that doesn't mean the securities house is out of the woods. It may yet lose its independence, but it can afford to be a little discrminating in its choice of partners. After trading as low as 11.70 on Thursday, before the U.S. government began bailing out America's financial industry in earnest, Morgan Stanley closed the week at 27.21, up 44.66, or 20.7%, on Friday. Enthusiasm that Morgan Stanley (nyse: MS - news - people ) could avoid the fate of Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, was spurred Friday morning after Merrill Lynch (nyse: MER - news - people ) analyst Guy Moszkowski said the likelihood had increased that it would link up with commercial bank Wachovia (nyse: WB - news - people ). Wachovia's shares soared 29.3%, or 4.25, to 18.75. But Wachovia isn't the only hope. Morgan Stanley seems to be in discussions with anyone who will listen, and, Reuters quoted a source as saying, the firm is also trying to remain independent. Still , Chief Executive John Mack of Morgan Stanley has reached out to China's Citic Group, Wachovia, and Singapore Investment, one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds, said the source. As have other leading Wall Street brokers over the past week, Morgan Stanley has been feeling the pain as its stock plunged on investor fears about the credit crisis that began in America's subprime mortgage market. The good news is that regulators, law enforcement and major pension funds declared war on short-sellers on Thursday as they tried to put a stop to the panic gripping Wall Street, sparking a rally in shares. (See  War On Shorts.) Attorney General Andrew Cuomo of New York said he would use the state's Martin Act to pursue criminal fraud charges against short-sellers found to be manipulating shares in major financial institutions, including Lehman Brothers (nyse: LEH - news - people )American International Group (nyse: AIG - news - people ), Goldman Sachs (nyse: GS - news - people ) and Morgan Stanley. Reuters contributed to this article. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Morgan Stanley is a big company that helps people with their money. Recently, it was facing some problems, and people were worried that it might go out of business, like another company called Lehman Brothers.

(Associated Press)      MANILA, Philippines (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump has called Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte and expressed Washington's commitment to their treaty alliance and his interest in developing \\"a warm, working relationship,\\" a Filipino official said Sunday.      Presidential spokesman Ernie Abella said Trump mentioned he was looking forward to visiting the Philippines in November to attend an East Asia summit that Duterte will host with several world leaders and that Trump invited Duterte to visit the White House.      \\"The discussion that transpired between the presidents was warm, with President Trump expressing his understanding and appreciation of the challenges facing the Philippine president, especially on the matter of dangerous drugs,\\" Abella said in a statement.      A White House statement described late Saturday's call as \\"very friendly\\" and said the U.S.-Philippine alliance \\"is now heading in a very positive direction.\\"      Abella's remarks reflect the friendlier attitude Duterte has taken with Trump versus the antagonistic stance he had toward President Barack Obama, who he once asked to \\"go to hell\\" for criticizing the Philippine leader's bloody anti-drug crackdown. During Obama's final months in office, the Philippine president moved to build closer economic ties with China and Russia while repeatedly threatening to end his nation's longstanding military alliance with the U.S.      Duterte's apparent dislike for Obama began when the U.S. State Department expressed concern over his drug war — which has left thousands of suspects dead — and asked Philippine government officials to take steps to stop extrajudicial killings.      At one point Duterte suggested he may even move to abrogate a 2014 defense agreement that allows U.S. military access to five Philippine military camps.      He has walked back most of those threats but has proceeded with his efforts to align closer with China.      On Sunday, three Chinese navy ships, including a guided-missile destroyer and a guided-missile frigate, were welcomed in Davao city, Duterte's southern hometown, by officials, including presidential daughter and city Mayor Sarah Duterte, military officials said.      Asked if the rare Chinese naval visits were a sign that Duterte was backing away from Washington, Department of National Defense spokesman Arsenio Andolong said: \\"We are not veering away from the U.S. but rather we are expanding our relations with our fellow nations in the global community.\\"      Abella said without elaborating that concern over North Korea also came up in Trump's talk with Duterte.      Duterte suggested in a news conference Saturday that the Trump administration should back away from an intensifying standoff with North Korea, not in surrender, but to avoid risking a nuclear holocaust that could smother Asia.      \\"It would be good for America to just restrain a little bit and if I were President Trump, I'll just back out, not really in surrender and retreat, but just to let the guy realize that, 'Ah, please do not do it.'\\" Duterte said.      Washington, he said, should not play into provocations of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.      \\"It behooves upon America, who wields the biggest stick, just to really be prudent and patient. We know that we are playing with somebody who relishes letting go of his missiles and everything,\\" Duterte said. ||||| (CNN) President Donald Trump invited his polarizing Philippines counterpart to the White House during a phone call in which the two leaders discussed North Korea.      Trump and President Rodrigo Duterte had a \\"friendly discussion\\" Saturday that also addressed regional security in Southeast Asia and the Philippines' drug war, the White House said in a statement.      The statement did not provide details on when or if Duterte would visit Washington, but it said Trump is looking forward to his Philippines trip in November.      This man compares himself to Hitler      This man compares himself to Hitler 01:21      This man compares himself to Hitler      The invitation spurred questions about whether the White House should extend a visit to a leader who has been much criticized for alleged human rights abuses, such as extrajudicial killings in Duterte's war on drugs.      Priebus agreed that human rights matter but he argued that the North Korean problem takes precedence.      \\"The issues facing us developing out of North Korea are so serious that we need cooperation at some level with as many partners in the area as we can get to make sure we have our ducks in a row,\\" he said. \\"We have got to be on the same page.\\"      Escalating tensions with North Korea      The US military has moved an aircraft carrier strike group into the region, docked a powerful nuclear submarine in South Korea and staged large military drills with South Korea and Japan.      Trump said Thursday there was \\"a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea,\\" but added he would prefer a diplomatic resolution.      'Dangerous toys'      Before his phone call with Trump, Duterte said the world would suffer if the United States and North Korea -- led by Kim Jong Un -- could not defuse the situation.      \\"Everybody suffers, only because two nations are playing with their dangerous toys. It behooves a certain America, because it is the more responsible country. I'm sure President Trump by now must also be cautioning his military to just maybe hang on and not to start something they cannot control,\\" Duterte said.      Duterte urged the US to be patient and practice restraint.      \\"We know that we are playing with somebody who relishes in letting go his missiles. I would not want to go into his mind because I really don't know what is inside. But he is putting Mother Earth, the planet, on the edge,\\" he said.      In a statement issued after the phone call, the White House said Trump invited Duterte to the White House to discuss the US-Philippines alliance \\"which is now heading in a very positive direction.\\"      \\"They also discussed the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world.\\"      Duterte's tirades      Duterte's term has been marked with accusations of human rights violations. Since he became President last year, he has encouraged the extrajudicial killings of thousands of citizens suspected of dealing or using drugs.      He took power in June 2016 and waged an all-out \\"war on drugs,\\" which killed some 6,000 people in his first six months.      In December, he admitted to having suspected criminals killed when he was mayor of Davao City.      Duterte's tirades have raised many eyebrows since he took office.      While on a trip to China in October, he said \\"America has lost,\\" and that he has realigned himself with China's \\"ideological flow.\\" He later clarified his comments about relations with the United States, saying he was rather pursuing a \\"separation of foreign policy\\" from the US.      Obama had previously raised concerns about Duterte's controversial war on drugs and his human rights record.      Photos: Rodrigo Duterte has said some outrageous things.

Neither his girlfriend and former student, Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis), nor his wife's former FBI partner, Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), believe any of his wild theories.After doing some digging, Michael discovers that Oliver's real name is William Fenimore, and that he built a pipe bomb and used it to try to blow up a postal office in Kansas when he was 16.

Words like 'enthusiastic,' 'captivating,' 'impressive,' and 'engaging,' for instance, would more likely indicate a positive review, while terms such as 'lackluster,' 'disappointing,' 'forgettable,' or 'confusing' imply a negative evaluation. Furthermore, it's crucial to consider factors such as possible biases, personal preferences, and narratives surrounding a movie, as these can also influence a reviewer's take on a film. Sometimes, even in a positive review, specific aspects of the movie may have been seen as less appealing (or vice versa for a negative review).  Therefore, while the term \\"enthusiastic\\" within the given review implies that the film has been reviewed positively, it is important to examine the review in its entirety to form a comprehensive understanding of the reviewer's stance. This approach will enable you to gauge the overall sentiment of the review and whether the movie was appreciated or criticized by this particular reviewer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The thinner the wire, the more resistance it offers.  Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are greater or less ):   Robin is using aluminum foil to make small cylinders. A foil cylinder of diameter 10cm likely has greater or less resistance than a foil cylinder of diameter 1cm? The answer is:","output":"greater Here is an explanation on how I arrived at the answer: The question's statement indicates that the thinner wire has more resistance. Resistance in this context is affected by the physical dimensions of the material - here it is wire (or in this case, an aluminum foil cylinder).  So, when Robin is using the aluminum foil to make small cylinders, a foil cylinder of a smaller diameter (thinner) will offer more resistance. Since our 1cm diameter cylinder is thinner than our 10cm diameter cylinder, it will offer less resistance than the 10cm one. Therefore, a foil cylinder of diameter 10cm has greater resistance than a foil cylinder of diameter 1cm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

While air conditioning units are often the go-to solution, there are several additional strategies that you can employ alongside your air conditioning system to ensure that your home stays cool and energy-efficient. In this article, we discuss these strategies, which include using fans and ice, creating a cross-breeze with multiple fans, and selecting an adequately powerful air conditioning unit. Turning on a Fan Fans, either standing or mounted on the ceiling, are often underestimated when it comes to keeping a room cool. While they do not actually lower the temperature of the room, fans circulate the air and create a breeze that can make it feel cooler. This is because the air movement allows sweat to evaporate more quickly, which helps our bodies to regulate temperature more effectively. Using a fan in combination with your air conditioning system can be beneficial in two ways. First, the fan can evenly distribute the cool air produced by the air conditioner, ensuring that every part of the room feels comfortable. Second, using a fan can help you save energy and reduce energy bills, as circulating the air allows you to set your air conditioner to a higher temperature without sacrificing comfort. Placing Ice Cubes in Front of a Running Fan While a fan on its own can make a room feel cooler, you can further enhance its cooling effect by placing a bowl of ice cubes or a frozen gel pack in front of the running fan. As the ice melts, the fan will blow the cool air generated from the melting process around the room. This can create an additional cooling sensation and is an especially useful technique if you do not have air conditioning or are trying to reduce your use of it. Creating a Cross-Breeze with Two Fans A cross-breeze is a simple yet effective strategy to cool a room, as it involves using two fans to create air movement in multiple directions. To implement this tactic, place one fan near a window or doorway that is open to the outside, and the other fan on the opposite side of the room, near another open window or doorway. This setup will encourage fresh, cooler air from outside to enter the room, while simultaneously pushing stale, warm air out. This technique is most successful when used in conjunction with other cooling strategies mentioned earlier, as it helps to distribute the cool air produced by the air conditioning unit more effectively. Choosing a Powerful Air Conditioning Unit When selecting an air conditioning unit, it is crucial to choose one that is properly sized and powerful enough to cool the area of your home that you intend it to serve. Underestimating the cooling capacity needed can result in an inefficient system that struggles to lower the temperature and wastes energy in the process. To ensure you select the right air conditioning unit, consult an HVAC specialist to help you measure the square footage of the space you need to cool and determine the cooling capacity needed in BTUs (British Thermal Units). This will help you make an informed decision and choose an air conditioning system that matches your cooling needs. Conclusion When it comes to keeping your home cool during the hot summer months, combining different cooling strategies such as fans, ice, cross-breezes, and air conditioning units can lead to a more comfortable and energy-efficient living space. Not only will these techniques help keep your home pleasant, but they can also lower your energy consumption and save you money in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a question about the following article: In the latter half of the 16th century, the Sultanate of Demak, the dominant power in the island of Java, disintegrated into several independent states. At the turn of the 17th century, three of these states emerged as the leading powers: the Sultanate of Banten in western Java, the Sultanate of Mataram in inland central Java, and the Duchy of Surabaya in coastal eastern Java. Mataram consolidated its power by absorbing other principalities: Pajang in c. 1588, Demak , Madiun  and Kediri . Following Mataram's unsuccessful westward expedition against Banten in about 1597, Mataram turned its expansion eastward, into areas under the influence of Surabaya. The Duchy of Surabaya was centered roughly in today's city of Surabaya in the northern coast of eastern Java. It was a wealthy and powerful state, and the city was an important port in the trade route between Malacca and the Spice Islands., The city was approximately 37 kilometres  in circumference, and was fortified by canals and cannons. Allied with the nearby state of Pasuruan, the Duchy expanded its influence throughout the eastern part of Java in the beginning of the 17th century. By 1622, it was in control of Gresik and Sedayu in eastern Java. It was also the overlord of Sukadana and Banjarmasin in southern Borneo. More doubtful reports said it might have also extended its influence to Pasuruan, Blambangan, the Brantas valley region, and Wirasaba. Other than these, Surabaya was also allied with Tuban, Malang, Kediri, Lasem, all in eastern Java, as well as Madura off the northern coast.

Write an article that answers the following question: What happened second: Golden Horde attacked Poland or Volhynia was assigned to Liubartas?","output":"Title: The Sequence of Events: Golden Horde's Attack on Poland and Liubartas's Rule Over Volhynia Introduction In medieval Eastern European history, two significant events captured the attention of scholars and history enthusiasts alike: the Golden Horde's attack on Poland and Liubartas's reign over Volhynia. Although both took place in the mid-14th century, it is essential to pinpoint which event happened first. To answer this question, let's delve into the historical records and piece the events in their chronological order. The Golden Horde's Attack on Poland In the 13th century, the Mongol Empire, led by Genghis Khan, began conquering vast territories. One of its division, the Golden Horde, under the rule of Batu Khan, subdued various Slavic groups. The Golden Horde first invaded Poland in 1241 during the reign of Bolesław V The Chaste and conquered Kraków, Poland's capital at the time. In the decades that followed, the Horde orchestrated numerous attacks on Polish territories, attempting to weaken and conquer it. The last substantial invasion took place in 1340, under the command of Ozbeg Khan. This invasion prompted Casimir III, known as Casimir the Great, who ruled Poland from 1333-1370, to bolster the country's defensive capabilities. The Horde's attack forced Poland to abandon, at least temporarily, its interest in the neighboring region of Volhynia. Liubartas's Reign Over Volhynia Meanwhile, Volhynia, a historic region straddling modern-day Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus, experienced significant internal strife and political turmoil throughout the 13th and 14th centuries. At the time, the Mongol Empire began to weaken, and the Golden Horde gradually lost its influence over various territories, including Volhynia. Many rulers sought to gain power and control over the resource-rich area. Liubartas was one such ruler who sought to control Volhynia. Born to Gediminas, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Liubartas inherited the western part of the region after the Treaty of 1320. His brother, Algirdas, inherited the eastern part of Volhynia. However, the decisive moment when Liubartas officially became the ruler of all of Volhynia occurred in 1340 when his brother Algirdas transferred the eastern part of the region to him, uniting Volhynia under Liubartas's rule. Sequence of Events Given these historical contexts, it becomes evident that the Golden Horde's attack on Poland in 1340 happened before Liubartas's full ascension to power over the united Volhynia. The invasion forced Poland temporarily to shift its focus from Volhynian territory, providing a favorable environment for Liubartas to establish control and unite the region under his rule. Thus, the Golden Horde's attack on Poland occurred before Volhynia was assigned to Liubartas in that same year. Conclusion While both the Golden Horde's attack on Poland and Liubartas's full acquisition of Volhynia took place in 1340, historical records indicate that the former event preceded the latter. This timeline clarifies a substantial moment in Eastern European history and sheds light on the complex political climate of the era. Understanding these chronological intricacies helps to comprehend the context and consequences of these pivotal events in the region's history."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Article: China Daily: As China comes down from a travel rush during the seven-day holiday for National Day, people called for a return of the Labor Day Golden Week holiday as a way to ease  the travel peak. By Friday, 79 million passengers were expected to have used the railways up about 8 percent over last year. Waterways had shipped around 2 million, a rise of about 17 percent on last year, www. cntv. cn, the website of China Central Television, said on Saturday. As large numbers of tourists _ scenic spots around China, it caused huge crowds and many complaints. The Forbidden City in Beijing has long been a big draw for travelers. On Tuesday alone, the museum reported, it received more than 180,000 visitors, about six times higher than a regular day. According to China Central Television, restless visitors demanded their money back from the tourism committee, and police were sent to help deal with the problem. The Beijing-HongKong-Macao expressway, the Shanghai-Kunming expressway and the route from Beijing to Kunming saw large increases in traffic on Saturday, according to www. cntv. cn. \\"As there are only two long holidays in the country and paid leave is not well carried out by employers , people have limited chances for travel\\", Dai Bin, the director of China Tourism Academy, said in a report by Beijing Times on Saturday. \\"The travel rush during the 'Golden Week' holidays happens because people do not take long journeys during shorter holidays\\", said Liu Simin, a researcher with the China Academy of Social Sciences, in a report by Beijing Times on Saturday. Liu said that now the most important task is to ease the pressure from the huge numbers of tourists. When the Labor Day Golden Week holiday came to an end in 2007, a chance to travel was reduced. In 2008, the government shortened the Labor Day Golden Week holiday, usually lasting from May 1 to May 7, to three days and added three other short vacations to the list.

It was to those under her command that she should always appear firm , confident and strong . It was her commanding officer she should go to with her problems and complaints . Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why did the narrator always go to her officer ?","output":"The passage does not explicitly state the reason why the narrator always goes to her commanding officer with her problems and complaints; however, we can infer some reasons by analyzing the provided context. One possible reason the narrator goes to her officer is to maintain a sense of decorum and hierarchy within her unit or team. By bringing her concerns and issues to her commanding officer instead of discussing them with those under her command, she is respecting the chain of command and ensuring that the approved protocol is followed. This approach demonstrates her understanding of her role in the organizational structure and helps maintain discipline within the team. Another possible reason behind this decision is the narrator's belief in the importance of appearing firm, confident, and strong to those she commands. To achieve this goal, she refrains from discussing her struggles or complaints with her subordinates, as doing so might undermine their confidence in her leadership ability. Instead, she relies on her commanding officer for support and guidance, which is a more appropriate outlet for addressing her concerns and maintaining her composed demeanor. Lastly, turning to her commanding officer with her problems and complaints could be a means for the narrator to seek valuable feedback, guidance, and mentorship. The commanding officer's experience and seniority within the organization make them a vital resource in helping the narrator address her concerns, navigate professional challenges, and grow in her role as a leader. In summary, the narrator always goes to her commanding officer with her problems and complaints in order to uphold the chain of command, preserve her image as a strong leader in front of her subordinates, and seek valuable guidance and support from a more experienced and higher-ranking individual within the organization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors and, in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Context_2 : Darwin: The Life of a Tormented Evolutionist is a biography of Charles Darwin by Adrian Desmond and James Moore. It is considered one of three scholarly biographies of Darwin, along with \\"Charles Darwin: The Man and His Influence\\" (1996) by Peter J.

Between 30 and 40 fossil specimens have been identified, all collected from the Tiaojishan Formation, which dates to the middle Jurassic period, 160.89–160.25 Ma ago. The type species, \\"D. modularis\\", was described in February 2010. \\"D. modularis\\" was the first known pterosaur to display features of both long-tailed ('rhamphorhynchoid') and short-tailed (pterodactyloid) pterosaurs, and was described as a transitional fossil between the two groups. Two additional species, \\"D. linglongtaensis\\" and \\"D. robustodens\\", were described from the same fossil beds in December 2010 and June 2011, respectively. Context_4 : Jenny was an orangutan kept in captivity in London Zoo during the 1830s, most notable for being encountered by the biologist Charles Darwin in March 1838.

Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them.

When asked about Phillips' imitation of his style, Dave Matthews said: \\"More power to him, I don't mind,\\" and added \\"He should kick my ass, [then] maybe I can retire and he can take over my band.\\" Mentor Stevie Nicks said Phillips would have been good enough to join Fleetwood Mac back in 1975, after his performance of Jonny Lang's Still Rainin, which he received a standing ovation from the judges.

Christmas-Tree Sales Spread Good Tidings OAK PARK, Ill.—Sandhill Christmas Trees here sells fewer than 5,000 firs in a typical holiday season but this year it sold nearly 6,000, many as last-minute deliveries to retailers who had underestimated demand. John Brussock, center, with his father, James Brussock, left, and friend Ben Emmrich at Sandhill Christmas Tree Farm in Marquette County, Wis. \\"Dad would be proud that we went out and had a record year,\\" said John Brussock, who at age 24 just completed his rookie season as chief executive of Sandhill after taking over for the founder, his father, James Brussock, who died earlier this year. Sandhill's success mirrors that of tree farms across the U.S. Precise numbers won't be available until late winter, when the National Christmas Tree Association completes its annual survey. But after two flat seasons, tree-farm associations in the biggest-producing states say members are estimating an industry-wide sales jump in the mid- to high single digits over a year ago, with some growers reporting larger gains. \\"At times during the season, we had growers reporting increases of 20% to 40%,\\" said Brian Ostlund, executive director of the Pacific Northwest Christmas Tree Association, whose territory includes Oregon, the nation's largest producer of Christmas trees. With annual sales under 2 billion, the Christmas tree is a small but nevertheless telling economic indicator because when incomes fall, people tend to forgo buying trees, economists say. \\"Better sales would be a good supporting indicator for better consumer sentiment,\\" said Michael Swanson, agricultural economist for Wells Fargo & Co. At Sandhill, this year's sales boost also reflects a son's determination to embrace a family business his father called \\"an out-of-control hobby.\\" Like many Christmas-tree farmers, the elder Mr. Brussock got into it as a sideline. The owner of a kitchen-remodeling business in Oak Park, a Chicago suburb, James Brussock decided about 30 years ago to start growing Christmas trees on 200 acres he owned in southern Wisconsin. The project required endless toil—planting, fertilizing, shearing—with no quick payoff because the first crop of trees took eight years to mature. Even after sales took off, the burly, white-bearded Mr. Brussock limited the operation's growth so it wouldn't interfere with his day job. Yet growing and selling Christmas trees gave him great pleasure. A devoted outdoorsman, he loved working fields of Frasers and Balsams. Selling the trees from the asphalt parking lot of his remodeling firm, he also treasured the local renown it brought his family. \\"Our kids just know the Brussocks as the Christmas tree people,\\" said Lisa Hendrix, an Oak Park schoolteacher who has been buying Brussock trees for years. Even as a toddler, John Brussock worked the farm and sold trees alongside his dad. But after graduating with an economics degree from the University of Wisconsin, he took a job selling commercial real estate in Chicago. In 2008, his father manned the tree lot alone. John, missing the outdoors and physical work, returned the next year and started an online sales business. His father was delighted. \\"I don't know that there's anything better in life than working with your son,\\" Mr. Brussock said in interviews for an article published last year in The Wall Street Journal. In early 2009, the elder Mr. Brussock had been diagnosed with bile-duct cancer. Doctors predicted it would kill him before Labor Day. \\"I want another Christmas,\\" his wife, Kitty, recalled him saying. James and John worked the sales lot together through last year's holidays. This summer, they tended trees side-by-side in the fields. \\"I was shearing with him, and that is hot, strenuous work,\\" said John Brussock. His father died Sept. 4 at the age of 65. The younger Mr. Brussock intends to make a full-time career out of Christmas trees, as his father had dreamed of doing. Thanks to his dad, John said, \\"Christmas trees are my passion.\\" With a farm planted with 75,000 trees, John Brussock aims to more than triple Sandhill sales over the next few years by increasing both Internet and wholesale revenue. \\"There are always new people opening Christmas tree lots, and we have a reputation for quality trees,\\" he said. Before his father died, John Brussock peppered him with questions on things like the per-acre formula for spraying herbicide. But some business details got lost. One recent day, Mr. Brussock wondered where his father stored the spare tire for a tree-hauling trailer. He reached for his cellphone to call his dad, only to remember he was now on his own.

Given the following passage  \\"As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

Given the question: Information:  - Soukous (from French \\"secouer\\", \\"to shake\\") is a popular genre of dance music from the Congo Basin. It derived from Congolese rumba in the 1960s and gained popularity in the 1980s in France. Although often used by journalists as a synonym for Congolese rumba, both the music and dance currently associated with soukous differ from more traditional rumba, especially in its higher tempo, longer dance sequences. Notable performers of the genre include African Fiesta, Papa Wemba and Pépé Kallé.  - Pépé Kallé, sometimes written as Pepe Kalle (November 15  November 30 1998) was a soukous singer, musician and bandleader from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Since you've taken over the responsibility for verbally confirming trades booked to John Arnold, Larry May, Mike Maggie, Dutch, and Andy Zipper, I just wanted to clarify that part of this responsibility includes clearing the trades in Deal Capture/Structure. When you verbally confirm a deal, you have to click on Counterparty and Verify the deal, noting with whom you verballed. If you don't do this, the confirms group has no way of knowing whether or not you've verbally confirmed the deal. Also, in keeping with our global standards for sending out confirmations, verballing should be done on Trade Day -  although we give you until noon on T+1 before sending out your deals. At that point, any trades that are not verbally confirmed will be generated and sent. (This does not preclude the need for you to follow up with deals not yet verballed). The exception to this is, of course, if you have identified an economic discrepancy and \\"Actioned\\" the deal as such in TAGG - in this case we will wait until the Action has been cleared in TAGG.

Disadvantages of electric traction include high capital costs that may be uneconomic on lightly trafficked routes; a relative lack of flexibility since electric trains need electrified tracks or onboard supercapacitors and charging infrastructure at stations; and a vulnerability to power interruptions. Different regions may use different supply voltages and frequencies, complicating through service. The limited clearances available under catenaries may preclude efficient double-stack container service.

A couple of fumbling Florida fugitives led police on a wild river chase as they tried to escape from the cops by paddling away in a canoe. The hapless pair  tried to flee cops by floating their way to freedom down the Withlacoochee River. They almost got away with it were it not for a police power boat that caught up with the dumb duo some nine miles downstream. The paddlers were nabbed and brought back to dry land where they were placed into police custody. Fugitives: Garrett Eure, and Jessie Bryant, both 23, attempted to flee cops by floating their way to freedom. You too: Cassandra Zabriskie, 21, Eure's girlfriend was also arrested. Garrett Eure, 23, of Gainesville, was wanted for failure to appear on an escape charge and the other fugitive was Jessie Bryant, 23, of Fort Pierce, who was wanted on various charges. For a time,the fugitives managed to elude authorities for about five hours as they used wooden paddles to sail down the river for nine miles. The U.S. Marshals Service contacted the Madison County Sheriff’s Office on Monday to say that Eure was living in Madison. Investigators determined that Eure was living in a house in Lee with Bryant, who was wanted in St. Lucie County for charges of armed burglary coupled with assault and battery by strangulation. A couple of floaters: The pair got nine miles down the Withlacoochee River. Dumb couple: Garrett Eure, 23 and his girlfriend Cassandra Zabriskie, 21, also of Gainesville were both arrested. She was released on bail whilst Euro is being held on 100,000 bond. Bryant was arrested on warrants for burglary and battery. Zabriskie was also arrested on charges of resisting arrest without violence. Eure’s girlfriend, Cassandra Zabriskie, 21, also of Gainesville, was with them. Eure and Bryant suspected that authorities had found them and they ran to the Withlacoochee River, climbed into a canoe and tried to escape. Officials used dogs to track the fugitives on foot and then started up a motorboat to chase them on the river. The small blue canoe the men used was filled with a cooler and several backpacks, said Russell Williams, a freelance photographer who was present during the arrests. As dumb as each other: The two fugitives Garrett Eure, 23, were living with his girlfriend, Cassandra Zabriskie,21, pictured here. Getaway vehicle: The two men tried to run, or rather, paddle from the law in a two-man canoe. The police soon caught up with them nine miles down the river. Mr Williams added that deputies at the scene said they had been to Zabriskie’s house multiple times, and she had told them her boyfriend was not there. According to Florida Department of Corrections records, Eure was in prison until October 2013 on several Lake County charges, including armed burglary and grand theft. Both men have quite the wrap sheet. In March 2013, the Gainesville Police Department arrested Eure for escaping while on work release and returned him to state custody. Bryant meanwhile, was incarcerated from 2009 to 2012 on charges out of St. Lucie County, including burglary, credit card fraud, organized fraud, fleeing a law enforcement officer and grand theft of a motor vehicle. The three were taken into custody by deputies and taken to the Madison County jail. Zabriskie was released on 540 bond on Monday night, but Bryant and Eure remained at the jail on Tuesday on no bond and 100,000 bond respectively.

Write an article with the title: \\"Tip Bankers Like Waiters\\"","output":"Title: Tip Bankers Like Waiters Introduction: In the service industry, tipping is a long-standing tradition. When we go out to eat at a restaurant, we know that leaving a tip for our waiter or waitress is expected. Tipping is a way to show appreciation for excellent service, and it is an essential part of the income of service staff. However, the concept of tipping isn't typically associated with the banking industry. In this article, we will explore the idea of tipping bankers and discuss the potential benefits of adopting a similar system. Step 1: Explain the current status of the banking industry The banking industry is an important sector in the economy, responsible for managing our financial transactions, securing loans, and providing financial advice. While bankers are often compensated with a salary and performance-based bonuses, they do not generally receive tips for their services. Many people may not even consider tipping their banker, assuming that their salary and benefits are sufficient. Step 2: Explore the similarities between waiters and bankers Though the nature of their jobs is different, there are similarities between the roles of waiters and bankers. Both are service-oriented professions, necessitating strong interpersonal skills and customer service expertise. Both waiters and bankers also work to address the needs of their customers, whether it's providing information about a savings account or ensuring your satisfaction during a meal. Step 3: Discuss the potential benefits of tipping bankers Introducing a tipping system for bankers could have several positive effects on the banking industry. Firstly, it could incentivize bankers to provide even better customer service, as they would be motivated to receive tips from clients for their exceptional services. As a result, overall customer satisfaction could increase. Secondly, by giving customers the option to tip their bankers, it could foster a more personal relationship between the two parties. A positive banking experience could lead to increased trust and loyalty between the client and the banker. Consequently, clients may be more likely to recommend the bank to others, promoting the bank's growth and success. Step 4: Address potential drawbacks While tipping bankers may have its benefits, there are potential drawbacks as well. For instance, introducing tips could put pressure on bankers to focus on customer-facing roles, potentially neglecting important backend work, or causing undue stress. Additionally, employees might become reliant on tips, which could contribute to income disparity within banks. Step 5: Explore how a tipping system could be implemented If the idea of tipping bankers is to gain traction, a feasible implementation plan would be necessary. One potential strategy would be to introduce optional tip jars at teller windows or discreet prompts on digital banking platforms, allowing customers to tip at their discretion. Additionally, banks could provide guidelines on recommended tip amounts or percentages based on the services provided. Conclusion: Though the concept of tipping bankers is unconventional, it opens an interesting dialogue on recognizing and rewarding exceptional service in the banking industry. By exploring this idea, we can encourage discussions around customer satisfaction and, ultimately, strive for better service standards across all industries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Identify the words and phrases in the sentence that need to be translated - Cos she's = because she is - real = opravdu (in this context, meaning truly or really) - slutty = at first glance, the word might seem offensive. However, a non-offensive direct translation would be \\"lechtivá\\" or \\"lejchtavá,\\" which means flirtatious, or promiscuous. Step 2: Translate each word or phrase individually - Because she is = protože ona je - real = opravdu - slutty = lechtivá Step 3: Combine the translated words and phrases to form a coherent sentence in Czech - \\"protože ona je opravdu lechtivá.\\" So, the phrase \\"Cos she's real slutty.\\" can be translated to Czech as \\"protože ona je opravdu lechtivá.\\" Keep in mind that depending on context and intention, there could be other more or less appropriate translations of the original sentence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: The wildfire smoke cleared on the morning of our family wedding, just in time for the bride and groom to say their vows overlooking coal harbour.

I suppose it was ok… oh, who am I kidding, the harbour is spectacular. Let me also point out that none of these images are touched by editing. Like 99% of my images in this blog (the other 1% is cropping and making slight adjustments), these are entirely un-doctored.

With a slightly chaotic boarding process (more noticeable after such a serene start) we were too busy sorting out the seats to realise that we had hopped on board, and within in seconds it seemed, our pilot had lifted off smoothly in a flurry of water foam. As we began to watch the world turn into a Lilliput version of itself, we barely blinked for watching beautiful vistas unfold. From tiny little islands (the above Passage Island technically belongs to West Vancouver, known as the Hollywood suburb of the city, and a couple of the homes are allegedly owned by celebrities) where the residents enjoy views of downtown Vancouver, the University of British Columbia campus, Vancouver Island, and the snow-capped mountains of Howe Sound – to the fjords all the way along the Sea to Sky Highway to Whistler.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Diet book fraudster Kevin Trudeau trying to hide fortune Published: Tuesday, July 21, 2015, 11:42 PM Updated: Tuesday, July 21, 2015, 11:49 PM Looks like this scam won't work, either. Former TV pitchman Kevin Trudeau, who is already serving a decade-long prison sentence in Alabama for criminal contempt, is allegedly trying to hide hundreds of millions of dollars from the government — just two years after claiming he was sent to prison “penniless.” The deceitful diet book author earned at least 24 million over the last decade, and his crock companies may have taken in more than half a billion dollars during that same time, with 30 million of that still unaccounted for, ABC Chicago reported. The government believes Trudeau is trying to hide his fortune in Swiss and Caribbean banks in anticipation of his release. “Mr. Trudeau continues to resist, but we will do everything we can to find the money that properly belongs to (his) consumers,” Federal Trade Commission attorney Jonathan Cohen said Tuesday. The FTC is planning to send refund checks of 11 to nearly all of the 820,000 people who bought Trudeau’s 2007 book “The Weight-Loss Cure ‘They’ Don't Want You to Know About.” That book brought fraud fines and eventual convictions to Trudeau a year after its publication due to its unsafe, unproven and unsubstantiated health advice. For example, the book told readers to suffice on a 500-calorie-a-day diet and get prescription injections of a hormone only found in pregnant women. Five iconic pitchmen who landed in hot water after becoming ‘as seen on TV’ famous Trudeau, 52, told a court under oath in 2013 he was completely broke, even though he continued to dish on fancy dinners and jet around the world, the Chicago Tribune reported. \\"He told me he was broke when he had hundreds of millions of dollars going through his hands,\\" U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman Judge Gettleman said Tuesday. “When he gets out, we're going to be going right back into this.” The slippery salesman’s lawyer could face punishment of his own for allegedly helping his client on the money scam.","output":"Former TV pitchman and diet book author Kevin Trudeau is allegedly attempting to hide hundreds of millions of dollars from the US government while serving a decade-long prison sentence for criminal contempt.

The differences lie in the specific units stated and the organizational structure mentioned. Let's break down both sentences to highlight the similarities and differences. Sentence 1: \\"During the Vietnam War, the 12th Field Battery also served with the 104th Field Regiment -- to which the 161st Field Battery RNZA was also attached.\\" In this sentence, we understand that: - The 12th Field Battery served alongside the 104th Field Regiment during the Vietnam War. - The 161st Field Battery RNZA was also attached to the 104th Field Regiment. Sentence 2: \\"During the Vietnam War, the 104th field battery also served with the 12th field regiment, which was also assigned to the 161th field battery RNZA.\\" In this sentence, we understand that: - The 104th Field Battery served alongside the 12th Field Regiment during the Vietnam War. - The 12th Field Regiment was also assigned to the 161st Field Battery RNZA. The key differences between the two sentences are: - Sentence 1 refers to the 12th Field Battery serving with the 104th Field Regiment, while Sentence 2 refers to the 104th Field Battery serving with the 12th Field Regiment. This difference in unit names (battery vs. regiment) creates confusion in understanding the actual organizational structure. - Sentence 1 specifies that the 161st Field Battery RNZA was attached to the 104th Field Regiment, while Sentence 2 indicates that the 12th Field Regiment was assigned to the 161st Field Battery RNZA. This again changes the perceived hierarchy and relationship between these units. To summarize, while both sentences discuss the involvement of the 12th Field Battery, 104th Field Regiment, and 161st Field Battery RNZA during the Vietnam War, the actual relationships and hierarchy between these units differ in each sentence. They do not mean the same, but they convey related information about the organizational structure and interactions during the war."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Letters to his family show he was recommended for a gallantry medal. Discrimination feared to have prevented him being honoured in 1918. He played football professionally for Tottenham Hotspur. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: The Remarkable Life of Second Lieutenant Walter Tull: Remembering a War Hero and Footballer Introduction: Walter Tull (1888 - 1918) was a trailblazer, both on and off the football field. As a professional football player who later became a Second Lieutenant in the British Army during World War I, Tull broke racial barriers and set new precedents. Despite his numerous accomplishments, letters uncovered reveal that Tull was recommended for a gallantry medal but was denied due to racial discrimination. This article will delve into the life of Walter Tull, his accomplishments, and the injustice that prevailed. Step 1: Walter Tull's Early Life and Football Career: Walter Tull was born on April 28, 1888, in Folkestone, England. He faced adversity from a young age, losing both of his parents and growing up in an orphanage. Despite his troubling past, Tull found solace in sports, particularly football. He pursued a career in football, eventually signing with Tottenham Hotspur, a prestigious professional football club. At Tottenham, Tull was one of the very first mixed-race players in England's top league, making a significant mark in football history. Step 2: Military Service and Promotions: When the First World War broke out in 1914, Tull enlisted and eventually became a Second Lieutenant, defying the racial barriers of the time. He fearlessly fought for his country, with his extraordinary bravery and leadership abilities earning him the respect of his fellow soldiers. He actively participated in battles such as the Battle of the Somme and the Italian front, where he stood tall in the face of adversity. Step 3: Death and Attempts to Honour Tull: Tragically, Walter Tull was killed in action on March 25, 1918, aged just 29. Letters to his family uncovered that Tull had been recommended for a gallantry medal, specifically the Military Cross. However, due to the racial discrimination and the institutional barriers of the time, it is believed that Tull was denied the honour that he rightly deserved. Step 4: Legacy and Modern Recognition: Walter Tull may not have received the recognition he deserved during his time, but the world has taken steps to rectify this and honour Tull's memory. As a talented footballer and a courageous solider, Tull's legacy resonates within both the sports and military communities. His story serves as a testimony to the resilience and courage required to fight for justice and equality in challenging times. Conclusion: Second Lieutenant Walter Tull's life, though cut tragically short, serves as a shining example of courage, determination, and the power of challenging racial barriers. Today, his story continues to inspire generations to fight against discrimination and strive for equality. By remembering and honouring Tull, the hope is to create a better and just future for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Input: Article: If you go to Ethiopia,you'll find a strange palm-like structure,which is called Warka Water.It gathers water from fog and condensation and is invented by an Italian firm. When Italian designer Arturo Vittori and Swiss architect Andreas Vogler first visited Ethiopia in 2012,they were shocked to see women and children forced to walk miles to access what,for them,had always been within easy reach,water. Only 34 percent of Ethiopians have access to a reliable water supply.Some travel for up to six hours a day to fetch some or,even worse,have to use pond water polluted by human waste, _ the spread of disease. Worldwide,about 768 million people--two and a half times the U.S.population--don't have access to safe drinking water.So just imagine if we could just pull water out of thin air?That's what Vittori and Vogler asked once they saw the severe problem and promised to take action.Their firm,Architecture and Vision,has since come up with Warka Water,a grand palm-like structure that may look like something you'd see in a modern art museum,but it's been designed to harvest water from the air. Warka Water,which is named after an Ethiopian fig tree,is composed of a 30-foot bamboo frame containing a fog-harvesting nylon net that can catch water easily,can be easily lowered for repairs and allow communities to measure the water level.Collecting water through condensation is hardly a new technique,but the creators of Warka Water say their tree-inspired design is more effective,maximizing surface and perfecting every angle to produce up to 26 gallons of drinkable water a day--enough for a family of seven. Western organizations have been working to provide clean water access in Africa for decades,so Warka Water joins a very long list of earlier attempts.So far,high-tech solutions,like the once promising Playpump,have failed,mostly due to high costs and maintenance issues. This is where Warka Water stands apart--a lower-tech solution that is easy to repair and far more affordable than digging wells in the rocky Ethiopian plateau.

Indicate your choice as \`a\` for Yes or \`b\` for No. Input: Question: What country was Wang Han born in? Passage:A native of Hsinchu County, Wang was born in 1954. He began swimming in the Touqian River at a young age, and in college, started swimming the ocean. Wang's first publicized attempt at long-distance swimming in 1985 was funded by the actors' guild of which Wang held membership. He swam from Donggang, Pingtung, to Liuqiu Island in approximately six hours. Subsequently, aged 31, he chose to retire from acting and modeling to concentrate on swimming. In August 1986, Wang swam the Strait of Gibraltar. From 1988 to 1998, Wang traversed one body of water per year, including the English Channel (1988), Bosporus (1989), the channels of the Hawaiian Islands around Maui (1990), the Strait of Juan de Fuca (1993), the Tsugaru Strait (1994), Cleveland Bay (1996), and the Strait of Sicily (1998). He had originally planned to swim the Taiwan Strait in 1998, but did not do so, as it was too soon after the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. Wang was consulted about plans to swim the Taiwan Strait in 2001, and scheduled his own attempt throughout 2007, after receiving help from Chi Cheng. The 2007 attempt was unsuccessful, and Wang made plans for the strait in January 2008, though this last attempt received no further media coverage. Output:","output":"b Justification: To answer the question \\"What country was Wang Han born in?\\", only the term \\"Hsinchu County\\" is needed because the phrase \\"a native of Hsinchu County\\" indicates Wang Han's birthplace.

The 71-year-old ex-police officer accused of shooting dead a man inside a Florida movie theater won't get the chance to go home -- at least for now -- after a judge Friday decided not to grant him bail.  Judge Pat Siracusa made his decision after two days of wrenching, evocative, at times seemingly contradictory testimony inside a Dade City, Florida, courtroom.  \\"The state did, in fact, meet their standard,\\" Siracusa said of prosecutors argument that Curtis Reeves shouldn't be allowed to post bond. \\"And I am going to detain Mr. Reeves, pretrial. He will remain in custody.\\"  Reeves' lawyer signaled his intention to appeal a decision that -- while not unexpected, given this is a homicide case -- he believes is unwarranted. The attorney, Richard Escobar, said that he's optimistic about not only the appeal on bail, but that a jury of six citizens will side with his client.  \\"Mr. Reeves is truly an innocent man,\\" Escobar told reporters. \\"And we look forward to proving that at a jury trial at some point.\\"  The widow of the man that Reeves killed, meanwhile, applauded Siracusa's decision.  \\"I'm just very happy and relieved,\\" Nicole Oulson said. \\"... I have no doubt in my mind that it was the right decision.\\"  No threats before shooting, widow says  Was it self-defense or an overreaction?

Summarize this article: On the second day of the trial in Cape Town, Mziwamadoda Qwabe said he was asked to make it look like a hijacking. Mr Dewani, 34, from Bristol, denies murdering his wife Anni, 28, on their honeymoon in 2010. The couple were held at gunpoint while being driven in a taxi through Gugulethu township near Cape Town. Qwabe told the Western Cape High Court that taxi driver Zola Tonga had told him \\"there was a husband who wanted his wife to be killed\\". Mr Dewani faces five charges, including murder and lying about the circumstances of Swedish national Anni's death. Qwabe, from Cape Town, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2012 for the murder of Anni Dewani. Prosecutors claim Mr Dewani conspired with him, and other Cape Town residents Zola Tongo and Xolile Mngeni. Qwabe, 29, told the court Tongo phoned him and said he had a job that needed to be done - that someone needed to be killed. He said Tongo agreed to meet him the next day to discuss the murder, and a price of 15,000 rand (about £1,330 at the exchange rate at the time) was agreed. The pair then arranged to meet up with Tongo's taxi for the attack, during which Mr Dewani's phone would also be taken. He told the court the money was due to be left in a \\"cubby hole\\" in the vehicle which would later be split before the pair spent an evening \\"socialising\\". Qwabe was asked if there was any discussion about a weapon. He said: \\"I knew there would be a firearm involved.\\" He told the court Tongo called him later and told him the route the taxi would take on the evening of 13 November 2010. Describing the carjacking, Qwabe said: \\"[Mngeni] had the gun. As it [Tongo's car] approached I got into the driver's side. \\"[Mngeni] got into the passenger side and Zola got into the back. I saw in the (rear view) window a guy and behind me was a lady,\\" he said. \\"I ordered Zola to get out of the car. He told me the money was in a pouch behind the front passenger door. \\"I stopped the vehicle, I asked the husband to get out of the car. \\"The husband was now out of the vehicle and I drove on.\\" Qwabe told the court he was behind the wheel when Anni was fatally wounded. He said he was concentrating on the road at the moment Mngeni killed her. \\"I heard a gun shot. [Mngeni] said 'I shot the lady'. \\"I pulled over on to the pavement and stopped the car. I saw she [Anni] was on the back seat of the car.\\" Qwabe said he found the bullet casing then threw his gloves away. He told the court 10,000 rand was in the pouch and 4,000 rand was seized from \\"the husband\\". Qwabe admitted he had lied in court at a bail hearing before he admitted his guilt over the murder. Francois van Zyl, representing Dewani, said: \\"At that bail hearing you testified under oath, you pleaded not guilty because you said you had an alibi. Is that a lie?\\" Qwabe replied: \\"My lawyer at the time told me to plead not guilty.\\" Mr van Zyl said: \\"I repeat the question. Was that a lie under oath?\\" Qwabe answered: \\"Yes.\\" The court was told there had been no conversations with Tongo about how Anni would be killed, only that it had to look like a hijacking. Mr van Zyl asked: \\"You never had a discussion about how this woman was going to be killed?\\" Qwabe answered: \\"No, sir.\\" He told the court it was not decided who would strike the fatal blow, what weapon would be used, or where the killing would take place. On Monday Mr Dewani told the court in a written statement that his \\"whole world came crashing down\\" when his wife was found killed. He also revealed to the court that he is bisexual. A record of agreed facts in the case, released by the court on Wednesday, showed he had been browsing same-sex dating websites during the honeymoon and within days of his wife's death. It shows he was logged into the Gaydar website while waiting with his wife for a connecting flight to Cape Town, and three times between November 15 and November 16, He also logged into the Recon website twice. The trial was adjourned until Thursday. Summary:","output":"A man named Mr. Dewani is being accused of planning to kill his wife Anni during their honeymoon in 2010. They were both in a taxi in Cape Town when they were held at gunpoint. Mr. Dewani says he didn't plan it, but the men who actually did the crime say that he hired them to make it look like a hijacking and kill his wife.

Dennis had a much higher testosterone level than Christopher, so","output":"Dennis had a much higher testosterone level than Christopher, so he visibly displayed a variety of physical and psychological differences that profoundly impacted their contrasting experiences in numerous aspects of their lives. These disparities became particularly apparent in their competitive attitudes, physical stature, energy levels, and social interactions. Firstly, Dennis's elevated testosterone level led to a heightened sense of competitiveness in various areas, including sports, academics, and career advancement. As a result, he often found himself striving to excel and seeking challenges to prove his abilities. On the other hand, Christopher displayed a more laid-back attitude, as he was less driven by the need for dominance and achievement. He typically opted for collaboration instead of competition, which in some cases, worked to his advantage as this allowed him to build strong relationships and connections. Secondly, the increased testosterone in Dennis's system contributed to a more muscular and defined body composition, providing him with greater strength, power, and agility. This advantage translated into an increased performance in physically demanding activities such as athletics and manual labor. Meanwhile, Christopher had a comparatively less muscular build with less overall physical strength, which made him gravitate more towards activities that relied more on mental aptitude and finesse rather than brute force. In terms of energy levels, Dennis often displayed a higher degree of vigor and vitality, thanks to his elevated testosterone levels. This enabled him to maintain alertness and performance throughout the day, allowing him to tackle tasks more efficiently. Conversely, Christopher might have experienced lower energy levels and a greater tendency to fatigue. Although this sometimes impacted his productivity, it encouraged him to find balance and prioritize relaxation and self-care. Socially, Dennis's high testosterone levels appeared to be both a boon and a bane. On one hand, it gave him the confidence to approach new situations with gusto, attracting people with his assertiveness and charm. Conversely, it sometimes led to aggressive or dominating behavior, which could be off-putting to some individuals. On the other side of the spectrum, Christopher's comparatively lower testosterone levels fostered a more amiable and empathetic demeanor, which many found to be approachable and comforting. However, it could also result in a perceived lack of self-assuredness and leadership qualities in certain situations. Ultimately, the hormonal variances between Dennis and Christopher shaped their experiences, choices, and perspectives. Dennis's higher testosterone levels manifested in increased competitiveness, a physically more imposing presence, greater energy, and a strong, occasionally overbearing, social demeanor. In contrast, Christopher exhibited a calmer disposition, more collaborative attitude, and a generally less physically aggressive presence, although occasionally at the expense of self-confidence and assertiveness. As is evident, these two distinct hormonal profiles produced contrasting life experiences and points of view for both individuals, offering them unique strengths and challenges as they navigated their journeys."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: She has been seen out and about for the first time since fans began speculating about whether she is starting a family CHERYL fuelled those ongoing baby rumours today as she was spotted out and about for the first time since speculation began over whether she is expecting her first child. The pop star was spotted out in London and she made sure to cover her tummy with her coat. Cheryl looked glowing as she wrapped up warm and held her beige jacket across her middle. Cheryl has been hit with pregnancy rumours in recent weeks as fans have been speculating that she is expecting a baby with her boyfriend Liam Payne. The former Girls Aloud star has stayed silent amid the furore, and her outing today has done little to dispel the gossip. It marks the first time Cheryl has been spotted out and about since she was hit by the rumours, and she kept her tummy firmly under wraps. Cheryl, 33, has been dating One Direction star Liam, 23, since earlier this year. They went public with their romance in May and appeared together at events over the summer, but they have both been keeping a low profile since September. It was that month the star first faced speculation about whether she is starting a family as fans noticed she was sporting a slightly fuller-looking face in a L’Oreal advert. The commercial caused a Twitter storm, and rumours about a possible pregnancy have continued ever since. Cheryl's mum fuelled the gossip when she was spotted buying pregnancy goods in Mothercare last month. The pictures, which showed Joan Callaghan buying a maternity pillow at a store in Newcastle sent fans into a frenzy. An eyewitness who was also in the queue told The Sun Online: “She had a massive pregnancy pillow which helps make your bump more comfortable when you’re trying to sleep. \\"She was asking the assistant for advice about another kind that she wanted, more of a wedge which you can put under your bump when it’s quite big to help take the weight. \\"The shop assistant went away and came back with what she had asked for.\\" Many fans claimed the snaps substantiated the gossip about Cheryl and Liam starting a family. The news comes as Cheryl faces a delay in taking her romance with Liam to the next level as her divorce from Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini has stalled. Reports suggest the Frenchman has put a halt to the divorce proceedings amid concerns about a clause in the settlement which would prevent him from talking about the couple's union. A source told The Mirror he's been saying Cheryl is trying to \\"gag\\" him and that he felt she wasn't there for him when his father died last year. One friend said: “JB has moved on. It’s been a really tough year for him with his father dying, leaving him the only remaining member of his family. \\"Then there is getting divorced and being bound by a ­confidentiality agreement – which means he can never defend himself or clarify any false reports.

Pick your answer from: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","output":"[a]. no; These two sentences do not mean the same thing. The differences in these sentences lie in the country and time period of Vladimír Železný's affiliation. In sentence (1), it says that Vladimír Železný is a media businessman and politician in the Soviet Union, implying that he was active during the Soviet era. It's important to note that the Soviet Union, officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), existed from 1922 to 1991. The Czech Republic, as a separate sovereign state, was established on January 1, 1993, after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. Therefore, the first sentence is suggesting that Vladimír Železný was active in a time and place that precedes the existence of the Czech Republic. In sentence (2), it mentions that Vladimír Železný is a media businessman and politician in the Czech Republic. Here, the indication is that he is currently active or was active in the Czech Republic as a media businessman and politician after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the establishment of the Czech Republic as an independent country.

However, it largely depends on the context and the intended audience. Here's a detailed analysis of the possible sentiments: 1. Humor: When someone refers to a 1.8 million property as a \\"little charmer,\\" it could be an attempt to make light of the situation or provide a sense of amusement. Generally speaking, a 1.8 million property would not be considered \\"little\\" in terms of price or value, so it's possible that the speaker is delivering this line with a comedic or ironic tone to highlight the contrast and make others laugh. 2. Sarcasm: Another possible sentiment is sarcasm, with the speaker using the term \\"little charmer\\" to sarcastically emphasize the high price of the property. By calling it \\"little,\\" the speaker may be trying to imply that the property is not worth the price or they find it surprising that something so small or modest could have such a high price tag. 3. Understatement: The sentence could also convey a sense of understatement. By referring to a 1.8million property as \\"little,\\" the speaker might be subtly implying that the property's value is greater than its price tag suggests or that they believe it's quite a bargain. This would mean that the speaker sees potential in the property and thinks it's a good investment despite the seemingly high price. 4. Appreciation: Lastly, the sentiment of the sentence could be perceived as genuine appreciation and admiration for the property at hand. The speaker might genuinely find it charming, regardless of its price, and the presence of the term \\"little\\" may simply be intended as an affectionate or endearing way to describe the property. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence, \\"this little 1.8 million charmer,\\" depends heavily on the context it's spoken or written in and the intent of the speaker or writer. It could be perceived as humor, sarcasm, understatement, or appreciation, with each interpretation being plausible given the right circumstances. To determine the exact sentiment, one would need more information about the situation or a deeper understanding of the speaker's opinions and feelings toward the property."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not.  But I can use this background: Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage.  What is an answer for this question: Citizens of which city should be less concerned about sink holes? The answer is:","output":"Citizens of Tichago should be less concerned about sink holes. Step 1: Identify the issue The issue mentioned in the question is soil piping, which can cause sink holes.  Step 2: Analyze the situation of both cities - Reslie: Known for its grilled cheese sandwiches.   - Currently experiencing soil piping. - Tichago: Neighboring city to Reslie.   - Consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches.   - Not experiencing soil piping, according to the mayor. Step 3: Evaluate sink hole risks Since soil piping is a cause of sink holes and Reslie is experiencing soil piping, the risk of sink holes is higher in Reslie. On the other hand, Tichago is not experiencing soil piping, thus the risk of sink holes is lower in Tichago. Step 4: Choose the city with lower sink hole concern Based on the evaluation, Tichago has a lower risk of sink holes due to the absence of soil piping, so citizens of Tichago should be less concerned about sink holes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Bat Out of Hell is the second studio album and the major-label debut by American rock singer Meat Loaf, as well as being his first collaboration with composer Jim Steinman and producer Todd Rundgren, released on October 21, 1977 on Cleveland International/Epic Records. It is one of the best-selling albums of all time, having sold over 43 million copies worldwide. \\"Rolling Stone\\" ranked it at number 343 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003.  - Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people or to the study of such myths. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs.  - The raccoon (or , \\"Procyon lotor\\"), sometimes spelled racoon, also known as the common raccoon, North American raccoon, northern raccoon and colloquially as coon, is a medium-sized mammal native to North America. The raccoon is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of and a body weight of . Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates it against cold weather. Two of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws and its facial mask, which are themes in the mythology of several Native American ethnic groups. Raccoons are noted for their intelligence, with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for up to three years. The diet of the omnivorous raccoon, which is usually nocturnal, consists of about 40% invertebrates, 33% plant foods, and 27% vertebrates.  - Masters of Horror was an American anthology television series created by director Mick Garris for the Showtime cable network.  - Giallo (plural \\"gialli\\") is a 20th-century Italian thriller or horror genre of literature and film, usually with mystery elements and often with slasher, crime fiction or, less frequently, supernatural horror elements. In Italy, the term simply denotes thrillers, typically of the crime fiction, mystery, and horror subgenres, regardless of the country of origin. In English-speaking countries, however, the term \\"giallo\\" is used to refer to a particular style of Italian-produced murder mystery film which often includes elements of horror fiction (such as slasher violence) and eroticism (similar to the French fantastique genre). The genre began in the mid-to-late 1960s, peaked in popularity during the 1970s, and subsequently declined over the next few decades (although some examples continue to be produced). It has been considered to be a predecessor to, and significant influence on, the later American slasher film genre.  - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.  - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.  - Francis Paul Wilson (born May 17, 1946 in Jersey City, New Jersey) is an American author, primarily in the science fiction and horror genres.  - Michael Lee Aday (born Marvin Lee Aday, September 27, 1947), better known by his stage name Meat Loaf, is an American musician, singer, songwriter, record producer and actor. He is noted for the \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" trilogy of albums, consisting of \\"Bat Out of Hell\\", \\"\\", and \\"\\". \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" has sold more than 43 million copies worldwide. Almost 40 years after its release, it still sells an estimated 200,000 copies annually, and stayed on the charts for over nine years, making it one of the best selling albums in history. He is also known for his powerful wide-ranging operatic voice and theatrical live performances.  - Dario Argento (born 7 September 1940) is an Italian film director, producer and screenwriter. He is best known for his work in the horror film genre, particularly in the subgenre known as giallo, and for his influence on modern horror movies.  - Fur is used in reference to the hair of animals, usually mammals, particularly those with extensive body hair coverage that is generally soft and thick, as opposed to the stiffer bristles on most pigs. The term \\"pelage\\" first known use in English c. 1828(French, from Middle French, from \\"poil\\" hair, from Old French \\"peilss\\", from Latin \\"pilus\\",) is sometimes used to refer to the body hair of an animal as a complete coat. \\"Fur\\" is also used to refer to animal pelts which have been processed into leather with the hair still attached. The words \\"fur\\" or \\"furry\\" are also used, more casually, to refer to hair-like growths or formations, particularly when the subject being referred to exhibits a dense coat of fine, soft \\"hairs.\\" If layered, rather than grown as a single coat, it may consist of short down hairs, long guard hairs, and, in some cases, medium awn hairs. Mammals with reduced amounts of fur are often called \\"naked\\", as with the naked mole-rat, or \\"hairless\\", as with hairless dogs.  - Pelts is the sixth episode of the second season of Masters of Horror , first aired 1 December 2006 . The director is Dario Argento , and it based on a short story by F. Paul Wilson . The film is a story about supernaturally beautiful raccoon pelts ( called \`\` pine lights '' ) that cause anyone who seeks to profit by them to commit horrendous acts .

As a result , people end up committing brutal murders and suicides appropriate to their positions in relation to the pelts whenever around them .    What is the relationship between 'pelts ' and 'horror film'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'pelts' and 'horror film' lies in the fact that 'Pelts' is an episode of the American horror anthology television series, \\"Masters of Horror.\\" It is the sixth episode of the second season, which first aired on December 1, 2006.

Here's a more detailed and long explanation about the translation: In the given sentence, \\"This finally took place on 16 November.\\" has been translated to German as \\"Diese Veranstaltung fand schließlich am 16. November statt.\\" Let's break down the translation by words and phrases: 1. \\"This\\" - The corresponding German word for \\"this\\" is \\"diese\\" when referring to a feminine or plural noun. In this context, we can assume the event being mentioned is feminine or plural in nature, hence the appropriate use of \\"diese\\". 2. \\"finally\\" - In German, \\"finally\\" can be translated as \\"schließlich\\" or \\"endlich\\". In this context, \\"schließlich\\" is the more suitable choice, as it implies that something has happened after waiting or overcoming difficulties. 3. \\"took place\\" - The verb phrase \\"took place\\" is translated to \\"fand statt\\" in German. It is the past tense form of \\"stattfinden\\", which means \\"to take place\\" or \\"occur\\". 4. \\"on\\" - In German, \\"on\\" can be translated as \\"am\\" when talking about dates or specific days. In this case, \\"am\\" is used to connect the 16th of November to the sentence. 5. \\"16 November\\" - In German, dates are written in a slightly different format compared to English. Instead of writing \\"November 16,\\" it is written as \\"16. November\\", with a period and the month following the day of the month. 6. To sum it up, the translated sentence in German is: \\"Diese Veranstaltung fand schließlich am 16.

Keene and Alexandra Kaczenski of the Getty Museum’s Manuscripts Department have spent the last few years preparing for an exhibition and publication titled Sacred Landscapes: Nature in Renaissance Manuscripts that aims to examine representations of “green spaces” such as gardens, vistas, and their relation to the divine. In particular, Bryan and Alexandra focus on the ways in which artists during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance embedded the pages of illuminated manuscripts with depictions of the natural world so that nature could guide prayer, chant, and meditation. For Bryan, this project represents a continuation of his interest in sacred gardens that began with his graduate work on the garden imagery that influenced Botticelli’s Agony in the Garden painting. In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance. For Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication. Though floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated—the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented—this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly “scattered” floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, “The tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific.

Volkswagen is working with the United Automobile Workers at its Chattanooga, Tenn., assembly plant on how to unionize the plant and create a German-style works council there, the president of the labor union said on Friday. The company would be the first German automaker to have such a council at a United States plant. A works council is a group of employees, including both white- and blue-collar workers, that meets with management on issues like working conditions and productivity. But to avoid violating American labor laws, the plant would first have to be formally unionized, the company said. âVW workers in Chattanooga have the unique opportunity to introduce this new model of labor relations to the United States, in partnership with the U.A.W.,â the unionâs president, Bob King, said in a statement on Friday. Volkswagen officials told employees at the Chattanooga plant on Thursday that it was negotiating with the union about establishing a works council there, where about 2,000 workers assemble the VW Passat. A letter, signed by the plantâs chairman, Frank Fischer, and its vice president for human resources, Sebastian Patta, said the talks were aimed at âthe possibility of implementing an innovative model of employee representation for all employees.â The VW officials said that a works council could be created at a company in the United States only with the cooperation of a labor union because it might otherwise be viewed as an illegal company-sponsored union. That, the VW officials wrote, is why the company has started its dialogue with the U.A.W. None of the foreign carmakers with auto plants in the South are currently unionized. Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee has been outspoken in opposing any union inroads at the Volkswagen plant, warning that it would undermine his stateâs efforts to attract investment. Volkswagen and U.A.W. officials met on Aug. 30 in Wolfsburg, Germany, where the company is based, to continue previous discussions about the works council and unionizing at the Chattanooga plant, which has been operating since 2011 and has a total of 2,500 employees including managers. Some labor and auto experts say that if the VW plant in Chattanooga gets a works council, it would create pressure to do likewise at the BMW plant in Spartanburg, S.C., and the Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Ala. While some executives see works councils as a pesky thorn in their side, others see them as a useful source of ideas from the shop floor and a vehicle to build consensus and employee morale. âVolkswagen is a company that has extensive experience with union representation,â Mr. King said in his statement, âand the U.A.W. believes the role of the union in the 21st century is to create an environment where both the company and workers succeed.â U.A.W. officials say that Volkswagen has agreed to not oppose any unionization drive in Chattanooga. In the letter to Chattanooga employees, Mr. Fischer and Mr. Patta wrote that they wanted to âprevent any influence from outside driving a wedge into our great team.â That resembles language that anti-union companies often use to suggest that unions would be an undesirable third party that gets between employees and managers. But a U.A.W. official said that sentence referred to anti-union groups, like the Competitive Enterprise Institute and its Center for Economic Freedom, that have vigorously criticized Volkswagen for not battling to keep out a union the way that many American companies do. What was this article about?","output":"The article discusses the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and their collaboration with the United Automobile Workers (U.A.W.) to potentially unionize the plant and create a German-style works council.

Question: A short plant with a thick, fleshy stem, extensive roots, and a short blooming period would most likely be found in which of the following environments? What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? Select from the following. (1). prairie (2). desert (3). coniferous forest (4). deciduous forest","output":"The correct answer to the question is (2). desert. A short plant with a thick, fleshy stem, extensive roots, and a short blooming period is most likely to be found in a desert environment. Let us delve deeper into the properties of desert plants and why these characteristics are advantageous in this environment. Deserts are characterized by arid conditions, low humidity, and sparse precipitation. Consequently, plants that thrive in these conditions have evolved specific characteristics, such as thick stems, extensive roots, and short blooming periods, to cope with these harsh environmental stresses. The desert environment poses unique challenges to plant life, with adaptations essential for survival. The thick and fleshy stem seen in desert plants is an adaptation for storing water. When precipitation occurs, the short-lived influx of water is absorbed by these plants, allowing them to preserve valuable water resources for periods of drought. A well-known example of such a plant is the cactus, which is specifically adapted to survive in dry desert environments. Its thick stem serves as a water reservoir, allowing it to survive through long periods without rainfall. A desert plant's extensive root system is another vital adaptation for surviving in arid environments. With a large, expansive network of roots, desert plants can maximize their reach and access precious water resources found deep underground or spread over large areas close to the surface. The shallow roots help collect rainwater when it's available, while the deep roots tap into subsurface water. The extensive roots also provide stability to the plants, allowing them to withstand strong winds and shifting sands. The short blooming period observed in desert plants is a reproductive adaptation. A short blooming period ensures that the plant quickly uses the opportunity provided by the limited rain; it will bloom and set seeds before water becomes unavailable. Since the desert climate is less conducive to pollination over extended periods due to high temperatures, dry conditions, and wind, a short blooming condition can increase pollination success rates. This increases the odds of passing on their genetic material to the next generation. Comparing this to the other environments: (1). Prairie: Prairie plants are adapted to windy grasslands and require extensive root systems to anchor them in place. However, they tend to have a long blooming period compared to desert plants and generally do not have thick, fleshy stems for water storage. (3). Coniferous forest: Plants in coniferous forests are adapted to cold, dark environments and generally do not need to store water or have extensive root systems like desert plants. They have other adaptations, such as evergreen leaves and waxy coatings to help them withstand cold temperatures. (4). Deciduous forest: In deciduous forests, plants like short-lived wildflowers will have short blooming periods. However, the flora here is more focused on adapting to seasonal changes such as leaf shedding rather than water conservation adaptations. In conclusion, based on the characteristics provided—a short plant with a thick, fleshy stem, extensive roots, and a short blooming period—the most likely environment for this type of plant is the desert (option 2). The adaptations presented primarily allow for efficient water storage, access to scarce water through extensive roots system, and successful reproduction during the brief rainy season in harsh desert conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ask a question about Florida.","output":"What role has Florida played in the development and growth of the U.S. space program? Florida has played a crucial role in the development and growth of the United States space program. The state's first involvement with the space program started during the early stages of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1950s. Since then, Florida has continued to contribute and expand its involvement in the world of space exploration. One of the main reasons Florida has been such an essential player in the U.S. space program is because of its ideal geographic location. The state's proximity to the equator allows rockets to benefit from the Earth's rotational speed, making it easier and more fuel-efficient to reach the desired orbits. Florida's coastline facing the Atlantic Ocean also provides a safe and unobstructed launch path for space missions. Cape Canaveral in Florida has been a key location for the U.S. space program. The Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was established in 1948 as a missile test facility. By 1958, the first United States satellite, Explorer 1, was launched into space from this location. Since then, numerous space missions and projects have been developed and executed from Cape Canaveral and the surrounding areas. The John F. Kennedy Space Center, also located on Florida's east coast, is arguably one of the most iconic elements of the U.S. space program. Established in 1962 as the nation's primary launch center for human spaceflight, the Kennedy Space Center has played host to some of the most iconic space missions in history. This includes the legendary Apollo 11 mission which successfully landed humans on the moon for the first time in 1969. Florida's Space Coast, where both Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Kennedy Space Center are located, has seen the launch of numerous iconic spacecraft such as the Saturn V rockets for the Apollo missions and the Space Shuttle program that operated from 1981 until 2011. The Space Coast is still in use today for launches of private aerospace companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance. In addition to the Kennedy Space Center, Florida is also home to other organizations and aerospace companies that are involved in the space industry. For example, the Space Florida agency was established in 2006 to promote the growth of Florida's aerospace sector, attract investment, and facilitate business development. Florida's colleges and universities, such as the University of Florida and the Florida Institute of Technology, play a significant role in developing the next generation of engineers and scientists to support the growth and development of the U.S. space program. These institutions provide cutting-edge research and innovation in the fields of aerospace engineering, astronautics, and other space-related fields. In summary, Florida has been an integral part of the U.S. space program due to its prime geographic location, historic launch facilities, higher education institutions, and collaboration with private companies. The state's ongoing contributions to space exploration and development are a testament to Florida's role in shaping the future of human spaceflight and innovative aerospace industries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: New York Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony has been suspended one game without pay for confronting Boston's Kevin Garnett in the arena tunnel, near the players' locker rooms, and in the parking garage following Monday's game against the Boston Celtics at Madison Square Garden.      The NBA announced the suspension on Wednesday. Anthony served the suspension Thursday, when the Knicks lost 81-76 to the Indiana Pacers.      \\"There are no circumstances in which it is acceptable for a player to confront an opponent after a game,\\" NBA executive vice president basketball operations Stu Jackson said in a statement. \\"Carmelo Anthony attempted to engage with Kevin Garnett multiple times after Monday's game and therefore a suspension was warranted.\\"      Anthony said before the suspension was announced that he did not believe he deserved to be disciplined.      \\"If you just go off the actual facts of what happened, I don't think anything will happen,\\" Anthony said.      After he and Garnett were called for technical fouls for jawing at one another in the closing minutes of Monday's game, Anthony approached Garnett at the Celtics' team bus. Madison Square Garden security, New York City Police officers, team security and even Knicks coach Mike Woodson intervened before the incident could escalate.      Anthony said Tuesday that his \\"motivation\\" in finding Garnett after the game was to have a \\"one-on-one conversation\\" with him after the Boston big man spewed a verbal insult at Anthony.      \\"It's certain things that you just don't say to men, another man,\\" Anthony said Tuesday. \\"I felt that he crossed the line. Like I said, we're both at an understanding right now; we handled it the way we handled it. Nobody needs to know what was said behind closed doors. So that situation is handled.\\"      Anthony's teammate, Tyson Chandler, was on the floor at the time and agreed that Garnett crossed the line.      \\"I think it was a little too much, in all honesty,\\" Chandler said Wednesday in an appearance on \\"The Michael Kay Show\\" on ESPN New York 98.7 FM. \\"I felt like Melo wanted to have a conversation man to man (with Garnett), and I respect that.\\"      According to a source close to Anthony, he and Garnett had a phone conversation after the confrontation to clear the air.

It's the rough equivalent of a 1 fine for someone earning 40,000 per year.      Cuban is also no stranger to the NBA dinging him for cash since he bought the Mavericks in 2000. According to the Dallas Morning News, he's been docked a total of some 2 million in the 13 years since.      Cuban is exceptionally outspoken and candid on Twitter for a billionaire sports team owner, so it's not entirely surprising that his tweeting thumbs — rather than his sharp tongue — did him in this time.      But for all that trash talk, there's one team's fan base he says he won't mess with online — the Los Angeles Lakers.      “There is more Twitter courage in Southern California than probably any other part of the world,\\" Cuban said in November. “I could say ‘Kobe tied his shoe laces wrong’ and I’d probably get death threats on Twitter.”      What do you think about the NBA fining Mark Cuban for his tweet — Right?

It is explicitly mentioned that the vegan bakery franchise \\"currently operates in eight states,\\" therefore classifying it as a multi-state business. The exact term \\"several\\" is typically used to denote more than two but not many, it can be reasonably asserted that eight can be considered \\"several.\\" Further, the additional information provided about the company's appearance on the television show Shark Tank in 2014 and their decision to turn down a 200,000 investment offer from Robert Herjavec lends some context to the company's status and performance. It indicates that the company has garnered enough attention and value to be presented on a high visibility platform like Shark Tank and that it holds enough confidence in its business model to decline substantial financial investment. In addition, we learn that the company is not just operating in several states, but it does so using a franchise business model. This model is typically used by businesses that intend to expand their reach and operations in a cost-effective way, hinting at their growth and expansion strategy. Finally, their aspiration to open 100 locations by 2020 gives another indication of their ambition and potential scope of operation, making it a highly possible assumption that they are not only present in several states at the time of the information presented, but also have plans for future expansion, both within the existing states and possibly into new ones.

He asked the driver if he had ever seen him before. \\"No, sir,\\" the driver replied, \\"I have never seen you before.\\" Then he explained, \\"This morning's newspaper had a story about your being on vacation in Marseilles. This is the taxi stop where people who return from Marseilles always come. Your skin color tells me you have been on vacation. The ink spot on your right fingers suggests to me that you are a writer.

Can an eye damaged through fire works be repaired? Bain initial call, what does it entail? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"First, let's address the question about eye damage due to fireworks. Fireworks can cause varying degrees of eye injuries, such as corneal abrasions, superficial burns, retinal detachment, and even severe injuries due to chemical burns or impact from projectile objects. The reparability of an eye damaged by fireworks depends on the extent of the injury and the specific structures of the eye that are affected. It is important to seek immediate medical attention in any case of eye injury from fireworks. For minor injuries such as corneal abrasions or superficial burns, treatment may include antibiotic eye drops, lubricating eye drops, and pain management, allowing the eye to heal within a few days to weeks. However, more severe cases may require specialized medical intervention. In cases of retinal detachment, surgery is often necessary to reattach the retina and restore vision. There are various methods, such as scleral buckling, pneumatic retinopexy, or vitrectomy, depending on the extent of the detachment and the patient's specific circumstances. The prognosis for regaining vision depends on the extent of the detachment, the duration of the detachment, and the surgical intervention's success. In extremely severe cases, such as those involving chemical burns or significant physical injury, the eye may not be repairable, and the patient may experience permanent vision loss or need to undergo enucleation (removal of the eye). In these instances, eye prosthetics may be considered for cosmetic purposes. As for the second question, \\"Bain initial call, what does it entail?\\" it appears unrelated to the topic of eye damage caused by fireworks. The Bain initial call refers to the first phone call or communication a candidate has with a representative from Bain & Company, a global management consulting firm, during the recruitment process. During this call, the representative may discuss a candidate's background, qualifications, and interest in the company while also providing an overview of the firm's culture, values, and opportunities. The call serves as an initial screening to decide whether or not the candidate may be a suitable fit for the company and help the candidate decide if Bain & Company aligns with their career goals. In conclusion, these questions have different meanings. The first question relates to eye injury repair resulting from fireworks, while the second question relates to the recruitment process at a management consulting firm, Bain & Company. Each question covers separate topics and requires distinct information to address them effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: -  The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen  What might be the last step of the process? The answer is:","output":"The last step of the process is the oxygen diffusing from the capillaries into the body's cells, where it is used for cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the reaction of oxygen with glucose.

Rolling Stone described \\"Imagine\\" as Lennon's \\"greatest musical gift to the world\\", praising \\"the serene melody; the pillowy chord progression; [and] that beckoning, four-note [piano] figure\\". Robert Christgau called it \\"both a hymn for the Movement and a love song for his wife, celebrating a Yokoism and a Marcusianism simultaneously\\". Included in several song polls, in 1999, BMI named it one of the top 100 most-performed songs of the 20th century. Also that year, it received the Grammy Hall of Fame Award and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. \\"Imagine\\" ranked number 23 in the list of best-selling singles of all time in the UK, in 2000. In 2002, a UK survey conducted by the Guinness World Records British Hit Singles Book ranked it the second best single of all time behind Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". Gold Radio ranked the song number three on its \\"Gold's greatest 1000 hits\\" list.Rolling Stone ranked \\"Imagine\\" number three on its list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\", describing it as \\"an enduring hymn of solace and promise that has carried us through extreme grief, from the shock of Lennon's own death in 1980 to the unspeakable horror of September 11th.

Really want to shoot bird that starts tweeting outside our bedroom at 5:30am every day. And now that I'm in VA I can actually shoot it  Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","output":"The sentiment embodied by this tweet can be described as a combination of frustration, annoyance, and a desire for a practical, if extreme, solution to a recurring problem. The author appears to be significantly bothered by a bird that consistently begins tweeting outside their bedroom at 5:30 am every day, which disturbs their sleep and negatively affects their morning experience. The fact that this bird has managed to become such a nuisance suggests that the disturbance is significant enough to impact the author's mood and well-being. The tweet also implies a certain level of familiarity with and adaptability to the local culture and norms of Virginia (VA), likely meaning the author has recently moved there or is presently visiting. The mention of Virginia implies that the author is aware of local regulations and attitudes about firearms, suggesting that they may consider the state more accepting towards the use of guns for personal reasons in comparison to their previous location. The author's consideration of resorting to using a gun to literally shoot the problematic bird indicates that they may be feeling desperate for a solution to a seemingly small problem that has a considerable impact on their life. Moreover, the sentiment embodied in this tweet can be perceived as a desire for control over one's environment and personal space. By suggesting the option to shoot the bird, the author may be feeling empowered by the possibility to exercise control over the situation and prevent the irritating interruptions to their sleep. It conveys a sense of territoriality, where the author seeks to maintain a sense of peace and calm within their living space by addressing the disturbance caused by the bird. However, it's important to note that the sentiment could also be viewed as an exaggeration or an expression of exasperation. The author might not necessarily intend to go through with the action of shooting the bird, but instead uses the hyperbolic idea to emphasize the level of irritation and inconvenience the bird causes them. In conclusion, the sentiment embodied in this tweet is a blend of frustration, annoyance, a desire for control, adaptability to local norms, and potentially an element of exaggeration. The author's expression might serve as an indicator of their desperation to remedy a seemingly insignificant, yet highly infuriating situation that has a significant impact on their daily life and overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A 31-year-old Chicago man has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend, allegedly strangling her to death during a late-night fight on Tuesday. Daniel Kralik is being held on a 1 million bond in the relation to the slaying of Victoria McManus, 26, who he had been dating for two years. The couple had been living together for the past two months at her home in the 1200 block of North Rockwell Street, Assistant State’s Attorney Alexandra Molesky told The Chicago Sun-Times. Two weeks ago, the couple got into a fight because McManus, 26, had a relationship with another man, Molesky said.

McManus was found dead in her home in the 1200 block of North Rockwell Street in Chicago on Tuesday night. Kralik initially planned to move out and stay with friends, but the couple reconciled and continued living together. On Tuesday, the couple got into another fight at McManus’ apartment, authorities said. McManus left her residence while Kralik went to a friend’s place until he 'cooled off', Molesky said. Instead, Kralik stayed at McManus’ apartment and when she returned home the couple got into another argument in her bedroom, Molesky said. During the argument, Kralik allegedly strangled McManus with his hands. The roommate heard the muffled sounds of an argument and a brief struggle, Molesky said. Kralik called 911 and admitted that he strangled McManus after an argument. Police responded about 12:50 a.m. and arrested Kralik, authorities said. McManus was declared dead at the scene. McManus is believed to have recently started a relationship with another man, infuriating her boyfriend, who has now been charged with her murder. McManus was found lying on her bed with an abrasion on her forehead and a pillow covering her face, Molesky said. An autopsy confirmed McManus died of strangulation, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office. Kralik appeared in court wearing Thursday a white plastic jumpsuit because his clothes were taken as evidence. Judge Adam Bourgeois ordered Kralik held on 1 million bond and issued a next court date of June 4.

Context: New sexual harassment and racial discrimination lawsuits are rocking the already scandal riddled Fox News Channel. Three new lawsuits were filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Two allege racial harassment at Fox News, while a third alleges sexual harassment at Fox News Radio. The cases increase to 23 the number of past or present Fox employees represented by attorney Doug Wigdor, the majority having cases alleging racial hostility by a since-fired financial executive. Fox said Monday that the lawsuits have no legal basis. Kathleen Lee, a Fox News Radio employee of more than 10 years, alleges that radio anchor Ron Flatter subjected her to “unrelenting sexual harassment” after the network hired him in 2013. A former Fox employee, Adasa Blanco, said she alerted Fox executives about racially hostile behavior on the part of former Fox controller Judith Slater more than eight years before the executive was let go. Slater has denied charges of racially hostile conduct. Blanco, who is Hispanic, said that Slater made fun of her accent. In the lawsuit, Wigdor said Fox “knowingly harbored and protected” a racist employee for more than eight years and misrepresented to the public that it fired Slater quickly upon learning of her behavior. Naima Farrow, another former Fox employee who worked for Slater, said she was fired without warning or explanation in 2015, less than three days after telling superiors she was pregnant. Farrow, who is black, said Slater mockingly referred to her as “girlfriend.” Fox News said in a statement that it is committed to a diverse workplace free from discrimination, and takes any complaint seriously. In these cases, Fox “took prompt, effective and, when necessary, strong remedial action,” the network said. “We believe these latest claims are without legal basis and look forward to proving that the company at all times has acted appropriately, and lawfully, in connection with these matters.” The new legal claims come as Fox News is battling a series of...

On a busy Friday morning in Manhattan, nine pedestrians suffered bullet or fragment wounds after police unleashed a hail of gunfire at a man wielding a .45 caliber pistol who had just killed a former co-worker. The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said. Police identified the slain co-worker as Steven Ercolino, 41, who had apparently filed a prior complaint against his assailant, claiming that he thought Johnson would eventually try to kill him. Both men had filed harassment complaints against each other in April 2011, Kelly added. Ercolino was listed as a vice president of sales at Hazan Import Corp., according to his LinkedIn profile. \\"It's not something that should happen to a loving person like that,\\" said his brother, Paul. \\"He's going to be so missed by everybody.

People are sitting in the stands watching. the man","output":"is wearing a sports uniform and holding a ball in his hand. The anticipation in the air is palpable as the spectators eagerly await the start of the game. Based on this scenario, the most logical next event is that the man in the sports uniform will initiate the game by performing an action relevant to the specific sport being played. The type of sport remains unspecified in the given information, so we will consider three popular sports events to provide a comprehensive answer. 1. Soccer (Football): If the man is dressed in soccer attire and is holding a soccer ball, the most logical next event would be the commencement of the match with the man either kicking off the soccer ball or passing it to a teammate. The kickoff signifies the start of the game, and the two teams on the field will then compete against each other to score goals and ultimately determine the winner of the match. 2. American Football: If the man is wearing an American football uniform and is holding a football, the next most logical event could be that the man is the quarterback about to start an offensive play. This could involve the quarterback initiating a snap by having the center pass the football between his legs, taking the football, and then deciding whether to pass the ball to a teammate, hand it off to a running back, or run with the ball himself in an attempt to progress down the field and eventually score a touchdown. 3. Baseball: If the man is dressed in a baseball uniform and is holding a baseball, it would be logical to assume that he is either a pitcher or a batter. If he is a pitcher, the next event would be him throwing the ball towards the home plate in an attempt to strike out the batter. If he is the batter, the next event would involve him stepping up to the home plate, taking a swing at the incoming pitch, and attempting to hit the ball to reach a base or send it out of the park for a home run. Regardless of the specific sport being played, the most logical next event for this man, who is wearing a sports uniform and holding a ball on the field, is to initiate the game by participating in a crucial starting play that sets the stage for the ensuing competition between the two teams. The spectators in the stands will continue to watch and cheer, further adding to the excitement and intensity of the event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"The place where students run a number of news media outlets is a kind of?\\"  Context: \\"As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The place where students run a number of news media outlets can be referred to as a hub for student media or a student media center. At the University of Notre Dame, this vibrant and diverse student media ecosystem comprises various newspapers, magazines, journals, radio, and television stations, reflecting the interests and creativity of the student body. The student media hub at Notre Dame provides opportunities for students to engage in journalism, creative writing, and media production, allowing them to develop practical skills while contributing to the intellectual and cultural life of the university community. The nine student-run media outlets cater to a wide range of interests and offer an essential platform for free expression, open discourse, and the exchange of ideas within the university's academic environment. Among these outlets, the Scholastic magazine holds a special status as the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States, highlighting the long-standing tradition of student involvement in media at Notre Dame. The other magazine, The Juggler, is dedicated to showcasing student literature and artwork, emphasizing the importance of fostering artistic talent within the university community. The various newspapers, such as The Observer, Common Sense, and Irish Rover, reflect the diversity of opinions and concerns among students. These publications offer a platform for students to voice their thoughts and share valuable perspectives on university news, local and global events, and ideologically-driven issues. Through these newspapers, students are exposed to a wide array of viewpoints, which fosters critical thinking and promotes a healthy exchange of ideas. The Dome yearbook captures the memories, achievements, and milestones of each academic year, playing a significant role in preserving the university's history. Furthermore, the expansion of media channels, such as the radio and television station, underlines the commitment to embracing modern communication technologies and diversifying student media offerings. The emergence of newer publications like Beyond Politics, an undergraduate journal for political science research, highlights the importance of nurturing research interests among students and providing a platform for showcasing their work in a specialized journal. In conclusion, the place where students run a series of news media outlets at the University of Notre Dame can be described as a multifaceted student media hub that fosters creativity, provides valuable learning opportunities, and supports the expression of diverse ideas and perspectives within the university community. This vibrant and dynamic student media ecosystem significantly contributes to the intellectual and cultural richness of Notre Dame while serving as a model for other universities to follow and expand their own student-led media initiatives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Philanthropist Admits Stealing More Than 1 Million From Charity For most of his long and very public life as a philanthropist, William E. Rapfogel has been surrounded by powerful friends and politicians, chief among them Sheldon Silver, the New York State Assembly speaker. But as he sat in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Wednesday, about to plead guilty to a slew of criminal charges, Mr. Rapfogel was all alone. Grim-faced in a dark suit and black skullcap, Mr. Rapfogel quietly read passages from a well-thumbed copy of the Torah while his lawyers, Alan Vinegrad and Paul L. Shechtman, went over terms of a plea agreement. A few minutes later, Mr. Rapfogel, 59, stood before Justice Larry Stephen and admitted stealing more than 1 million from the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, the influential social service organization he had led for more than two decades. Mr. Rapfogel said he had overseen a scheme for 20 years, colluding with the owner of an insurance company and two other executives at the charity to overcharge the council for insurance policies and skim off cash. The state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said they had looted more than 9 million from the nonprofit. The plea marked a stunning downfall for a man once considered one of the New York City’s most respected philanthropists, whose work and close ties to Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, gave him influence and prominence in political circles. In the end, no one stood with Mr. Rapfogel as he pleaded guilty to grand larceny, money laundering, tax fraud and filing false documents to the city campaign finance board. His wife, Judy, the longtime chief of staff to Mr. Silver, was not there; neither was Mr. Silver, who over the years has allocated millions of public dollars to Met Council. Mr. Rapfogel will be sentenced to 31/3 to 10 years in prison and must pay 3 million in restitution to the charity; to date, he has repaid 1.8 million. If he fails to pay the full restitution by his sentencing date, July 16, he will be sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison, Gary T. Fishman, an assistant attorney general, said in court. Mr. Rapfogel, the former chief executive of the council, did not apologize publicly, and gave only a short explanation of what he had done, saying he had “knowingly helped steal more than 1 million from the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty as part of a scheme in which insurance premiums were overstated.” According to a plea agreement filed in court and an earlier criminal complaint, Mr. Rapfogel gave about 350,000 of the stolen funds to one of his three sons to buy a home. The agreement states the attorney general will not seek to recover that money from the son, who has not been identified, though Mr. Rapfogel has promised to pay it back. Neither Mr. Silver nor Ms. Rapfogel has been linked to the financial irregularities at the Met Council, and they have denied any knowledge of Mr. Rapfogel’s activities. The assembly speaker issued a terse statement about Mr. Rapfogel’s plea, saying simply: “I am deeply saddened by this entire episode.” Ms. Rapfogel declined to comment through a spokesman, Stu Loeser. An hour earlier, another defendant charged in the scheme, David Cohen, who was Mr. Rapfogel’s predecessor at the council, pleaded guilty to grand larceny and conspiracy before Justice Michael J. Obus. Mr. Cohen, 70, promised to pay back 650,000 that he said he had stolen from the charity starting in 1992, and he has already returned 500,000, prosecutors said. He will serve one year in prison under an agreement reached between his lawyer, Alan M. Abramson, and the attorney general’s office. Mr. Cohen, in his statement to the court, said he set up the scheme in 1992, conspiring with Herb Friedman, who was the chief financial officer, and Joseph Ross, the owner of Met Council’s insurance broker, Century Coverage Corporation. Mr. Ross, 58, admitted to his role in the fraud in December, pleading guilty to grand larceny, money laundering and tax fraud. Mr. Friedman was also arrested and will face conspiracy charges. At heart it was a simple scheme, Mr. Cohen said. The insurance company submitted inflated invoices to the council, which in turn paid the bills. Mr. Ross would then send the difference between the true cost of the insurance and the inflated amount to Mr. Cohen in cash. Mr. Cohen said in court that in the early years, the stolen money totaled about 20,000 to 30,000 a year. Six months after the scheme started, Mr. Rapfogel took over as the charity’s chief executive, and soon began getting a share of the money, Mr. Cohen said. In 1995, Mr. Rapfogel took over running the scheme; by 2013, Mr. Rapfogel was receiving 30,000 a month, Mr. Cohen said. Mr. Cohen, who is to be sentenced on July 9, said he and Mr. Rapfogel also funneled some of the illicit money to candidates running for office, asking Mr. Ross to make contributions not only in his name but also in the names of his employees and partners in the company. “These campaign contributions were made to politicians Willie and I thought would help Met Council — mainly, candidates for city elected offices,” Mr. Cohen told the judge. A criminal complaint filed against Mr. Ross said he had channeled at least 120,000 of the stolen funds to candidates for city office over the last 20 years. Met Council receives much of its funding through state and city grants and contracts, as well as from funds earmarked by individual lawmakers. Mr. Rapfogel’s scheme began to unravel last year after officials at Met Council received an anonymous letter detailing improprieties with insurance payments, and a law firm hired to investigate found evidence that the payments had been padded. Mr. Rapfogel, who received a 400,000 salary, was fired in August. That investigation prompted the attorney general and the state comptroller to start a criminal inquiry. Facing lengthy prison sentences, Mr. Ross, Mr. Friedman and Mr. Cohen all agreed to cooperate with investigators, according to defense lawyers. William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.

WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\\" Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \\"schizoid policy making.\\" Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \\"a horrifically chilling signal\\" that \\"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\\" On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies. \\"This is a fight born out of knowing who we are and fighting for the ideals of our country,\\" she said. Harris spoke after touring a detention facility and speaking with several mothers.​ Trump's call for Congress to postpone action came as House Republican leaders failed to garner enough support for two bills that would overhaul U.S. immigration laws and bolster border security. A hard-line measure authored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte failed to pass on... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is probably true about when immigration reform will take place? Options:  A. before the election in November  B. not enough information  C. after the election in November  D. after the next President is in office","output":"C. after the election in November Based on the information provided, President Trump urged Republicans to stop wasting time on immigration until after the mid-term elections in November, suggesting that he believes further action on immigration reform will likely take place after the elections. Additionally, the current political climate makes it difficult for any substantial immigration reform to pass due to the lack of consensus and the 60 votes needed for passage in the Senate. Therefore, it is probable that any significant progress on immigration reform will take place after the election in November."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is the answer: Who was Formula One Champion driver for 2013?","output":"The Formula One World Champion driver for 2013 was Sebastian Vettel, a German racing driver who has made his mark as one of the most successful and dominant drivers in the history of the motorsport. Born on July 3, 1987, in Heppenheim, Germany, Vettel made his Formula One debut in 2007 at the age of 19 and has since stacked up numerous records and achievements. The 2013 Formula One season was a particularly remarkable year for Vettel, who was driving for the Red Bull Racing team at the time. The young driver managed to clinch his fourth consecutive world championship, further solidifying his position among the all-time greats of Formula One racing. Having already won three world championships in a row (2010, 2011, and 2012), Vettel displayed immense skill and determination during the 2013 season, winning 13 of the 19 races that year, including a record-breaking nine consecutive victories in the last nine races of the season. This incredible performance saw him amass a total of 397 points, easily eclipsing the scores of his closest competitors, Fernando Alonso of Ferrari and Mark Webber of Red Bull Racing, who finished the season with 242 and 199 points, respectively. In clinching the 2013 Formula One World Championship, Vettel joined an elite group of drivers who have won four consecutive titles, including Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher. Additionally, his nine consecutive race wins matched the record held by Alberto Ascari since the 1952-1953 seasons. Beyond the 2013 season, Sebastian Vettel continued to build an impressive career in Formula One by joining Scuderia Ferrari in 2015, with whom he raced until 2020 before signing with the newly rebranded Aston Martin team (formerly Racing Point) for the 2021 season.

Options: - november - rainy - dull - wet - average  Explain why a human would choose \\"rainy\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"rainy\\" to answer the question above because of the following step-by-step reasoning: Step 1: Understand the question The question asks when beautiful lightning strikes happen, and provides a list of five options to choose from. Step 2: Assess the options The options are november, rainy, dull, wet, and average. A human would analyze these options to determine which one is most relevant to the occurrence of lightning. Step 3: Eliminate irrelevant options - November: This is a month, not a type of day, so it is irrelevant to the question. - Dull: This is an adjective that describes a lack of excitement or interest and doesn't directly relate to weather conditions. - Average: This adjective suggests no significant weather conditions, which makes it less likely for lightning to happen.  Step 4: Compare the remaining options Now, we are left with two options: rainy and wet. - Rainy: This describes a day with rain, which often results from stormy weather. Storms are associated with the occurrence of lightning, making this option a strong contender. - Wet: This simply describes the presence of moisture, which is not a direct indicator of storms or lightning but implies that rain has happened. Step 5: Choose the most appropriate option After comparing rainy and wet, a human would realize that \\"rainy\\" is the most relevant option to the occurrence of lightning. This is because storms, which are associated with lightning, are more likely to happen on a rainy day than a wet day which doesn't necessarily mean a storm is occurring. Therefore, a human would choose \\"rainy\\" to answer the question about what kind of day beautiful lightning strikes happen on."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Necrotizing fasciitis. Yes or no? Answer: Some published case reports have implied a possible link between use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and NF, though the evidence of the link was said to be weak because of a small number of case patients and it was unclear whether the drugs just masked the symptoms of a secondary infection or were a cause per se. Question: where do flesh eating bacteria live A:","output":"Flesh-eating bacteria, also known as Necrotizing fasciitis (NF), are caused by various types of bacteria, with the most common being Group A Streptococcus (GAS). These bacteria, including other types such as Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio vulnificus, and Clostridium perfringens, live in different environments. Here is where these bacteria can commonly be found: 1. Group A Streptococcus (GAS): These bacteria are commonly found in the throat and on the skin of healthy individuals without causing any infection. However, when they enter the body through cuts, wounds, or weakened immune systems, they can potentially cause NF. 2. Staphylococcus aureus: This bacterium can be found on the skin and in the nasal passages of healthy individuals. It generally causes mild skin infections, but when it enters deeper tissues, it can also lead to NF. 3. Vibrio vulnificus: This bacterium is commonly found in warm seawater, particularly in areas with high salinity and temperatures. Exposure to this bacterium can occur through open wounds when swimming in seawater or through consumption of contaminated seafood, potentially leading to NF. 4. Clostridium perfringens: These bacteria are typically found in soil, dust, and often in the human gastrointestinal tract. In rare cases, they can enter the body through open wounds, leading to NF. In summary, flesh-eating bacteria can live in various environments such as human skin, nasal passages, gastrointestinal tracts, soil, dust, and warm seawater. Infections caused by these bacteria usually occur when they enter the body through cuts or wounds, or in situations where the immune system is compromised."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM  Question 1. Alkalinity is the name given to the quantitative capacity of an aqueous solution to neutralize an acid, measuring alkalinity is important in determining a stream's ability to neutralize acidic pollution from acid rain, or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions, and which ph? Answer:","output":"Alkalinity, also referred to as acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC), is a critical parameter in assessing the ability of an aqueous solution or a stream to neutralize acidic pollutants, such as acid rain, and maintain a stable pH level. The measurement of alkalinity in water bodies is essential for understanding the ecological health and buffering capacity of water systems, as well as facilitating the management of water quality and protection of aquatic life. In general, alkalinity is primarily due to the presence of dissolved substances, such as bicarbonate (HCO3-), carbonate (CO32-), and hydroxide (OH-) ions, which can neutralize excessive hydrogen ions (H+) and reduce the acidity of water. These ions mainly originate from the weathering of rocks and minerals, dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and from within the water, and biological processes in the ecosystem. The pH scale, which ranges from 0 to 14, is a logarithmic measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution. A pH value of 7 is considered neutral, where the concentration of hydrogen ions is equal to that of hydroxide ions (OH-). When pH values are below 7, the solution is considered acidic, while values above 7 indicate that the solution is alkaline or basic. Acid rain refers to any form of unusually acidic precipitation, such as rain, snow, fog, or dew, with elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH) resulting from the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from anthropogenic sources, like burning fossil fuels, and some natural processes. The pH of unpolluted rain generally ranges from 5.0 to 5.6 due to the dissolution of carbon dioxide, while acid rain has a pH value between 4.2 and 4.4, and in extreme cases, it can be as low as 2. Concerning the relationship between alkalinity and pH, the ability of a stream to neutralize acidic pollution is directly linked to its alkalinity level; higher alkalinity tends to be associated with higher pH values and a better buffering capacity against acidity. Streams with low alkalinity are more susceptible to drastic pH changes that can harm aquatic life and destabilize the ecosystem. There is no specific pH value at which alkalinity is solely responsible for neutralizing acidic pollutants, as alkalinity depends on the concentration of bicarbonate, carbonate, and hydroxide ions in the water and their ability to buffer against pH changes. Still, alkaline waters generally have pH values above 7.  In conclusion, alkalinity represents the quantitative capacity of an aqueous solution, like a stream, to neutralize acidic pollution from acid rain or other forms of acidic precipitation with elevated levels of hydrogen ions. The measurement of alkalinity is vital for maintaining water quality and protecting aquatic life. Although there is no fixed pH value that solely represents alkalinity-induced neutralization, alkaline waters typically have pH values greater than 7, with better buffering capacities to counteract acidic inputs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Owls hunt around their hunting territory away from where they roost during the day - They sit still on a perch, like a stump of branch, and wait for prey - They use their highly sensitive hearing to locate prey that cannot be seen - They use their very keen vision to see prey in the dark - They fly silently, without flapping their wings, in order to surprise the prey - The owl silently glides or drops on its prey, grabbing it with its talons and beak - The owl eats the prey, or carries it back to its perch -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more deforestation occurs happens, how will it affect HELPING owls to hunt at night.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if more deforestation occurs, it will have an impact on the ability of owls to hunt at night. To understand how deforestation might affect the hunting process of owls, let's first examine the various stages of their hunting process and then consider the potential effects of deforestation on each of these stages. 1. Hunting territory: Owls typically hunt around their hunting territory, away from where they roost during the day. Deforestation can lead to the destruction of these habitats, reducing the available hunting grounds for owls. Areas of dense vegetation provide suitable nesting and roosting sites, so losing these can have an impact on the overall owl population.  2. Perching: Owls sit on perches like stumps or branches while waiting for prey. Deforestation results in the loss of trees that act as ideal perching spots for owls. Consequently, owls may have a harder time finding suitable spots to perch and, subsequently, hunt. 3. Sensitive hearing and keen vision: Owls rely on their highly sensitive hearing to locate prey that cannot be seen and their extremely keen vision to see prey in the dark. The reduction in tree cover caused by deforestation may create more open spaces, which could make it more challenging for owls to locate prey using their excellent hearing and vision. Predators often rely on camouflage to blend in with their surroundings, and a more open hunting ground might expose them more easily to potential prey. 4. Silent flight: Owls fly silently, without flapping their wings, to surprise their prey. Deforestation may affect air currents and wind patterns due to the loss of trees, which can impact an owl's silent flight. This may make it more difficult for owls to approach their prey undetected. 5. Prey capture: The owl silently glides or drops on its prey, grabbing it with its talons and beak. Deforestation can disrupt the ecosystem, leading to a reduced number of prey species, making it harder for owls to find and take down prey. With fewer available prey, owls may have to expend more time and energy hunting for food. 6. Consumption and transportation of prey: The owl eats the prey or carries it back to its perch. Deforestation may force owls to travel longer distances for food, expending more energy in the process. This could lead to nutritional stress and potential decline in owl populations. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of increased deforestation has both direct and indirect effects on the hunting process of owls. The loss of habitat, shifts in ecosystems, and changes in the availability of suitable hunting grounds can have negative consequences on the owl's ability to hunt effectively at night. Consequently, deforestation can significantly impact the long-term survival and success of owl populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Author and business consultant Jim Collins once called Jobs the \\"Beethoven of business\\". When asked what Steve Jobs will be best remembered for, many of us would name a particular product:the iPod, the iPhone or the iPad, for example. But in the eyes of Eric Jackson, a reporter with Forbes magazine, Jobs brought the world much more than these popular devices . Here are some of the lessons he taught us: 1. The most lasting inventions mix art and science. Jobs pointed out that the team members working with Apple were trained in anthropology , art, history, and poetry. He believed this was important in making Apple's products stand out. 2. Never fear failure. Jobs was fired by the successor he himself chose. It was one of the most public embarrassments  of the last 30 years in business. However, Jobs didn't hide away or try to get a new job. He _ and got back to work. 3. You can't look forward to connecting the dots--you can only look backward. This means that, however much we try to plan things ahead of time, life is always full of unexpected things. What seems like bitter pain and defeat could turn out to sow the seeds of unimaginable success in years to come. You can't connect the dots looking forward. But you have to trust that all the dots will be connected in the future. 4. Listen to that voice in tile back of your head that tells you if you're on the right track or not. Most of us simply decide that we're going to work in finance or become a doctor because it's what our parents tell us to do.

A deaf composer dubbed \\"Japan's Beethoven\\" confessed Wednesday to hiring someone to write his best-known works, leaving duped broadcaster NHK red-faced, and casting a cloud over a figure skater set to dance to his music in Sochi.      Mamoru Samuragochi, 50, shot to fame in the mid-1990s with classical compositions that provided the soundtrack to video games including Resident Evil, despite having had a degenerative condition that affected his hearing.      Samuragochi, who also spells his name Samuragoch, became completely deaf at the age of 35 but continued to work, notably producing \\"Symphony No.1, Hiroshima\\", a tribute to those killed in the 1945 atomic bombing of the city.      In 2001 Time magazine published an interview with him, calling him a \\"digital-age Beethoven\\".      \\"I listen to myself,\\" Samuragochi told the magazine. \\"If you trust your inner sense of sound, you create something that is truer. It is like communicating from the heart. Losing my hearing was a gift from God.\\"      Samuragochi's reputation grew when public broadcaster NHK aired a documentary in March last year entitled \\"Melody of the Soul\\", in which it showed the musician touring the tsunami-battered Tohoku region to meet survivors and those who lost relatives in the 2011 catastrophe.      The film shows Samuragochi playing with a small girl whose mother was killed in the disaster and apparently composing a requiem for her, despite his own struggles with illness.      Viewers flocked in their tens of thousands to buy his Hiroshima piece, which became an anthemic tribute to the tsunami-hit region and its determination to get back on its feet, known informally as the symphony of hope.      But on Wednesday morning the composer's life was revealed to have been a fraud, and an NHK anchor offered a fulsome apology for having aired the documentary.      \\"Through his lawyer, Mamoru Samuragochi confessed early Wednesday that he had asked another composer to create his iconic works,\\" said the anchor.      \\"NHK has reported on him in news and features programmes but failed to realise that he had not composed the works himself, despite our research and checking.\\"      The statement, seen by AFP, offered an unqualified mea culpa.      \\"Samuragochi is deeply sorry as he has betrayed fans and disappointed others. He knows he could not possibly make any excuse for what he has done,\\" it said.      A man claiming to be the mystery ghostwriter, Takashi Niigaki, issued a statement late Wednesday, claiming that he had worked for Samuragochi for 18 years, TV Asahi said.      NHK quoted Samuragochi as saying his deception had begun nearly two decades ago.      \\"I started hiring the person to compose music for me around 1996, when I was asked to make movie music for the first time,\\" he said.      \\"I had to ask the person to help me for more than half the work because the ear condition got worse.\\"      Japanese Winter Olympics medal hopeful, figure skater Daisuke Takahashi, has also been caught up in the row.      Takahashi's programme in Sochi includes a dance to a sonatina allegedly composed by Samuragochi that was unveiled two years ago, although in a statement posted on his website, Takahashi said none of his entourage had any knowledge of the deception and there were no plans to change the music.      Nippon Columbia Co, which has sold his CDs and DVDs, said in a statement that the company was \\"flabbergasted and deeply infuriated\\" by his revelation.      \\"We had been assured by him that he himself composed the works,\\" it said.      A Nippon Columbia spokesman admitted that \\"Symphony No.1, Hiroshima\\" was an extraordinary hit for a classical music CD, selling 180,000 copies in a genre where a hit often only logs 3,000 sales.      \\"But the company has decided to halt the shipment of his works,\\" he said, adding legal action against the fake composer was under consideration.      oh/hg/lm ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Listen to an excerpt from Symphony No. 1 Hiroshima: Tokyo Symphony Orchestra / Naoto Otomo, courtesy DENON      A deaf composer who has been dubbed \\"Japan's Beethoven\\" has admitted hiring someone else to write his music for nearly two decades.      Mamoru Samuragochi shot to fame in the mid-1990s and is most famous for his Hiroshima Symphony No 1, dedicated to those killed in the 1945 atomic blast.      The 50-year-old has now confessed he has not composed his own music since 1996.      The real composer of the musician's \\"hits\\" has not been formally named.      According to Japanese media, though, a man named Takashi Niigaki issued a statement on Wednesday claiming to be the \\"ghost\\" composer and to have worked for Samuragochi for 18 years.      According to his now defunct website, Samuragochi was taught how to play the piano by his mother when he was four and began playing Beethoven and Bach when he was 10.      He made his first breakthrough creating music for video games including Resident Evil and Onimusha.      He completely lost his hearing when he was 35 but continued to compose music, apparently relying on his \\"absolute pitch\\".      His Hiroshima Symphony No 1, completed in 2003, became a major classical music hit, selling more than 100,000 copies in Japan.      It went on to become an anthemic tribute known informally as the \\"Symphony of Hope\\", after Samuragochi was filmed meeting survivors in the tsunami-battered Tohoku region in 2011.

However his campaign is damaged by the revelation of his affair with one of his supporters, when Cam accidentally leaves a sexually explicit voice message on a local family's answering machine. The corrupt businessmen brothers Glenn and Wade Motch (Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow) use this opportunity to convince Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), tourism director for the town of Hammond and son of one of their associates, Raymond Huggins, to run against Cam on the Republican ticket, as part of a plan to profit from dealings with a Chinese company. Cam at first underestimates Marty and humiliates him by playing a video biography highlighting potentially embarrassing aspects of Marty's life. The Motch brothers then hire Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott) to be Marty's campaign manager. Tim reinvents Marty as a successful entrepreneur and family man. Marty's popularity rises due to his effective campaign while Cam's is further damaged when he accidentally punches a baby when intending to hit Marty.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Bats fly through an area - The bat makes sounds with their mouth or nose - The sound waves travel away from the bat - The sound waves hit objects - The sound waves bounce off the objects back towards the bat - The bat hears the sound waves echoing off the objects - The bat knows where the objects are because of where the sound echoed from Answer:","output":"The final step of the process described above is the bat using the information gathered from the echolocation process to navigate its surroundings, avoid obstacles, locate prey, and perform other essential functions for its survival. In more detail, once the bat has successfully detected the presence, distance, and location of objects in its environment through the echolocation process, it must analyze and interpret this information to make decisions on how to react and adapt to its surroundings. This step involves the integration of sensory input and cognitive processing, allowing the bat to effectively use echolocation in various scenarios and contexts. For example, when hunting insects, a bat would interpret the echoed sound waves to determine the precise distance, size, and speed of the prey, in order to make a well-timed swoop and successfully catch it. Bats may also use echolocation to identify specific prey species, by recognizing the unique echolocation signatures of different insects. The bat's incredible auditory processing skills allow it to make these determinations in real-time, and make split-second adjustments to its flight path as needed. When navigating through its environment, the bat would use echolocation to avoid collisions with obstacles such as trees and buildings, by detecting the echoes reflected off of these surfaces and adjusting its flight path accordingly. Bats also use echolocation for social purposes, such as communicating with other bats and avoiding in-flight collisions within their roost. In summary, the final step of the process initiated by a bat flying through an area and using echolocation to detect objects in its surroundings is the interpretation and utilization of this information to effectively navigate, hunt, and interact within its environment. The bat's remarkable ability to process and make use of the auditory data gathered through echolocation reflects its advanced cognitive capabilities and adaptability, enabling it to thrive in diverse ecological niches."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Lancy is a municipality of the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland.  - The Republic and Canton of Geneva (; ) is the French-speaking westernmost canton or state of Switzerland, surrounded on almost all sides by France. As is the case in several other Swiss cantons (e.g. Ticino, Neuchâtel, and Jura), this canton is referred to as a republic within the Swiss Confederation.  - A photographer (the Greek  (\\"phos\\"), meaning \\"light\\", and  (\\"graphê\\"), meaning \\"drawing, writing\\", together meaning \\"drawing with light\\") is a person who makes photographs.  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - Eastern Christianity consists of four main church families: the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Assyrian Church of the East, as well as the Eastern Catholic Churches (that are in communion with Rome but still maintain an Eastern liturgy). The term is used in contrast with Western Christianity (namely the Latin Church and Protestanism). Eastern Christianity consists of the Christian traditions and churches that developed in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia Minor, the Balkans, Southern India and parts of the Far East over several centuries. The term does not describe a single communion or religious denomination. Some Eastern churches have more in common historically and theologically with Western Christianity than with one another. The various Eastern churches do not normally refer to themselves as \\"Eastern\\", with the exception of the Assyrian Church of the East and its offshoots.  - An angel, especially according to Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, is a spiritual being superior to humans in power and intelligence. Angels are typically described as benevolent, dreadful, and endowed with wisdom and knowledge of earthly events, but not infallible; for they strive with each other, and God has to make peace between them. Most of them serve either as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits. They are studied in the theological doctrine of angelology. In Christian Science, the word \\"angel\\" is used to refer to an inspiration from God. The use of the term has extended to refer to artistic depictions of the spirits, and it is also used figuratively to refer to messengers and harbingers, and to people who possess high qualities of goodness, purity, selflessness, intelligence, and/or beauty.  - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  - An icon (from Greek \\"eikn\\" \\"image\\") is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from Eastern Christianity and certain Eastern Catholic churches. The most common subjects include Christ, Mary, saints and/or angels. Though especially associated with \\"portrait\\" style images concentrating on one or two main figures, the term also covers most religious images in a variety of artistic media produced by Eastern Christianity, including narrative scenes.  - A photograph or photo is an image created by light falling on a light-sensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic medium such as a CCD or a CMOS chip. Most photographs are created using a camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see. The process and practice of creating photographs is called photography. The word \\"photograph\\" was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based on the Greek  (\\"phos\\"), meaning \\"light\\", and  (\\"graphê\\"), meaning \\"drawing, writing\\", together meaning \\"drawing with light\\".  - Nicolas Bouvier ( March 6 , 1929 , Lancy -- February 17 , 1998 ) was a 20th - century Swiss traveller , writer , icon painter and photographer .

Follow the steps below: Step 1: Combine like terms The equation has two terms with b, 252*b and -190*b. Combine these terms to simplify the equation.  0 = (252*b - 190*b) + 310 By subtracting -190*b from 252*b, you'll get: 0 = 62*b + 310 Step 2: Isolate b Now that you have simplified the equation, isolate b by moving the constant term, 310, to the other side of the equation. To do this, subtract 310 from both sides: 0 - 310 = 62*b + 310 - 310 This simplifies to: -310 = 62*b Step 3: Solve for b Lastly, to solve for b, you need to get b alone by dividing both sides of the equation by 62: -310 / 62 = 62*b / 62 The simplified equation is: b = -5 So, the solution for the equation 0 = 252*b - 190*b + 310 is b = -5."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The answer to the question: What building's opening did the artist who joined Royal Academy Schools in 1807 attend in 1838? is inside the article: William Etty  (10 March 1787 – 13 November 1849) was an English artist best known for his history paintings containing nude figures.

There he studied under Thomas Lawrence and trained by copying works by other artists. Etty earned respect at the Royal Academy of Arts for his ability to paint realistic flesh tones, but had little commercial or critical success in his first few years in London. Etty's Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia, painted in 1821, featured numerous nudes and was exhibited to great acclaim. Its success prompted several further depictions of historical scenes with nudes. All but one of the works he exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s contained at least one nude figure, and he acquired a reputation for indecency. Despite this, he was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, and in 1828 was elected a Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. Although he was one of the most respected artists in the country he continued to study at life classes throughout his life, a practice considered inappropriate by his fellow artists. In the 1830s Etty began to branch out into the more lucrative but less respected field of portraiture, and later became the first English painter to paint significant still lifes. He continued to paint both male and female nudes, which caused severe criticism and condemnation from some elements of the press. An extremely shy man, Etty rarely socialised and never married. From 1824 until his death he lived with his niece Betsy (Elizabeth Etty). Even in London he retained a keen interest in his native York, and was instrumental in the establishment of the town's first art school and the campaign to preserve York city walls. While he never formally converted..., can you guess it ?

The anonymous writer claimed, \\"These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed liners to this coast, or even followed the Deutschland herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children.\\" The writer concluded, \\"This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh.\\"Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The art of public speaking began in ancient Greece over 2,000 years ago. Now, twitter, e-mail, blogs and QQ chat offer approaches to communication-- but none can replace the role of a great speech. The spoken word can handle various important functions: persuading or inspiring, informing, paying tribute  , entertaining, or simply introducing someone. Persuading is used in dealing with or _ different points of view. When the leaders met in Copenhagen in December, 2009, persuasive words from activities encouraged them to take former action. Inspirational speeches deal with emotions. They focus on topics and matters that are close to people' s hearts. Last year, during the fighting in Iraq, generals used inspiring speeches to prepare the troops for battle. Some speeches spread knowledge and deepen understanding. When the H1N1 flu was announced, the disease scared many people. Informtive speechs from World Health Organization (WTO) officials helped people to keep their panic under control so they could take necessary preventive measures. Sad events are never easy to deal with but a speech that pays tribute to the loss of a loved one and gives praise for their contribution can be comforting. Madonna's speech about Michael Jackson after his death showed the fact that he will continue to live on through his music. It's not only in world forums where public speaking plays an important role. It can also be helpful in the course of our own life. You may be asked to do a presentation at college or work to inform others about an area of great importance. On a more personal level, a friend may be upset and need comforting. Or you might be asked to introduce a speaker at a family gathering or to speak at a wedding, where your language will be needed to move people or make them laugh. Great speaking ability is not something we're born with. Even Barack Obama works hard to perfect every speech.

Bison injures woman posing for selfie at Yellowstone Park Thursday, July 23, 2015, 9:35 AM YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. — Yellowstone National Park officials are warning tourists to keep their distance after a bison flipped a woman into the air as she posed for a selfie with the massive beast. The dangerous encounter was the fifth run-in between park-goers and buffalo this year. Park officials said the 43-year-old Mississippi woman turned her back on the animal to get a photo with it near the Fairy Falls trailhead just outside Old Faithful. Someone nearby saw the woman and her daughter about 6 yards from the animal and warned they were too close just before it came at them. They tried to run, but the bison caught the woman and tossed her with its head. The woman’s family drove her to a nearby clinic where she was treated for minor injuries. “The (woman) said they knew they were doing something wrong but thought it was OK because other people were nearby,” park spokeswoman Amy Bartlett said. “People are getting way too close.” In separate incidents earlier this year, bison gored a 68-year-old woman and a 16-year-old girl and tossed an off-trail teenager and an Australian tourist into the air. Five bison encounters resulting in injuries is unusual during a tourist season, Bartlett said. “We typically have one or two per year,” she said. One factor that could be contributing to added encounters is increased attendance at the park this year, Bartlett said. The park had more than 780,000 recreational visits in June, a 17 percent increase over June 2014 and 12 percent more than the previous record set in June 2010. July and August are the busiest months of the year for tourists. Yellowstone prohibits people from getting within 25 yards of bison and within 100 yards of bears and wolves.

The woman sustained minor injuries and was treated at a nearby clinic. 4.

Here is a question about this article: Contributions from governments and the private sector to UNFPA in 2014 exceeded 1 billion. The amount includes 477 million to the organization’s core resources and 529 million earmarked for specific programs and initiatives. What is the answer to this question: How much of its funding was earmarked?","output":"In 2014, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) received contributions from governments and the private sector exceeding 1 billion. These contributions were divided into two categories: core resources and earmarked funding. Earmarked funding refers to contributions designated for specific programs and initiatives. In this case, out of the total 1 billion contributions to the UNFPA, 529 million was earmarked for specific programs and initiatives. This means that over half of the funding received by UNFPA during that year was designated for particular purposes decided by the contributors, rather than being under the discretion of the organization. It's important to note that earmarked funding ensures that the contributor's priorities are addressed directly while offering transparency and demonstrating the impact of their funding. However, this also can pose certain challenges for the organizations, as they have to manage a higher degree of restrictions on the usage of funds and might encounter difficulties with long-term planning and sustainability. On the other hand, core resources such as the 477 million received by UNFPA in 2014 function as unrestricted funds that the organization can allocate and use according to their internal priorities and strategies. These funds provide more flexibility and autonomy in decision-making, which can help an organization in addressing pressing issues, implementing long-term plans, and allocating resources more efficiently. In conclusion, among the 1 billion contributions received by UNFPA in 2014, 529 million was earmarked for specific programs and initiatives, reflecting government and private sector priorities for leveraging their financial support while addressing global population and development challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"For example, in Standard English , one may say I am or he is, but not \\"I is\\" or \\"he am\\".\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"Absolutely, it would be a very reasonable answer. To elaborate, in the realm of linguistics and grammar, 'agreement' refers to the way in which different parts of a sentence must adjust in form to have a grammatically consistent relationship with one another. This agreement occurs in several essential linguistic features, such as number, person, gender, and case. Your example – \\"I am\\" versus \\"I is\\" or \\"he am\\" versus \\"he is\\" – is a perfect illustration of agreement in terms of person and number in English grammar. In English, verbs need to agree with their subjects in both number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, or third person). The verb \\"to be\\" in the present tense, for instance, becomes \\"am\\" with the first person singular pronoun \\"I\\", \\"is\\" with the third-person singular pronouns \\"he\\", \\"she\\", or \\"it\\", and \\"are\\" with the second-person singular and all plural subjects. In the phrase \\"I am\\", the subject \\"I\\" is in the first person singular, and it agrees with the verb \\"am\\" which is also in the first person singular. Similarly, in the phrase \\"he is\\", the subject \\"he\\" is in the third person singular, and it agrees with the verb \\"is\\", which is also in the third person singular. These examples follow the conventions of standard English grammar. However, in the sentence \\"I is\\" or \\"he am\\", the subject and the verb do not match in terms of person; \\"I\\" is a first person pronoun, but \\"is\\" is a third person form of \\"to be\\", and \\"he\\" is a third person pronoun while \\"am\\" is a first person form of \\"to be\\". The lack of consistency between the subject and the verb in terms of person makes these sentences incorrect according to the conventional rules of English, demonstrating how crucial agreement is to grammatical relationships. Overall, the concept of agreement is fundamental in ordering the relationships between different parts of a sentence and in ensuring that sentences in a language are grammatically accurate. Without agreement, there are potentially numerous different ways one could structurally arrange a language, leading to confusion and misunderstanding. Therefore, agreement helps maintain the clarity and comprehensibility of language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Question: who produces a sketch of the Frankenstein monster ? Movie title: Gods and Monsters Movie plot: The story opens in the 1950s, after the Korean War; it has been more than a decade since James Whale, director of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, has retired. He lives with his long-time housemaid, Hanna, who loyally cares for him but disapproves of his homosexuality. Whale has suffered a series of strokes that have left him fragile and tormented by memories: growing up as a poor outcast, his tragic World War I service, and the filming of The Bride of Frankenstein. Whale slips into his past, and indulges in his fantasies, reminiscing about gay pool parties and also sexually teasing an embarrassed, starstruck fan who comes to interview him. Whale battles depression, at times contemplating suicide, as he realizes his life, his attractiveness, and his health are slipping away. Whale befriends his young, handsome gardener and former Marine, Clayton Boone and the two begin a sometimes uneasy friendship as Boone poses for Whale's sketches. The two men bond while discussing their lives and dealing with Whale's spells of disorientation and weakness from the strokes. Boone, impressed with Whale's fame, watches The Bride of Frankenstein on TV as his friends mock the movie, his friendship with Whale, and Whale's intentions. Boone assures Whale that he is straight and receives assurance from Whale that there is no sexual interest, but Boone storms out when Whale graphically discusses his sexual history. Boone later returns with the agreement that no such \\"locker room\\" discussions occur again. Boone is invited to escort Whale to a party hosted by George Cukor for Princess Margaret.

The answer to the question: What are the names of the two people who the genre of Chinese travel literature became popular with? is inside the article: The visual arts during the Song dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as \\"treatise on a place\\", or fangzhi, replaced the old \\"map guide\\", or tujing, during the Song dynasty.The imperial courts of the emperor's palace were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist as well as a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177).

As for the Italians, we know that Paesiello, who was a famous intriguer against his musical rivals, was a devoted husband whose wife was an invalid and who died soon after her death. Cherubini married Mademoiselle Cecile Turette, when he was thirty-five, and the marriage was not a success. He left a son and two daughters. Spontini, one of whose best operas was based on the life of that much mis-married enthusiast for divorce, John Milton, took to wife a member of the Erard family. In the outer world Spontini was famous for his despotism, his jealousy, his bad temper, and his excessive vanity. None of these qualities as a rule add much to home comfort, and yet, it is said that he lived happily with his wife. We may feel sure that some of the bad light thrown on his character is due purely to the jealousy of rivals, when we consider his domestic content, his ardent interest in the welfare of Mozart's widow and children, and the great efforts he made to secure subscriptions for the widow's biography of Mozart.

So this happened when I was 16 year old. I belong to a very humble and conservative family, from Indore. @I never had a lot of exposure to guys, until we went to attend a marriage of one of our wealthy relatives in Delhi.. it was one of the best times I had, as we had a group of 4–5 similar aged cousins, though most of them were very distant relatives. One of them was a 19 year old dude, and he was kind of cute. But I never thought I would have this urge to you know… it was teenage and everything seemed new and exciting. So the second day, after having roamed all around Noida, we finally returned to our hotel and that guy accompanied me to my room. I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth …and he kept rolling his tongue on mine. It was my first kiss, and I don't regret it. The warmth of his mouth, the wetness of his lips and his breath felt like the only thing I ever wanted. I was a teen so please not judge. Sadly… before we could proceed, rest of our cousins called us to play Antakhshree with them. Never have we met since, but we often exchange messages on Facebook.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. One of the key components to a healthy and fulfilling relationship is offering your partner support for their personal endeavors. Your partner was a model before they met you and, if they continue their career, understand they will sometimes have to sacrifice spending time with you to further their career. Ask them how work is going. Listen to them vent or talk about upcoming jobs they’re excited for. On the flip side, don’t get angry if your partner decides to leave modeling to follow another career path. Most models don’t spend their entire lives modeling. Getting angry over their decision to leave may communicate that you’re only with their for their fame and hurt your relationship. If your partner has gained considerable fame, your relationship will inevitably end up within the public eye. Once things start getting serious between the two of you, sit down with them to discuss your privacy as a couple. It’s okay if you’re fine with the spotlight, but it’s also okay if you want more privacy. One point to consider is whether you’re okay with being photographed with your partner while on dates and attending events. Do you want to be mentioned on their social media and in interviews? Being a model requires a lot of traveling to different job locations and events. You won’t always be able to accompany your partner to different areas, so you will have to discuss whether you’re okay with long distance relationships and how you’ll communicate during these periods.  Web messenger clients like LINE and Telegram are great for keeping in touch over long distances, since they don’t require specific network signals to function. Facetime and Skype can help you talk in a more face to face manner. Setting aside time to spend together will strengthen your relationship, especially if you’re indulging in a common interest. Cook meals with your partner. Cuddle together as you watch a television show or movie you both love. Take dancing classes together to learn a fun new skill. Enjoy your time with each other as much as you can to keep your relationship strong. Fame aside, your partner is still a regular person and will appreciate being treated that way. Don’t let their fame go to your head. Always remember who they are and what you love about them as a person, whether it’s their passion for a particular hobby or a charming personal quirk.","output":"Support your partner's modeling career by understanding their need for flexibility, discussing privacy and long-distance communication, engaging in shared interests, and treating them as a regular person regardless of fame."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hercules was once destined to be the King of Mycenae as his father Zeus had planned but his jealous stepmother Hera had other plans. Hera not willing a bastard son of Zeus should overshadow her, decided to let another boy, Eurystheus, his cousin born first which deprived Hercules of the right. Hera tried to kill Hercules with two serpents but he strangles them both. As the years go by, Hercules displayed strength like no other boy his age which unknown to many, his father is really Zeus. Eurystheus was then declared king after winning a race. Unable to accept his defeat, Hercules challenged Eurystheus to another round which accidentally takes away the life of his mother Alcmene. Feeling guilty even with all the consolation Megara gives him, he goes to the oracle and consults Apollo who tells him he must perform the \\"Twelve Labors\\" for Eurystheus. He refuses at first until the guilt goes so deep that he gives in to the challenge. Hercules is given a series of challenges each one was designed tougher by the other by his stepmother Hera. He was first sent to kill the Nemean lion which he succeeded into turning his coat. He also drove away the Stymphalian birds with the help of Athena's cymbals. Each one was made difficult by the other as his stepmother hopes to see the last of him. A series of labors are shown like the slaying of the Lernaean Hydra, catching the stag of Artemis, the Cathmanian boar, the Cretan bull, cleaning the Augeean stables, getting the girdle of Hippolyte, the man-eating mares of Diomedes and the Cattle of Geryon (but the monster is not shown). When asked to get the Golden Apples of the Hesperides, he does not get permission so he goes to Atlas who gets the apples for him.

Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.  - Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines.  - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo.  - African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of musics and musical genres largely developed by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War.  - A trumpet is a musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \\"buzzing\\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape.   - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area.

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Vic Lewis (29 July 1919  9 February 2009) was a British jazz guitarist and bandleader.

Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Food on what kind of transport is normally freeze dried or dehydrated? Possible A: friend's house, bicycle, space shuttle, kitchen, disneyland  Why is \\"space shuttle\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Space shuttle\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for the given question because: 1. Context of the question: The question asks about the type of transport where food is normally freeze-dried or dehydrated. This implies that the transport would be unusual or have specific conditions that require preserving food in such a way. 2. Nature of other options: Comparing \\"space shuttle\\" to the other options (friend's house, bicycle, kitchen, and Disneyland), none of them are a form of transport. A friend's house and kitchen are static places, Disneyland is a theme park, and a bicycle is used for short-distance transport where people usually don't require a specific food preservation method. 3. Specific conditions in space: The space shuttle (and space travel in general) presents unique conditions such as microgravity, limited storage, and the need for long-lasting provisions that are lightweight and easy to prepare. These factors make freeze-dried and dehydrated food ideal for consumption on a space shuttle. Freeze-dried food retains nutritional value, has a long shelf life, is lightweight, and is easily rehydrated. 4. Precedence: Historically, freeze-dried and dehydrated food has been used by astronauts during space missions due to the reasons stated above. This is a well-established concept bolstered by examples from real-life space missions. Given these factors, selecting \\"space shuttle\\" as the answer to the question aligns with human common sense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

After the death of Charles XII, Sweden still refused to make peace with Russia on Peter's terms. Despite a continued Swedish naval presence and strong patrols to protect the coast, small Russian raids took place in 1716 at Öregrund, while in July 1717 a Russian squadron landed troops at Gotland who raided for supplies. To place pressure on Sweden, Russia sent a large fleet to the Swedish east coast in July 1719. There, under protection of the Russian battlefleet, the Russian galley fleet was split into three groups. One group headed for the coast of Uppland, the second to the vicinity of Stockholm, and the last to coast of Södermanland. Together they carried a landing force of nearly 30,000 men. Raiding continued for a month and devastated amongst others the towns of Norrtälje, Södertälje, Nyköping and Norrköping, and almost all the buildings in the archipelago of Stockholm were burned. A smaller Russian force advanced on the Swedish capital but was stopped at the battle of Stäket on 13 August. Swedish and British fleets, now allied with Sweden, sailing from the west coast of Sweden but failed to catch the raiders. After treaty of Frederiksborg in early 1720, Sweden was no longer at war with Denmark, which allowed more forces to be placed against the Russians. This did not prevent Russian galleys from raiding the town of Umeå once again. Later in July 1720 a squadron from the Swedish battlefleet engaged the Russian galley fleet in the battle of Grengam. While the result of the battle is contested, it ended Russian galley raids in 1720. As negotiations for peace did not progress, the Russian galleys were once again sent to raid the Swedish coast in 1721, targeting primarily the Swedish coast between Gävle and Piteå.

But comets are not made of solid rocks like planets. A comet is a ball of dust, stones, and ice. Many people call comets dirty snowballs. The \\"snowball\\" may be only a few miles across. But when the sun heats the \\"snowball,\\" much of it is changed to gases. The gases spread out and form the comet's head, which may be thousands of miles across. A comet moves fast in its trip around the sun. But when we see it, the comet does not seem to move. That's because it is so far away. The moon moves fast, but when you look at it, you can't see any motion . That's because the moon is far away. Each year astronomers discover new comets. Some of them are seen only once. They make one trip around the sun and then go away out into space. The sun's gravity cannot hold them. Other comets, like Halley, keep returning. They have been captured by the sun. Halley's earliest visit was probably 3,000 years ago. It may keep returning for another 3,000 years. But every time a comet goes around the sun, the comet loses part of itself. Gases and dust are pulled out of the comet. That's why Halley is now dimmer than it used to be. Next time it visits us, in 2062, it may be even dimmer. Each visit it may get dimmer and dimmer, until it finally disappears. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. What is a dirty snowball? 2. What is it composed of? 3. Where do they travel? 4. Does something else travel around the sun? 5. How are they different than comets? 6. Do all comets make just one trip around the sun? 7. Why do some comets only go around once? 8. What is Halley? 9. When was Halley first seen? 10. How long will it be around?","output":"1. A dirty snowball is a colloquial term used to describe a comet because of its composition and appearance. It is a metaphorical way to represent the mixture of dust, stones, and ice found in a comet. 2. A dirty snowball (comet) is composed of dust, stones, and ice, with the majority of its composition being ice. The icy core, or nucleus, usually contains frozen water along with other frozen gases such as methane, ammonia, and carbon dioxide. 3. Dirty snowballs (comets) travel in elliptical orbits around the Sun from different regions of our solar system. They come from either the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud, at the outer edges of the solar system, and move toward the Sun when disturbed by various forces. 4. Yes, other celestial bodies, such as planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and meteoroids, also travel around the Sun. These objects orbit the Sun due to its gravitational influence on them. 5. Comets are different from other celestial bodies that travel around the Sun, primarily in their composition and origin. Unlike solid, rocky planets, comets are made up of ice, dust, and rocky materials. Additionally, comets originate from the outer edges of the solar system, whereas planets and other celestial bodies can be found closer to the Sun. 6. No, not all comets make just one trip around the Sun. Some comets have orbits that repeatedly bring them back near the Sun, while others may make a single pass before being ejected out of the solar system or disintegrating. 7. Some comets only go around the Sun once because they become gravitationally unbound from the solar system. This can occur if their orbits are influenced by the gravity of other celestial bodies or if they get too close to the Sun and disintegrate. 8. Halley is a well-known, short-period comet officially known as Halley's Comet. It is named after the English astronomer Edmond Halley, who first recognized that its recorded appearances at regular intervals were of the same comet. 9. Halley's Comet was first seen and recorded by Chinese astronomers in 240 BCE. Edmond Halley, however, used earlier observations of this comet to calculate and predict its return about 1700 years later, in 1758. 10. Halley's Comet is predicted to be around for several thousand more years as it continues to orbit the Sun. However, with each visit, the comet loses part of itself due to the Sun's heat, causing it to become dimmer. Eventually, it may disappear altogether after thousands of years of repeated passes around the Sun."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: HIGH (Human Growth Hormone) could be the favorite drug at the next athletic world championships, and we might never know it. It is a natural substance  produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles  to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover  more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later. Question: Besides making them stronger, why is taking HGH attractive for some athletes?

Answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Cluster sampling. Yes or no? Answer: Cluster sampling is a sampling technique used when \\"natural\\" but relatively homogeneous groupings are evident in a statistical population . Question: what is the difference between multistage and cluster sampling Answer:","output":"Yes, your definition of cluster sampling is correct. Cluster sampling is a probability sampling technique where researchers divide the population into distinct, non-overlapping groups called \\"clusters\\" based on shared characteristics. These clusters are then randomly selected, and all members within each selected cluster are included in the sample. Cluster sampling is often used when the population is geographically dispersed or when no complete list of the population is available. Now, let's discuss the difference between multistage and cluster sampling: Multistage sampling is a more complex form of probability sampling that involves multiple stages of selection. It is an extension of cluster sampling, and it combines two or more sampling techniques, usually stratified and cluster sampling. In multistage sampling, the population is sequentially divided into smaller groups, which are then sampled at each stage. In contrast to cluster sampling, where all members within each selected cluster are included in the sample, multistage sampling involves selecting only a subset of members from each cluster in the later stages. This approach allows researchers to focus on specific segments of the population while reducing the time and costs associated with data collection. To summarize, the main difference between multistage and cluster sampling is as follows: 1. Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into distinct clusters and then randomly selecting some clusters for inclusion in the sample. All members within the selected clusters are included in the sample. 2. Multistage sampling is a more complex probability sampling technique that involves dividing the population into smaller groups at different stages and then selecting members based on certain criteria. It is an extension of cluster sampling and combines multiple sampling techniques. Overall, both methods are used to study large and geographically dispersed populations, but multistage sampling allows for more focused and efficient sampling due to the hierarchical selection process."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article:  Argentina: The torch relay leg in Buenos Aires, Argentina, held on April 11, began with an artistic show at the Lola Mora amphitheatre in Costanera Sur. In the end of the show the mayor of Buenos Aires Mauricio Macri gave the torch to the first torchbearer, Carlos Espínola. The leg finished at the Buenos Aires Riding Club in the Palermo district, the last torchbearer being Gabriela Sabatini. The 13.8 km route included landmarks like the obelisk and Plaza de Mayo. The day was marked by several pro-Tibet protests, which included a giant banner reading \\"Free Tibet\\", and an alternative \\"human rights torch\\" that was lit by protesters and paraded along the route the flame was to take. Most of these protests were peaceful in nature, and the torch was not impeded. Chinese immigrants also turned out in support of the Games, but only minor scuffles were reported between both groups. Runners surrounded by rows of security carried the Olympic flame past thousands of jubilant Argentines in the most trouble-free torch relay in nearly a week. People showered the parade route with confetti as banks, government offices and businesses took an impromptu half-day holiday for the only Latin American stop on the flame's five-continent journey.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.  Ben and Jerry were two friends with very different dietary habits. Jerry ate healthy food, and was always on top of his caloric consumption, while Ben overate because he loved fatty foods such as butter, bacon et al.  Which friend had a higher blood lipid level? The answer is:","output":"Ben likely had a higher blood lipid level. As the question suggests, a diet high in lipids, specifically saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol, can increase lipid levels in the blood. It's mentioned that Ben overate and loved fatty foods such as butter and bacon, which are high in the aforementioned harmful lipids. On the other hand, Jerry’s habits of eating healthy food and monitoring his caloric intake would typically be associated with lower lipid levels in the blood. Therefore, considering their dietary habits, Ben would more likely have a higher blood lipid level than Jerry. However, it's important to note that various factors including genetics, exercise, and overall lifestyle also play roles in determining blood lipid levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Ciara Princess Harris was born in Austin, Texas, on October 25, 1985, the only child of Jackie and Carlton Clay Harris. An army brat, she grew up in Germany, New York, Utah, California, Arizona and Nevada. Ciara's parents are both African Americans. Ciara also has some Irish ancestry, from her mother's background. On December 5, 2006, Ciara released her second studio album, Ciara: The Evolution. According to the singer, the title of the album is \\"about so much more than just my personal growth - it's about the evolution of music, the evolution of dance, the evolution of fashion.\\" The source of the album's creativity such as the sound and edge comes from Ciara in general. Ciara: The Evolution became Ciara's first number one album on the U.S. Billboard 200 and second on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts with sales of more than 338,000 becoming her highest first week of sales to date. The album went on to be certified platinum by the RIAA in the United States, within only five weeks of its release, and has sold 1.3 million copies according to Nielsen SoundScan. It sold over two million copies worldwide.  The album's international lead single, \\"Get Up\\", which features Chamillionaire, reached number seven in the United States and gained a platinum accreditation. It reached number five in New Zealand. The song was used for the film Step Up (2006) and featured on the film's soundtrack. The album's US lead single, \\"Promise\\", reached number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 and became her third number one single on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \\"Like a Boy\\" was released as the second international single which reached within the top twenty in the UK, Finland, France, Ireland, Sweden Switzerland, and also in the United States. The fourth and final single from the album, \\"Can't Leave 'em Alone\\", reached number 10 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song became Ciara's fifth single to peak in the top in New Zealand, peaking at number 4. The song achieved moderate success in other international markets.  In support of the album, Ciara went on her first headlining tour in October 2006. The tour went to seventeen different clubs in cities throughout the United States. The tour was met with mixed to positive reviews; critics were divided regarding the pre-recorded backing tracks and remarked that Ciara was slightly under-prepared to host her own headlining tour, but ultimately praised her energetic choreography. In August 2007, she headlined the Screamfest '07 tour with fellow rapper, T.I.. Critics praised her performance for her gracious dancing and being able to command a sold out arena. Ciara, along with Chris Brown and Akon, was a support act for Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad Tour in the United Kingdom. She made a guest appearance on \\"So What\\" by Field Mob. The single went on to become a top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. She also appeared on Tiffany Evans' single \\"Promise Ring\\". The song achieved little success on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.  In addition to her music, Ciara made her acting debut in the MTV Films production All You've Got in May 2006. In the movie she played Becca Whiley, a teenager who is competing in a volleyball tournament. The movie received mixed to positive reviews; critics said the movie was predictable but still enjoyable.

Write an article with the title: \\"Charlie Hebdo lives again with new issue\\" Article:","output":"Title: Charlie Hebdo Lives Again with New Issue Introduction: (Step 1: Introduce the topic and provide background information about Charlie Hebdo's history.) Once the epicenter of a terrorist attack in 2015, French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo continues to defy fear and intimidation by releasing a new issue. Founded in 1970, the publication is famous for its provocative illustrations, sharp-witted humor, and unapologetic commitment to freedom of speech. This article explores the resurrection of Charlie Hebdo and the importance of supporting its steadfast presence in the face of adversity. Triumph over Tragedy: (Step 2: Discuss the attack on Charlie Hebdo and its aftermath.) On January 7, 2015, terrorists stormed the Charlie Hebdo headquarters in Paris, gunning down twelve staff members, including cartoonists and editors. Many around the world were shaken, mourning the loss of these lives while simultaneously struggling to understand the motivations behind such a violent act. The tragedy, fueled by the magazine’s history of controversial caricatures and satirical content, sent ripples throughout the media landscape. In the aftermath, support for Charlie Hebdo surged, not just for the victims, but for the magazine’s continual act of defiance against terror that sought to silence it. The surviving staff members vowed to continue their work, and millions of euros poured in from various sources to help rebuild the publication. New Issues, Unwavering Resolve: (Step 3: Introduce the new issue of Charlie Hebdo and its significance.) Today, Charlie Hebdo's return to the public eye with its new issue marks a powerful statement of perseverance through which the magazine adamantly refuses to be silenced. Featuring fresh satirical content and illustrations in the classic Charlie Hebdo style, the latest issue serves as a reminder that freedom of speech should be vigorously defended. This new beginning for Charlie Hebdo is not without challenges, however. Concerns have been raised over the safety and security of its staff, with many members living under police protection in undisclosed locations. However, this has not dampened their spirits or weakened their commitment to pushing boundaries through satire and humor. Global Importance of Free Speech: (Step 4: Address the importance of defending freedom of speech and artistic expression.) Charlie Hebdo's return also serves as a broader statement on the necessity of defending freedom of speech and artistic expression worldwide. In an era when political correctness and intolerance threaten open discourse, it is imperative that society preserves the rights of all individuals to express their views freely - even when those ideas may be offensive or controversial to some. As a triumph of courage and determination, Charlie Hebdo stands as a testament to the resilience of free speech. It is up to us all, as members of a global society, to foster an environment where every voice can be heard, even when that voice shakes the foundations of what we believe to be right and true. Conclusion: (Step 5: Summarize the article and reflect on the significance of Charlie Hebdo's resurgence.) In conclusion, the revival of Charlie Hebdo with a new issue is a testament to their unwavering commitment to free speech, even in the face of extreme adversity. Charlie Hebdo's ongoing presence is a bold reminder that fear cannot silence the human spirit, and their defiant return to the public eye serves as an inspiration for all who champion the freedom of expression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a question: Seeing someone open a gift after buying christmas presents causes what for the gift giver?  Here are possible answers to this question: - stress - understand themselves - pleasure - sense of joy - debt  I believe the correct choice is \\"pleasure\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"Pleasure.  Step 1: Analyze the possible answers In this situation, we have to consider all the given options and understand their relevance to the context of the question. The options are: stress, understand themselves, pleasure, sense of joy, and debt. Step 2: Identify the emotions and conditions associated with gift giving We should consider the emotions and conditions commonly associated with gift giving, especially during Christmas. Generally, gift-giving is intended to express love, appreciation, or kindness. The act usually results in positive emotions for both the giver and the recipient. Step 3: Rule out irrelevant options We can rule out \\"stress\\" and \\"debt\\" as these options represent negative emotions or conditions that do not align with the positive emotions typically associated with gift-giving. Although gift purchases may at times lead to financial stress or debt, the act of seeing someone open a gift should result in positive emotions that overshadow these negative aspects. Step 4: Compare remaining options Now we are left with the options: \\"understand themselves\\", \\"pleasure\\", and \\"sense of joy\\". Although understanding one's self is important, it is not directly related to the experience of seeing someone open a gift. Hence, we can rule out this option. Step 5: Choose the most appropriate answer Between \\"pleasure\\" and \\"sense of joy\\", the most suitable choice is \\"pleasure\\" because it is a general term that encompasses the positive emotions experienced by the gift giver when seeing someone open the gift they have purchased. Joy can be a specific form of pleasure, but \\"pleasure\\" is a more inclusive term that best captures the wide range of positive feelings a gift giver may experience upon seeing the recipient open their gift. Therefore, the correct choice in this context is \\"pleasure,\\" as it represents the overarching positive emotions experienced by the gift giver when they witness the recipient opening their Christmas present."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  you could prove that movements are occurring even in the absence of a gradient. In a similar manner, there are analogous carrier systems that move hydrophobic molecules through water. Channel molecules sit within a membrane and contain an aqueous channel that spans the membrane’s hydrophobic region. Hydrophilic molecules of particular sizes and shapes can pass through this aqueous channel and their movement involves a significantly lower activation energy than would be associated with moving through the lipid part of the membrane in the absence of the channel. Channels are generally highly selective in terms of which particles will pass through them. For example, there are channels in which 10,000 potassium ions will pass through for every one sodium ion. Often the properties of these channels can be regulated; they can exist in two or more distinct structural states. For example, in one state the channel can be open and allow particles to pass through or it can be closed, that is the channel can be turned on and off. Channels cannot, however, determine in which direction an ion will move - that is determined by the ion gradient across the membrane. The transition between open and closed states can be regulated through a number of processes, including the reversible binding of small molecules to the protein and various other molecular changes (which we will consider when we talk about proteins). Another method of channel control depends on the fact that channel proteins are i) embedded within a membrane and ii) contain charged groups. As we will see cells can (and generally do) generate ion gradients, that, is a separation of charged species across their membranes. For example if the concentration of K+ ions is higher on one side of the membrane, there will be an ion gradient where the natural tendency is for the ions to move to the region of lower K+ concentration.222 The ion gradient in turn can produce an electrical field across the plasma membrane. As these fields change, they can produce (induce) changes...

When the 22-year-old entered college in 2009, he decided not to change his rural residence to a students' collective one. But when he finished college and was offered a job with a state-owned enterprise in Beijing, Sun was told that he couldn't accept the offer unless he had an urban hukou (household registration record). This time, he had no choice but to change his residence status. Transferring hukou to a university became optional in 2003, and many students are confronted with the dilemma of whether to do so or not. Professionals suggest they make the decision based on their current situation and future plans. 'I regret transferring my hukou' Wang Jinbi, 20, is an accounting major at Beijing Union University. Coming from Chifeng, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, she transferred her hukou when she enrolled at university. \\"I didn't think it was a big deal,\\" Wang says. \\"Since I'm registering under an urban hukou, it doesn't matter whether it's in Beijing or Inner Mongolia, I thought.\\" What Wang didn't expect, however, is that she would regret her decision later. \\"After two years of study, I've figured out my future plans. I want to return to my hometown and make a living there,\\" she says. That means Wang needs to transfer her hukou back again, which she worries will be a troublesome procedure. \\"I have a friend who graduated last year. She spent a lot of time and energy transferring her hukou back to her hometown again due to complicated paperworks,\\" says Wang. Guidelines for transferring hukou Wang's experience is not uncommon. Many students don't know what their decision means for their future.

However, there are a few areas where I think the developers could improve the app. The first is the occasional performance issues: sometimes, the app can be a bit slow, especially when sending larger media files. Additionally, the app could benefit from implementing a more comprehensive backup and restore option for messages. Finally, I would love to see future updates include a group chat feature supporting end-to-end encryption. Despite these minor drawbacks, I still give the app 4 stars out of 5.

As movie release schedules are subject to change due to several factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and growing streaming platforms' influence, it is difficult to provide a precise release date for the next LEGO Movie without official information. It's also worth noting that the LEGO Group has entered into a new five-year partnership with Universal Pictures, which started in 2020. This partnership indicates that LEGO-based movies may be produced and released by Universal Pictures moving forward.

Picture it like going from your house to the playground, but with many stops in between to see other cool things. First, the traveler started in his hometown, which was a cozy place filled with people he loved, just like your home with your family. He waved goodbye and began his journey. Second, the traveler went through the Forest of Whispers, a place filled with tall trees and colorful birds that could talk! Imagine if trees and birds could chat with you while walking to the park. That is what it was like for our traveler in the Forest of Whispers. Next, the traveler reached Crystal River, a big, shiny river made of crystal-clear water. He crossed it using a magical boat. Picture a sparkly river full of fish jumping and playing, so clear that you can see each and every rock on the bottom. After crossing the river, the traveler arrived at Rainbow Bridge. Just like the name says, it was a long bridge in all the colors of the rainbow! The traveler walked across it, watching the pretty colors under his shoes. It was like walking on a rainbow slide that took him to the other side. The last place the traveler visited before Kounavia was the Village of Smiles. This was a small, cute village filled with people always smiling and having fun. They shared ice cream and played games together, like you would do at a birthday party with your friends. Finally, the traveler reached Kounavia after his amazing journey. Kounavia was even more magical and beautiful than he could have ever imagined. It was a place where wishes came true, and everyone was happy and friendly. And that, dear friend, is the story of the traveler's journey to Kounavia.

We need to find the value of 'a' in the equation 119*a - 21407 = -238*a - 8012 + 21948. 1. First, we combine the numbers on the right side to make it simpler:    -8012 + 21948 = 13936 So now our equation is:    119*a - 21407 = -238*a + 13936 2. Now, we want to get all the 'a' terms on one side and the numbers on the other side. Let's move -238*a to the left side by adding 238*a to both sides:    119*a + 238*a - 21407 = 13936 3. Combine the 'a' terms on the left side:    357*a - 21407 = 13936 4. Now, let's move -21407 to the right side by adding 21407 to both sides:    357*a = 13936 + 21407 5. Combine the numbers on the right side:    357*a = 35343 6. Lastly, to find the value of 'a', divide both sides by 357:    a = 35343 / 357 7.

Write a text based on this summary: key regulators urge broad oversight of derivatives Text:","output":"Title: Key Regulators Call for Expanded Oversight of Derivatives Market In a recent development, key financial regulators have come together to advocate for broader oversight and monitoring of the derivatives market. These regulators, identifying the growing complexity and significance of the derivatives industry, believe that a more comprehensive approach is necessary to mitigate the risks associated with these financial instruments and maintain the stability of the global economy. The derivatives market, which includes options, futures, swaps, and other complex financial products linked to underlying assets, has expanded rapidly in recent years due to increasing demand from investors seeking alternative ways to manage risk and enhance returns. However, this growth has also led to concerns over the potential for systemic risk, market manipulation, and irresponsible trading practices that could threaten financial stability. In response to these concerns, the key regulators propose a multi-faceted plan to enhance oversight and supervision of the derivatives market. The plan features a series of steps aimed at bolstering the existing regulatory framework, including: 1. Strengthening the reporting requirements: By imposing stricter reporting standards for derivative transactions, regulators will have better access to critical information, thus allowing them to more effectively monitor market activities and identify potential breaches of regulatory rules. 2. Implementing centralized clearing: The introduction of central counterparties (CCPs) will significantly reduce counterparty risk by acting as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, ensuring that both parties fulfill their obligations. 3. Enhancing margin requirements: Increased margin requirements will act as a safety net, encouraging market participants to maintain sufficient collateral to cover potential losses and promote responsible trading practices. 4. Promoting transparency: Increasing the availability of information on derivatives trading activities to the public will help to build trust in the market and discourage potential manipulative practices. 5. Encouraging international cooperation: By working together with global regulatory bodies, the key regulators aim to create a more consistent and harmonized approach to the supervision of the derivatives market across different jurisdictions. The key regulators' call for broad oversight of derivatives signifies their recognition of the importance of this market in the global financial landscape. By implementing these measures, they hope to strike a balance between facilitating innovation and investment and protecting the financial system from potential pitfalls associated with growing complexity. In conclusion, the proposed enhancements to the existing regulatory framework underscore the commitment of key regulators to ensuring the stability and integrity of the derivatives market. By taking a proactive approach to address emerging risks and fostering international cooperation, the regulators aim to bolster financial stability and promote confidence in the global economy."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: This article: Young filmmaker Stevie Horowitz eagerly awaits a meeting with big shot Hollywood film producer J.P.

It is revealed to be owned by a scientist named Dr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine), the only survivor of the attack. Slater orders two helicopters to check for a black mass (revealed to be bees), but the two helicopters are swarmed by the bees and explode, killing the pilots inside. Crane insists to Slater that the base was attacked by the same African killer bees that destroyed the helicopters. Helena Anderson (Katharine Ross), one of the base's doctors, supports Crane's story.Meanwhile, in the countryside, a family is attacked by a swarm of the bees. The teenaged son manages to escape in a Mustang, although he is also stung, and crashes into the Maryville town square, where the citizens are preparing for the annual flower festival. The boy is brought into the hands of military personnel, where he hallucinates a vision of giant bees attacking him, due to the aftereffects of the bee sting. Dr. Walter Krim (Henry Fonda) confirms to Crane that the very war they have feared for a long time has started against the bees. At the gates of the base, Slater must confront angry country bumpkin Jed Hawkins (Slim Pickens) who demands to see the dead body of his son, who was killed by the bees. Hawkins takes the body bag and departs, leaving the entire watching crowd silent over the loss.

A game date lasts about 10 minutes, and it costs real money in the form of game points. That’s where it gets a little weird.

In fact, several people on the ground or at sea claimed they saw Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 before it went missing after its post-midnight takeoff from Kuala Lumpur on March 8. The purported eyewitnesses include fishermen, an oil rig worker and islanders in an atoll. Some even alleged they saw it crash. While none of their claims have been substantiated, their assertions add to the ongoing mystery of the missing Boeing 777 and the 239 people aboard. Sighting claim: Kota Bharu, Malaysia. In the middle of the night, two fishermen near the Malaysia-Thailand border saw a plane flying low over the South China Sea -- at the same time that air traffic controllers lost contact with Flight 370 over the same body of water, at 1:30 a.m. or almost 50 minutes after takeoff. Fisherman Azid Ibrahim and a friend had taken people fishing that night off the coast of Kota Bharu. \\"I was fishing when I saw the plane -- it looked strange. Flying low. I told my friend that's not normal. Normally, it flies at 35,000 feet. But that night it touched the clouds.  I thought the pilot must be crazy,\\" Ibrahim said. \\"It was really low. I saw the lights they looked like the size of a coconut,\\" he said. Their fishing grounds lay under a flight path, but the predawn plane was unusual to see because of its low altitude, they said. The fishermen filed a police report about their sighting, but Malaysian officials haven't commented. Location, weather may hamper search. Sighting claim: Oil rig off Vietnam. A New Zealand man working on an oil rig off Vietnam claimed he saw a burning object in the sky Saturday morning, hours after the plane had taken off. Mike McKay of New Zealand was stationed on the Sona-Mercur oil rig on seas about 186 miles southeast of Vung Tau, a coastal Vietnamese town outside Ho Chi Minh City, according to CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand. McKay wrote of his sighting in an e-mail, the news outlet said. \\"Gentlemen. I believe I saw the Malaysian Airlines flight come down. The timing is right. I tried to contact Malaysian and Vietnamese officials several days ago. But I do not know if the message has been received,\\" he wrote last week. \\"I observed the plane burning at high altitude at a compass bearing of 265 to 275 degrees from our surface location. \\"While I observed (the plane) it appeared to be in one piece. From when I first saw the burning (plane?) until the flames went out (at high altitude) was 10-15 seconds. There was no lateral movement so it was either coming toward our position stationary (falling) or going away from our location. The general position of the observation was perpendicular/south-west of the normal flight path and at a lower altitude than the normal flight paths,\\" he wrote. In fact, Vietnamese authorities dispatched aircraft last week to search for the plane, in response to McKay's report, the affiliate reported. When the Vietnamese navy sent a plane to conduct a search, it found nothing, ABC News reported. Vietnamese naval officer Le Minh Thanh told that network that the plane investigated the area cited by McKay, but the search came up empty. New theories about what happened to missing flight. Sighting claim: Maldives atoll. On a remote island in the Maldives, residents claimed they saw a \\"low flying jumbo jet\\" the same morning that the Malaysia plane disappeared, according to the website of the Maldivian news outlet Haveeru. Residents on the isle of Kuda Huvadhoo in the Dhaalu Atoll gave a description that matched the commercial airliners: white with red stripes, according to the news outlet. \\"I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly,\\" an unidentified eyewitness said, according to Haveeru. \\"It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too.\\" These claims, published in a story Tuesday, were dismissed by Malaysian officials. The Maldives coast guard told CNN it had no reports of such sightings and had not even been requested to conduct a search. The acting Malaysian transport minister also declared the reports false. \\"I can confirm that the Malaysian Chief of the Defense Force has contacted his counterpart in the Maldives, who has confirmed that these reports are not true,\\" Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a press conference. The Maldives Ministry of Defense and National Security also confirmed that their radar systems and surveillance mechanisms show no indication of the missing plane. Sighting claim: Off Indonesia coast. Indonesian fishermen claim they saw an airplane crash around the Strait of Malacca on the morning of March 9 -- more than a full day after the Malaysian plane took off -- the Indonesian state news agency Antara reported late Monday. The strait lies between Indonesia and Malaysia. The Indonesia fishermen, based in the North Sumatra provincial subdistrict of Pangkalan Susu, went to sea for a week of fishing on March 9, a Sunday. At 11 a.m., they saw a plane crash, Antara reported. \\"We saw an airplane crash around the Malacca Straits,\\" a fisherman identified as Hendra said, according to Antara. The fishermen saw a white plane crossing and circling, Antara reported. Smoke came from the plane's right rear portion when it circled for a second round and tilted to the left, the agency said. Flying lower, the plane then fell from sight. \\"We suspect the plane crashed into the sea,\\" Hendra said, according to Antara. \\"We could not go to the location where the aircraft was lost due to large waves, and the boat did not have enough fuel.\\" The aircraft is believed to have crashed in waters off the Aceh provincial district of East Aceh. But there are two problems with these fishermen's account. They spotted the plane more than 24 hours after it took off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. And Indonesian military officials said their radar didn't spot Flight 370. The Jakarta Post reported that Indonesian air force spokesman Air Commodore Hadi Tjahjanto said the Air Force's radar in Lhokseumawe, Aceh, didn't detect the missing flight in the area that the Malaysian military suggested was the plane's last detected position, around Penang waters. \\"Our radar information has been shared with our Malaysian counterparts,\\" the air force spokesman added, according to the Jakarta Post.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster.  I am facing a new situation today: Andy is participating in this years science fair. He is testing how fast metal takes to rust. He rakes 3 pieces of iron one is a cube, and the other is a sheet both weighing the same. It takes the cube almost a week to fully rust but the sheet only takes 2 days. The only difference between the two is that the sheet has more surface area. He tries this again with a cylinder so the surface area is larger than the cube but smaller than the sheet and it takes about 4 days to fully rust.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which will rust faster given they contain the same amount of iron, a sheet or a cylinder? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, we can follow these steps to answer the question: 1. Acknowledge that increasing the surface area of a solid substance involved in a chemical reaction increases the reaction rate. 2. Recall the background article's example of nails rusting faster than a hammer due to a higher surface area. 3. Consider the new situation with Andy's science fair experiment involving three pieces of iron: a cube, a sheet, and a cylinder. The rusting times observed were as follows:    - Cube: 1 week    - Sheet: 2 days    - Cylinder: 4 days 4. Notice that the rusting time decreases as the surface area of the iron pieces increases. 5. Evaluate the given question: \\"Which will rust faster, given they contain the same amount of iron, a sheet or a cylinder?\\" From these steps, we can conclude that the sheet, having a larger surface area than the cylinder, will rust faster. The background article and Andy's experiment support this conclusion, as both demonstrate a correlation between increased surface area and increased reaction rate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An inventive pet owner has created the world's goldfish walking device - because he was worried his pet was bored. Mike Warren-Madden spent weeks designing his unique 'Aquatic Perambulator' as a way to help pet fish Malcolm have a more exciting life. Former sheet metal worker Mr Warren-Madden, 60, came up with the plan around seven years ago. An inventive pet owner has created the world's goldfish walking device, after worrying that his fish was becoming bored. Mike Warren-Madden spent thousands of hours designing his unique 'Aquatic Perambulator' as a way to help pet fish Malcolm have a more exciting life. Sadly, his beloved goldfish has since died, but he lived to the grand old age of 11, thanks Mr Warren-Madden says, to his adventurous lifestyle - which included trips to the pub and walks around town. Sadly, his beloved goldfish has since died. But the fish lived to the grand old age of 11 thanks, Mr Warren-Madden says, to his adventurous lifestyle - which included trips to the pub and walks around town. Despite Malcolm passing away he hopes his pioneering legacy will now see an entrepreneur come forward to invest in the invention. Mr Warren-Madden, from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, said: 'We had some right looks around town, we stopped traffic, but everyone has got into it now. It's not every day you see someone taking a fish for a walk. 'If a fish is in a bowl on a shelf swimming in circles it must get bored. I decided it would be fun to take it out with me down the pub. 'People have said to me the fish couldn't see what was going on, but I always said \\"how do you know?\\"' Mr Warren-Madden, from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, said: 'We had some right looks around town, we stopped traffic, but everyone has got into it now. It's not every day you see someone taking a fish for a walk' The contraption even allows fish owners to share a drink at the local with their pet, as Mr Warren-Madden enjoyed to do with the late Malcolm. He said: 'If a fish is in a bowl on a shelf swimming in circles it must get bored. I decided it would be fun to take it out with me down the pub' 'Malcolm lived to almost 12-years-old, I think he was getting something out of it.' The Aquatic Perambulator - which is now a Mark III - stands around four-foot tall and is made from laser-cut mild steel. Mr Warren-Madden, who lives with wife Shirley, 58, said: 'My wife has learned to live with me, I have been tinkering around with this idea for around seven years. 'With the first designs I didn't take into account how heavy water is so I have modified it over the years. 'I've added better elastic to take the shock out of the water and I hope to get better wheels. 'Because of my background as a sheet metal worker I have been able to build this at little cost - but for someone else it would cost hundreds to make. 'I think I'd like someone to come forward and help me motorise it perhaps with a remote control.'

His initial designs faced challenges with the weight of the water and the shock absorption capabilities of the device. Improved elastic has since been added to address these issues. Despite being able to build the contraption at a low cost due to his background, Warren-Madden acknowledges that it may cost hundreds for others to create a similar device.

While the user initially loved various aspects of the Dyson Animal, such as its ease of handling, cleaning capabilities, and it being bagless, they became disappointed and dissatisfied when the vacuum cleaner started making a horrible noise after only 6-10 uses. Upon discovering that the issue was the result of premature wear on the plastic gears, the user became even more disheartened and angry, given the high price of the product. The user also questions the manufacture location, speculating that it might be made in China and assuming that this could be the reason behind the vacuum's poor durability. Furthermore, when they looked at Consumer Reports reviews on bagless vacuums, the user could not find one that met their wish list, which included simple needs like ease of handling, great cleaning, bagless, and dependability.

Anthony's box is stocked with traditional toys--board games, puzzles, art supplies--and as far as he is concerned, they are relics of Christmases past. His sister Michaely, 6 years old, still likes dressing her Barbies. But once she starts playing Game Boy, it's hard to get her away. Play patterns like this could take up another Christmas for the toy department. Through September, toy sales were down 5% compared with the first nine months of last year, according to the NDP Group. Meanwhile, the video-game industry is heading for another record year. Thanks to hot new games like Halo 2 for the Xbox, the industry is light-years ahead of the toy business when it comes out. While some new toys emerge every holiday season, toymakers are heading into this one without a monster hit  . Indeed, there has not been a Furby-style frenzy   in years. Of 10 toy segments only two, arts and crafts and dolls, have generated sales growth over a recent 12-month period. Some of the weakest categories like construction sets and action figures are the ones aimed at boys, who suffer the most from the video games. Analysts expect one of the top stocking stuffers this season to be not a traditional toy but the new generation of Nintendo's Game Boy, the DS, which hit stores last week. The deeper issue is that shifts in play patterns are forcing toymakers to fight for shelf space in a tightening market. Boys in particular seem to be abandoning traditional toys at earlier ages in favor of consumer electronics, video games, PC software and the Internet. The fact that kids are growing more tech-savvy  , a trend called \\"age compression  \\", has troubled toy companies for at least a decade.

As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad, the Japanese loan, the new wing to his art gallery, and an attack that morning, in his own newspaper, upon his pet trust. But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where would young Spear be? It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse. It was these same impulses, leading so invariably to success, that made his enemies call him the Wisest Man.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Gill and Ann were two fellow botanists. Gill studied alpine tundras extensively, while Ann studied tropical forests. They both discovered very interesting facts about nature and plants.  and a hint : Alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft).  Please answer this question : Which person learned less about shrublands ecoregions? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it would appear that Ann learned less about shrublands ecoregions compared to Gill. Ann primarily studied tropical forests, which are typically characterized by a dense and diverse accumulation of plant species, including trees, shrubs, and ground flora in warm regions, usually near the Equator. These environments are distinct from shrublands, which are characterized by sparse, low-growing shrubs, grasses, and herbaceous plants. On the other hand, Gill studied alpine tundras extensively. Alpine tundras occur at high altitudes, often above the treeline, where ecological conditions are unfavorable for the establishment of tall trees. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide, as mentioned, include alpine tundra. In studying alpine tundras, Gill would likely have encountered and learned about the shrublands ecoregions within these areas. Therefore, due to Ann's focus on tropical forests and Gill's study of alpine tundras, which overlap with shrublands ecoregions, it can be concluded that Ann learned less about shrublands ecoregions than Gill."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Before seeing this, I was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated \\"Emmanuelle\\" series starring Sylvia Kristel. It was really surprising how good this one turned out to be. It actually has a story, and it is very romantic indeed. What makes 'Yellow Emanuelle' so good is it's leading heroine, the beautiful and exotic Chai Lee. She plays her character, Emy Wong so sweetly, that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her. Emy Wong is a much-respected doctor, statuesque, with a regal quality. She comes from an important old family, where ancient customs are still practiced. Emy will remain a virgin until she is married, to a man she has never met. The beautiful doctor seems OK with this arranged marriage. It is simply how it is done in her world. However she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the British pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works. Emy decides to do away with custom, and she gives herself to her Western man. But only after a very long courtship, as Doctor Wong is anything but an easy woman. Her pilot, George, is a good guy, and promises to marry Emy, so that she doesn't lose her respectability and place in her rigid society. Neither one counts on a third party, one Ilona Staller, who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games. Emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man, that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her. Her place in society is gone, she has been debased. The film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud, elegant woman gives up her career, as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father, and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution. I was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale. I was on the edge of my seat when George blows back into town, and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful Emy is working as a prostitute! Classic drama. I imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama. One would expect lots of sex and nudity here, but there is not much. And when there is, it is totally non-exploitative, and very artsy and soft-core. If you are a fan of the first Emmanuelle, with Sylvia Kristel, than you most likely will appreciate this, lesser known classic. I was especially impressed by the extra attention to details. The whole segment where Emy takes George to her fathers house on the island is really nice. Her father shows George, and the viewer his impressive collection of Bonzai trees. He has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees. Totally unexpected. After catching it on late night cable TV years ago, I spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film. When i finally got it i found that the video version was longer. More sex? No, more melodrama. For the DVD release there is a subplot about George suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease! I actually preferred the cable version better. I am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on DVD. I must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70's soundtrack. While watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare, and quite special.

In commemoration, they create a giant shuttlecock and robotic replica figure of Perry to play an improvised game of badminton. However, when Perry's hovercraft accidentally collides with their shuttlecock, the boys crash into Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz's laboratory and destroy his \\"Other-Dimension-Inator\\", which is designed to help him travel to parallel dimensions. Intrigued by the idea, the two help Doofenshmirtz rebuild the machine, while Perry arrives on his mission to stop Doofenshmirtz. Unwilling to give away his secret identity to the boys (which would get him relocated to another family), Perry reverts to his pet mode and is forced to watch them help Doofenshmirtz activate his invention. The group is transported to an alternate dimension where a second, truly intelligent and evil Doofenshmirtz rules over his Tri-State Area. The second Perry (known as Platyborg), was converted into an evil cyborg by Doofenshimrtz-2 and programmed to serve as his second-in-command and general of his army of Norm-Bots. When the boys arrive with Perry to Doofenshmirtz-2's office, Doof-2 recognizes Perry as a secret agent and orders Platyborg to attack Perry. When that doesn't affect him, Doofenshmirtz-2 orders Platyborg to attack the boys next, which forces Perry to reveal his secret identity to stop Platyborg from doing so, much to the others' shock. Doofenshmirtz-2 then sends several of his Norm Bots to catch Perry and the boys, but the trio escapes. Afterwards, Phineas expresses his anger at Perry for using him and Ferb as a cover for his double life.

L. M. Barreto together with Vincent Rijmen, one of the designers of the Advanced Encryption Standard (Rijndael). KHAZAD is named after Khazad-dûm, the fictional dwarven realm in the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien (see also Khazad). KHAZAD was presented at the first NESSIE workshop in 2000, and, after some small changes, was selected as a finalist in the project.  - Vincent Rijmen (born 16 October 1970) is a Belgian cryptographer and one of the two designers of the Rijndael, the Advanced Encryption Standard. Rijmen is also the co-designer of the WHIRLPOOL cryptographic hash function, and the block ciphers Anubis, KHAZAD, Square, NOEKEON and SHARK.  - A cryptographic hash function is a special class of hash function that has certain properties which make it suitable for use in cryptography. It is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit string of a fixed size (a hash function) which is designed to also be a one-way function, that is, a function which is infeasible to invert. The only way to recreate the input data from an ideal cryptographic hash function's output is to attempt a brute-force search of possible inputs to see if they produce a match. Bruce Schneier has called one-way hash functions \\"the workhorses of modern cryptography\\". The input data is often called the \\"message\\", and the output (the \\"hash value\\" or \\"hash\\") is often called the \\"message digest\\" or simply the \\"digest\\".  - NOEKEON is a family of two block ciphers designed by Joan Daemen, Michaël Peeters, Gilles Van Assche and Vincent Rijmen and submitted to the NESSIE project in September 2000. The two ciphers are \\"direct mode\\" NOEKEON, to be used for maximum efficiency where related-key attacks are not possible, and \\"indirect mode\\" NOEKEON where they are.  - The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael, is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.  - ECRYPT (European Network of Excellence in Cryptology) was a 4-year European research initiative launched on 1 February 2004 with the stated objective of promoting the collaboration of European researchers in information security, and especially in cryptology and digital watermarking.  - The Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography research group , commonly called COSIC , is a research group at the Department of Electrical Engineering of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven , which is headed by Professor Bart Preneel , Vincent Rijmen , and Professor Ingrid Verbauwhede . The goal of COSIC 's research activities is to create a secure electronic equivalent for interactions in the physical world such as confidentiality , signatures , identification , anonymity , payment and elections . The research concentrates on the design , evaluation , and implementation of cryptographic algorithms and protocols , on the development of security architectures for information and communication systems and on the development of security mechanisms for embedded systems . COSIC 's theoretical work is mainly based on discrete mathematics such as number theory , finite fields , Boolean algebra , but also includes statistics and optimization . The aim is to achieve efficient and secure solutions . The broader goal is to achieve efficient and secure multi-party computation .

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948?  In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year.  While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954. Its preparation was dogged by misfortunes. Olivier, originally scheduled to direct it, backed out, as did Henry...

The PPP is a center-left, social-democratic political party, founded in 1967 by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Since then, the party has been led by members of the Bhutto family, including Benazir Bhutto, who became the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan. The PPP has historically been associated with populist, socialist, and progressive policies. On the other hand, the PML-N is a center-right, conservative political party in Pakistan. Founded by Nawaz Sharif in 1993 as a faction of the original Pakistan Muslim League, the party has been associated with capitalist, pro-business policies, as well as asserting a strong nationalistic stance. Much like PPP, the PML-N has also functioned as a family-run political dynasty, with the Sharif family dominating the party's leadership. Both the PPP and PML-N have influenced Pakistani politics significantly and have been characterized as family-run political dynasties. These dynasties often have a strong influence in their respective parties and can shape policies and political discourse.

Background: De La Soul is an American hip hop trio formed in 1987 on Long Island, New York. The group is best known for their eclectic sampling, quirky lyrics, and their contributions to the evolution of the jazz rap and alternative hip hop subgenres. The members are Posdnuos, Trugoy the Dove and Maseo. The three formed the group in high school and caught the attention of producer Prince Paul with a demo tape of the song \\"Plug Tunin'\\". Context: De La Soul's debut album, 3 Feet High and Rising, released in 1989, was a critical smash hit in the hip hop genre. They quickly became prominent members of the Native Tongues Posse along with A Tribe Called Quest, Black Sheep, Queen Latifah, the Jungle Brothers and others. The single \\"Me Myself and I\\" became a huge hit, further cementing the group's popularity. However, the sixties pop group The Turtles sued De La Soul for using a sample from their 1969 hit \\"You Showed Me\\" for the interlude track \\"Transmitting Live from Mars\\", despite the fact that The Turtles did not actually write the original song.  Lyrically, much of 3 Feet High and Rising focused on striving for peace and harmony. 3 Feet High and Rising also introduced De La Soul's concept of the \\"D.A.I.S.Y. Age\\" (an acronym standing for \\"da inner sound, y'all\\"). As a result, audiences were quick to peg the members of De La Soul as hippies. This stereotype greatly agitated the group's members, as they always envisioned their career as a constantly changing style; this frustration would influence their next recording sessions. In the press kit for 3 Feet High and Rising, the members explained their stage names: Trugoy when reversed spells yogurt, because he likes yogurt, and Posdnuos spelled backwards is \\"sound sop\\". The album artwork was designed by radical British artist collective the Grey Organisation  De La Soul's second album, De La Soul Is Dead (1991) was a much more mature album. It featured a wealth of material that criticized the violent, careless direction that hip hop was heading in at the time, though it still managed to maintain a light, absurd sense of humor. The cover of the album features a broken daisy flower pot, symbolizing the death of the \\"D.A.I.S.Y. Age\\" and the imagery that went along with it. The album spawned several singles, including the dark \\"Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa\\", a tale of a young girl who could no longer take the sexual abuse from her father, and the lead single \\"Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey)\\", a story about the people rated with the Black Sheep on \\"Fanatic of the B Word,\\" Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest on \\"A Roller Skating Jam Named 'Saturdays'\\", and Prince Paul makes an appearance on the mic in \\"Pass the Plugs\\" with a verse of his own. The album also more prominently featured Vincent Mason as a rapper, providing verses of his own on \\"Bitties in the BK Lounge,\\" \\"Afro Connections at a Hi-5,\\" and \\"Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey)\\".  Though it received mixed reviews and did not sell as well as 3 Feet High and Rising it eventually became a cult classic. The Source magazine listed the album as one of their top 100 hip hop albums of all time, stating that \\"its true genius is rarely understood\\". There are several major differences between the CD version of this album and the other formats, as the tracks \\"Johnny's Dead AKA Vincent Mason\\", \\"My Brother's a Basehead\\", \\"Kicked Out the House\\", and \\"Who Do U Worship?\\" are only available on the CD. The limited edition double vinyl promotional copies of the album distributed to the media before the official release did not feature these. Question: How was the album received? Answer:","output":"The album, De La Soul Is Dead, received mixed reviews when it was released. Some people liked it, while others didn't like it as much as their first album, 3 Feet High and Rising. But over time, the album became very popular and is now considered a classic. The Source magazine even put it on their list of the top 100 hip-hop albums of all time.

Purchase netting from most home supply stores. Secure your netting at the bottom so birds can't get them at ground level.  Look for heavy-duty, knitted netting with an aperture no bigger than 5 by 5 millimetres (0.20 in × 0.20 in) and woven no larger than 500 microns thick.  Check your netting in the spring and winter. Bird sometimes peck at growing cherry buds in the late winter. Replace your netting as needed. When your trees will be exposed to much sunlight, it is important to keep your trees hydrated and healthy, especially for freshly planted trees. Water your trees when the top layers of soil seem dry. To check the moisture, stick your finger about 3 inches (7.6 cm) into the soil. If the soil is not moist, then water it thoroughly from the base of the tree. If the soil is still wet, you can wait another day before checking the moisture level again. Use an all-purpose fertilizer or a fruit tree fertilizer, and follow instructions on the package to determine the recommended amount to use. After April, only fertilize your trees after you harvest the fruit each season. Fertilizing right before your trees bloom helps replenish nutrients and help the tree produce more fruit. in the late winter annually. This will help your trees grow new fruiting wood. Prune the tree when it is dormant so you don't damage the fruit-bearing branches. You can use hand pruners or scissors to cut away dead, damaged, or diseased branches. Regularly pruning your trees will prevent infection and disease. In order to prevent winter sunscald, you should wrap the trunk with tree wrap every winter. Start at the bottom of the trunk and work your way toward the top, overlapping the layers. You can find tree wrap at gardening and home improvement stores. Sweet cherries are more likely to get a fungal or bacterial disease, so prune them again in the late summer to prevent diseases from spreading. The warmth of the sun will develop the flavor of your cherries, and they will fall off the tree when ready to harvest. Pick your cherries with the stalks still attached using scissors or hand pruners. Hand picking can injure your tree and cause infection.  Cherries will appear dark red, black, or yellow when fully ripened. They will be the most sweet and delicious at this point, because the sugar content will rise a few days before they are fully ripened Pick your cherries when they are still firm if you want to freeze them. Typical cherry harvests only last 1 week, so be ready to pick! Common cherry tree pests include aphids, Japanese beetles, and caterpillars. If you have issues with pests, you can treat your trees with pesticides. Always consider using natural pesticides so you don't damage your trees or cherries with harsh chemicals. You can easily make your own pesticides at home. Try mixing different household vegetables, oils, or soaps with water and treating for pests naturally.

Leo found that the specialty company numbered fifteen people. The performers were, for the most part, of very ordinary ability. There were several song and dance men, a number of musicians who drew tunes out of a variety of articles, several lady vocalists, a comical fat man and a magician.  The magician was a young fellow, hardly older than Leo. His name was Carl Ross, and he had such a smiling face and gentlemanly manner that Leo took to him instantly.  “We want a good all-around gymnast and tumbler,” said Carl Ross. “As it is the show is lop-sided—too much singing and dancing.”  Leo was asked to give an exhibition of what he could do, and readily complied, performing at first on the floor of the stage and then on a bar let down from the flies.  “Very good!” said Nathan Wampole, highly pleased, and Carl Ross also smiled his approval.  At the conclusion of the show that evening Leo decided to join the company, and from that moment on he and Carl Ross became warm friends.

He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. At what game was a former world champion famously defeated by a computer called Deep Blue in 1997?","output":"The game in which a former world champion was famously defeated by a computer called Deep Blue in 1997 is chess. The world champion who faced Deep Blue was Garry Kasparov, a Russian chess grandmaster who is widely considered one of the greatest chess players of all time. The match took place from May 11 to May 17, 1997 and was held in New York City. Deep Blue was a chess-playing computer developed by IBM, specifically designed to compete at an advanced level against human chess players. It was a successor to an earlier system called Deep Thought, which was also a chess-playing system. Deep Blue's creators worked to significantly improve its processing power and decision-making abilities, enabling it to analyze in-depth chess strategies and think several moves ahead, much like a human chess player. The 1997 match was a rematch, as Kasparov and Deep Blue had previously faced off in February 1996. In that earlier encounter, Kasparov emerged victorious, winning with a 4-2 score. However, subsequent improvements were made to Deep Blue's capabilities leading up to their 1997 match. The 1997 match consisted of six games, and Deep Blue won the match with a score of 3.5-2.5. This historic victory marked the first time that a chess-playing computer had defeated a reigning world champion in a match played under classic time controls. Kasparov won the first game, while Deep Blue claimed a victory in the second game. Games three, four, and five ended in draws, and Deep Blue ultimately triumphed in the sixth and final game. Kasparov's defeat at the hands of Deep Blue is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it showcased the remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence and computing at the time. The event also sparked widespread debate about the relationship between humans and machines, raising questions about the future of artificial intelligence and its potential implications for various fields. Furthermore, the match exemplified how technology can push the boundaries of human ingenuity, as engineers and computer scientists were able to create a system capable of outthinking a human mind in a game as complex and strategic as chess. This achievement serves as a testament to the ongoing development and evolution of artificial intelligence and its potential to transform a wide range of industries and disciplines in the future."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Two friends skiing on the North slope, Heidi (Annie McEnroe) and Jennifer (Kathy Christopher), find mysterious tracks and hear some disturbing noises coming from the woods. Heidi takes off, but Jennifer lags behind and is set upon by a monstrous beast.Tony Rill (Robert Logan), manager of the resort, is summoned and told that a female skier was found, babbling incoherently about some sort of monster and her missing friend. Rill, doubtful at first, listens to Heidi's story and, despite being unsettled by what he hears, surmises that it was probably a grizzly bear. He and a search party set out and split up to find Jennifer. Rill comes upon a remote stretch where he finds Jennifer's jacket, bloody and torn to shreds. He also hears a monstrous roar come from the woods and turns just in time to glimpse something white, hairy and massive at the edge of the treeline.Meanwhile, back at the resort, Gar Seberg (Bo Svenson) and his wife Ellen (Yvette Mimieux) arrive. Seberg, a former Olympic Ski champion, has fallen on hard times and has come to Colorado to see if his old friend Rill can give him a job. As they step into the main building, Seberg gets the brushoff from a worried Rill, and begins to feel that this whole thing was a bad idea. Rill, meanwhile, informs his grandmother, and owner of the resort, Carrie Rill (Sylvia Sidney) about what he saw and heard, and tells her that they should put up signs restricting access to the area and inform the sheriff. Carie, however, is put off by the thought of a story about some wild man-beast roaming the slopes hurting business, and convinces Rill that while no one will believe Heidi, his word is another matter altogether.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Robert Dale Owen (November 7, 1801 - June 24, 1877) was a Scottish-born social reformer who immigrated to the United States in 1825, became a U.S. citizen, and was active in Indiana politics as member of the Democratic Party in the Indiana House of Representatives (1835-39 and 1851-53) and represented Indiana in the U.S. House of Representatives (1843-47). As a member of Congress, Owen successfully pushed through the bill that established Smithsonian Institution and served on the Institution's first Board of Regents. Owen also served as a delegate to the Indiana Constitutional Convention in 1850 and was appointed as U.S. charge d'affaires (1853-58) to Naples. Owen was a knowledgeable exponent of the socialist doctrines of his father, Robert Owen, and managed the day-to-day operation of New Harmony, Indiana, the socialistic utopian community he helped establish with his father in 1825. After his first term in the Indiana legislature and two unsuccessful campaigns for election to the U.S. Congress in 1838 and in 1840, Owen was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1842. He served from 1843 to 1847 in the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Congresses. Owen was chairman of the Committee on Roads and Canals during the Twenty-eighth Congress. He was also involved in the debates about the annexation of Texas and an Oregon boundary dispute in 1844 that led to the establishment of the U.S-British boundary at the 49th parallel north, the result of the Oregon Treaty (1846).  While serving as a member of Congress, Owen introduced and helped to secure passage of the bill that founded the Smithsonian Institution in 1846. Owen was appointed to the Smithsonian Institution's first Board of Regents and chaired its Building Committee, which oversaw the construction of the Smithsonian Institution Building in Washington, D.C., and recommended James Renwick, Jr. as architect, James Dixson and Gilbert Cameron as the contractors, and the Seneca Quarry for its distinct, dark-red sandstone.  Owen, his brother David Dale Owen, and architect Robert Mills, were involved in developing preliminary plans for the Smithsonian Building. These early plans influenced Renwick's choice of the Romanesque Revival architectural style (sometimes referred to as Norman-style architecture) and his three-story design for the building, which was finally selected, although not without controversy. Owen's book Hints on Public Architecture (1849) argued the case for the suitability of Renwick's Romanesque Revival (Norman) architectural style for public buildings such as the Smithsonian \\"Castle,\\" which he discussed in detail. Seven full-page illustrations and details of the building's architectural elements were prominently featured in the book, leading some to criticize Owen for his bias toward Renwick and his preference for Norman-style architecture over other popular styles.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: Individuals who have satisfying interpersonal relationships and friendships show reduced depression, a more positive outlook, and a better ability to deal with challenging situations and feelings overall. Social support can help reduce stress that is associated with feeling lonely.  Going to therapy and going to family therapy are good ways to work on your relationships. Focus on engaging in social activities that can lead to friendships. Keep away from cynical and negative people if they bring you down. Ask for help when you need it. Rejection can be more of a worry when you feel lonely. Try not to put pressure on yourself to make a new best friend or a fantastic conversation with each social interaction. Instead, try to enjoy the feeling of connecting in the moment.  Social networking allows you to connect without having to worry too much about rejection. Try leaving a comment on someone's post, or sending someone a short message. When you're socializing in person, whether with someone you know or a stranger, try making small talk. You can start with the friendly question, \\"How is your day going?\\". Asking someone how their day is going may not seem like the start of a profound conversation, but it allows you to make a small connection with anyone you meet. If it leads to a deeper conversation, that's fine; if not, you've still shared a moment with another person. Signing up for a dating website, joining a group or club, volunteering, or taking a class are just a few ways to put yourself in situations where you'll meet new people who share common interests.  If you are interested in and connect with someone, a great way to follow up is by adding him or her on a social networking site (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter). Remember that the relationships you form may not grow deeper right away, and that's OK. For now, focus on how it feels to connect with people in the moment. It can be tough to get out there and socialize. Each time you make a connection, whether it's making small talk with a stranger or asking someone in your class out for coffee, be proud of yourself for reaching out.  Feeling positive about your social achievements will help you continue making an effort to connect with people. As your social needs are increasingly met, you'll begin to feel less lonely.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of satisfying interpersonal relationships and friendships in reducing depression and enhancing a positive outlook. Social support aids in diminishing the stress related to loneliness. To nurture relationships, people should consider therapy and engage in social activities leading to friendships.

Sanjay Gupta ( SAHN-jay GOOP-t@; born October 23, 1969) is an American neurosurgeon and medical reporter. He serves as associate chief of the neurosurgery service at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, and as assistant professor of neurosurgery at the Emory University School of Medicine. A media personality on health-related issues, he is best known as CNN's multiple Emmy Award-winning chief medical correspondent, hosting the network's weekend health program Sanjay Gupta, M.D., and making frequent appearances on their American Morning, Larry King Live and Anderson Cooper 360deg programs. His reports from Charity Hospital, New Orleans, Louisiana, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina led to him winning a 2006 Emmy Award for Outstanding Feature Story in a Regularly Scheduled Newscast. Some journalists and journalism professors specializing in health care have criticized Gupta's coverage. Trudy Lieberman, a regular Nation contributor on healthcare and director of the health and medicine reporting program at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, reviewed Gupta's \\"ineptitude\\" in reporting on the McCain health plan. Lieberman criticized Gupta for relying on insurance industry statistics, and a health expert quoted by Lieberman said that Gupta's reporting \\"gives a gross oversimplification\\".  Peter Aldhous criticized Gupta's \\"enthusiasm for many forms of medical screening - even when the scientific evidence indicates that it may not benefit patients\\". He and other medical journalists accuse him of a \\"pro-screening bias\\" in promoting widespread electrocardiogram and prostate cancer screening, even though medical authorities like the US Preventive Services Task Force recommend against it.  Writing in CounterPunch, Pam Martens criticized Gupta's promotion of Merck's cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil, including repeated assertions that it prevented cervical cancer years before clinical trials had proven that to be true, and without disclosing the financial arrangements between CNN and Merck; she also criticized his downplaying of the risks of Vioxx for cardiovascular events, for which he stated that he drew his conclusions from having \\"talked to the makers of Vioxx, the Merck company\\"; and for his involvement in AccentHealth, a health infomercial site that presents itself as patient education and is played in physician waiting rooms and does not in her view adequately disclose its promotional nature.

Dado que las placas están separadas por 15 cm, podemos considerar que esa es la distancia entre ellas. Además, se menciona que hay un campo eléctrico de 5000 N/C en dirección y (hacia arriba). La fuerza eléctrica experimentada por una partícula cargada en un campo eléctrico se calcula mediante la fórmula: F = q * E Donde F es la fuerza eléctrica, q es la carga de la partícula y E es el campo eléctrico. Sabemos que el electrón tiene una carga negativa de -1.6 x 10^-19 C. Por lo tanto, la fuerza eléctrica experimentada por el electrón será: F = (-1.6 x 10^-19 C) * (5000 N/C) F = -8 x 10^-16 N La fuerza eléctrica es negativa porque el electrón tiene carga negativa y el campo eléctrico apunta hacia arriba. La fuerza eléctrica es igual a la fuerza gravitatoria para que el electrón pueda moverse verticalmente. Por lo tanto, podemos igualar la fuerza eléctrica a la fuerza gravitatoria: F = m * g Donde m es la masa del electrón y g es la aceleración debido a la gravedad. La masa del electrón es de aproximadamente 9.11 x 10^-31 kg y la aceleración debido a la gravedad es de aproximadamente 9.8 m/s^2. Sustituyendo estos valores en la ecuación: -8 x 10^-16 N = (9.11 x 10^-31 kg) * (9.8 m/s^2) Resolviendo para la masa: m = -8 x 10^-16 N / (9.11 x 10^-31 kg) / (9.8 m/s^2) m ≈ -9 x 10^-5 kg La masa obtenida es negativa porque la fuerza eléctrica es negativa. La velocidad inicial del electrón se da como 5 x 10^6 m/s hacia arriba, por lo que la magnitud de la velocidad se mantiene constante durante el movimiento vertical. Dado que la velocidad es constante, podemos utilizar la siguiente ecuación del movimiento rectilíneo uniforme: v = u + at Donde v es la velocidad final (0 m/s en este caso, ya que el electrón golpea la placa positiva y se detiene), u es la velocidad inicial (5 x 10^6 m/s hacia arriba), a es la aceleración (9.8 m/s^2 hacia abajo debido a la gravedad) y t es el tiempo de vuelo. 0 m/s = 5 x 10^6 m/s + (-9.8 m/s^2) * t -5 x 10^6 m/s = -9.8 m/s^2 * t t = (-5 x 10^6 m/s) / (-9.8 m/s^2) t ≈ 5.1 x 10^5 s El tiempo de vuelo obtenido es aproximado. La distancia desde el punto P hasta el punto A, donde el electrón golpea la placa positiva, se puede obtener utilizando la siguiente ecuación del movimiento rectilíneo uniforme: s = ut + (1/2) * a * t^2 Donde s es la distancia, u es la velocidad inicial, a es la aceleración y t es el tiempo. s = (5 x 10^6 m/s) * (5.1 x 10^5 s) + (1/2) * (-9.8 m/s^2) * (5.1 x 10^5 s)^2 s = 2.55 x 10^12 m La distancia desde el punto A donde el electrón golpea la placa positiva es aproximadamente 2.55 x 10^12 metros."},{"instruction":"puedes ayudarme a redactar un documento?","output":"¡Por supuesto!

One primary realization for students during this time is the importance of personal responsibility. With the transition to remote learning and limited physical contact with classmates and teachers, students have had to take ownership of their own education. They have discovered that no one else can force them to attend virtual classes or complete assignments; it is up to them to prioritize their learning and stay motivated. This realization has taught students the value of discipline, time management, and self-motivation in achieving their academic goals. Additionally, students have come to appreciate the significance of their mental and emotional well-being. With extended periods of isolation and concerns about health and safety, they have understood the importance of taking care of themselves and seeking support when needed. They have recognized the impact that stress and anxiety can have on their ability to learn and have learned to prioritize self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, and connecting with loved ones. Furthermore, students have realized the power of adaptability and resilience. The sudden shift to online classes and the cancellation of extracurricular activities and events have forced them to adjust quickly and find new ways to pursue their passions and interests. They have discovered their capacity to embrace change, explore creative solutions, and adapt to new circumstances. Through these realizations, students have developed a stronger sense of their own capabilities and the importance of personal growth. They have learned that they are capable of overcoming challenges and thriving even in the face of adversity. These realizations will undoubtedly shape their future, equipping them with valuable life skills and a heightened appreciation for the interconnectedness of personal responsibility, well-being, adaptability, and resilience."},{"instruction":"Personal realization during pandemic","output":"During the pandemic, many people, including students, have had personal realizations about their lives and priorities. For example, a student may have realized the importance of family and relationships. The sudden disruption in regular routines and the inability to see friends and loved ones regularly has made them appreciate the value of human connection. They may have realized that material possessions and academic achievements are not as significant as the love and support of family and friends. This realization could have led them to invest more time and effort in nurturing relationships, whether through regular video calls, virtual game nights, or simply spending quality time with family members at home. Another personal realization that students might have had during the pandemic is the importance of mental health and self-care. The prolonged isolation, increased stress, and uncertainty about the future have brought to light the significance of taking care of one's emotional well-being. Students may have discovered the effectiveness of practices like meditation, exercise, and journaling in managing stress and anxiety. They may have realized that prioritizing self-care is not selfish but necessary for maintaining overall wellness and productivity. Additionally, the pandemic could have sparked a realization about the importance of flexibility and adaptability. As students navigated through sudden changes in their learning environment, they may have recognized the need to be adaptable in various aspects of life. This realization may have made them more open to change, more creative in finding solutions, and more resilient in facing future challenges.

The code also defines several routes: 1. \`/v1/add/region\` - This route is used to add a new region to the database. It expects a JSON payload with an 'id' and 'name' property. The code checks if a region with the same id already exists and inserts a new region if it doesn't. 2. \`/v1/add/tax_param\` - This route is used to add a new tax parameter to the database. It expects a JSON payload with 'city_id', 'from_hp_car', 'to_hp_car', 'from_production_year_car', 'to_production_year_car', and 'rate' properties. The code checks if the specified city_id exists in the region table and inserts a new tax parameter if it does. 3. \`/v1/add/auto\` - This route is used to add a new auto entry to the database. It expects a JSON payload with 'city_id', 'name', 'horse_power', and 'production_year' properties. The code checks if the specified city_id exists in the region table and if a tax parameter exists for the specified horse_power and production_year. If both conditions are met, an auto entry is inserted with the calculated tax based on the tax rate. 4. \`/v1/auto/<id>\` - This route is used to retrieve information about an auto entry with a specific id. It returns a JSON response with the auto entry information. To run the application, you can execute the Python script, and the Flask web server will start running on localhost:5000.

This type of activity involves analyzing, questioning, and evaluating different perspectives and themes to develop a deeper understanding and form educated opinions. In a critical engagement activity, individuals may conduct research, gather evidence, and examine multiple sources of information to identify biases, inconsistencies, and logical fallacies. They actively reflect on their own assumptions and biases, seeking to challenge and refine their thinking. This process may involve exploring the underlying assumptions, values, and implications of a particular idea or argument. Critical engagement activities may be carried out individually or collaboratively in various contexts, such as academic settings, professional discussions, or social platforms. They often include activities like debates, discussions, problem-solving exercises, or analytical writing tasks.

It involves searching through various sources, such as customer feedback, documentation, and existing systems, to gather information on the requirements. This approach helps developers understand the needs and expectations of stakeholders and ensures that the final system meets their requirements accurately."},{"instruction":"what is the difference between search-based and oprimization","output":"The main difference between search-based and optimization approaches is the objective they aim to achieve. Search-based approaches, including search-based requirement engineering, focus on exploring a search space to find solutions that meet certain criteria. These approaches are often used when the problem cannot be solved analytically or when the solution space is too vast to exhaustively evaluate all possibilities. The aim is to find an acceptable solution that meets the desired criteria, but it may not necessarily be the globally optimal or best possible solution. On the other hand, optimization approaches aim to find the best possible solution within a given set of constraints. These methods use mathematical models and algorithms to optimize the objective function and search for the optimal or near-optimal solution. The goal is to maximize or minimize a particular objective while satisfying all specified constraints. Optimization approaches provide a systematic and rigorous way to find the optimum solution, but they may require a significant amount of computational resources, time, and expertise. In summary, search-based approaches focus on finding an acceptable solution within a search space, while optimization approaches aim to find the best possible solution based on a specific objective and constraints."},{"instruction":"what are search-based techniqe","output":"There are several search-based techniques that are commonly used in various domains. Here are a few examples: 1. Genetic Algorithms (GA): Genetic algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution. They involve maintaining a population of candidate solutions and iteratively applying evolutionary operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to generate new generations of solutions. 2. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): Particle swarm optimization is a population-based optimization technique that is inspired by the collective behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. It involves a set of particles moving through a search space and updating their positions based on their own experiences and the best positions found by the swarm. 3. Simulated Annealing (SA): Simulated annealing is a technique inspired by the process of annealing in metallurgy. It uses a probabilistic search strategy where the algorithm starts with an initial solution and then iteratively explores its neighborhood. The algorithm accepts worse solutions based on a probability function that gradually decreases as the search progresses. 4. Tabu Search: Tabu search is a local search-based technique that maintains a short-term memory called a tabu list to avoid revisiting previously visited solutions. It explores the search space by iteratively moving from one solution to a neighboring one, considering both improving and non-improving moves based on the tabu list. 5. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO): Ant colony optimization is inspired by the behavior of real ants in finding the shortest path from a source to a destination. It uses artificial ants to explore the search space by depositing pheromone trails on the edges. The amount of pheromone guides the search and is updated based on the quality of solutions found by the ants. These search-based techniques can be adapted and combined to address specific problem domains and objectives. Each technique has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of technique depends on the problem characteristics and the available resources."},{"instruction":"is there a different between search-based software requirement optimization and search-based software requirement prioritization","output":"Yes, there is a difference between search-based software requirement optimization and search-based software requirement prioritization. Search-based software requirement optimization refers to the use of search-based techniques, such as genetic algorithms or simulated annealing, to optimize software requirements. The goal is to explore different combinations or configurations of requirements to identify the best possible set or arrangement that maximizes a specific objective, such as cost minimization, resource utilization, or performance improvement. This process involves searching through a large solution space to find the optimal or near-optimal solution based on the defined optimization criteria. On the other hand, search-based software requirement prioritization focuses on identifying the most important or critical requirements based on certain criteria. This process involves searching through the requirements set to determine their relative importance or priority. Search-based techniques, such as genetic algorithms or particle swarm optimization, can be used to explore different combinations or permutations of requirements and assign priority values to each requirement. The aim is to identify the order in which requirements should be addressed or implemented, considering factors like customer needs, business value, project constraints, or risk mitigation. In summary, software requirement optimization aims to optimize the overall set of requirements by finding the best possible configuration, while requirement prioritization focuses on determining the relative importance or order of requirements based on specific criteria. Both approaches utilize search-based techniques but are applied to different aspects of requirements engineering."},{"instruction":"ubuntu 装 docker","output":"要在Ubuntu上安装Docker，您可以按照以下步骤进行操作： 1. 更新系统的软件包列表： \`\`\` sudo apt update \`\`\` 2. 安装依赖项，以允许apt使用HTTPS访问Docker仓库： \`\`\` sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common \`\`\` 3. 添加Docker的官方GPG密钥： \`\`\` curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg \`\`\` 4. 添加Docker的apt repository： \`\`\` echo \\"deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu (lsb_release -cs) stable\\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null \`\`\` 5. 更新软件包列表： \`\`\` sudo apt update \`\`\` 6. 安装Docker： \`\`\` sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io \`\`\` 7. 验证Docker是否成功安装： \`\`\` sudo docker run hello-world \`\`\` 如果一切顺利，您应该会看到一个简短的欢迎消息，代表Docker已经成功安装在Ubuntu上。 注意：以上步骤适用于Ubuntu 20.04及更高版本。对于旧版本的Ubuntu，请参考Docker官方文档以获取详细的安装步骤。"},{"instruction":"hello","output":"Hello!

If the chosen method, such as sending emails or using a messaging app, is not effective for the team members involved, it can lead to confusion and misunderstandings. This miscommunication may result in meetings being canceled because participants do not have a clear understanding of the meeting's intent or objectives. (2) Lack of clarity in meeting preparation: Another issue that can lead to the cancellation of regular catch-up meetings is when the preparation for the meeting is not clear. If participants are not given sufficient information or guidance regarding the agenda, topics to be discussed, or any pre-meeting tasks, they may feel unprepared or unsure of what is expected of them. This lack of clarity can discourage attendance and give rise to regular cancellations. (3) Unclear purpose of the meeting: Lastly, when the purpose of the regular catch-up meetings is not clearly defined, it can become difficult to sustain the motivation and interest of the participants. If team members are uncertain about how these meetings contribute to their work or the overall goals of the team, they may view these gatherings as unnecessary or unimportant, leading to frequent cancellations. To address these issues, it is important to establish effective communication channels that suit the team's preferences, provide clear and detailed information for meeting preparation, and clearly communicate the purpose and objectives of the regular catch-up meetings to ensure participants understand their significance."},{"instruction":"Actuellement, notre journal est accessible à toutes la communauté professionnelle.

It is estimated that for most sports, the odds are less than 1 in 10,000. However, for certain sports that require highly specialized skills or have limited spots available, the odds can be even lower. Additionally, factors such as talent, dedication, training, and the level of competition in a particular country also play a significant role in determining the likelihood of becoming an Olympian."},{"instruction":"What about in wrestling for the US","output":"In wrestling, the odds of becoming an Olympian for the US can be quite competitive. The United States has a strong tradition in wrestling and has produced many successful Olympic wrestlers. However, the exact odds can vary based on factors such as weight class, competition level, and individual talent. In terms of qualification, typically an athlete must first compete at a national level to earn a spot on the US wrestling team. This involves participating in various tournaments and trials against other top wrestlers in the country. The top wrestlers from these competitions then advance to the Olympic Trials, where they compete for a limited number of spots to represent the US at the Olympics. Given the highly competitive nature of the sport, the odds of becoming an Olympian in wrestling for the US can be quite challenging. However, with dedication, training, and talent, it is certainly possible to achieve this goal."},{"instruction":"What would be the best training routine","output":"The best training routine for becoming an Olympic wrestler would involve a combination of technical skill development, strength and conditioning, and mental preparation. Here are some key components that could be included: 1. Technical Skill Development: Focus on mastering the fundamental techniques of wrestling, such as takedowns, throws, escapes, and pinning combinations. This requires regular practice and drilling with a partner or coach. 2. Strength and Conditioning: Build overall strength, power, endurance, and agility through a well-rounded strength and conditioning program. This should include weightlifting exercises (such as squats, deadlifts, and bench presses), plyometric drills, cardiovascular training, and functional exercises specific to wrestling movements. 3. Flexibility and Mobility: Maintain and improve flexibility and mobility through regular stretching and mobility exercises. This is crucial for executing different wrestling techniques and avoiding injuries. 4. Cardiovascular Endurance: Develop strong cardiovascular fitness through running, interval training, and sports-specific conditioning drills. Wrestling requires both anaerobic and aerobic endurance, so a combination of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and steady-state cardio can be beneficial. 5. Mental Preparation: Wrestling is mentally demanding, so developing mental toughness, focus, and resilience is important. Incorporate mental training techniques such as visualization, goal setting, positive self-talk, and mindfulness. 6. Competition and Sparring: Regularly compete in local, national, and international tournaments to gain match experience and analyze strengths and weaknesses. Regular sparring and practice matches with different opponents can also help to improve skills and adaptability. 7. Recovery and Rest: Allow time for proper recovery and rest to prevent overtraining and reduce the risk of injury. This includes getting sufficient sleep, maintaining a healthy diet, and incorporating recovery techniques like stretching, foam rolling, ice baths, and massages. Note that the specifics of the training program should be tailored to individual needs, goals, and the guidance of coaches or trainers who have experience with wrestling at an elite level."},{"instruction":"How much money does it take to buy a house in todays market?","output":"The cost of buying a house in today's market varies widely depending on factors such as location, size, condition, and local market conditions. Generally, house prices can range from tens of thousands of dollars for small properties in rural areas to millions of dollars for larger properties in highly desirable urban areas or luxury markets. In the United States, the median home price as of late 2021 is around 350,000. However, this is just a rough estimate and prices can be significantly higher or lower depending on the specific region or city. Additionally, it's important to factor in additional costs associated with purchasing a house, such as closing costs, inspections, appraisals, and potential property taxes. It's recommended to consult with a real estate agent or do further research on the local market to get a more accurate estimate of house prices in your desired location."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

NK cells are part of the innate immune system and play a crucial role in immune surveillance and the regulation of tissue inflammation and fibrosis. Several studies have shown that NK cells can modulate liver fibrosis by interacting with other immune cells, such as hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which are the primary effector cells in the development of liver fibrosis. NK cells can directly kill activated HSCs or stimulate them to undergo apoptosis, thus attenuating liver fibrogenesis. Additionally, NK cells can produce cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which can inhibit HSC activation and promote fibrosis regression. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that the function and phenotype of NK cells can be altered in the context of chronic liver diseases, including liver fibrosis. Chronic inflammation and the presence of fibrotic tissue in the liver can impair NK cell function and alter their phenotype, leading to decreased antifibrotic activity. This altered NK cell response may contribute to the persistence of liver fibrosis. Recent research has also focused on exploring the therapeutic potential of NK cell-based approaches for the treatment of liver fibrosis. This includes the administration of exogenous NK cells or the stimulation of endogenous NK cell activity through the use of cytokines or other immunomodulatory drugs. These approaches aim to enhance NK cell-mediated antifibrotic effects and promote the regression of liver fibrosis. Overall, the research progress on NK cells in liver fibrosis highlights their important role in modulating fibrogenesis and suggests that targeting NK cell function and activity could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of liver fibrosis. However, further studies are needed to fully understand the complex interactions between NK cells and other immune cells involved in liver fibrosis and to develop effective NK cell-based therapies."},{"instruction":"Help me write the introduction section of my SCI paper titled 'The anti fiber effect of IL-10 is dependent on the increase function of nature kill cells in fiber life issue in mice'","output":"Title: The Antifibrotic Effect of IL-10 is Dependent on Enhanced Function of Natural Killer Cells in Fibrotic Liver Tissue in Mice Introduction: Liver fibrosis is a progressive pathological condition characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, leading to the disruption of liver architecture and impaired liver function. It is a common consequence of chronic liver diseases such as viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Despite extensive research, effective therapeutic options for liver fibrosis are limited, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving fibrogenesis and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. The immune response and the interplay between various immune cell populations play a pivotal role in the development and progression of liver fibrosis. Among these immune cells, natural killer (NK) cells have emerged as key players in modulating liver fibrosis by exerting potent antifibrotic effects. NK cells are innate immune cells that recognize and eliminate infected or transformed cells without prior sensitization, mostly through the engagement of activating receptors. Previous studies have demonstrated that NK cells are capable of exerting direct cytotoxic effects on activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main effector cells responsible for ECM deposition in liver fibrosis. NK cells can induce apoptosis or inhibit the activation of HSCs, thereby contributing to the regression of fibrotic tissue. Moreover, NK cells can produce cytokines, including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which possess antifibrotic properties by inhibiting ECM synthesis and promoting fibrosis resolution. Interleukin-10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine, has been shown to possess potent antifibrotic properties in various experimental models of liver fibrosis. IL-10 can inhibit the activation of HSCs, suppress ECM synthesis, and modulate the immune response within the liver. However, the precise mechanisms by which IL-10 exerts its antifibrotic effects, particularly in relation to NK cells, remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of NK cells in mediating the antifibrotic effect of IL-10 in a murine model of liver fibrosis. We hypothesized that IL-10 treatment would enhance NK cell function, thereby attenuating fibrosis progression and promoting fibrosis regression. Understanding the specific contribution of NK cells in the antifibrotic effects of IL-10 could provide valuable insights into the development of targeted therapies for liver fibrosis. In this paper, we present our findings regarding the effect of IL-10 on NK cell function in fibrotic liver tissue of mice. We also elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying the antifibrotic activity of IL-10 mediated through NK cells. The results of this study may contribute to a better understanding of the immunological basis of liver fibrosis and provide a foundation for developing novel therapeutic strategies to combat this debilitating condition."},{"instruction":"Research progress in liver fibrosis","output":"Liver fibrosis is a complex and dynamic process characterized by the excessive accumulation and remodeling of connective tissue in the liver. It is a common consequence of chronic liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and autoimmune liver diseases. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of liver fibrosis has been a topic of extensive research, leading to significant progress in recent years. One key area of research focuses on the role of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in liver fibrosis. HSCs are considered the major effector cells in fibrogenesis, as they undergo activation in response to liver injury and transform into myofibroblasts, which are responsible for excessive production and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. Researchers have made significant strides in deciphering the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms that drive HSC activation and subsequent fibrosis development. This includes the identification of profibrotic cytokines, growth factors, and chemokines, as well as the involvement of various intracellular signaling pathways, such as TGF-β/Smad, MAPK, and Wnt signaling. In addition to HSCs, immune cells play a crucial role in the development and progression of liver fibrosis. Research has shown that immune cell populations, including macrophages, lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells, can either promote or inhibit fibrogenesis. Macrophages, for example, can adopt distinct phenotypes—classically activated M1 or alternatively activated M2—which have contrasting roles in fibrosis. M1 macrophages are pro-inflammatory and promote fibrosis, whereas M2 macrophages have an anti-inflammatory phenotype and contribute to fibrosis resolution. Furthermore, there has been considerable interest in the interaction between liver fibrosis and the gut microbiome. Recent studies have demonstrated that dysbiosis, characterized by alterations in the composition and diversity of gut bacteria, can contribute to the development and progression of liver fibrosis. The gut microbiota-derived metabolites, such as bile acids, lipopolysaccharides, and short-chain fatty acids, can directly affect immune responses and HSC activation, thereby impacting liver fibrosis. Advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics have provided unprecedented insight into the cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization of liver fibrosis. These techniques have revealed novel cell types and gene expression patterns involved in fibrosis, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular processes driving disease progression. Additionally, there has been progress in the development of non-invasive diagnostic tools for assessing liver fibrosis. Liver stiffness measurement using transient elastography or magnetic resonance elastography has emerged as a reliable method for assessing liver fibrosis severity. Similarly, serum biomarkers and imaging techniques, such as FibroTest, FibroScan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are being investigated for their ability to non-invasively stage liver fibrosis and monitor treatment response. The identification and testing of potential antifibrotic therapies is also a rapidly advancing field of research. Multiple targets and therapeutic strategies are being explored, including antifibrotic drugs targeting HSC activation, immune modulation, or ECM remodeling. Some promising approaches under investigation include anti-TGF-β therapies, inhibition of fibrogenic signaling pathways, modulation of the gut-liver axis, and targeted immunotherapies. In summary, research in liver fibrosis has made substantial progress in recent years, shedding light on the complex cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this disease. These advancements hold promise for the development of more accurate diagnostic tools, targeted therapies, and prevention strategies to address the growing burden of liver fibrosis worldwide."},{"instruction":"Research progress of NK cells in liver fibrosis","output":"Research progress on Natural Killer (NK) cells in liver fibrosis has been gaining attention in recent years. NK cells are a type of immune cell that play a critical role in the body's defenses against viral infections and tumor cells. They are known for their ability to directly kill target cells without prior sensitization. In liver fibrosis, NK cells have been found to exhibit both protective and pathogenic functions. Studies have shown that NK cells can contribute to the resolution of liver fibrosis by mediating the killing of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which are major contributors to liver fibrosis. Activated HSCs are responsible for the excessive production of extracellular matrix proteins, leading to the accumulation of scar tissue in the liver. Research has also revealed that NK cells can regulate the immune response by releasing cytokines and chemokines that promote the recruitment and activation of other immune cells, such as macrophages and T cells. This interaction between NK cells and other immune cells can influence the progression or resolution of liver fibrosis. Additionally, studies have highlighted the impact of dysfunctional NK cells in liver fibrosis. Dysfunction of NK cells has been observed in chronic liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and viral hepatitis. This dysfunction can lead to impaired NK cell-mediated killing and cytokine production, contributing to liver fibrosis progression. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that there is a complex interplay between NK cells, liver-resident immune cells, and the gut microbiota in liver fibrosis. Dysbiosis (imbalanced gut microbiota) has been linked to the development of liver fibrosis, and NK cells may play a role in mediating this gut-liver axis. Despite the progress made in understanding the role of NK cells in liver fibrosis, further research is still needed to fully elucidate their precise mechanisms of action and how they can be therapeutically targeted.

Liver fibrosis is a dynamic and reversible process characterized by the excessive accumulation of scar tissue in response to chronic liver injury, ultimately leading to the disruption of liver function. Here, we highlight some of the key research advancements in the field of liver fibrosis. 1. Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms: Extensive research has been conducted to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have emerged as key players in liver fibrosis progression. Activated HSCs are responsible for the production and deposition of excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, leading to the formation of scar tissue. The signaling pathways involved in HSC activation and ECM deposition, such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and endothelin-1 (ET-1), have been extensively investigated. 2. Immune Response and Inflammation: The role of the immune system and inflammation in liver fibrosis has also been extensively studied. Various immune cells, including macrophages, lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells, interact with HSCs and contribute to the progression or resolution of fibrosis. The complex crosstalk between immune cells, inflammatory mediators, and fibrosis-associated cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), is being actively investigated to identify potential targets for therapy. 3. Extracellular Matrix Remodeling: The dynamic remodeling of the ECM is a characteristic feature of liver fibrosis. Researchers have focused on understanding the enzymes and pathways involved in ECM degradation, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Manipulating the balance between MMPs and TIMPs has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy. 4. Epigenetic Modifications: Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs, have emerged as critical regulators of liver fibrosis. Studies have shown that these epigenetic modifications can influence the activation of HSCs, fibrosis-related gene expression, and the progression of liver fibrosis. Targeting epigenetic modifications presents a promising avenue for future therapeutic interventions. 5. Non-Invasive Diagnosis and Monitoring: Traditional liver biopsy, although considered the gold standard for diagnosing liver fibrosis, is invasive and carries certain limitations.

Liver fibrosis, characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, is a common pathological feature of chronic liver diseases. It is well established that liver fibrosis is a dynamic and complex process involving multiple cell types and molecular mechanisms [1]. In recent years, the role of immune cells in liver fibrosis has gained significant attention. Natural killer (NK) cells are a key component of the innate immune system and have been shown to play diverse roles in liver fibrogenesis. NK cells can directly kill activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the major cellular source of ECM proteins during liver fibrosis, through the secretion of cytotoxic molecules, including perforin and granzymes [2]. Additionally, NK cells exhibit immunomodulatory functions by producing cytokines and chemokines that influence the recruitment and activation of other immune cells [3]. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an important anti-inflammatory cytokine known to regulate immune responses and tissue repair processes. Previous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of IL-10 in liver fibrosis, highlighting its role in attenuating inflammation and fibrogenesis [4]. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that IL-10 may also modulate NK cell activity to exert its anti-fibrotic effects in the liver [5]. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the IL-10-mediated regulation of NK cells in liver fibrosis remain largely unknown. Hence, in this study, we aimed to comprehensively investigate the role of IL-10 in modulating NK cell activity in the context of liver fibrosis. Specifically, we focused on understanding the dependence of IL-10's anti-fibrotic effect on the functional enhancement of NK cells within fibrotic liver tissue in a murine model. To achieve this, we employed a well-established mouse model of liver fibrosis, induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) administration. We analyzed the distribution, phenotype, and cytotoxic activity of NK cells in fibrotic liver tissue using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry techniques. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of IL-10 deficiency on fibrogenesis and the associated alterations in NK cell functionality. The findings from this study will shed light on the interplay between IL-10 and NK cells in the context of liver fibrosis, providing valuable insights into the potential therapeutic implications of IL-10-based interventions for liver fibrosis. Moreover, unraveling the mechanisms underlying the IL-10-mediated enhancement of NK cell function could pave the way for the development of novel strategies targeting NK cells to combat liver fibrosis. In summary, this study aims to elucidate the role of IL-10 in regulating NK cell function within fibrotic liver tissue and its impact on liver fibrosis development and progression. Understanding the intricate crosstalk between IL-10 and NK cells could offer novel opportunities for therapeutic interventions aimed at ameliorating liver fibrosis."},{"instruction":"Research progress in liver fibrosis","output":"Introduction Liver fibrosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with chronic liver diseases such as viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease being the primary causes [1]. Liver fibrosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, leading to the disruption of normal liver architecture and impaired liver function. Over time, progressive fibrosis can result in cirrhosis, liver failure, and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma [2]. Understanding the processes and molecular mechanisms involved in liver fibrosis has been the subject of extensive research in recent years. Significant progress has been made in unraveling the complex cellular and molecular events contributing to fibrogenesis, as well as identifying potential therapeutic targets for intervention. This section provides an overview of key research advances in liver fibrosis, focusing on some notable discoveries and emerging trends. 1. Cellular players in liver fibrosis: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have long been recognized as the primary effector cells in liver fibrogenesis. Activated HSCs undergo a transformation from a quiescent lipid-storing phenotype to a myofibroblast-like phenotype, characterized by increased ECM production [3]. However, recent studies have revealed the involvement of various immune cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells, in regulating the fibrotic response [4]. The roles of different immune cell subsets in fibrogenesis and their interplay with HSCs are being increasingly elucidated. 2. Signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms: Several key signaling pathways have been identified as crucial mediators of liver fibrosis. These include the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, the Hedgehog signaling pathway, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway [5]. Researchers have focused on understanding the complex interactions between these signaling pathways and various cell types within the liver, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of fibrogenesis. 3. Epigenetic modifications: Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA expression, have emerged as important contributors to liver fibrosis [6]. Alterations in the epigenetic landscape of cells can result in dysregulated gene expression and contribute to the activation of fibrogenic pathways. Targeting epigenetic modifications holds great therapeutic potential for attenuating liver fibrosis and inhibiting disease progression. 4. Non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis: Traditional methods for assessing liver fibrosis, such as liver biopsy, are invasive and associated with potential complications. Therefore, there is a growing interest in non-invasive techniques for accurate assessment and monitoring of liver fibrosis. Advances in imaging modalities, such as transient elastography (FibroScan), magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging, allow for the non-invasive estimation of liver stiffness, an indirect marker of fibrosis severity [7]. 5. Therapeutic strategies: Several therapeutic approaches for liver fibrosis are being actively investigated. These include targeting specific signaling pathways, modulation of the immune response, inhibition of ECM production and deposition, and promotion of ECM degradation [8]. Furthermore, ongoing research aims to identify novel therapeutic targets and develop innovative treatment strategies, including anti-fibrotic drugs, cell-based therapies, and gene therapy approaches. In conclusion, research into liver fibrosis has significantly advanced our understanding of the complex cellular and molecular processes involved in fibrogenesis. The identification of key players, signaling pathways, and epigenetic modifications, along with the development of non-invasive assessment methods, has opened up new avenues for therapeutic interventions. Continued research efforts hold great promise for the development of effective treatments to halt or reverse liver fibrosis, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of this global health problem."},{"instruction":"La rencontre de ce 11/09 s’est bien déroulée.

The story delves into themes of parental responsibility, neglect, and the consequences of societal expectations. The story opens with a mother, who remains unnamed throughout the narrative, tending to her young daughter as she wakes up in a makeshift bed in their apartment. The mother is described as being a former teacher who is now unemployed and seems to be struggling with her role as a caregiver. The narrative then shifts to a flashback of the mother's childhood, where she recounts her own mother being distant and often absent. This experience has clearly had a profound impact on her own parenting style, as she seems detached and disinterested in her daughter's needs. Throughout the story, it becomes evident that the mother often neglects her daughter, leaving her alone for long periods of time and failing to provide her with basic necessities like food. Instead, she spends her time lost in her own thoughts and reminiscing about her past. One day, the mother receives a phone call informing her that her daughter has been taken into custody by Child Protective Services. Instead of reacting with concern or remorse, the mother is nonchalant and seems almost relieved by the news. She tells herself that it is for the best, asserting that she was never meant to be a mother in the first place. The story concludes with the mother reflecting on her life without her daughter, realizing that she is now free from the burdens of motherhood. However, this newfound freedom is tinged with a sense of emptiness and regret, leaving the reader to question the consequences of her neglect. Overall, \\"Taking Care\\" is a poignant and introspective short story that highlights the complexities of motherhood and the long-lasting effects of neglect. It serves as a critique of societal expectations and the devastating impact they can have on individuals who are ill-equipped to fulfill them."},{"instruction":"Conclusion","output":"In conclusion, \\"Taking Care\\" is a thought-provoking short story that delves into the complicated relationship between a mother and her daughter.
