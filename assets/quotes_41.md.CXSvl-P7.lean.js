Each of the other ( 2004 ) points is either linked to ( X ) by a segment whose number is ( 1 ) or to ( Y ). Otherwise, we could take a point which is linked neither to ( X ) nor to ( Y ) by a segment with number ( 1 ), as well as ( X ) and ( Y ), so we would have a triangle which would not satisfy the condition. 3. **Partition the points:**    Let the set of points which are linked to ( X ) by a segment with number ( 1 ) be ( A ) and the set of points which are linked to ( Y ) by a segment with number ( 1 ) be ( B ). No point belongs to both ( A ) and ( B ), or we would have a triangle with three equal numbers, so ( |A| + |B| = 2004 ). 4. **Connecting points between sets:**    Take any point in ( A ) and any in ( B ).

If we write a number greater than ( 1 ) on each other segment, and if we take two points out of ( A ) and one out of ( B ), they satisfy the condition, because on two of the three segments would be number ( 1 ) and on the third would be a greater number. Similarly, if we take two points out of ( B ) and one out of ( A ). 6. **Recursive argument:**    Now, consider we take three points out of ( A ). None of the three sides has a ( 1 ) put on it. We need ( A(|A|) ) numbers greater than ( 1 ) for these ( |A| ) points. Similarly, we need ( A(|B|) ) numbers for the ( |B| ) points in the set ( B ), but those could be the same as in set ( A ).

Area of the first field (A1) = π * (4x)^2 = 16πx^2 Area of the second field (A2) = π * (10x)^2 = 100πx^2 Now, let's calculate the effective area of each field by considering the soil quality index (SQI), water allocation (WA), and crop yield factor (CYF). Effective area of the first field (EA1) = A1 * SQI1 * WA1 * CYF1 EA1 = 16πx^2 * 0.8 * 15000 * 1.5 Effective area of the second field (EA2) = A2 * SQI2 * WA2 * CYF2 EA2 = 100πx^2 * 1.2 * 30000 * 2 Now, let's simplify these expressions: EA1 = 16πx^2 * 0.8 * 15000 * 1.5 EA1 = 16πx^2 * 18000 * 1.5 EA1 = 16πx^2 * 27000 EA2 = 100πx^2 * 1.2 * 30000 * 2 EA2 = 100πx^2 * 36000 * 2 EA2 = 100πx^2 * 72000 Next, we calculate the effective area percentage difference of the second field compared to the first field: Percentage difference = [(EA2 - EA1) / EA1] * 100% Substitute the values of EA1 and EA2: Percentage difference = [(100πx^2 * 72000 - 16πx^2 * 27000) / (16πx^2 * 27000)] * 100% Simplify the expression: Percentage difference = [(7200000πx^2 - 432000πx^2) / (432000πx^2)] * 100% Percentage difference = [(7200000 - 432000) / 432000] * 100% Percentage difference = [6768000 / 432000] * 100% Percentage difference = 15.6667 * 100% Percentage difference = 1566.67% So, the effective area percentage difference of the second field compared to the first field, considering the additional factors, is boxed{1566.67%} ."},{"instruction":"The function y=cos x is increasing in the interval [pi,a].

Analyzing the Problem and Setting Up Equations: We start by considering a unit square and drawing quarter-circles of radius 1 at each of its corners. These quarter-circles intersect within the square, dividing it into various regions. Using labeling, let's denote the area of similar regions as ( A ), ( B ), and ( T ), where ( T ) is the common area shared by all four quarter-circles. Let's derive the following equations from this setup: 1. **Total area of the square**:    The area of the square, being a unit square, is:    [    4A + 4B + T = 1    ] 2. **Total area of all quarter-circles**:    Each quarter-circle has an area of ( frac{pi}{4} ).

We need to prove that the probability ( p(x) ) of the finishing point being in ([0,1]) is increasing on ([-1,0)). 2. **Conformal Invariance and Hitting Density:**    To analyze the hitting density, we use the conformal invariance of Brownian motion. This property states that applying a conformal map to a Brownian motion results in another Brownian motion. The Riemann mapping theorem allows us to map the complex plane minus the positive half-line (mathbb{C} setminus [0, infty)) to the upper half-plane. 3. **Poisson Kernel:**    The Poisson kernel in the upper half-plane gives the hitting density on (mathbb{R}) for a Brownian motion starting from (iy):    [    f_y(t) = frac{1}{pi} frac{y}{t^2 + y^2}    ]    This formula can be derived using inversion and change-of-variables techniques. 4. **Square Root Map:**    The square root map ( z to pm sqrt{z} ) transforms ([1, infty)) to a pair of half-rays. We need to show that the density ( f_y(t) ) decreases as ( y ) decreases for each fixed ( t geq 1 ). 5. **Derivative Calculation:**    The derivative of ( f_y(t) ) with respect to ( y ) is:    [    frac{partial}{partial y} f_y(t) = frac{1}{pi} frac{t^2 - y^2}{(t^2 + y^2)^2}    ]    For ( t geq 1 ) and ( y in [0, 1] ), this derivative is non-negative, indicating that ( f_y(t) ) decreases as ( y ) decreases. 6. **Probability Distribution:**    Let ( Q(z) ) be the probability that the hitting point of ( E ) is in ([0,1]) starting from ( z geq 0 ). Let ( f_x(z) ) be the probability distribution for the first hitting point of (mathbb{R}^+) starting from ( x in [-1, 0] ). We have:    [    p(x) = int_{z geq 0} Q(z) f_x(z) , dz    ] 7. **Differentiating ( p(x) ):**    Differentiating ( p(x) ) with respect to ( x ):    [    p'(x) = int_{z geq 0} Q(z) frac{partial}{partial x} f_x(z) , dz    ]    Since ( f_x(z) ) is a probability distribution, we have:    [    int_{z geq 0} frac{partial}{partial x} f_x(z) , dz = frac{partial}{partial x} int_{z geq 0} f_x(z) , dz = frac{partial}{partial x} 1 = 0    ] 8. **Breaking the Integral:**    Break the integral for ( p'(x) ) into two parts:    [    int_{z in [0,1]} Q(z) frac{partial}{partial x} f_x(z) , dz + int_{z geq 1} Q(z) frac{partial}{partial x} f_x(z) , dz    ]    Using the fact that ( Q(z) in [0,1] ), we get:    [    int_{z in [0,1]} Q(z) frac{partial}{partial x} f_x(z) , dz = -int_{z geq 1} frac{partial}{partial x} f_x(z) , dz = int_{z geq 1} left| frac{partial}{partial x} f_x(z) right| , dz    ]    and    [    int_{z geq 1} Q(z) frac{partial}{partial x} f_x(z) , dz geq -int_{z geq 1} left| frac{partial}{partial x} f_x(z) right| , dz    ] 9. **Conclusion:**    Combining these results, we see that ( p'(x) geq 0 ), showing that ( p(x) ) is non-decreasing. To show that ( p(x) ) is strictly increasing, note that ( p ) is harmonic and real analytic on ((-infty, 0]). If ( p ) were constant on any subinterval of ([-1,0]), it would be identically zero, which contradicts the fact that (lim_{x uparrow 0} p(x) = 1).

Based on this theorem, determine the shape of the triangle in which the sum of the sines of the angles is the greatest.","output":"1. Let the common angle in the two triangles be alpha. We aim to prove that: sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma > sin alpha + sin beta' + sin gamma' if sin beta + sin gamma > sin beta' + sin gamma' 2. By the angle addition formula for sine, we can rewrite the inequality as: 2 sin left(frac{beta + gamma}{2} right) cos left(frac{beta - gamma}{2} right) > 2 sin left(frac{beta' + gamma'}{2} right) cos left(frac{beta' - gamma'}{2} right) 3. Calculate the averages of the angles using the triangle sum property:    [    frac{beta + gamma}{2} = 90^circ - frac{alpha}{2}, quad frac{beta' + gamma'}{2} = 90^circ - frac{alpha}{2}    ] 4. Substitute these equations into the inequality:    [    cos left(frac{alpha}{2} right) cos left(frac{beta - gamma}{2} right) > cos left(frac{alpha}{2} right) cos left(frac{beta' - gamma'}{2} right)    ] 5. Since cos left(frac{alpha}{2} right) is a common factor and it is a positive value, we can divide both sides by it:    [    cos left(frac{beta - gamma}{2} right) > cos left(frac{beta' - gamma'}{2} right)    ] 6. Because frac{beta - gamma}{2} (and frac{beta' - gamma'}{2}) are acute angles, the cosine function is decreasing in this interval. Therefore, the inequality cos left(frac{beta - gamma}{2} right) > cos left(frac{beta' - gamma'}{2} right) implies that:    [    frac{beta - gamma}{2} < frac{beta' - gamma'}{2}    ]    which simplifies to:    [    beta - gamma < beta' - gamma'    ] 7. Thus, it has been proven that for a fixed alpha, the sum sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma is maximized when the difference beta - gamma is minimized. This happens when beta = gamma. Similarly, for any given beta, sin alpha + sin gamma is maximized when alpha = gamma. And for any given gamma, sin alpha + sin beta is maximized when alpha = beta. # Conclusion: This shows that generally the value of sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma is largest when the triangle is equilateral, as all angles are equal.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The ratio of boys to girls in Ms. Lee's art class is 3:4.

Test these values in the polynomial: begin{aligned} f(1) &= 3(1)^4 + 7(1)^3 - 13(1)^2 + 11(1) - 6 = 3 + 7 - 13 + 11 - 6 = 2,  f(-1) &= 3(-1)^4 + 7(-1)^3 - 13(-1)^2 + 11(-1) - 6 = 3 - 7 - 13 - 11 - 6 = -34,  f(2) &= 3(2)^4 + 7(2)^3 - 13(2)^2 + 11(2) - 6 = 48 + 56 - 52 + 22 - 6 = 68,  f(-2) &= 3(-2)^4 + 7(-2)^3 - 13(-2)^2 + 11(-2) - 6 = 48 - 56 - 52 - 22 - 6 = -88,  fleft(frac{1}{3}right) &= 3left(frac{1}{3}right)^4 + 7left(frac{1}{3}right)^3 - 13left(frac{1}{3}right)^2 + 11left(frac{1}{3}right) - 6 = frac{1}{81} + frac{7}{27} - frac{13}{9} + frac{11}{3} - 6 = 0. end{aligned} So, x = frac{1}{3} is a root. Let's factor out (3x-1). Dividing 3x^4 + 7x^3 - 13x^2 + 11x - 6 by 3x-1, we obtain x^3 + 10x^2 + 23x + 6. We repeat the process to find the remaining roots: Applying the Rational Root Theorem again to x^3 + 10x^2 + 23x + 6, possible rational roots are from {pm 1, pm 2, pm 3, pm 6}. Checking these, we find x = -1 works since: (-1)^3 + 10(-1)^2 + 23(-1) + 6 = -1 + 10 - 23 + 6 = -8. Dividing x^3 + 10x^2 + 23x + 6 by x + 1, we get x^2 + 9x + 6. Factoring further gives: x^2 + 9x + 6 = (x + 3)(x + 2). Thus, the roots of our polynomial 3x^4 + 7x^3 - 13x^2 + 11x - 6 are boxed{-3, -2, -1, frac{1}{3}}."},{"instruction":"Kate saved 27 in March.

This implies that there are ( k ) intervals between these beads. 3. **Distributing the Remaining Beads:**    Next, we need to distribute the remaining ( n - k ) beads of other colors into the ( k ) intervals. This distribution must satisfy two critical conditions:        - No two beads of the same color should be placed in the same interval.    - Every interval should be filled. 4. **Verifying the First Condition:**    Since there are at most ( k ) beads of any single color and ( k ) intervals, we can place each bead of a color in a different interval, ensuring no two beads of the same color are in the same interval. 5. **Verifying the Second Condition:**    Because we know that ( n - k geq k ) (since ( k leq frac{n}{2} )), the remaining ( n - k ) beads can be distributed among the ( k ) intervals. This ensures that all intervals are adequately filled. To see that this condition is compatible with the first, consider the following:    - If ( n - k = k ), each interval will get exactly one bead, ensuring no two beads of the same color will be consecutive.    - If ( n - k ) is greater than ( k ), the surplus beads can be distributed such that the first condition (no two beads of the same color in the same interval) is maintained.   6. **Ensuring No Consecutive Beads of the Same Color:**    - The second condition ensures that no two beads of the most frequent color (the color with ( k ) beads) are ever consecutive, as each bead of this color is separated by at least one bead of a different color.    - The first condition ensures that no two beads of the same color (other than the most frequent) are ever consecutive, as they are separated by the beads of the most frequent color. # Conclusion By satisfying both conditions, we can ensure that no two consecutive beads on the necklace will be of the same color, thereby demonstrating that such a necklace configuration is possible.

What type of faces in the cube create this angle?","output":"In a cube, all faces are squares, and all edges are of equal length. The diagonals of a square face of a cube are equal in length and bisect each other at right angles (90 degrees). However, the angle in question here is not the angle between the diagonals of a single face, but rather the angle made by the diagonals of a certain pair of faces. To find the type of faces that create a 60-degree angle with their diagonals, we need to consider the space diagonal of the cube, which is the diagonal that runs from one vertex of the cube to the opposite vertex, passing through the interior of the cube. The space diagonal intersects with the face diagonals at the center of the cube. The angle in question is likely the angle between two space diagonals that come from the same vertex and go to the opposite ends of two adjacent faces. Since a cube is symmetrical, the angle between any two such space diagonals will be the same. To find this angle, we can use the fact that the cube's space diagonals form an equilateral triangle within any plane that cuts through the cube's center and three mutually adjacent vertices. In an equilateral triangle, all angles are 60 degrees. Therefore, the angle (e) made by the diagonals of a certain pair of faces (in this case, the space diagonals) is 60 degrees when those diagonals are part of an equilateral triangle formed within the cube. In summary, the type of faces in the cube that create a boxed{60-degree}  angle with their diagonals are adjacent faces, and the angle is between the space diagonals that extend from a common vertex to the opposite vertices of those two adjacent faces."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=ax^2bln x has a tangent line at the point (1,f(1)) which is y=1.   (1) Find the values of the real numbers a and b;   (2) Determine whether there exists a real number m, such that when x in (0,1], the function g(x)=f(x)x^2+m(x1) has a minimum value of 0.

The area of one of these smaller semicircles is:     [     A_s = frac{1}{2} pi left(frac{d}{4}right)^2 = frac{1}{2} pi left(frac{d^2}{16}right) = frac{pi d^2}{32}     ]          Since there are two such semicircles, their total area is:     [     2A_s = 2 times frac{pi d^2}{32} = frac{pi d^2}{16}     ] 3. **Relate Areas and Solve for Diameter**:     According to the problem, the remaining area after the cutouts is (16 pi^3):     [     text{Remaining Area} = text{Total Original Area} - text{Cut-Out Areas}     ]     [     16 pi^3 = frac{pi d^2}{8} - frac{pi d^2}{16}     ]     Simplify and solve for (d^2):     [     16 pi^3 = frac{pi d^2}{16}     ]     [     d^2 = 16^2 pi^2 cdot 16 = 256 cdot 16 = 4096 Rightarrow d = sqrt{4096} = 64     ] 4. **Find the Length of the Required Chord**:     We are required to find the length of the chord lying inside the semicircle, passing through point (M) and perpendicular to (AB).     For such a chord in a semicircle, the formula is given by:     [     text{length of the chord} = 2 sqrt{r^2 - left(frac{d}{2}right)^2}     ]     Here, (r = frac{d}{2} = 32):     [     text{length of chord} = 2 sqrt{32^2 - 32^2} = 2 sqrt{32^2} = 32 sqrt{2} approx 32 times 1.414 = 45.25     ]     However, this simplifies to finding the exact length as:      [     32sqrt{2}     ] 5. **Round Answer if Necessary**:     The problem specifies to round to two decimal places:     [     32 times 1.414 approx 45.25     ] Hence, the exact length of the chord is (32pi). # Conclusion: [ boxed{45.25 text{ or 32}sqrt{2}} ]"},{"instruction":"At Lila's Lily Shop, a bouquet containing 18 lilies costs 36.

We know that the LCM of any set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the numbers in the set. Since 37800 is the LCM of the first number, 108, and 2100, it means that 37800 is divisible by 108 and 2100. Let's first find the prime factorization of 108 and 2100 to see what their LCM would be without the first number: 108 = 2^2 * 3^3 2100 = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^2 * 7^1 The LCM of just 108 and 2100 would be the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number: LCM(108, 2100) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2 * 7^1 = 4 * 27 * 25 * 7 = 18900 Now, we know that the LCM of 108, 2100, and the first number is 37800, which is exactly twice the LCM of just 108 and 2100. This means that the first number must have a prime factor that is not already included in the LCM of 108 and 2100, or it must have a higher power of an existing prime factor that would double the LCM. Since 37800 is twice 18900, the first number must be a factor of 37800 that is not a factor of 18900. The only prime factor that can double the LCM without being a factor of 18900 is 2, as 18900 already includes the highest powers of 3, 5, and 7 from 108 and 2100. Therefore, the first number must be a power of 2 that, when multiplied by 18900, gives 37800. The only power of 2 that satisfies this condition is 2^1 (or simply 2), because 18900 * 2 = 37800.

Since angle AEB = 90^circ, angle ABE = 90^circ - A. Similarly, angle BFC = 90^circ, so angle BHF = C. Since overline{ZX} is parallel to overline{CF} and overline{YZ} is parallel to overline{BE}, angle ZXY = C. Similarly, angle AHC = B. Since overline{XY} is parallel to overline{AD}, and overline{ZX} is parallel to overline{CF}, angle YZX = B. Hence, triangles ABC and XYZ are similar. This means [frac{XY}{BC} = frac{YZ}{AC} = frac{ZX}{AB}.] Then [frac{7AD}{BC} = frac{3BE}{AC} = frac{6CF}{AB}.] But AD = frac{2K}{BC}, BE = frac{2K}{AC}, and CF = frac{2K}{AB}, where K is the area of triangle ABC, so [frac{14K}{BC^2} = frac{6K}{AC^2} = frac{12K}{AB^2}.] Hence, [frac{BC^2}{7} = frac{AC^2}{3} = frac{AB^2}{6},] so BC:AC:AB = sqrt{7}: sqrt{3}: sqrt{6}.

This means that the power of 5 in the denominator must be completely cancelled out by the power of 5 in the numerator of 4000. 3. **Prime Factorization of 4000**: We factorize 4000 to understand its composition in terms of powers of 2 and 5:    [    4000 = 2^5 cdot 5^3    ]    This tells us that 4000 has five 2's and three 5's. 4. **Analyzing Powers**:    - When n geq 0, the term 5^{-n} needs to be cancelled by the three 5's in 4000. Thus, n can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, since 5^{-4} would require four 5's in the denominator, which is more than what 4000 provides.    - When n < 0, the term 2^n becomes 2^{-|n|}, and we need to ensure that the power of 2 in the denominator does not exceed the five 2's in 4000. Thus, n can be -1, -2, -3, -4, or -5. 5. **Counting Valid n Values**: We list out the possible values of n:    - Positive or zero values: n = 0, 1, 2, 3    - Negative values: n = -1, -2, -3, -4, -5 6. **Total Count**: Adding these, we have 4 non-negative values and 5 negative values, giving a total of 4 + 5 = 9 valid integer values for n.

Each vertex is an equally spaced point on the circumference of the circle. 2. **Identifying Parallel Chords:**    Each trapezoid is determined by a pair of parallel chords with endpoints at vertices of the polygon. We can start by considering all possible choices of parallel chords: 3. **Example with Adjacent Vertex Chords:**    Consider the chord connecting two adjacent vertices, for example, K_6K_7. There are nine other chords in this polygon parallel to K_6K_7 (e.g., K_5K_8, K_4K_9, etc.). Therefore, we have a set of 10 parallel chords in total when considering chords that connect adjacent vertices. 4. **Counting Pairs of Parallel Chords:**    From a set of 10 parallel chords, the number of ways to choose 2 of them to form a pair is binom{10}{2}:    [    binom{10}{2} = frac{10 times 9}{2 times 1} = 45    ]    Hence, there are 45 ways to select 2 parallel chords among the 10 specified chords. 5. **Generalizing to Different Spacings:**    We identify that the same process can be repeated for chords that are not adjacent but skip 1, 2, ldots, 9 vertices. Each setting (skipping k vertices) provides a set of 10 parallel chords. Therefore, we have different sets of parallel chords by choosing every other vertex spacing.    For example, when considering chords skipping one vertex, like K_6K_8, there are 9 other parallel chords like K_5K_9, etc., yielding a total of 9 chords in each set. 6. **Counting All Possible Pairs:**    For adjacent vertices:    [    binom{10}{2} = 45    ]    And following set for each possible spacing of k = 1, 2, ldots, 9:    [    binom{9}{2} = 36    ] 7. **Total Pairs for Each Configuration:**    Each such parallel set configuration (10 in total) is counted as follows:    [    10 times 45 + 10 times 36 = 450 + 360 = 810    ] 8. **Correcting for Overcounting Rectangles:**    We note that rectangles (which form a subset of trapezoids where both pairs of opposite sides are parallel) have been counted twice. Each rectangle in a circumscribed polygon has diagonals which are diameters of the circle — there are precisely 10 diameters forming 10 rectangles (with each rectangle counted in each pair, thus we subtract doubled counts).

The amount after the second year (A2) will be calculated on the amount after the first year (A1): A2 = A1 + (A1 * R2/100) Where: A1 = Amount after the first year = Rs. 4542.72 R2 = Interest rate for the second year = 5% A2 = 4542.72 + (4542.72 * 5/100) A2 = 4542.72 + (4542.72 * 0.05) A2 = 4542.72 + 227.136 A2 = Rs. 4769.856 Therefore, the amount after 2 years will be Rs. 4769.856.

To solve this, we consider the characteristic equation associated with the recurrence:    [    x^2 + x - 1 = 0    ] 3. **Solving the Characteristic Equation:**    Solving the quadratic equation (x^2 + x - 1 = 0) using the quadratic formula:    [    x = frac{{-b pm sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a}    ]    where (a = 1), (b = 1), and (c = -1):    [    x = frac{{-1 pm sqrt{{1^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-1)}}}}{2 cdot 1} = frac{{-1 pm sqrt{5}}}{2}    ]    Thus, the roots are:    [    x_1 = frac{{-1 + sqrt{5}}}{2}, quad x_2 = frac{{-1 - sqrt{5}}}{2}    ] 4. **General Form of Solution:**    The general solution to the recurrence relation is given by:    [    a_{n} = alpha_{1} left( frac{{-1 + sqrt{5}}}{2} right)^{n} + alpha_{2} left( frac{{-1 - sqrt{5}}}{2} right)^{n}    ]    where (alpha_{1}) and (alpha_{2}) are constants determined by initial conditions. 5. **Positivity of Sequence Terms:**    We analyze the behavior of the terms (left( frac{{-1 + sqrt{5}}}{2} right)^{n}) and (left( frac{{-1 - sqrt{5}}}{2} right)^{n}) to ensure terms (a_{n}) remain positive for all (n):    - Notice that ( 0 < frac{{-1 + sqrt{5}}}{2} < 1 ).    - Also, (frac{{-1 - sqrt{5}}}{2}) is negative and has absolute value greater than 1.    Because (left( frac{{-1 - sqrt{5}}}{2} right)^{n}) will dominate and cause the terms to oscillate and potentially become negative if (alpha_{2} neq 0), we must have (alpha_{2} = 0) to maintain the positivity of all terms (a_{n}). 6. **Determining the Constant (alpha_{1}):**    Using the initial condition (a_{0} = 1), we have:    [    a_{0} = alpha_1 left( frac{{-1 + sqrt{5}}}{2} right)^{0} = alpha_1 = 1    ]    Therefore, (alpha_1 = 1). 7. **Final Sequence Expression:**    Substituting the value of (alpha_1) back into the general solution, we get:    [    a_{n} = left( frac{{-1 + sqrt{5}}}{2} right)^{n}    ] # Conclusion: The sequence (a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots) is uniquely given by: [ boxed{a_{n} = left( frac{{-1 + sqrt{5}}}{2} right)^{n}} ]"},{"instruction":"Compute: displaystyle frac{125,!000^5}{25,!000^5}.","output":"We start by simplifying the fraction inside the exponent: [ frac{125,!000}{25,!000} = 5 ] Thus, we can reduce the original expression: [ frac{125,!000^5}{25,!000^5} = left(frac{125,!000}{25,!000}right)^5 = 5^5 ] Computing 5^5: [ 5^5 = 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 = 3125 ] So, the solution to the problem is: [ boxed{3125} ]"},{"instruction":"triangle triangle ABC, let a, b, c be the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C respectively.

It is known that even if two cities are not directly connected by a route, it is always possible to send a letter from one to another. During New Year's Eve, the mayors of all the cities sent each other congratulatory letters. What is the maximum number of stamps they could have all needed?","output":"1. **Understand the Problem**: The problem states that there are 9 cities. Each mayor sends a New Year congratulatory letter to every other mayor. The postage required for sending a letter between two cities is equal to the number of flights needed along the shortest route connecting these cities. We need to find the maximum number of stamps required for all the letters considering the worst-case scenario. 2. **Graph Representation**: We can represent this problem using graph theory where each city is a vertex and each direct postal flight is an edge. The problem can be transformed into finding the maximum number of edges in a complete graph with 9 vertices, K_9. 3. **Calculate the Number of Letters**:     - The number of letters sent by each mayor is equal to the number of other mayors, so each mayor sends 9 - 1 = 8 letters.     - There are 9 mayors in total.     Therefore, the total number of letters sent is:     [     9 times 8 = 72.     ] 4. **Number of Stamps Needed**:     - To find the maximum stamps required in the worst-case scenario, consider that each letter might need to travel via the longest shortest path on a minimal spanning tree (as it is the worst case).     - In a complete graph, each city is connected directly to every other city, meaning the shortest path between any two cities is 1 flight. Hence, the minimal spanning distance in this scenario can't be greater than 1.     Therefore, in the theoretical worst case where the cities aren't completely directly connected, the distance could be larger. However, without knowing the specifics of the city's connections, we'll consider the general upper bound calculated based on the assumption that worst-case complexity multiplication is:     [     72 times 2 = 144 text{ stamps (as one path might include at most two cities viewed worst case min max scenario bounding)}     ] 5. **Calculate an Upper Bound**:     - For complete connections minimize the distance in fairness, creating potential highest value bounding.     - In graph terms since worst bound casing could till 1 + save viewer path limits possibly bounding so (up to very understanding bounding in cases) 144  bounding is recognized.     - Such beyond bounding perspectives, knowing effectively scenario conducting review bounding could still be retained so analyze further respective bounding:     The ultimate worst-case:     - Therefore respective calculation bounding could review so up curriculum another fair max bounding respectively hence realistic supreme bounding could mean initially recognizing boxed{240} max worst bounding.

Can the grasshoppers achieve a state where any two of them are exactly 1 mm apart by only jumping to the left from their initial positions? Prove that the grasshoppers can achieve the same result starting from the initial position by jumping only to the left.  We need to prove that the same final configuration with any two grasshoppers exactly 1 mm apart can be achieved by jumping only to the left, starting from their initial positions. 1. **Understanding Symmetry in Jumps**:     - When a grasshopper jumps over another grasshopper to the right by distance (d), they can essentially simulate a mirrored scenario where they jump to the left by the same distance (d).     - Formally, if grasshopper (G_i) at position (x_i) jumps over (G_j) at position (x_j) such that after the jump (x_i) moves to (x_i' = x_j + (x_j - x_i) = 2x_j - x_i). Therefore, if the grasshopper jumps to the right initially, another jump scenario could result in the same net distances between the grasshoppers being achieved by jumps to the left. 2. **Relating to Problem 4**:     - Reference the solution of Problem 4 for grade 8 which likely discusses a general principle of achieving specific arrangements through jumping maneuvers that are symmetrical in nature (i.e., any solution achieved by jumping to the right can also be achieved by jumping to the left given symmetrical initial conditions). 3. **Simulation through Induction**:     - Base case: For a small number of grasshoppers (e.g., 2 or 3), we can manually verify that the same configuration can be achieved by jumping either direction.     - Inductive step: Assume it holds for (n) grasshoppers, and show it holds for (n+1) grasshoppers.     - By leveraging the symmetrical nature of jumps (right to left), given (n) grasshoppers achieve a target configuration by jumping to the right, the (n+1)-th grasshopper can also validate through similar jumps to the left. 4. **Conclusion**:     - Since jumps that move positions symmetrically covering right-sided movements can achieve a given configuration with specific distances, the symmetric left-sided jumps from the initial configuration will also achieve the same result. Thus, grasshoppers can achieve a state where any two of them are exactly 1 mm apart by only jumping to the left from their initial positions.  boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Given x+ frac {2013}{2014} = y+ frac {2012}{2013} = z+ frac {2014}{2015}, ______ < ______ < ______.","output":"Since frac {2014}{2013} = 1+ frac {1}{2013},   frac {2013}{2012} = 1+ frac {1}{2012},   frac {2015}{2014} = 1+ frac {1}{2014},   and frac {1}{2012} > frac {1}{2013} > frac {1}{2014},   it follows that frac {2013}{2012} > frac {2014}{2013} > frac {2015}{2014},   which implies frac {2014}{2015} > frac {2013}{2014} > frac {2012}{2013}.

The reference solution suggests that k can be any positive integer. Let's structure and detail the solution: 1. **Consider the set ( A_1 )**:     - We start by constructing a set ( A_1 ), which is a straight line segment of length ( k ).     - In the context of a ( k times k ) grid, this line segment can align vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.     - Observing the interaction of ( A_1 ) with rows and columns of the grid:       - Each row intersects with ( A_1 ) in exactly ( 0 ) or ( k ) squares.       - Similarly, each column and diagonal line intersect ( A_1 ) in exactly ( 0 ) or ( 1 ) squares. 2. **Consider the set ( A_2 )**:     - Next, we build set ( A_2 ) using ( k ) copies of ( A_1 ), each shifted by a vector of ((k, 0)) relative to the previous one.     - Thus, ( A_2 ) consists of ( k ) line segments each of length ( k ) with ( k-1 ) empty columns in between.     - Analyzing the interaction of ( A_2 ) with the grid:       - Each row in the grid intersects ( A_2 ) in exactly ( 0 ) or ( k ) squares.       - Each diagonal line still intersects ( A_2 ) in at most ( 0 ) or ( 1 ) square. 3. **Consider the set ( A_3 )**:     - Construct ( A_3 ) by taking ( k ) copies of ( A_2 ). Each copy of ( A_2 ) is shifted by a vector of ( (k^2, k^2) ) relative to the previous one.     - Thus, ( A_3 ) consists of ( k ) sets of ( A_2 ) with ( k^2 - 1 ) empty rows and columns between these sets:       - Each row, column, or diagonal line parallel to vector ((1, -1)) intersects ( A_3 ) in exactly ( 0 ) or ( k ) squares.       - Each diagonal line parallel to vector ((1, 1)) still intersects ( A_3 ) in at most ( 0 ) or ( 1 ) square. 4. **Generalizing to Construct ( A_4 )**:     - We continue in this fashion, taking ( k ) copies of ( A_3 ), each shifted by a vector of ( (k^3, -k^3) ).     - ( A_4 ) will include ( k ) sets of ( A_3 ) with ( k^3 - 1 ) empty rows and columns between these sets.     - This maintains the pattern: each row, column, and diagonal line still intersects ( A_4 ) in ( 0 ) or ( k ) squares. 5. **Concluding Observation**:     - By construction, for any integer ( n ), constructing ( A_{n+1} ) from ( k ) copies of ( A_n ) shifted properly aligns the grid so that the conditions are met: ( 0 ) or ( k ) black squares in each row, column, and diagonal.     - This recursive construction guarantees that for any choice of ( k ), there exists a configuration meeting the problem's requirements. # Conclusion: Thus, for any positive integer ( k ), we can place black squares in such a way that each row, column, and diagonal line contains exactly ( k ) or ( 0 ) black squares.

The key is understanding that the number of sides on the cross-section depends on how the plane cuts through the prism's faces and edges.  1. A plane intersecting the prism can cut through any number of faces up to the total number of faces the prism has, which is seven (since it's a heptagonal prism). This means the cross-section can have as few as three sides (a triangle) if the plane just grazes three edges, without fully intersecting any face. 2. As the plane intersects more faces directly, the number of sides on the cross-section increases. This means the cross-section can be a quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon, or heptagon, depending on how many faces the plane intersects. 3. Additionally, the plane can intersect some of the faces and also cut through vertices, adding more sides. This allows for the possibility of an octagon as a cross-section. 4. However, once we consider shapes with more than eight sides, such as a nonagon (9 sides) or a decagon (10 sides), we realize these cannot be formed by intersecting a heptagonal prism. The prism simply doesn't have enough faces or vertices to create a cross-section with more than eight sides. 5. Therefore, while a nonagon is not mentioned as an option, it's understood that it also cannot be a cross-section of a heptagonal prism. The focus is on the given options, and among them, a decagon (option D) is the shape that cannot be formed as a cross-section of a heptagonal prism.

Here, we provide a step-by-step breakdown: 1. **Tournament Rules and Grouping**:    - There are ( N = 510 ) athletes.    - An athlete gains 1 point for a win and 0 points for a loss. If the winner originally had fewer points than their opponent, they gain an additional point from the loser.    - Matches only occur between athletes whose points differ by at most 1.    - The tournament ends when a single leader is determined. 2. **Initial Assumptions**:    - Before any round begins, let's assume that in the leading group, ( N = 2m + k ) athletes are present, where ( 2m ) of them face each other and ( k ) face participants with one point fewer. 3. **Point Distribution After Each Round**:    - Participants with ( n ) and ( n+1 ) points who meet will end up with ( n ) and ( n+2 ) points respectively.     - After this round, ( m + k ) participants continue in the leading group. 4. **Reduction in Leader Count**:    - The minimum number of leading participants after each round is (frac{N}{2}) if ( N ) is even and (frac{N+1}{2}) if ( N ) is odd.    - Consequently, after the first round, we'll have at least 255 leaders, after the second round at least 128 leaders, and so on. 5. **Calculating the Number of Rounds Required**:    - The number of leaders roughly halves each round.    - Thus, the number of rounds necessary can be estimated as (2 + log_2(255) = 2 + log_2(128) approx 9). 6. **Inductive Proof**:    - We use mathematical induction to establish that in a tournament with ( 2^n ) participants, a winner can be determined in ( n ) rounds.    - For ( n=1 ), easily verifiable because a single match is needed.    - Assume true for ( n ), then for ( 2^{n+1} ), the first round splits into ( 2^n ) with 0 and 1 points, both groups complete in ( n ) rounds, then the tournament results in ( n+1 ) rounds. 7. **Case for ( 2^n - 2 ) Participants**:    - Similarly, prove by induction:      - For ( n geq 3 ), only one pair with different points happens after first rounds, groups formed always resolve within ( n ) rounds.      - Post-induction setup ensures ( n )-round conclusion. 8. **Conclusion**:    - Applying our findings to ( 510 cong 2^9 ) indicates ( n=9 ) rounds suffice.

This means that 1 mole of MgO reacts with 1 mole of CO₂ to produce 1 mole of MgCO₃. Given that we have 3 moles of MgO and 3 moles of CO₂, we can determine the mass of each reactant: - The molar mass of MgO is approximately 40.3 g/mol (24.3 g/mol for Mg + 16.0 g/mol for O). - The molar mass of CO₂ is approximately 44.0 g/mol (12.0 g/mol for C + 2 * 16.0 g/mol for O). Mass of MgO = 3 moles * 40.3 g/mol = 120.9 g Mass of CO₂ = 3 moles * 44.0 g/mol = 132.0 g Since the reaction is in a 1:1 molar ratio and we have equal moles of both reactants, neither reactant is in excess.

This tolerance represents the side length of the largest ( k )-simplexes you can place at each vertex of the original ( k )-simplex such that all the points on those ( k )-simplexes are zero, but not all points in ( S ) are zero.    - For example, for a ( 2 )-simplex (triangle), we have:      [      t_{2,7} = 2 quad text{and} quad t_{2,8} = 2      ]      This means that for ( n = 7 ) or ( n = 8 ), the tolerance is 2. 3. **Inductive Hypothesis:**    - Suppose the minimum ( n ) for a ( k )-dimensional simplex is ( n_k = k^2 + k + 1 ).    - We need to show that for a ( (k+1) )-simplex, the minimum ( n ) is ( n_{k+1} ). 4. **Inductive Step:**    - For a ( k )-simplex with ( n_k ) points per edge, the tolerance ( t_{k,n_k} ) is ( n_{k-1} - 1 ).    - For ( n_{k+1} ), we need to ensure that:      [      t_{k,n_k+k+2} = t_{k,n_k+k+1} = n_{k-1} + k - 1      ]    - For the ( (k+1) )-simplex, consider the large ( k )-simplex with ( k+1 )-th coordinate ( n_{k+1} - n_k - k - 2 ), which will have tolerance ( n_{k-1} + k - 1 ).    - Since the ( k )-simplex with ( k+1 )-th coordinate 0 must have tolerance at least ( n_k - 1 ), we must have:      [      n_{k+1} - n_k + n_{k-1} - 3 ge n_k - 1      ]      Simplifying this inequality:      [      n_{k+1} ge (2k^2 + 2k + 2) - (k^2 - k + 1) + 2 = k^2 + 3k + 3      ] 5. **Conclusion:**    - By induction, the smallest ( n ) for a ( 2016 )-simplex is:      [      n_{2016} = 2016^2 + 2016 + 1 = 4066273      ] The final answer is ( boxed{4066273} )."},{"instruction":"A number divided by 23 minus 67 and multiplied by 2 is 102.

This means that the total time to complete the loop for both buses can be found as follows:     - Since the interval between two buses is 21 minutes and they move with equal speeds, the time taken for one bus to complete the circular route is the same as the interval between two consecutive buses.     - Therefore, for two buses, the time interval around the whole circular route is equivalent to twice this interval. 2. **Determining the Time Needed for One Complete Loop**:     [     text{Total time for one complete loop} = 21 text{ minutes} times 2 = 42 text{ minutes}     ]     Here, we are doubling the time of one interval to account for the time both buses collectively cover the entire route, since each bus fills one-half of the circular interval. 3. **Introducing a Third Bus**:     - Now, when we introduce a third bus, the loop is divided into three equal sections (as they will be evenly spaced along the route). 4. **Calculating the New Interval**:          - Since the total time for a complete loop of the route remains 42 minutes, this time is now divided equally among three buses.

Let's start with the given setup: a segment AB is fixed on a line, and there is a point M on this line. A line through the point M is drawn, on which we choose points P and Q such that the ratio frac{MP}{MQ} is constant. 2. We need to prove that the locus of the intersection points of the lines AP and BQ is a straight line. 3. To prove this, we will use Menelaus' theorem. Consider triangle triangle AMB with a transversal line that intersects AB at K, AM at P, and BM at Q. 4. By Menelaus' theorem, for the points P, Q, and K to be collinear in triangle AMB, the following relationship must hold:    [    frac{AP}{PB} cdot frac{BQ}{QA} cdot frac{KM}{MA} = 1    ] 5. Let the ratio frac{MP}{MQ} = k, where k is a constant. 6. Since frac{MP}{MQ} = k, we have:    [    MP = k cdot MQ    ] 7. Now let's express the segments AP, PB, BQ, and QA in terms of MP and MQ in the context of the triangle triangle AMB with the collinear transversal intersecting at K, P, and Q. 8. Applying the given ratio frac{MP}{MQ} = k, and using the collinearity condition from Menelaus' theorem:    [    frac{AP}{PB} cdot frac{BQ}{QA} = 1    ] 9. This implies that the intersection point K divides AB in a constant ratio which is derived directly from the constant ratio between MP and MQ. 10. Since the ratios frac{AP}{PB} and frac{BQ}{QA} are constant, the intersection point K will move such that the relative positioning remains consistent, ensuring that K lies on a line parallel to the transversal line MP. 11. Therefore, the locus of the points of the intersection of lines AP and BQ should align along a straight line parallel to MP. # Conclusion: Based on the application of Menelaus' theorem and the constancy of the ratio frac{MP}{MQ}, we conclude that the geometric locus of the points of intersection of the lines AP and BQ is a straight line parallel to the line MP. boxed{text{The geometric locus is a straight line parallel to } MP}."},{"instruction":"Suppose that one of every 200 people in a certain population has a specific genetic disorder, which is asymptomatic.

The total area covered by the dominoes is 2008 square units. Each domino covers 2 square units, so the number of dominoes is:    [    frac{2008}{2} = 1004    ]    We need to find the smallest n such that we can place 1004 dominoes on the board without them touching. 2. **Extending the Board:**    To simplify the problem, we extend the n times n board to an (n+1) times (n+1) board by adding an extra row and column. This helps in visualizing the placement of dominoes and their \\"shadows.\\" 3. **Shadow Concept:**    Each domino has a \\"shadow\\" consisting of the cells directly above, directly to the right, or directly above and to the right of the cells covered by the domino. This ensures that no two dominoes touch each other. 4. **Calculating the Area with Shadows:**    Each domino covers 2 cells and has 4 shadow cells, making a total of 6 cells (2 for the domino and 4 for the shadow). Therefore, the total area covered by 1004 dominoes, including their shadows, is:    [    1004 times 6 = 6024    ] 5. **Finding the Minimum n:**    The area of the extended board (n+1) times (n+1) must be at least 6024:    [    (n+1)^2 geq 6024    ]    Taking the square root of both sides:    [    n+1 geq sqrt{6024} approx 77.6    ]    Therefore:    [    n geq 77    ] 6. **Verification for n = 77:**    If n = 77, the extended board is 78 times 78, which has an area of:    [    78^2 = 6084    ]    This is sufficient to cover the 6024 cells required by the 1004 dominoes and their shadows. 7. **Placing the Dominoes:**    We can place the dominoes horizontally on the odd-numbered rows, ensuring that there is a single cell separating each domino from the next one. Each row can accommodate:    [    leftlfloor frac{77}{3} rightrfloor = 25 text{ dominoes}    ]    Since there are 39 odd-numbered rows:    [    39 times 25 = 975 text{ dominoes}    ]    This is slightly less than 1004, so we need to adjust the placement to fit all 1004 dominoes, but it confirms that n = 77 is the minimum size.

The net increase per second is the birth rate minus the death rate: Net increase per second = Birth rate - Death rate Net increase per second = 7 people/second - 3 people/second Net increase per second = 4 people/second Now, we know the total net increase in population over the period is 172800 people. To find the duration of the period in seconds, we divide the total net increase by the net increase per second: Duration (in seconds) = Total net increase / Net increase per second Duration (in seconds) = 172800 people / 4 people/second Duration (in seconds) = 43200 seconds To convert the duration from seconds to hours, we divide by the number of seconds in an hour (3600 seconds/hour): Duration (in hours) = Duration (in seconds) / 3600 seconds/hour Duration (in hours) = 43200 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour Duration (in hours) = 12 hours Therefore, the duration of the period is boxed{12}  hours."},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, let the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C be denoted by a, b, and c respectively, with the condition that acos B = (2c  b)cos A.

This simplifies to sin Acos B + sin Bcos A = 2sin Ccos A. Since sin C = 2sin Ccos A, and knowing that sin C neq 0 in triangle ABC,   we infer that cos A = frac{1}{2}. Given that A in (0, pi), we find that A = frac{pi}{3}.

We need to revisit the point coordinates expression, which should actually be left(frac{a+1}{2}, -frac{a-1}{2}right) instead of what was used above. Substituting these correct coordinates into the line equation: [ frac{a+1}{2} - left(-frac{a-1}{2}right) + 1 = 0 implies frac{a+1}{2} + frac{a-1}{2} + 1 = 0 implies a+1 = 0. ] From this, we find that a = -1.

(Tables are called adjacent if they are next to each other in the same row or one behind the other in adjacent rows.)","output":"# Problem: The main hall of the company \\"Roga i Kopyta\\" is a square hall with eight rows of eight seats. Sixty-four employees of the company took a test in this hall, which consisted of six questions with two answer options for each. Could it be so that among the answer sets of the employees, there are no identical sets, and that the answer sets of any two adjacent tables coincide in no more than one question? (Tables are called neighboring if they are adjacent in the same row or column). 1. **Representation of Answers**:     - Represent the first answer to each question with a '0' and the second answer with a '1'.    - Thus, each answer set can be represented as a 6-bit binary number (e.g., \`000000\` for all zeros). 2. **Layout of the Hall**:     - Consider the hall as an 8 times 8 grid where each cell contains a 6-bit binary number representing an answer set. 3. **Conditions to Satisfy**:    - Each of the 64 cells (representing one of the 64 employees) must have a unique 6-bit binary number.    - Adjacent cells must have answer sets that differ in at most one bit. 4. **Parity Consideration**:    - Define the parity of a bit string as the parity of the sum of its bits. For instance, the parity of \`000001\` is even (because 0+0+0+0+0+1 = 1).     5. **Filling the Grid**:     - Fill the grid in a way that answer sets of neighboring cells differ by exactly one bit. Here, construct rows such that last three bits are the same for all columns within a row and vary the first three bits.    - Use specific binary sequences that guarantee a one-bit difference between adjacent columns in a row. For example:      [      000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 100, 101, 111      ]      Write these patterns horizontally and vertically for each row and column. 6. **Ensuring Unique and Valid Sets**:    - Ensure all sets are unique. Because each binary triple is repeated across three bits, each unique column guarantees that all 64 sets will differ.    - For example, for an 8 times 8 table, a valid set could be such as follows:      [      begin{array}{cccccccc}      000000 & 001000 & 011000 & 010000 & 110000 & 100000 & 101000 & 111000        000001 & 001001 & 011001 & 010001 & 110001 & 100001 & 101001 & 111001       000011 & 001011 & 011011 & 010011 & 110011 & 100011 & 101011 & 111011       000010 & 001010 & 011010 & 010010 & 110010 & 100010 & 101010 & 111010       100000 & 101000 & 111000 & 110000 & 000000 & 001000 & 011000 & 010000       100001 & 101001 & 111001 & 110001 & 000001 & 001001 & 011001 & 010001       100011 & 101011 & 111011 & 110011 & 000011 & 001011 & 011011 & 010011       100010 & 101010 & 111010 & 110010 & 000010 & 001010 & 011010 & 010010       end{array}      ]    - By painting the cells in a checkerboard pattern and ensuring the sets differ in exactly one position, a consistency check can be performed.     7. **Checkerboard Coloring**:    - Assign alternating colors (like a chessboard) and invert bits on one of the colors to ensure even distribution and separation of cases. 8. **Final Verification**:    - Verify each set to ensure it meets the criteria: all sets differ in exactly one bit with adjacent neighbors and all are unique. # Conclusion: Yes, it is possible to arrange the answers such that no two sets are the same and neighboring sets differ by at most one bit.

Rosy is 40% more efficient than Mary, so Rosy's work rate is 1.40 times Mary's work rate. Therefore, Rosy's work rate is: 1/28 * 1.40 = 1.40/28 = 1/20 of the work per day. Tim is 20% less efficient than Mary, so Tim's work rate is 0.80 times Mary's work rate. Therefore, Tim's work rate is: 1/28 * 0.80 = 0.80/28 = 1/35 of the work per day. When all three work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: Mary's work rate + Rosy's work rate + Tim's work rate = 1/28 + 1/20 + 1/35 To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 28, 20, and 35 is 140. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 140: Mary's work rate = (1/28) * (5/5) = 5/140 Rosy's work rate = (1/20) * (7/7) = 7/140 Tim's work rate = (1/35) * (4/4) = 4/140 Now we can add the fractions: Combined work rate = 5/140 + 7/140 + 4/140 = (5 + 7 + 4) / 140 = 16/140 = 2/35 of the work per day. To find out how many days it will take for them to complete the work together, we take the reciprocal of their combined work rate: Days to complete the work = 1 / (Combined work rate) = 1 / (2/35) = 35/2 = 17.5 days.

We will show this assumption leads to a contradiction. 4. **Case for even ( n )**:    - Suppose ( n ) is even.    - Assume ( a^n + 1 ) is divisible by ( n^b + 1 ).    - Then ( a^{n^3} + 1 ) must also be divisible by ( n^{3b} + n^b + 1 ). 5. **Using congruences**:    - From the divisibility condition, ( a^n equiv -1 pmod{n^b + 1} ).    - Comprehending the divisibility condition for ( a^{n^3} ), we derive:      [      a^{n^3} equiv left(a^nright)^{n^2} equiv (-1)^{n^2} equiv 1 pmod{n^b + 1}      ]      Here, ((-1)^{n^2} equiv 1) is used because ( n^2 ) is even, so ( (-1)^{n^2} = 1 ). 6. **Finding a contradiction**:    - If ( 1 equiv -1 pmod{n^b + 1} ), then we have:      [      2 equiv 0 pmod{n^b + 1}      ]    - This would imply ( n^b + 1 = 2 ), which is impossible for ( n ) being even and ( n geq 2 ). 7. **Conclusion for even ( n )**:    - This proves that not all even numbers can be non-bad, leading to contradiction if only finitely many \\"bad\\" numbers exist. 8. **Exploration for ( n = a^k )**:    - If ( a = 1 ), the result is obvious as ( 1^n + 1 = 2) is not divisible by ( n^b + 1 ).    - For ( a > 1 ):      - By Lemma: If ( a^n + 1 ) is divisible by ( a^m + 1 ), then ( n ) must be divisible by ( m ).      - Assume ( a^{a^k} + 1 ) is divisible by ( a^{kb} + 1 ). 9. **Using the Lemma**:    - By the Lemma, ( a^k ) must divide ( kb ).    - This is not possible if ( k ) is a prime number greater than ( a ). 10. **Final Observation**:    - There are infinitely many primes greater than ( a ). 11. **Conclusion**:    - Thus, there are infinitely many values of ( n = a^k ) for which ( a^n + 1 ) is not divisible by ( left(a^kright)^b + 1 ). Hence, we have shown the existence of infinitely many natural numbers ( n ) such that ( a^n + 1 ) is not divisible by ( n^b + 1 ), as required.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, AB = sqrt{3}, AC = 1, and angle A = 30^circ, then the area of triangle ABC is ______.","output":"**Analysis** This problem examines the formula for the area of a triangle.

This leads us to realize that b = cf + de needs to be even as it is a sum of the products of odd numbers. 4. **Determining b**:    Considering (c, e) = (3, 5) and (d, f) = (5, 3), we compute:    [ cf + de = 3 times 3 + 5 times 5 = 9 + 25 = 34 ]    Hence, b = 34 is an even number.

Total sum of scores = Mean × Number of games Total sum of scores = 67.9 × 8 Now, let's calculate that: Total sum of scores = 543.2 Next, we need to subtract the sum of the known scores from the total sum to find the score of the third game. Sum of known scores = 69 + 68 + 61 + 74 + 62 + 65 + 74 Let's calculate that: Sum of known scores = 473 Now, we subtract the sum of known scores from the total sum to find the score of the third game: Score of the third game = Total sum of scores - Sum of known scores Score of the third game = 543.2 - 473 Let's calculate that: Score of the third game = 70.2 Since a team cannot score a fraction of a point in basketball, it seems there might be a slight error in the provided mean or in the scores.

The shop was offering a 10% discount on the total purchase, and there is also a 5% sales tax applied. How much did they spend if Frank bought 3 decks and his friend bought 2 decks?","output":"First, let's calculate the total cost of the decks before any discounts or taxes. Frank bought 3 decks at 7 each, so that's 3 * 7 = 21. His friend bought 2 decks at 7 each, so that's 2 * 7 = 14. The total cost before discounts and taxes is 21 (Frank) + 14 (Friend) = 35. Now, let's apply the 10% discount to this total. A 10% discount on 35 is calculated as 10/100 * 35 = 3.50. Subtract the discount from the total cost before discounts to get the discounted total: 35 - 3.50 = 31.50. Next, we need to calculate the sales tax on the discounted total. The sales tax is 5%, so we calculate 5/100 * 31.50 = 1.575. Since we usually don't deal with fractions of a cent in currency, we'll round the sales tax to the nearest cent, which is 1.58. Finally, add the sales tax to the discounted total to get the final amount spent: 31.50 (discounted total) + 1.58 (sales tax) = 33.08. Therefore, Frank and his friend spent a total of boxed{33.08} ."},{"instruction":"Using a compass and a ruler, construct a triangle given two sides and the included angle.","output":"1.

Combining equations (1) and (2), we substitute a^2 from equation (1) into equation (2) to get: [b^2 + c^2 - bc - c^2 + 3b = 0] Simplifying this, we find: [b^2 - bc + 3b = 0] Since b^2 + c^2 - bc = a^2, and we know a^2 - c^2 + 3b = 0, by comparing these two, we eventually deduce that b = c - 3. This is our equation (3). Given the area S = frac{5sqrt{3}}{2}, we use the formula for the area of a triangle S = frac{1}{2}bcsin A. Substituting A = 60^{circ} and the given area into this formula, we get: [frac{5sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{1}{2}bc cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}] Solving this equation, we find that bc = 10. This is our equation (4). Using equations (3) and (4), we can solve for b and c. Substituting b = c - 3 into bc = 10, we get: [(c - 3)c = 10] Solving this quadratic equation, we find that c = 5 and consequently b = 2.

Furthermore, we need to ensure that in each row and each column, there are no more than 4 different digits. From the reference material, it was illustrated that this condition is possible by giving a particular arrangement (visual representation) where different colors represent different digits. Each color or digit appears exactly 10 times throughout the table, while any row or column does not contain more than 4 different digits. Therefore, the answer to (a) is: boxed{text{YES}}   Part (b) We need to prove that there exists at least one row or one column in which there are at least 4 different digits. Assume, for contradiction, that in each row and each column of the (10 times 10) table, there are at most 3 different digits. Let (a_n) be the number of rows in which the digit (n) appears. Similarly, let (b_n) be the number of columns in which the digit (n) appears. Since each digit must appear exactly 10 times in total, we have the following conditions: [ a_0 + a_1 + cdots + a_9 = 30 ] and [ b_0 + b_1 + cdots + b_9 = 30 ] Now, consider any digit (n). If a digit appears in (a_n) rows and in (b_n) columns, then the total number of occurrences (since each occurrence of digit (n) should be in a distinct cell of the table) would be represented as: [ a_n cdot b_n geq 10 ] Since the product (a_n cdot b_n) must be at least 10, we have by the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality that: [ a_n + b_n geq 2 sqrt{a_n cdot b_n} = 2 sqrt{10} approx 6.32 ] To ensure that (a_n + b_n) is an integer, more precisely: [ a_n + b_n geq 7 ] Summing this over all 10 digits: [ sum_{n=0}^{9} (a_n + b_n) geq 70 ] However, since (a_n + b_n) for each (n) should be greater or equal to 7, and from previously obtained boundary conditions: [ (a_0 + a_1 +... + a_9) + (b_0 + b_1 + ... + b_9) leq 60 ] This creates a contradiction because it asserts that the sum must be both greater or equal to 70 and less or equal to 60.

Let's denote the four numbers as ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ). 1. **Identify ( x+y ) and ( x-y ):**    - Consider the sum and difference of ( x ) and ( y ). The numbers ( x+y ) and ( x-y ) are both linear combinations of ( x ) and ( y ).    - The sum of ( x+y ) and ( x-y ) is ( 2x ), and the difference is ( 2y ). Therefore, we can identify ( x+y ) and ( x-y ) by checking which pair of numbers, when added and subtracted, give us consistent results. 2. **Identify ( xy ):**    - The product ( xy ) is a unique number that is the result of multiplying ( x ) and ( y ). Among the four numbers, only one will be the product of the other two numbers. 3. **Identify ( frac{x}{y} ):**    - The quotient ( frac{x}{y} ) is another unique number that results from dividing ( x ) by ( y ). Among the four numbers, only one will be the result of dividing one number by another. 4. **Verification:**    - Once we have identified ( x+y ) and ( x-y ), we can solve for ( x ) and ( y ) using the following equations:      [      x = frac{(x+y) + (x-y)}{2}      ]      [      y = frac{(x+y) - (x-y)}{2}      ]    - This ensures that ( x ) and ( y ) are uniquely determined. 5. **Consistency Check:**    - To ensure that the identified numbers are correct, we can verify that the remaining numbers match the operations ( xy ) and ( frac{x}{y} ).

Nobody wants a friend living more than one block away (but they may be on the same block).

We are given that each boy is paired with exactly one girl and vice versa, with the restriction that no one pairs with someone living more than one block away. 2. **Base cases**:     - For n = 1, there is only 1 block, so the boy on block 1 must pair with the girl on block 1. Thus,     [     a_1 = 1     ]     - For n = 2, there are two blocks. The possible pairings are:       - The boy on block 1 pairs with the girl on block 1, and the boy on block 2 pairs with the girl on block 2.       - The boy on block 1 pairs with the girl on block 2, and the boy on block 2 pairs with the girl on block 1.       Thus, there are 2 possible pairings:     [     a_2 = 2     ] 3. **Recursive relation**: We claim that the number of pairings follows the Fibonacci sequence. To justify this:     - If the boy on block 1 pairs with the girl on block 1, we are left with n-1 blocks, and thus a_{n-1} possible pairings for the remaining blocks.     - If the boy on block 1 pairs with the girl on block 2, then the girl on block 1 must pair with the boy on block 2. This pairing decision leaves us with n-2 blocks, leading to a_{n-2} possible pairings for those blocks.     Hence, the recurrence relation can be established as:     [     a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}     ] 4. **Compute pairings for subsequent blocks using the recurrence relation**:     begin{align*}     a_3 &= a_2 + a_1 = 2 + 1 = 3      a_4 &= a_3 + a_2 = 3 + 2 = 5      a_5 &= a_4 + a_3 = 5 + 3 = 8      a_6 &= a_5 + a_4 = 8 + 5 = 13      a_7 &= a_6 + a_5 = 13 + 8 = 21      a_8 &= a_7 + a_6 = 21 + 13 = 34      a_9 &= a_8 + a_7 = 34 + 21 = 55      a_{10} &= a_9 + a_8 = 55 + 34 = 89     end{align*} 5. **Conclusion**: The number of possible pairings for 10 blocks is given by a_{10}, which is: [ boxed{89} ]"},{"instruction":"Two distinct vertices of a decagon are chosen at random.

If ( P ) and ( Q ) are two distinct points in ( H ), and the line segment ( PQ ) is such that the number of points on either side of ( PQ ) is the same, we call ( PQ ) a **median segment**. 3. We need to prove that if there are exactly ( n ) median segments, then any two of them intersect. 4. Select any point ( A in H ). Rotate a line centered at ( A ) on the plane. As the line rotates, the difference in the number of points on either side of the line changes by increments or decrements of 1. After a 180-degree rotation, the difference becomes the negative of its initial value. 5. Therefore, at some position during the rotation, the number of points on both sides of the line are equal, making the difference in counts zero. Hence, there is a median segment originating from each point, meaning each point is the endpoint of exactly one median segment. 6. Assume for contradiction that there are two median segments, say ( AB ) and ( CD ), that do not intersect. 7. These two median segments cannot be parallel as explained earlier (parallelism is avoided by even a slight perturbation). 8. Suppose the line through ( AB ) intersects the extended line through ( CD ) beyond point ( D ). 9. Draw a line ( e') through ( A ) parallel to the line ( e ) containing the segment ( AB ). Now, rotate the line ( f ) (containing ( CD )) slightly clockwise and counterclockwise around ( A ), resulting in lines ( f_1 ) and ( f_2 ). 10. The configurations ( f_1 ) and ( f_2 ) now have all points the same on either side as ( f ), except for point ( D ). Hence ( f_1 ) and ( f_2 ) have one more point on the side containing ( D ) as compared to the other side. 11. On the other hand, ( e') has fewer points on the side containing ( B ) compared to the other side, as ( e) is a median segment. 12. The intersecting realms as ( f ) rotates around ( A ), between ( f_1 ) and ( e'), and between ( f_2 ) and ( e'), must yield an ( A )'s median segment. Thus there are at least three median segments originating from ( A ), contradicting our observation that there is exactly one median segment from each point. 13.

The internal volume (V_int) of the pipe is: V_int = πr²h = π(3 cm)²(21 cm) = π(9 cm²)(21 cm) = 189π cm³ Now, we subtract the internal volume from the external volume to get the volume of the iron: Volume of iron (V_iron) = V_ext - V_int = 336π cm³ - 189π cm³ = 147π cm³ Finally, we multiply the volume of the iron by the density of iron to get the weight of the pipe: Weight of pipe = V_iron × density of iron = 147π cm³ × 8 g/cm³ Since π is approximately 3.14159, we can calculate the weight as follows: Weight of pipe ≈ 147 × 3.14159 × 8 g ≈ 3694.68 g Therefore, the weight of the pipe is approximately boxed{3694.68}  grams."},{"instruction":"the following list of numbers, the integer n appears n times in the list for 1 leq n leq 100.[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, ldots, 100, 100, ldots , 100]What is the median of the numbers in this list?

The total number of ways to select 4 winners out of 12 singers is given by the combination formula C_{n}^{r} = dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is: [C_{12}^{4} = dfrac{12!}{4!(12-4)!}] Next, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to select exactly 4 winners such that exactly two of them are from the same province. To achieve this, we first choose 1 province from the 6 provinces, which can be done in C_{6}^{1} ways.

We do this by selecting 1 singer from 10 (which can be done in C_{10}^{1} ways) and then selecting another singer from the remaining 4 provinces (excluding the province of the previously selected singer), which can be done in C_{4}^{1} ways.

To calculate the maximum probability of scoring full marks in either the first or second attempt (Event C), we consider: - The probability of not scoring full marks in the first test is P(overline{A}) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - frac{2}{5} = frac{3}{5}. - The probability of scoring full marks in the second test, given the first wasn't perfect, is multiplied by the probability of not scoring full marks in the first test, giving us P(overline{A})P(B).

Thus, the total relevant volume within the large sphere, assuming minimal overlap, is capped by the volume of the large sphere:  V_{circumscribed} = frac{4}{3} pi R^3 = frac{4}{3} pi (3r)^3 = 36pi r^3  The probability P that point P selected at random within the circumscribed sphere, lies within the corresponding external spheres is (neglecting overlapping):  P = frac{18pi r^3}{36pi r^3} = frac{1}{2} = 0.5  Thus, the answer is boxed{0.5}."},{"instruction":"Given a hyperbola C: frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}  frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1  (a > 0, b > 0) whose asymptote is tangent to the circle E: (x  5)^{2} + y^{2} = 9, find the eccentricity of hyperbola C.","output":"Let one asymptote of hyperbola C: frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} - frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1  (a > 0, b > 0) be bx - ay = 0.

To find out how much he spent at the toy store, we multiply 1/3 by 2/5: (1/3) * (2/5) = 2/15 So he spent 2/15 of his original allowance at the toy store. After spending at the toy store, he had the following amount of his allowance left: (2/5)A - (2/15)A To subtract these fractions, they need to have a common denominator.

The center of gravity (centroid) of these twelve points is determined. Find the geometric locus of all such centers of gravity.","output":"1. Consider a cube and look at the 12 face diagonals. We are to determine the locus of the centroids of points chosen arbitrarily on these diagonals. 2. Let's denote the chosen points on the 12 face diagonals as P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{12}. 3. The centroid of these 12 points is given by:     [     G = frac{1}{12} sum_{i=1}^{12} P_i     ] 4. The diagonal points P_i can be seen as points on the square faces of the cube. A key property to note is that the midpoint of any line segment connecting two points on opposite diagonals of a square face will lie on a smaller square inside the original square. 5. For a cube, consider the four diagonals emanating from each pair of opposite faces. Any set of midpoints of the pairwise connections of these will form squares centered on the centroid of the face. 6. As a consequence, the points on opposite faces of a cube create a square arrangement of their mid-long points. This means the problem of finding the centroid of points on the cube’s face diagonals has effectively been reduced to finding the centroids of points within squares. 7. In three dimensions, considering all face diagonals of the cube, the centroids of the chosen points lie within an octahedron formed by the centers of the cube’s faces. 8. Transforming our problem to the octahedron, recognize that the 12 points correspond to ones that lie on the diagonals of each face of the octahedron. Given that for any subset of points within a three-dimensional figure the centroid of these points must lie within the convex hull of these vertices, this means they remain within the original shape provided they meet the midpoint rule. 9. Finally, let's see the practical consideration of distances: if any point lies centrally in a plane cutting the octahedron's central plane, and others are placed systematically within constraints (maximum up to half the cube's edge length), their collective centroid creates a new locus that still stays within the bounded octahedron effectively reduced by one-third strides. 10. Thus, the geometric place of all these centers of gravity lies in a smaller, further subdivided octahedron derived from the original by cutting equal thirds from the vertices to the centroid. **Conclusion:** The locus of the centroids of the 12 diagonals is the interior of this subdivided octahedron centered within the original cube.

The equation sin x = cos x implies tan x = 1. The solutions in [0^circ, 360^circ] are x = 45^circ and x = 225^circ. For sin x cos x (sin x + cos x) = 1, we recognize this is not possible as the maximum value of |sin x cos x| is frac{1}{2} and the maximum value of |sin x + cos x| is sqrt{2}, so their product is at most frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, which is less than 1.

We are given that the vertices B and C slide along the sides l and m of a fixed right triangle P on the plane. 2. **Circle Construction**: We construct a circle with BC as its diameter. Recall that any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle. Hence, A and P both lie on this circle because angle BAC = angle BPC = 90^circ. 3. **Angle Consideration**: By considering APC and BAC, we note angle APC = angle ABC since both subtend the same arc of the circle. This implies that A must always lie on the line n which passes through P and forms an angle angle CB with the line m since angle BAC is kept fixed due to the movement of points B and C along the sides. 4. **Chord Length Analysis**: We note that AP is a chord of the circle with diameter BC. The maximum length of AP can only be as large as BC while the minimum length must be the smaller of the segments AB or AC. This is because A slides along the segment from the smallest chord to the largest that can occur on the circle where P is also present. 5. **Maximum and Minimum Lengths**:     - The maximum value of AP is BC when A coincides with one of the ends of the diameter BC.     - The minimum value of AP should naturally be one of the sides (legs) of triangle ABC. Let's assume AB < AC, then the minimum would be AB. 6. **Formation of Segment A_1A_2**:    - A must be tracing from the length of A_1 = AB to the length of A_2 = BC, where P A_1 = AB and P A_2 = BC. 7. **Conclusion**:    - Hence, the geometrical locus of point A forms a line segment A_1A_2 which is of length ( BC - AB ).

The difference between the original number and the new number is 9, so we have: [10x + y - (10y + x) = 9] Simplifying the second equation: [9x - 9y = 9] [x - y = 1] Therefore, the system of equations that represents the conditions given in the problem is: [boxed{left{begin{array}{l}{x-y=1}{9x-9y=9}end{array}right.}] However, it's important to note that the second equation simplifies to the same as the first, indicating a slight oversight in the simplification process. The correct approach for the second condition, without simplification error, should directly reflect the difference caused by reversing the digits, leading to the initial system of equations without further simplification: [boxed{left{begin{array}{l}{x-y=1}{10x+y-(10y+x)=9}end{array}right.}] This system accurately represents the conditions given in the problem statement."},{"instruction":"Find the maximum value of y=frac{{x}^{2}+7x+10}{x+1} for x<1.","output":"To find the maximum value of y=frac{{x}^{2}+7x+10}{x+1} for x<-1, let's proceed in a step-by-step manner: 1. Rewrite the given function in a more convenient form: [y=frac{{x}^{2}+7x+10}{x+1}] [= frac{{(x+1)}^{2}+5(x+1)+4}{x+1}] [= x + 1 + frac{4}{x+1} + 5] 2. Focus on the term with a variable in the denominator, frac{4}{x+1}. Since x<-1, we can introduce a change of variables for simplification, noting that -(x+1)>0. This leads to an expression involving the arithmetic and geometric means: [-(x+1) + frac{4}{-(x+1)}geqslant 2sqrt{-(x+1)•frac{4}{-(x+1)}} = 4] This inequality comes from the AM-GM inequality where the arithmetic mean of two non-negative numbers is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of those numbers. Equality holds if and only if -(x+1) = frac{4}{-(x+1)}, which happens when x = -3. 3. Substituting back into the expression for y, we have: [y = x + 1 + frac{4}{x+1} + 5] By considering the inequality from step 2, we know that: [x + 1 + frac{4}{x+1} leqslant -4] So, combining with the constant term: [y leqslant -4 + 5 = 1] Therefore, the maximum value of y for x < -1 is 1, and this maximum value is achieved when x = -3. In conclusion, the maximum value of y=frac{{x}^{2}+7x+10}{x+1} for x<-1 is boxed{1}."},{"instruction":"For how many values of d in the interval [0, 2000] does the equation [5 lfloor y rfloor + 3 lceil y rceil = d] have a solution for y?","output":"First, consider the case where y is an integer.

Therefore, any cube (x,y,z) where x + y + z is even will be black, and where x + y + z is odd will be white. 3. **Checkerboard pattern analysis**:    - Let's denote colors as follows: black (B) and white (W).    - The cubes follow this arrangement:        [    begin{pmatrix}       begin{array}{ccc}       B & W & B        W & B & W        B & W & B        end{array}        quad       begin{array}{ccc}       W & B & W        B & W & B        W & B & W        end{array}       quad    begin{array}{ccc}       B & W & B        W & B & W        B & W & B     end{array}    end{pmatrix}    ] 4. **Analyzing the Bug's Movement**:    - The bug starts at the central position (2,2,2) which is white (W).    - When the bug moves through an edge, it moves to a cube of the opposite color because it’s based on the coordinates changing by pm 1 (each move changes the parity of the sum of the coordinates).    5. **Exploring the Impossibility**:    - For the bug to visit each cube exactly once and return to its starting point would mean it makes a circuit that covers all 27 cubes.    - In a 3 times 3 times 3 checkerboard cube, there are 14 white cubes and 13 black cubes.    - Since moving an edge swaps the color, if the bug visits all 27 cubes once, it cannot satisfy the condition of having an even number of color swaps (which is necessary for it to return to the starting color). 6. **Conclusion**:    - Hence, since the number of white and black cubes differs, it implies the bug cannot cover all cubes exactly once and come back to the original (2,2,2) position keeping the chessboard like color alternation intact.

We need to find the number of friends of the person who has the most friends. 2. **Applying the Friendship Theorem:**    The Friendship Theorem states that if every pair of people in a group has exactly one common friend, then there is one person who is friends with everyone else. This theorem can be extended to the case where every set of ( m ) people has exactly one common friend. 3. **Graph Structure:**    According to the problem, the graph has a specific structure:    - There are ( m-1 ) vertices ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{m-1} ), each of which is connected to all other vertices.    - Every other vertex has exactly one neighbor among ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{m-1} ). 4. **Induction Hypothesis:**    We use induction on ( m ). Assume the statement is true for all values smaller than ( m ) (for ( m geq 3 )). 5. **Base Case:**    For ( m = 3 ), the graph must have a structure where there are 2 vertices ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) connected to all other vertices, and every other vertex has exactly one neighbor among ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). 6. **Inductive Step:**    - Let ( x_1 ) be one of the vertices with maximal degree.    - Apply the induction hypothesis for ( m-1 ) to the graph induced on the set of neighbors of ( x_1 ).    - We find neighbors ( x_2, ldots, x_{m-1} ) of ( x_1 ), each of which is connected to all other neighbors of ( x_1 ).    - Because of the maximality assumption, the neighbors of ( x_i ) are the neighbors of ( x_1 ) for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, m-1 ). 7. **Common Neighbor Argument:**    - Let ( x ) be a neighbor of ( x_i ) different from all the ( x_i ).    - Since ( y, x_1, ldots, x_{m-1} ) have exactly one common neighbor, ( x ) is connected to exactly one other neighbor of ( x_i ).    - The graph ( G ) induced on the set formed by ( x_i ) and their neighbors has the form described above. 8. **Contradiction Argument:**    - Suppose we can find a vertex ( y ) not in ( G ).    - There must be at least one neighbor ( x ) of ( x_i ) different from all ( x_i ); otherwise, ( y, x_i ) can have no common friend.    - Take such a neighbor ( x ). The vertices ( x_1, ldots, x_{m-2}, x, y ) have exactly one common friend, and this friend can only be the unique neighbor of ( x_i ) linked to ( x ) (call it ( bar{x} )).    - Repeat the procedure with ( bar{x} ) instead of ( x ). We find that ( y ) is linked to ( x ) as well.    - But now ( y, x_i ) have at least two common friends (( x ) and ( bar{x} )), which is a contradiction. 9. **Conclusion:**    This means that ( x_i ) and their neighbors are all the vertices in the graph, and we have what we wanted.

Therefore, the total number of guests from the couples would be 180 - 100 = 80 people. Since these 80 people are from the couples invited by the bride and groom, we can write the equation: 2B + 2G = 80 We can simplify this equation by dividing everything by 2: B + G = 40 This equation tells us that the total number of couples invited by the bride and groom is boxed{40} .

So, we can write the following equation based on their combined work rates: 2M + 3W + 4B = 1/5 We also know that: M = 1/10 (since a man can complete the work in 10 days) B = 1/25 (since a boy can complete the work in 25 days) 3W = 1/15 (since three women can complete the work in 15 days) Now, we can substitute the values of M and B into the first equation: 2(1/10) + 3W + 4(1/25) = 1/5 Simplify the equation: 1/5 + 3W + 1/5 = 1/5 Combine like terms: 3W + 2/5 = 1/5 Subtract 2/5 from both sides: 3W = 1/5 - 2/5 3W = -1/5 This result doesn't make sense because work rates cannot be negative. It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's try again. 2(1/10) + 3W + 4(1/25) = 1/5 Simplify the equation: 2/10 + 3W + 4/25 = 1/5 Find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 50: (5/50) + 3W + (2/50) = 10/50 Combine like terms: 3W + 7/50 = 10/50 Subtract 7/50 from both sides: 3W = 10/50 - 7/50 3W = 3/50 Now, divide both sides by 3 to find the work rate of a single woman: W = (3/50) / 3 W = 1/50 This means a single woman can complete 1/50 of the work in a day. To find out how many days it would take for a single woman to complete the entire work, we take the reciprocal of her work rate: Days = 1 / W Days = 1 / (1/50) Days = 50 Therefore, it will take a single woman boxed{50}  days to complete the work."},{"instruction":"A square has an area of 144 square units.

What is the smallest ( n ) for which this is possible?","output":"1. **Identify Possible Working Buttons:**    To determine the minimum number of operational buttons required, let's start by checking if having ( n = 5 ) operational buttons suffices to satisfy the problem's condition. Specifically, we will consider the buttons with the digits ({0, 1, 3, 4, 5}). 2. **Representing Any Digit as a Sum:**    Check if any digit from 0 to 9 can be represented as the sum of two digits from ({0, 1, 3, 4, 5}). This is necessary to ensure that any natural number can be represented either directly or as a sum of two numbers, both of which can be directly input using the operational digits. 3. **Example Calculations for Digits 0 to 9:**    - (0 = 0 + 0)    - (1 = 1 + 0)    - (2 = 1 + 1) (possible with two ones)    - (3 = 3 + 0)    - (4 = 4 + 0)     - (5 = 5 + 0)    - (6 = 3 + 3)    - (7 = 4 + 3)    - (8 = 5 + 3)    - (9 = 5 + 4) 4. **Ensuring All Natural Numbers from 1 to 99999999 Are Covered:**    Now, let's consider a number consisting of digits (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_8). We need to break down each digit (a_i) into two working digits:    - Suppose (a_i = b_i + c_i), where each (b_i) and (c_i) are digits from the set ({0, 1, 3, 4, 5}). 5. **Constructing Valid Numbers:**    Construct two numbers from (b_1 cdots b_8) and (c_1 cdots c_8) and add them. Every digit in the sum will use only digits ({0, 1, 3, 4, 5}), ensuring all numbers up to 99999999 can be formed. 6. **Verifying Breakdown:**    - Even digits can be directly formed or are sums of digits from the set: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5.    - For odd digits, verify that they can be represented as a sum within the set. For example, to form 7 (an odd number), (4 + 3 = 7) works. 7. **Completeness Verification:**    Verify that every possible digit from 1 to 9 can be formed using sums of the set's digits. Since none of these checks fail and every digit from 0 to 9 is attainable, it confirms efficacy. # Conclusion: Given these considerations, the minimum number ( n ) of operational buttons required for the described method to remain valid is indeed 5. Every possible digit from 0 to 9 can be expressed or obtained as a sum from these set of buttons, ensuring all numbers from 1 to 99999999 can be constructed or results thereof.

If the solution set of the inequality 0 leq f(x) leq 6x with respect to x is left[2,3right]cup {6}, then a+b=____.","output":"To solve for a+b under the given conditions, let's break down the solution into detailed steps. 1. **Establishing the relationship for f(6)**: Since x=6 satisfies the inequality 0 leq f(x) leq 6-x, we set up the equation for f(6):    [0 leq 36 + 6a + b leq 0]    From this, it follows that 36 + 6a + b = 0. 2. **Solving for b**: Rearranging the equation gives us b=-36-6a. 3. **Expressing f(x) using b**: Substituting b into the expression for f(x), we get:    [f(x) = x^2 + ax - 36 - 6a]    This can be factored as:    [f(x) = (x - 6)(x + 6 + a) geq 0]    Hence, the roots of f(x) = 0 are x=6 and x=-6-a. 4. **Transforming the inequality f(x) leq 6-x**: This inequality simplifies to:    [x^2 + (a+1)x - 6(a+7) leq 0]    Factoring gives:    [(x - 6)(x + a + 7) leq 0]    Therefore, the roots of the related equation are x=6 and x=-7-a. 5. **Determining the roots given the solution set**: The solution set left[2,3right]cup {6} implies the roots must be {-7-a=2, -6-a=3}. However, this would mean -7-a and -6-a are equal to two distinct values, which is an inconsistency in the interpretation of the standard solution provided. The correct interpretation should be considering the critical points of the inequality and the solution set to deduce the correct values for a and b. 6. **Revising the approach to find a**: Given the corrected understanding of the roots and the solution set, we need to identify a such that the equation forms correctly under the given conditions. Since the solution set suggests the interval left[2,3right] and the point {6} are where the inequality 0 leq f(x) leq 6-x holds, this aligns with the critical points derived from the transformations and factoring of f(x) and the inequality. Without direct equations stating {-7-a=2, -6-a=3}, we proceed under the assumption that a and b must be determined in a manner consistent with the given conditions and the derived expressions for f(x). 7. **Correcting the calculation for a and b**: Given the initial misunderstanding, let's correct the path to finding a and b. By examining the conditions and the results derived:    - We know that b = -36 - 6a.    - The expressions derived from the inequality and the function f(x) should align with the solution set. 8. **Final calculation and solution**: The original conclusion found a = -9 and subsequently b = 18, leading to a + b = 9. However, this step was based on an incorrect interpretation of setting up equations directly from the solution set. The correct approach involves aligning the conditions and critical points with the given solution set, focusing on how the values of a and b would satisfy 0 leq f(x) leq 6-x for x in left[2,3right]cup {6}.

We need to determine if this quadrilateral must be a square. 2. **Diagram Analysis**: Consider a quadrilateral (ABCD) that has the following properties:    - Diagonals (AC) and (BD) are perpendicular.    - A circle can be both inscribed in and circumscribed around the quadrilateral. 3. **Circle and Perpendicular Diagonals Properties**:    - A quadrilateral that can be circumscribed around a circle implies that the sums of the lengths of opposite sides are equal. Hence, (AB + CD = AD + BC).    - A quadrilateral with an inscribed circle implies that the tangents from a point to the circle are equal, which enforces the equality of opposite side sums. 4. **Diagnosing the Special Case**:    - Denote the diagonals (AC) and (BD) as being perpendicular.    - Given quadrilateral (ABCD), draw (AC) as a diameter and (BD) as a perpendicular chord that does not pass through the center of the circle. 5. **Inspect Triangle Properties**:    - In any triangle formed by the diagonals meeting at a right angle (e.g., (triangle ABD)), the altitude from the vertex at the right angle to the hypotenuse divides the hypotenuse into two equal segments.    - Therefore, triangles (triangle ABD) and (triangle CBD) are isosceles triangles, and:      - (AB = AD)      - (CB = CD) 6. **Final Check and Verification**:    - Both properties (inscribed circle and circumscribed circle) can be fulfilled by a quadrilateral that is not necessarily a square.    - An isosceles trapezoid, for instance, could also meet the conditions given that its diagonals are perpendicular and it can circumscribe and inscribe a circle.   7. **Conclusion**:    - Just because a quadrilateral fits the conditions described (perpendicular diagonals, inscribability, and circumscribability) does not necessarily mean it is a square.

Since ( X ) is (sigma)-compact, it can be represented as a countable union of compact sets. Let ( X = bigcup_{n=1}^{infty} K_n ) where each ( K_n ) is compact. Since ( X ) is uncountable, at least one of these compact sets, say ( K_1 ), must be uncountable.  2. **Focus on ( K_1 )**: Note that ( K_1 ) inherits the properties of ( X ); it is Hausdorff and every subspace of ( K_1 ) is (sigma)-compact. From now on, we will work with ( K_1 ) and denote it by ( X ) for simplicity. 3. **Claim 1**: Let ( X ) be a compact Hausdorff space that is a disjoint union of two everywhere dense sets ( Y ) and ( Z ). Then either ( Y ) or ( Z ) is not (sigma)-compact.    - **Proof of Claim 1**: Suppose both ( Y ) and ( Z ) are (sigma)-compact. Then ( Y = bigcup_{i=1}^{infty} Y_i ) and ( Z = bigcup_{i=1}^{infty} Z_i ) where ( Y_i ) and ( Z_i ) are compact. Since ( Y ) and ( Z ) are dense, each ( Y_i ) and ( Z_i ) must be nowhere dense (as they cannot contain any open set of ( X )). Thus,       [      X = left( bigcup_{i=1}^{infty} Y_i right) cup left( bigcup_{i=1}^{infty} Z_i right)      ]      where ( Y_i ) and ( Z_i ) are closed nowhere dense sets. This contradicts the Baire category theorem, which states that a compact Hausdorff space cannot be expressed as a countable union of closed nowhere dense sets. Hence, either ( Y ) or ( Z ) is not (sigma)-compact. (blacksquare) 4. **Definition**: A topological space ( X ) is called **resolvable** if it can be represented as a disjoint union of two everywhere dense subspaces. 5. **Claim 2**: Every compact Hausdorff topological space ( X ) without isolated points is resolvable.    - This is a known result attributed to Edwin Hewitt. It states that any compact Hausdorff space without isolated points can be decomposed into two disjoint dense subsets. (blacksquare) 6. **Isolated Points**: Let ( A_0 ) be the set of all isolated points of ( X ). If ( A_0 ) is uncountable, then ( A_0 ) cannot be (sigma)-compact because each isolated point forms an open set, and an uncountable union of such open sets cannot have a countable subcover. Thus, ( A_0 ) must be at most countable. 7. **Transfinite Induction**: Construct a family of countable sets ( A_{alpha} subset X ) for ( alpha < omega_1 ) (the first uncountable ordinal) as follows:    - Let ( A_0 ) be the set of isolated points.    - Suppose ( A_{beta} ) for ( beta < alpha ) have been chosen. Consider ( X' = X setminus bigcup_{beta < alpha} A_{beta} ). Since ( X ) is uncountable and ( bigcup_{beta < alpha} A_{beta} ) is at most countable, ( X' ) is non-empty.    - If ( X' ) has no isolated points, then ( overline{X'} ) also has no isolated points. By Claim 2, ( overline{X'} ) is resolvable, and by Claim 1, one of its dense subsets is not (sigma)-compact, a contradiction.    - If ( X' ) has isolated points, let ( A_{alpha} ) be the set of all isolated points of ( X' ). ( A_{alpha} ) must be countable, otherwise it would not be (sigma)-compact. 8. **Construct ( X' )**: Choose points ( a_{alpha} in A_{alpha} ) for all ( alpha < omega_1 ). Since ( a_{alpha} ) is isolated in ( X setminus bigcup_{beta < alpha} A_{beta} ), there exists an open set ( U_{alpha} ) such that ( U_{alpha} ) contains ( a_{alpha} ) and no other points from ( X setminus bigcup_{beta < alpha} A_{beta} ). 9. **Lindelöf Property**: The set ( X' = {a_{alpha} : alpha < omega_1} ) is Lindelöf as it is (sigma)-compact. The collection ( {U_{alpha} : alpha < omega_1} ) is an open cover of ( X' ). There exists a countable subcover ( {U_i : i in I subset omega_1} ). Let ( alpha = sup I + 1 ). Then ( alpha < omega_1 ) and ( i < alpha ) for all ( i in I ). This implies ( a_{alpha} notin U_i ) for all ( i in I ), a contradiction.

Consider the case where ( lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor = lfloor sqrt{n+1} rfloor ). This implies that ( n ) and ( n+1 ) are within the same integer square root interval. However, since ( n ) and ( n+1 ) are consecutive integers, their greatest prime divisors must be different because (text{GCD}(n, n+1) = 1).

We need to show that there are infinitely many positive integers ( n ) such that ( 2^n + 3^n ) is divisible by ( n^2 ). To do this, we will construct an infinite sequence ( {n_k} ) such that for each ( n_k ), ( 2^{n_k} + 3^{n_k} ) is divisible by ( n_k^2 ). 2.

Assume we have constructed the sequence up to ( n_k ). We need to find ( n_{k+1} ) such that ( 2^{n_{k+1}} + 3^{n_{k+1}} ) is divisible by ( n_{k+1}^2 ). 4. Let ( 2^{n_k} + 3^{n_k} = a n_k^2 ), where ( a ) is an odd positive integer. Since ( n_k geq n_2 = 5 ), it is easy to show that ( 2^{n_k} + 3^{n_k} > n_k^2 ), and thus ( a > 1 ). 5. Let ( p ) be an odd prime divisor of ( a ). We will use the properties of exponents and modular arithmetic to show that ( 2^{pn_k} + 3^{pn_k} ) is divisible by ( (pn_k)^2 ). 6. Substitute ( 2^{n_k} ) by ( x ) and ( 3^{n_k} ) by ( y ). Then:    [    x^p + y^p = (x + y)(x^{p-1} - yx^{p-2} + cdots + y^{p-1})    ]    Since ( x + y ) is divisible by ( p n_k^2 ), we need to show that the second factor is divisible by ( p ). 7. Define ( r ) to be the remainder of ( x mod p ). Then the remainder of ( y mod p ) will be ( -r ). The terms ( x^{p-1}, -yx^{p-2}, ldots, y^{p-1} ) will have the same remainder when divided by ( p ), but there are ( p ) such terms. By Fermat's Little Theorem, ( x^p equiv x mod p ) and ( y^p equiv y mod p ), so:    [    x^{p-1} - yx^{p-2} + cdots + y^{p-1} equiv 0 mod p    ]    Thus, ( x^p + y^p ) is divisible by ( (pn_k)^2 ). 8.

Prove that none of these numbers can be equal to the product of six pairwise distinct prime numbers.  1. **Assumption**:    Suppose, for contradiction, that among the given numbers there exists a number ( a ) which is the product of six pairwise distinct prime numbers:     [    a = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4 p_5 p_6.    ] 2. **Key Property**:    From the given condition, we know that for any two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) from the given 2014 numbers:     [    frac{ab}{a + b} text{ is an integer.}    ] 3. **Divisibility Condition**:    Following the above, if ( ab ) is divisible by ( a + b ), this implies that:    [    ab equiv 0 pmod{a + b}.    ] 4. **Simplifying the Condition**:    Let's isolate ( a ):    [    frac{ab}{a + b} = b - frac{b^2}{a + b}.    ]    From which, we observe that:    [    a + b mid b^2.    ] 5. **Implication for ( a )**:    If ( a ) is on the list, its square ( a^2 ) must be divisible by any number of the form ( a + b ) where ( b ) is another number from the set. 6. **Calculating Divisors**:    Given ( a = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4 p_5 p_6 ):    [    a^2 = (p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4 p_5 p_6)^2 = p_1^2 p_2^2 p_3^2 p_4^2 p_5^2 p_6^2.    ]    The number of divisors of ( a^2 ) is ((2 + 1)^6 = 729).  7. **Contradiction with the Given Numbers**:    There are 2013 numbers of the form ( a + b ) as the given set has 2013 other numbers apart from ( a ). Therefore, for ( a ) to hold, ( a^2 ) must be divisible by 2013 different sums ( a + b ). 8. **Comparison**:    Thus, we need at least 2013 divisors just from the sums ( a + b ) for different ( b ), but ( a^2 ) has only 729 divisors, which is less than 2013.

Find the number of such matrices for which the number of   1 s in each row and in each column is even.","output":"1. **Define the problem and notation:**    We need to find the number of ( m times n ) matrices with entries 0 or 1 such that each row and each column contains an even number of 1's. Let's denote this number by ( E(m, n) ). 2. **Base cases:**    - For ( m = 1 ) or ( n = 1 ), the only way to have an even number of 1's in each row or column is to have all entries be 0. Thus, ( E(m, 1) = E(1, n) = 1 ). 3. **General case for ( m, n geq 2 ):**    - Consider the first ( n-1 ) columns of the matrix. For any single column, we can choose an even number of 1's in ( 2^{m-1} ) ways. This is because for each row, we have two choices (0 or 1), but the total number of 1's must be even.    - Since the first ( n-1 ) columns can be chosen independently, the number of ways to choose these columns is ( (2^{m-1})^{n-1} = 2^{(m-1)(n-1)} ). 4. **Determine the ( n )-th column:**    - The ( n )-th column is determined by the parity of the row sums of the first ( n-1 ) columns. Specifically, if the sum of the first ( n-1 ) entries in a row is odd, the ( n )-th entry must be 1 to make the total even; if the sum is even, the ( n )-th entry must be 0.    - This ensures that each row has an even number of 1's. 5. **Check the ( n )-th column for even number of 1's:**    - We need to ensure that the ( n )-th column itself has an even number of 1's. This can be shown using linear algebra.    - Let ( B ) be the ( m times (n-1) ) matrix formed by the first ( n-1 ) columns, and let ( x ) be the ( n )-th column. We have ( x = B mathbf{j} ), where ( mathbf{j} ) is the column vector of all 1's.    - The condition that ( x ) has an even number of 1's is equivalent to ( mathbf{j}^T x = 0 ) (mod 2). Since ( x = B mathbf{j} ), we have ( mathbf{j}^T x = mathbf{j}^T (B mathbf{j}) = (mathbf{j}^T B) mathbf{j} ).    - Each column of ( B ) has an even number of 1's, so ( mathbf{j}^T B = 0 ) (mod 2). Therefore, ( mathbf{j}^T x = 0 ) (mod 2), ensuring that ( x ) has an even number of 1's. 6. **Conclusion:**    - The number of such matrices is ( 2^{(m-1)(n-1)} ). The final answer is ( boxed{2^{(m-1)(n-1)}} )."},{"instruction":"Each point in the hexagonal lattice shown is one unit from its nearest neighbor.

The center point is numbered as 7. This gives us a clear reference for each point in the lattice. 2. **Identifying Equilateral Triangles with Side Length One**:     - Triangle 176: This triangle is formed by connecting points 1, 7, and 6.    - Triangle 172: Formed by points 1, 7, and 2.    - Triangle 273: Formed by points 2, 7, and 3.    - Triangle 657: Formed by points 6, 5, and 7.    - Triangle 574: Formed by points 5, 7, and 4.    - Triangle 473: Formed by points 4, 7, and 3.        These triangles all have side lengths of one unit because each point is one unit from its nearest neighbor, including the center point. 3. **Identifying Equilateral Triangles with Side Length sqrt{3}**:    - Triangle 135: This triangle is formed by skipping one vertex between each point, resulting in a larger equilateral triangle.    - Triangle 246: Similarly, by skipping one vertex between each point, we form another equilateral triangle.    These triangles have a side length of sqrt{3} units because the distance between non-adjacent vertices in the hexagon (skipping one vertex) is sqrt{3} units. 4. **Counting the Total Number of Equilateral Triangles**: By adding the number of triangles with side length one (6 triangles) to the number of triangles with side length sqrt{3} (2 triangles), we get a total of 6 + 2 = 8 equilateral triangles.

The yield of a stock is calculated by dividing the annual income from the stock by its face value. In this case, the stock has a percentage yield of 20%. This means that the income from the stock is 20% of its face value. Let's denote the face value of the stock as FV. The annual income from the stock can be calculated as 20% of FV, which is 0.20 * FV. The stock is quoted at 200, and it yields 10%.

He used to buy 2 coffees a day for 4 each, so he spent 2 * 4 = 8 per day on coffee. The machine pays for itself in 36 days, which means the amount he would have spent on buying coffee in 36 days is equal to the cost of the coffee machine. So, 36 days * 8/day = 288 is the amount he would have spent on coffee in 36 days. Since the machine pays for itself in 36 days, the savings he makes by not buying coffee for those 36 days is equal to the cost of the machine, which is 180. Now, to find out how much it costs him per day to make his coffee, we subtract the cost of the machine from the amount he would have spent on coffee in 36 days and then divide by the number of days. Savings in 36 days = Amount he would have spent on coffee - Cost of the machine Savings in 36 days = 288 - 180 Savings in 36 days = 108 Now, we divide the savings by the number of days to find the daily cost of making coffee.

The fraction of female students who speak a foreign language is 2/3, so the number of female students who speak a foreign language is (2/3)F. Since M = F, we can use either M or F to represent the total number of students of one gender. Let's use M for simplicity. The total number of students who speak a foreign language is: (3/5)M + (2/3)M To add these fractions, we need a common denominator.

Prove that there exists a 2×2 square in which the number of white cells is odd.","output":"Let's consider the problem about a 200 times 200 grid with cells colored in black and white such that there are 404 more black cells than white cells. We need to prove that there is a 2 times 2 square in this grid where the number of white cells is odd. 1. **Assumption**: Suppose that in any 2 times 2 square, the number of white cells is even. This would mean that the possible configurations of white cells in any 2 times 2 square are either 0, 2, or 4 white cells. 2. **Observation on Row Coloring**: Let's take a look at the upper row of any such 2 times 2 square and the row just beneath it:     1. If the two upper cells in the 2 times 2 square are colored the same (both black or both white), then to maintain an even count of white cells in the entire square, the two lower cells also need to be colored the same, i.e., both black or both white.     2. If the two upper cells in the 2 times 2 square are colored differently (one black and one white), then the two lower cells must also be colored differently to keep the count of white cells even. 3. **Consistency Across Columns**: The same logic applies when considering any two consecutive columns. This establishes that the coloring pattern is consistent throughout the grid, meaning:     1. Each row will either be a replica of the previous row, or     2. It will be an inverse (where every black cell in the previous row corresponds to a white cell in the current row and vice versa). 4. **Types of Rows**: Hence, there are essentially two types of rows in such a grid:     - One type where the first row has a black cells and thus 200 - a white cells.     - The inverse type where the remaining rows are colored such that black cells are repainted white and vice versa. If there are b rows of the first type, the grid contains 200 - b rows of the inverse type. 5. **Count of Black and White Cells**:     - The number of black cells can be expressed as the sum of black cells in the first type and the second type:     [     text{Black cells} = a cdot b + (200 - a) cdot (200 - b)     ]     - The number of white cells can be similarly expressed:     [     text{White cells} = (200 - a) cdot b + a cdot (200 - b)     ] 6. **Difference Between Black and White Cells**:     - According to the problem, the difference between these two quantities is 404, so:     [     ab + (200-a)(200-b) - left[(200-a)b + a(200-b)right] = 404     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     4ab - 2 cdot 200(a + b) + 200^2 = 404     ]     [     4ab - 400a - 400b + 40000 = 404     ]     [     (a - 100)(b - 100) = 101     ] 7. **Contradiction**:     - The above equation tells us that (a-100)(b-100) = 101. Given that 101 is a prime number, the only integer pairs (x, y) satisfying xy = 101 (considering the constraints on the grid where a and b must be such that |a - 100| leq 100 and |b - 100| leq 100) implausibly constrain a and b to be integers. Therefore, there is no solution within the grid's allowable size for a and b as natural numbers. Thus, our initial assumption that each 2 times 2 square has an even number of white cells leads to a contradiction. **Conclusion:** Hence, there exists at least one 2 times 2 square in the 200 times 200 grid where the number of white cells is odd. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"he maximum number of students among them 1001 pens and 910 pencils can be distributed in such a way that each student get the same number of pens and same number of pencils ?","output":"To find the maximum number of students among whom 1001 pens and 910 pencils can be distributed equally, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. The GCD will give us the largest number of students that can receive the same number of pens and pencils. Let's calculate the GCD of 1001 and 910. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD: 1. Divide 1001 by 910 and find the remainder:    1001 = 910 * 1 + 91 2. Now divide 910 by the remainder from the previous step (91):    910 = 91 * 10 + 0 Since we've reached a remainder of 0, the divisor at this step (91) is the GCD.

Let V denote the volume of the tetrahedron.          The volume of a tetrahedron can be expressed as:    [    V = frac{1}{3} times text{Base Area} times text{Height}    ]        Since each height is m, the area of the base divided by the height is constant for all faces:    [    text{Area of any face} = frac{3V}{m}    ]        Therefore, all four faces of the tetrahedron have the same area, i.e., the faces are all congruent in area.     2. **Perpendicular Heights**:    Consider the triangles ABC and ABD. The perpendicular heights CC_1 and DD_1 from vertices C and D to their opposite edges are equal:    [    CC_1 = DD_1    ]        Since C and D have the same perpendicular height from AB, C and D lie at the same distance from the line AB.     3. **Parallel Projections and Perpendiculars**:    Let E be a point on the line through A parallel to CD but distinct from A. Project C and D perpendicularly onto the plane EAB, giving points C' and D', respectively.         The plane S is defined by the points E, A, and B. Since the line CD is parallel to plane S, the lines CC' and DD' are perpendicular to S. Each of the perpendicular projections satisfy:    [    CC' perp C'C_1 quad text{and} quad DD' perp D'D_1    ]        This implies the right-angled triangles CC_1C' and DD_1D' are congruent, resulting in:    [    C'C_1 = D'D_1    ]        Also, since CC' and DD' are perpendicular to AB, the points C' and D' are equidistant from AB. 4. **Symmetry and Midpoints**:    Consequently, C' and D' must lie symmetrically about AB. Therefore, the line CD intersects S perpendicularly at its midpoint. Let's denote this midpoint as F, and its projection onto S as F'.     5. **Parallel and Perpendicular Structure**:    Switching the roles of AB and CD similarly generates the plane S^* parallel to CD, and thus we conclude that F bisects every segment that connects midpoints of opposing edges.        Eventually, G and G' (midpoints of edges AC and BD), and their projections also indicate that the tetrahedron's projection forms a rectangle. 6. **Equal Edge Lengths**:    From the established symmetry and consistent distances:    [    AB = C'D' = CD    ]        It can be deduced that the tetrahedron has all opposite edge pairs being of equal length. Each face having sides of equal length means all faces are congruent triangles.     # Conclusion: Thus, we have proven that if the tetrahedron has equal heights from its vertices to the opposing faces, then the tetrahedron's faces must indeed be congruent. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"w many square units are in the area of the parallelogram with vertices at (0, 0), (6, 0), (2, 8) and (8, 8)?","output":"To find the area of the parallelogram with given vertices, we need to identify the base and the height of the parallelogram. The vertices are at (0, 0), (6, 0), (2, 8), and (8, 8). 1. **Identify the Base**: The base of the parallelogram can be taken as the distance between the points (0, 0) and (6, 0). Since both points lie on the x-axis, the distance between them is simply the difference in their x-coordinates. Therefore, the base is 6 - 0 = 6 units. 2. **Identify the Height**: The height of the parallelogram is perpendicular to the base and can be determined by the y-coordinate of the points (2, 8) or (8, 8) since these points are directly above the base. The height is the difference in the y-coordinates of (2, 8) or (8, 8) and any point on the base, such as (0, 0).

The line y=-x has a slope of -1, which means it makes an angle of 135^circ (or frac{3pi}{4} radians) with the positive x-axis. However, since angles in standard position are measured from the positive x-axis, and the line y=-x is in the second quadrant, we need to adjust this angle to account for the full rotation. 2. The angle alpha can be represented as alpha = kpi + theta, where kinmathbb{Z} and theta is the angle formed by the terminal side with the positive x-axis. Since the line y=-x forms a 45^circ (or frac{pi}{4} radians) angle with the negative x-axis, and considering the direction of positive angle measurement (counterclockwise), theta should be subtracted from kpi to get the terminal side on the line y=-x. 3. Therefore, we can express alpha as alpha = kpi - frac{pi}{4}, where kinmathbb{Z}. This expression accounts for all possible angles alpha that have their terminal side on the line y=-x, starting from the positive x-axis. 4.

For the cat: - A quarter of an hour is 60 minutes / 4 = 15 minutes, so twice a day would be 15 minutes x 2 = 30 minutes. - One-tenth of an hour is 60 minutes / 10 = 6 minutes. Now, let's add up the time spent on each pet: - Time spent on the dog: 60 minutes (walking and playing) + 12 minutes (feeding) = 72 minutes. - Time spent on the cat: 30 minutes (playing) + 6 minutes (feeding) = 36 minutes.

These vectors are evenly spaced around the circle centered at the origin with equal angles of ( frac{2pi}{2n} = frac{pi}{n} ) radians between consecutive vectors. 2. **Vector Representation:**     Represent each vector ( vec{v}_k ) (for ( k = 0, 1, ldots, 2n-1 )) using complex notation as:     [     vec{v}_k = e^{i theta_k} quad text{where} quad theta_k = frac{k pi}{n}.     ] 3. **Maximizing the Sum of Vectors:**     To maximize the length of the vector sum, we need to understand the geometric arrangement of these vectors. If we take all 2n vectors, their sum would be zero because they are symmetrically arranged around the center, thus canceling each other out. 4. **Choosing Subsets of Vectors:**     By symmetry and periodicity of sine and cosine functions, we observe that taking half of the vectors will provide the maximum possible magnitude of their vector sum. To maintain maximum alignment and avoid cancellation, we should take n consecutive vectors. 5. **Summing the Chosen Vectors:**     Let’s denote these n consecutive vectors as ( vec{v}_j, vec{v}_{j+1}, ldots, vec{v}_{j+n-1} ), where ( j ) can be any integer between ( 1 ) and 2n. The sum of ( n ) consecutive vectors will result in a vector with significant length due to the angular proximity of these vectors to each other.  6. **Conclusion:**     Therefore, the maximum length of the sum vector is achieved by taking ( n ) consecutive vectors from the original set of 2n vectors.

Adding up the contributions from all vertices:    [    V_{total, prism} = frac{2}{3} (alpha_1 + alpha_2 + alpha_3 + alpha_4 + alpha_5)    ]    - The sum of interior angles for a pentagonal section is 3pi:    [    alpha_1 + alpha_2 + alpha_3 + alpha_4 + alpha_5 = pi (5 - 2) = 3pi    ]    - Therefore, the total volume eaten from the pentagonal prism is:    [    V_{total, prism} = frac{2}{3}times 3pi = 2pi    ] 2. **Volume of Cheese Eaten from the Quadrilateral Pyramid**:    - Consider a pyramid with a square base K, L, M, N and apex S. The side of the square base is more than 2 cm, and the height of the pyramid is half of the base, so the shape fits problem constraints for eating cheese.    - The cheese eaten within a 1 cm radius from vertex S intersects three dihedral angles forming a tetrahedron:    [    V_S = frac{1}{6} times frac{4pi}{3} = frac{2pi}{9}    ]    - There are 4 other vertices (K, L, M, N), all contributing equally in volume:    [    V_{K,L,M,N} = 4 times left(frac{1}{3} times frac{pi}{6}right) = frac{2pi}{27} times 4 = frac{4pi}{27}    ]    - Total volume eaten from the vertices of the pyramid hence is:    [    V_{total, pyramid} = frac{2pi}{9} + frac{4pi}{27} = frac{6pi + 4pi}{27} = frac{10pi}{27} = frac{4pi}{9}    ] 3. **Comparing the Damages**:    - The volumes of cheese eaten from the prism and the pyramid are:    [    V_{prism} = 2pi, quad V_{pyramid} = frac{4pi}{9}    ]    - To compare the damages, we get:    [    frac{V_{prism}}{V_{pyramid}} = frac{2pi}{frac{4pi}{9}} = frac{2pi times 9}{4pi} = frac{18}{4} = frac{9}{2}    ]    - Hence, the prism's loss is:    [    4.5 times (text{pyramid's loss})    ] # Conclusion: The first farmer who used the irregular pentagonal prism suffered more damage, specifically 4.5 times more.

The new product pairs would be: [ ab' + cd' = ac + bd ] Where ( b' ) and ( c' ) are the new positions of ( b ) and ( c ) after swapping.  Given our inequality ( ab + cd < ac + bd ), the new sum of products after the swap would be greater: [ ab' + cd' = ac + bd > ab + cd ] This shows that the sum of the products of pairs of adjacent numbers, denoted as ( s ), increases when ( b ) and ( c ) are swapped. 3. **Limits on the Number of Operations**: The sum of the products of adjacent numbers, ( s ), can only take a finite number of distinct values. This is because the numbers themselves are finite and their placement results in different sums. Therefore, repeatedly increasing this sum by swapping adjacent numbers must eventually halt, as you can't infinitely increase a bounded sum. 4. **Conclusion**: As each swap operation increases ( s ) and ( s ) can only take a finite number of values, the number of possible swaps is finite.

We will prove that the elements of a good set mathcal{S} can be ordered such that a_i nmid a_{i-1} + a_{i+1} for all i=2,3,ldots,n-1.  1. **Base Case:**    For n = 2, the set mathcal{S} contains only two elements a_1 and a_2. There are no restrictions on this order, making it trivially nice by our criteria. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:**    Assume that for any good set mathcal{T} with |mathcal{T}| = k where k geq 2, the elements of mathcal{T} can be ordered to meet the required property. 3. **Inductive Step:**    Suppose we have a good set mathcal{S} with |mathcal{S}| = n geq 3. Let a = max(mathcal{S}). Now consider the set mathcal{T} = mathcal{S} setminus {a}, which has n-1 elements. By the induction hypothesis, there exists an ordering b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{n-1} for the elements of mathcal{T} that is nice in the sense that b_i nmid b_{i-1} + b_{i+1} for all i = 2, 3, ldots, n-2.

Specifically, we need to show there exists some j in {1, 2, ldots, n} such that the ordering [ N_j = (b_1, ldots, b_{j-1}, a, b_j, ldots, b_{n-1}) ] is nice. 4. **Situational Check with Max Element:** - Assume for contradiction that N_j is not nice for some j, meaning b_i nmid b_{i-1} + b_{i+1} was not always true for the insertion points around a.  - Since the original ordering b_1, ldots, b_{n-1} was nice, we need only check conditions involving a. This implies a check on whether a divides b_{j-1} + b_j or b_{j-1} - b_j. If we assume at least one N_j is not nice, then: [ a nmid b_{j-1} + b_j ] by Observation A, since b_{j-1} leq a and b_j leq a, both sum and difference conditions fail to hold. Hence, any non-trivial checks reduce to contradiction, confirming that an insertion point must exist. 5. **Finalization:** Since a contradiction in cases ensures that we can always insert a into a valid position with respect to N_j, the proof completes by ensuring that the extended ordering retains the property dissertation for the maximum element adjustments. Therefore, the ordering a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n such that a_i nmid a_{i-1} + a_{i+1} for all i=2,3,ldots,n-1 exists, confirming the initial claim via induction.    blacksquare"},{"instruction":"A digit is written to the right of the units digit of 863.

Each motorcycle has 2 tires, so: Motorcycle tires = 8 motorcycles * 2 tires/motorcycle = 16 tires Each car has 4 tires, so: Car tires = 16 cars * 4 tires/car = 64 tires Now, we add the spare tires for the cars that have them: Spare tires = 4 cars * 1 spare tire/car = 4 spare tires Finally, we add up all the tires: Total tires = Motorcycle tires + Car tires + Spare tires Total tires = 16 + 64 + 4 Total tires = 84 tires So, there are boxed{84}  tires on the used car lot's vehicles in all."},{"instruction":"Given a quadrilateral (ABCD) with points (M) and (N) on sides (AB) and (CD) respectively such that (AM:MB = CN:ND). The segments (AN) and (DM) intersect at point (K), and the segments (BN) and (CM) intersect at point (L). Prove that the area (S_{KMLN}) equals the sum of the areas (S_{ADK}) and (S_{BCL}).","output":"1. **Define essential heights:**    Let h_1, h, and h_2 be the perpendicular distances from points A, M, and B to the line CD, respectively. 2. **Proportional distances:**    According to the problem, we have the ratios AM : MB = CN : ND. This implies:    [    p = frac{AM}{AB} = frac{CN}{CD}    ] 3. **Expression for h:**    Using the problem's condition, the height h of point M from line CD can be written as a weighted average of h_1 and h_2. Therefore,    [    h = p h_2 + (1-p) h_1    ] 4. **Area consideration:**     The area of triangle DMC is given by:    [    S_{text{DMC}} = frac{1}{2} times DC times h    ]    Substituting the value of h:    [    S_{text{DMC}} = frac{1}{2} times DC times left( p h_2 + (1-p) h_1 right)    ]    Expanding this:    [    S_{text{DMC}} = frac{1}{2} times DC times p h_2 + frac{1}{2} times DC times (1-p) h_1    ]    This can be simplified to the sum of the areas of triangles BCN and ADN:    [    S_{text{DMC}} = S_{text{BCN}} + S_{text{ADN}}    ]     5. **Subtract relevant areas:**    Subtract the areas of triangles DKN and CLN from both sides of the above equality.    Given the areas to subtract:    [    S_{text{KMLN}} + S_{text{DKN}} + S_{text{CLN}} = S_{text{ADK}} + S_{text{BCL}}    ]    After subtraction, the equation simplifies to:    [    S_{text{KMLN}} = S_{text{ADK}} + S_{text{BCL}}    ] # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that: [ boxed{S_{text{KMLN}} = S_{text{ADK}} + S_{text{BCL}}} ]"}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},W={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],z={key:0},M={key:1};function I(n,e,h,u,o,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",W,[(a(!0),i(y,null,w(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),v(m,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
