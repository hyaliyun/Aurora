A total of 54% of those surveyed said they would like to see a new form of military conscription to help bring young people together from different socioeconomic backgrounds, while almost one third said they were opposed to such a move.","output":"A recent poll reveals that over half of people in Britain are in favour of the return of national service. The survey shows that 54% of participants would like to see a new form of military conscription reintroduced, with the aim of fostering greater social cohesion among the younger population from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. The results paint a picture of a nation seeking to address some of the existing societal divisions and create a sense of shared responsibility and purpose. The poll, carried out by a reputable research firm, gathered responses from a diverse spectrum of the British public. The majority of those in favour of national service believe that it would provide young people with a common experience and help break down barriers caused by class, ethnicity or geography. They also believe that it would instil discipline, resilience and a sense of pride and duty among today's youth, who some argue have become overly entitled and disconnected from society. However, not everyone is convinced that national service is the answer. Almost one third of those surveyed indicated that they were opposed to its reintroduction. Those against the idea argued that it would be an unnecessary imposition on individual freedom, financial burden on the government, and could be detrimental to the mental health of young people. Despite this opposition, the renewed interest in national service has sparked debate among politicians, military leaders and academics. Some have suggested that a modern version of conscription could take many forms, including community service, disaster relief or social care. The Ministry of Defense has responded cautiously, stating that it is open to discussing the idea but that any new form of national service must be properly considered and thoroughly evaluated to avoid unintended consequences. Overall, the poll suggests that there is a growing appetite for national service in a country that is grappling with major societal shifts and widening inequality.

The study, which involved a group of 100 participants, found that those who practiced meditation for just 10 minutes a day experienced a significant reduction in stress levels compared to those who didn't. Stress is known to have a negative impact on both physical and mental health, leading to a range of issues from high blood pressure to depression and anxiety. With the fast-paced, high-stress world we live in, finding effective ways to manage stress is essential for overall wellbeing. Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years and is a powerful tool for reducing stress and anxiety. It involves focusing on the present moment, calming the mind, and allowing thoughts and feelings to pass without judgment. In the recent study, participants were randomly assigned to either a meditation group or a control group. Those in the meditation group were instructed to practice mindfulness meditation for 10 minutes each day for a period of eight weeks. The control group did not practice meditation but instead continued with their daily routine. After eight weeks, the meditation group showed a significant reduction in stress levels compared to the control group. This reduction in stress was measured by a decrease in levels of cortisol, a hormone that is released in response to stress. Participants in the meditation group also reported feeling more relaxed, less anxious, and more focused than those in the control group. The findings of this study add to the growing body of evidence of the benefits of meditation for stress relief. By taking just a few minutes each day to practice mindfulness meditation, individuals can significantly reduce their stress levels and improve their overall wellbeing. So, if you're looking for an effective way to manage stress, why not give mindfulness meditation a try? It's simple, easy to do, and can be done anywhere, anytime. All you need is a quiet place to sit and focus on your breath. With regular practice, you may be surprised at the positive impact it can have on your mood and wellbeing."},{"instruction":"The special effects in this movie were incredible, but the story fell short and left me disappointed.

The process is divided into several stages: 1. Interphase: Before mitosis begins, the cell goes through a period of growth and DNA replication called interphase. During this stage, the cell prepares to divide by undergoing normal cellular functions, replicating DNA, and making copies of organelles. 2. Prophase: This stage marks the beginning of mitosis. The chromatin condenses to form visible chromosomes, each consisting of two identical sister chromatids. The nuclear envelope breaks down, and spindle fibers form, attaching to the centromeres of each chromosome. 3. Metaphase: In this stage, the spindle fibers line up the chromosomes along the equator of the cell, called the metaphase plate. 4. Anaphase: In this stage, the spindle fibers pull the sister chromatids apart, separating them and pulling them towards opposite poles of the cell. 5. Telophase: At the end of anaphase, the separated chromosomes arrive at the poles of the cell, and the spindle fibers disassemble. A new nuclear envelope forms around each set of chromosomes, and the chromosomes begin to uncoil. 6. Cytokinesis: During this final stage, the cell divides into two separate daughter cells. In animal cells, a contractile ring of microfilaments forms around the cell and pinches it in two. In plant cells, a cell plate forms at the center of the cell, which eventually becomes a cell wall. Overall, mitosis is a highly regulated process that ensures that each daughter cell receives an exact copy of the genetic material present in the parent cell."},{"instruction":"an easily string together abstract concepts to form a coherent sentence.

Here's a brief overview: - Pawns can move one or two squares forward on their first move, and then one square forward thereafter. They can capture other pieces diagonally one square forward. - Rooks can move horizontally or vertically as many squares as you wish. - Knights move in an L-shape (two squares in one direction and then one square to the side). - Bishops move diagonally, as many squares as you wish. - The queen can move as many squares as you wish in any direction (horizontally, vertically, diagonally). - The king can move one square in any direction. 4. Objective: The objective is to checkmate your opponent’s king, which means trapping it so it cannot escape capture. 5. Gameplay: Players take turns to move their pieces. When one player moves a piece so that it lands on a square occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is captured and removed from the board. 6. Special moves: There are a few special moves in chess. One is called castling, which is when the king moves two squares towards a rook and the rook moves to the square over which the king crossed. Another move is called en passant, which is when a pawn captures an opposing pawn that has moved two squares forward from its starting position. That’s a very brief introduction to chess!

This move comes after sanctions imposed on Russia by the US, alleging Moscow's interference in the 2016 presidential election. This treaty prohibits both the US and Russia from deploying certain types of short- and medium-range missiles. The suspension of the treaty is being viewed as a significant escalation of tensions between the US and Russia. Analysts have warned that this could potentially trigger a new arms race between the two countries. This could also have implications for other countries, as neighboring countries may feel the need to arm themselves in response to the escalating tensions. The US has remained committed to the treaty and has expressed its desire to find a diplomatic solution to the problem. However, experts have noted that the suspension of the treaty could affect the relationship between the two countries in the near future. There is a possibility that the US could suspend other treaties relating to arms control, leading to a further breakdown in US-Russia relations. Russia has been criticized for its aggressive military actions in recent years, notably in Ukraine and Syria. The suspension of the treaty is likely to raise concerns about Russia's intentions and agenda, as it follows a pattern of behavior that is seen as threatening and destabilizing.

In recent years, social media has become an integral part of modern life, with millions of people worldwide using various platforms to connect with friends and family, share information, and stay updated on news and current events. While this may seem like a positive and convenient way to stay connected, recent studies have revealed the potentially harmful effects of social media use on mental health. One recent study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania showed that participants who limited their social media use to 30 minutes per day, reported significantly lower levels of depression and loneliness after just three weeks. Another study, published in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, found that frequent use of social media can lead to negative self-comparison, leading to feelings of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Experts speculate that social media can contribute to feelings of loneliness, isolation, and FOMO (fear of missing out) among heavy users, as their daily consumption of carefully-curated content can create unrealistic expectations for their own lives. They may feel inadequate, socially excluded, and outright disconnected from the world around them, which can take a heavy toll on their mental well-being over time. While the benefits of social media are many, it is important to be aware of the potential pitfalls that come with excessive use. If you feel like your social media consumption is impacting you negatively, consider taking a break or limiting your daily usage to a specific amount of time. By taking positive actions towards promoting healthy social media habits, individuals can protect their mental health and cultivate a more balanced relationship with technology."},{"instruction":"Ways to reduce stress at work A > take breaks throughout the day B > work through lunch without pausing C > let work consume your life outside of work hours D > never ask for help or support from colleagues Is the right answer A, B, C or D ?","output":"The right answer is A."},{"instruction":"Michael Jordan is a retired American professional basketball player.

Whether we are scrolling through Instagram, tweeting our thoughts, or posting updates on Facebook, it seems that we are always connected. However, a new study has found that excessive use of social media could be linked to mental health issues. According to the study, which was conducted by researchers at a leading university, people who spend more time on social media are more likely to experience symptoms of depression. This link was found to be particularly strong in young adults, who are often the most active on social media. The study surveyed a large sample of people, asking them about their social media use and their mental health. The results showed that those who reported spending more time on social media also reported higher levels of depression. While the study does not prove that social media use causes depression, it does suggest that there could be a link. The researchers suggest that social media use could be contributing to feelings of social isolation, comparing oneself to others, and a lack of meaningful connection. It is important to remember that social media can have many positive effects on our lives, such as keeping us connected with friends and family who live far away. However, it is also important to be mindful of how much time we spend on social media, and to prioritize face-to-face interactions and real-life experiences. The findings of this study have important implications for mental health professionals, who may need to modify their treatment strategies for patients who are struggling with depression. They also have important implications for social media companies, who may need to take steps to promote more positive and healthy online interactions. In conclusion, while social media is an important part of our lives, it is crucial to be mindful of how much time we spend on it and the impact it may be having on our mental health. By prioritizing real-life connections and taking steps to promote positive online interactions, we can ensure that social media remains a positive force in our lives."},{"instruction":"A popular food chain was recently hit with a lawsuit for false advertising.

Next, let's identify the prime numbers less than 20: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. Now, we want to find the probability that the product of a randomly selected single-digit multiple of 3 and a randomly selected prime number less than 20 is a multiple of 45. A multiple of 45 must have at least one factor of 3 and one factor of 5 (since 45 = 3^2 * 5). Therefore, we need to find combinations of the single-digit multiples of 3 and the prime numbers less than 20 that include these factors and result in a multiple of 45. The single-digit multiples of 3 are already multiples of 3, so we need to pair them with a prime number that includes a factor of 5 to get a multiple of 45. The only prime number less than 20 that is a multiple of 5 is 5 itself. So, we need to pair each of the single-digit multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9) with the prime number 5 to see if the product is a multiple of 45. - 3 * 5 = 15 (not a multiple of 45) - 6 * 5 = 30 (not a multiple of 45) - 9 * 5 = 45 (a multiple of 45) Only the pair (9, 5) results in a multiple of 45. Now, let's calculate the probability. There are 3 possible single-digit multiples of 3 and 8 possible prime numbers less than 20, giving us a total of 3 * 8 = 24 possible pairs. Only 1 of these pairs results in a multiple of 45, so the probability is 1/24.

We need to prove that there always exists a pentagon ( ABCDE ) whose midpoints of the sides, in order, are ( P, Q, R, S, T ).  I. Proof using Vector Addition 1. **Vector Addition Rule:**      Using the vector addition rule of parallelograms, we have:     [     overrightarrow{L Q} = overrightarrow{L P} + overrightarrow{L R}     ]     and      [     overrightarrow{L T} = overrightarrow{L A} + overrightarrow{L S}     ]     Also using the midpoint formula for vectors (vec{v}) pointing to the midpoint of (vec{x}) and (vec{y}):     [     vec{v} = frac{vec{x} + vec{y}}{2} implies vec{y} = 2 vec{v} - vec{x}     ] 2. **Iterative Reflections:**     - Let the reflection of point (A) over (P) be (B):       [       overrightarrow{L B} = 2 overrightarrow{L P} - overrightarrow{L A}       ]          - The reflection of point (B) over (Q) be (C):       [       overrightarrow{L C} = 2 overrightarrow{L Q} - overrightarrow{L B} = 2 (overrightarrow{L P} + overrightarrow{L R}) - (2 overrightarrow{L P} - overrightarrow{L A}) = 2 overrightarrow{L R} + overrightarrow{L A}       ]     - The reflection of point (C) over (R) be (D):       [       overrightarrow{L D} = 2 overrightarrow{L R} - overrightarrow{L C} = 2 overrightarrow{L R} - (2 overrightarrow{L R} + overrightarrow{L A}) = - overrightarrow{L A}       ]     - The reflection of point (D) over (S) be (E):       [       overrightarrow{L E} = 2 overrightarrow{L S} - overrightarrow{L D} = 2 overrightarrow{L S} + overrightarrow{L A}       ]     - Finally, the reflection of point (E) over (T) be (F):       [       overrightarrow{L F} = 2 overrightarrow{L T} - overrightarrow{L E} = 2 (overrightarrow{L A} + overrightarrow{L S}) - (2 overrightarrow{L S} + overrightarrow{L A}) = overrightarrow{L A}       ]        3. **Conclusion:**     Since ( overrightarrow{L F} = overrightarrow{L A} ), we conclude that ( F equiv A ). Thus, the pentagon ( ABCDE ) satisfies the condition that the midpoints of its sides are ( P, Q, R, S, T ).  II. Alternative Proof using Midpoints and Parallelism 1. **Formation of Triangle and Parallelogram:**    - Let ( B ) be the reflection of ( A ) over ( P ):      [      AB = 2AP      ]        - The reflection ( C ) of ( B ) over ( Q ):      [      BC = 2BQ      ]        - Now form triangle ( ABC ), the midpoint of ( AB ) is ( P ) and the midpoint of ( BC ) is ( Q ):      [      PQ parallel AC text{ and } PQ = frac{AC}{2}      ]    - Consider ( PQRL ) as a parallelogram:      [      LR parallel AC text{ and } LR = frac{AC}{2}      ] 2. **Check Collinear Cases:**        - **Case when ( P, Q text { and } A ) are collinear:**            - Suppose ( AP = PB = a ):        [        Q equiv B rightarrow AC = 2PQ        ]              - **Subcase ( AP > PQ )**:        [        PQ = AB - BQ = a - b        ]        [        AC = 2PQ        ]              - **Other Cases ( PQ  < AP < 2PQ )**:        Analyze and show ( AC = 2PQ ) smoothly for collinear points. 3. **Reflection of ( A ) in ( T ) and ( mathbf S ):**     - Reflect ( A ) in ( T ) to get ( E )     [     A  T = TE     ]          - Reflect ( E ) in ( S ) to get ( D )     [     SE = E D/2     ]     - Reflect ( A ) in ( L ):     [     AL = LD     ] 4. **Overall structure:**          - The obtained pentagon ( ABCDE ) again fits reflection midpoints positioning, and it satisfies requirements. 5. **Conclusion:**      Both methods illustrate that ( ABCDE ), created through reflections, fulfills the constraints given. This concludes that there exists an ( ABCDE ) such that the midpoints of its sides are ( P, Q, R, S, T ).

We need to convert 1 hour and 48 minutes into hours to keep the units consistent. 1 hour = 1 hour 48 minutes = 48/60 hours = 0.8 hours Total time B walks to overtake A = 1 hour + 0.8 hours = 1.8 hours In this time, B not only covers the 2.5 km that A has already walked but also catches up to A. Since A continues to walk at 5 kmph, A will walk an additional distance during the 1.8 hours. Additional distance A walks = A's speed * Time B walks to overtake A Additional distance A = 5 kmph * 1.8 hours = 9 km Total distance B covers to overtake A = Distance A has walked before B starts + Additional distance A walks Total distance B = 2.5 km + 9 km = 11.5 km Now, we can calculate B's speed using the total distance B covers and the time B takes to overtake A.

This means that the task of adding axles and the task of adding wheels to the axles are linked and must occur in that specific order.

This effectively reduces the number of independent tasks from 6 to 5 (axles and wheels combined, windshield, instrument panel, steering wheel, and interior seating). The number of ways to arrange 5 tasks in any order is given by the factorial of 5, which is 5!

We connect vertex r_i to vertex c_j with an edge if the cell at the intersection of row i and column j is free. 2. **Reformulate the Problem**:    Vasya's goal can be reformulated as finding no more than 99 edges in this bipartite graph such that each vertex (either in R set or C set) remains with an even number of unmarked edges. 3. **Graph Theoretic Fact**:    We will prove a general fact: In any graph with n geq 2 vertices, it is possible to mark n-1 or fewer edges such that each vertex has an even number of unmarked edges. 4. **Induction Hypothesis**:    Assume for k < n, it is possible to mark k-1 edges so that every vertex has an even number of unmarked edges. We will show this holds for k = n. 5. **Base Case**:    For n=2, this is trivial - just mark the single edge between the two vertices (if it exists). 6. **Inductive Step**:    - If there is a vertex of degree 1, mark the only edge connected to it, then remove this vertex and edge from the graph. The remaining graph has n-1 vertices. By the induction hypothesis, in this reduced graph, we can mark n-2 edges to maintain the required parity condition.    - If there is a vertex with degree 0, simply remove it, as it does not affect the problem. 7. **Handling Cycle**:    If every vertex has a degree of at least 2, start from any vertex and traverse the edges. Since each vertex has at least degree 2, we will inevitably form a cycle. Remove the edges of the cycle from the graph, which ensures the degree of each remaining vertex retains the required even parity. 8. **Complete the Process**:    - Continue this process iteratively.    - Reduce the graph progressively, ensuring that each step remains consistent with the inductive assumption.     9. **Application to the Problem**:    Given the 50x50 grid, apply the above theorem for n = 100 vertices. Thus, Vasya can mark at most 99 edges ensuring every vertex ends up with an even number of unmarked edges. 10. **Conclusion**:    Vasya can place up to 99 new pieces such that each row and each column of the board has an even number of pieces.

[     text{Refer to Figure 1: Longest side hypothesis}     ] 2. **Angle-Side Relationships and Trigonometric Properties**:     - The side DF of the triangle DEF is greater than half a side of the hexagon. Therefore, it must be greater than half the hypotenuse of the right triangle with legs BF and BD.     - In a circumscribed circle with hexagon sides as radii, the central angles corresponding to BF and BD are equal to those at A, C, and E vertices. 3. **Angular Calculation and Inequality**:     - Since the sum of the central angles (A angle + C angle < 180^circ) in a larger radius circle is less than that of the same chord length in a smaller circle. Hence,     [     A angle + C angle + E angle < 360^circ     ]     - This leads to a contradiction as the sum of the angles in a hexagon is 720^circ and cannot be less than 360^circ + 360^circ. Thus, triangle BDF must be acute. 4. **Equal Radii and Central Division**:     - Let r be the circumradius of the acute triangle BDF, and O its center. If the hexagon sides are larger or smaller than r, the inequality of angles leads to contradictions.     - Therefore, hexagon sides must equal r. This forms rhombuses ABFO, and EDOF, showing opposite sides are parallel and angles at opposite vertices are equal.  Conclusion: ( boxed{text{The angles at opposite vertices of a regular hexagon are equal}} ).  blacksquare **Solution II: Trigonometric and Sinus Law** 1. **Sinus Law**:     - Given that angles sum to 180^circ in each group (alpha + beta + gamma and alpha_1 + beta_1 + gamma_1), and their sin ratios are equal.     [     sin alpha : sin beta : sin gamma = sin alpha_1 : sin beta_1 : sin gamma_1 implies alpha = alpha_1, beta = beta_1, gamma = gamma_1     ] 2. **Hexagon Angles & Side Lengths**:     - Let angles at vertices A, C, E be 2alpha_1, 2beta_1, and 2gamma_1. Their sum totals 360^circ, implying:     [     alpha_1 + beta_1 + gamma_1 = 180^circ     ] 3. **Application of Sinus Law**:     - The sides of triangle BDF expressed in terms of hexagon side a, using:     [     BD = 2a sin beta_1, BF = 2a sin alpha_1, DF = 2a sin gamma_1     ]  Conclusion: So angles at opposite vertices A and D, B and E, C and F must be equal.

What is the divisor?","output":"If subtracting 31 from 13603 results in a number that is divisible by a certain divisor, we can find the divisor by performing the subtraction and then finding the factors of the resulting number. Let's subtract 31 from 13603: 13603 - 31 = 13572 Now we need to find the factors of 13572 to determine the possible divisors. Let's start by finding the prime factorization of 13572: 13572 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 Simplifying, we get: 13572 = 2^2 × 3^6 The prime factorization of 13572 is 2^2 × 3^6. The divisors of 13572 are all the numbers that can be formed by multiplying these prime factors in different combinations, including 1 and the number itself. Since the question does not specify a unique divisor, there are multiple possible divisors for 13572. However, if we are looking for a specific divisor that would result in a remainder of 31 when 13603 is divided by it, we can simply divide 13603 by 13572 and see if the result is a whole number: 13603 ÷ 13572 = 1 (with a remainder of 31) This means that the divisor we are looking for is the number that 13603 is divided by to get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 31, which is 13572 itself. Therefore, the divisor is boxed{13572} ."},{"instruction":"The teacher took 13 students to cross the river by boat. There is only one small boat at the ferry, which can carry 5 people (no boatman).

In total, there are 13 + 1 = 14 people. Since the boat can only carry 5 people (without a boatman), and each trip requires one person to act as the boatman, the boat can carry 5 - 1 = 4 people per trip. Thus, it takes 14 div 4 = 3 (times) with a remainder of 2 (people). Since the last trip still has 2 people left, not just 1, one more boat trip is needed; this allows us to solve the problem.   The key to this problem is knowing that even though there are only 2 people left for the last trip, another trip is still needed because the boat cannot carry more than 5 people.

Specifically, for each (i), we must have:      [      2x_i < x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_n      ]      This ensures that the sum of the lengths of any (n-1) sides is greater than the length of the remaining side, which is a necessary condition for the existence of a polygon. 2. **Cyclic Polygon Construction:**    - Given that the above condition is satisfied, we can construct a polygon (A_0A_1ldots A_n) such that the vertices (A_0, A_1, ldots, A_n) are cocyclic (i.e., they lie on a common circle). This is possible because any set of side lengths satisfying the triangle inequality can form a cyclic polygon. 3. **Maximizing the Area:**    - To prove that the cyclic polygon has the maximal area, we use the concept of the isoperimetric inequality. The isoperimetric inequality states that among all simple closed curves with a given perimeter, the circle encloses the maximum area.    - Consider the cyclic polygon inscribed in a circle. If we glue an arc of the circle on each side of the polygon, we form a \\"curvilinear polygon\\" with the same perimeter as the original circle.    - By the isoperimetric inequality, the area of this curvilinear polygon is less than or equal to the area of the circle. Since the cyclic polygon is inscribed in the circle, its area is maximized compared to any other polygon with the same side lengths. 4. **Handling Overlapping Arcs:**    - The concern about overlapping arcs is valid, but it typically occurs in non-optimal configurations, such as non-convex polygons. In the case of convex polygons, which are the focus here, the arcs do not overlap, and the argument holds without issues. 5. **Conclusion:**    - Therefore, the cyclic polygon (A_0A_1ldots A_n) with side lengths (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) has the greatest area among all polygons with the same side lengths.

The discriminant Delta of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac. For the equation kx^2 + 30x + k = 0, the discriminant is: [ Delta = 30^2 - 4(k)(k) = 900 - 4k^2 ] For the solutions to be rational, Delta must be a perfect square.

Therefore, ( d(n) ) is odd. For ( d(n) ) to be odd, each factor ( (alpha_i + 1) ) in the product must be odd. This is because the product of any even number with any other number is even, and the product of odd numbers is odd. 4. **Implication for Exponents**:    Since ( (alpha_i + 1) ) is odd, it follows that ( alpha_i ) must be even. This is because an odd number plus one is even, and an even number plus one is odd. Therefore, we can write:    [    alpha_i = 2k_i quad text{for some integer } k_i    ] 5. **Form of ( n )**:    Substituting ( alpha_i = 2k_i ) into the prime factorization of ( n ), we get:    [    n = p_1^{2k_1} p_2^{2k_2} cdots p_k^{2k_k}    ]    This can be rewritten as:    [    n = (p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} cdots p_k^{k_k})^2    ]    Hence, ( n ) is a perfect square.

Any number ending in 5 raised to any positive integer power will always have a units digit of 5 because 5 multiplied by any number ending in 5 will always end in 5. So, the units digit of (35^{87}) is 5. Next, let's find the units digit of (3^{45}). The units digit of powers of 3 follows a pattern that repeats every 4 powers: - (3^1) has a units digit of 3. - (3^2) has a units digit of 9. - (3^3) has a units digit of 7. - (3^4) has a units digit of 1. - (3^5) has a units digit of 3 (and the pattern repeats). To find the units digit of (3^{45}), we can find the remainder when 45 is divided by 4, since the pattern repeats every 4 powers. (45 div 4) gives a quotient of 11 with a remainder of 1. Since the remainder is 1, the units digit of (3^{45}) is the same as the units digit of (3^1), which is 3. Now, we add the units digits of the two numbers: 5 (from (35^{87})) + 3 (from (3^{45})) = 8.

Let g(a) = a^2 - ln a - frac{1}{2}, and find its derivative: g'(a) = 2a - frac{1}{a} = frac{2a^2 - 1}{a}. Setting g'(a) = 0 gives a = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.

Each islander claims that \\"All whom I see are liars.\\" Let's analyze the situation for an islander named ( I ). ( I ) sees all other islanders except their immediate left and right neighbors. Therefore, ( I ) sees ( N - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 ) islanders. 3. We have two types of statements:    - If ( I ) is a knight, their statement \\"All whom I see are liars\\" must be true, implying all 27 seen islanders are liars.    - If ( I ) is a liar, their statement \\"All whom I see are liars\\" must be false, meaning there is at least one knight among the 27 seen islanders. 4. Since not all islanders can be liars (if they were, then all of them would be telling the truth, which causes a contradiction), there must be at least one knight. Let's denote the number of knights as ( K ). Thus, the number of liars is ( L = N - K = 30 - K ). Let's analyze the number of knights and liars more closely: Consider the arrangement around the table. Suppose there are ( K ) knights and ( L = 30 - K ) liars. Note that: - Each knight sees 27 islanders who must all be liars. - Each liar cannot see all liars among the 27 islanders they observe; they must see at least one knight to keep their statement false. 5. The neighbor analysis reveals:    - Knights need to be spaced out such that the liars' statements remain false. If knights are too close to each other, they would see each other and contradict their own statements of seeing only liars. Following through the logical deductions: - If there were two knights next to each other, they would see each other, which leads to a contradiction since a knight cannot claim another knight to be a liar.    Thus, there's a strict alternation between knights and liars with the maximum separation:   - We conclude that each knight must be surrounded by liars, both on the left and right side. 6. The optimal configuration to meet all criteria is to have 2 knights properly spaced around the circle with the rest as liars:    - Positioning two knights such that they are not immediate neighbors maintains the consistency of each knight's statement.    - Each knight will see only liars among the 27 islanders they observe. 7. Therefore, given ( K = 2 ) knights, the number of liars ( L = 30 - 2 = 28 ).

Thus, we have: [S_9 = 9a_1 + frac{9 times 8}{2}d = 85.5] [9a_1 + 36d = 85.5] Now, we have a system of equations: [begin{cases} 3a_1 + 9d = 31.5  9a_1 + 36d = 85.5 end{cases}] Solving this system of equations, we first multiply the first equation by 3 to align the coefficients of a_1: [begin{cases} 9a_1 + 27d = 94.5  9a_1 + 36d = 85.5 end{cases}] Subtracting the second equation from the modified first equation gives us: [27d - 36d = 94.5 - 85.5] [-9d = 9] [d = -1] Plugging d = -1 back into the first original equation: [3a_1 + 9(-1) = 31.5] [3a_1 - 9 = 31.5] [3a_1 = 40.5] [a_1 = 13.5] Now, to find the length of the shadow on Minor Fullness, which corresponds to the 11th term in the progression, we use: [a_{11} = a_1 + 10d] [a_{11} = 13.5 + 10(-1)] [a_{11} = 13.5 - 10] [a_{11} = 3.5] Therefore, the length of the shadow on Minor Fullness is 3.5 feet.

Let the area of quadrilateral ( ABCD ) be denoted as ( [ABCD] ). Then, the area of quadrilateral ( PQRS ) is ( 0.52 times [ABCD] ). 3. We know that the area of ( PQRS ) can be expressed in terms of the areas of the triangles formed by the points ( P, Q, R, S ) and the vertices of ( ABCD ). Specifically, we can write:    [    [PQRS] = [ABCD] - left( [SAP] + [PBQ] + [QCR] + [RDS] right)    ] 4.

We need to prove that the sum of the areas of these triangles is greater than the area of the pentagon itself. 2. **Initial Manipulation**:    Let us consider moving vertex (A) of the pentagon (ABCDE) parallel to the diagonal (BE). This motion ensures that the area of triangle (BEA) remains unaltered, and consequently, the area of the pentagon (ABCDE) remains unchanged. 3. **Identifying Variable Triangles**:    When we move (A) along the specified path, the bases of all triangles formed by diagonals will still be segments from (BE), while their heights remain consistent relative to each other. However, only the areas of triangles (DEA) and (EAV) will change due to the motion. 4. **Examining Area Changes**:    Let (A) move to a point (A') by a distance (x). Denote the heights from (A) and (A') to segment (DE) as (h) and (h') respectively, and (varphi) as the angle between line (AA') and segment (DE).     5. **Calculating Area Differences**:    The area of the new triangle (A'DE) versus the old triangle (ADE) is:    [    S_{triangle A'DE} - S_{triangle ADE} = frac{1}{2} cdot DE cdot h' - frac{1}{2} cdot DE cdot h    ]    This simplifies to:    [    = frac{1}{2} cdot DE cdot (h' - h)    ]    Given (h' = h + xcos(varphi)), we have:    [    = frac{1}{2} cdot DE cdot x cos(varphi)    ] 6. **Area Sum Variation**:    This indicates that the change in the area of triangle (DEA) and hence (EAV) due to movement is proportional to both the shifting magnitude (x) and the cos(θ). When direction is set along (DE), it results in a consistent decrement until alignment onto the segment (BE). 7. **Moving Vertices**:    By symmetry and parallel reasoning, moving any vertex parallel to other respective diagonals follows similar analysis maintaining area contributions changing proportionally. This leads to triangles (AVE) and ultimately being covered such as (BEC). 8. **Generalization**:    Finally, consider degenerating the pentagon such vertices (A, E, text{and } D) lying on a line, yielding analysis of covering original shaped (ABCDE).

Let the intersection of (a') with side (b) be (B). 3. **Reflect (B) Over (P)**:    Reflect point (B) over point (P) to get point (A) on side (a). 4. **Line (AB)**:    Line (AB) is the unique line passing through (P) such that (P) is the midpoint of segment (AB).  5. **Claim**:    We will show that line (AB) cuts off the smallest possible triangle from the angle. 6. **Consider Any Other Line Through (P)**:    Take any other line through (P) that intersects (a) at (A') and (b) at (B'). Assume (B) separates (B') from the angle vertex and (A) separates (A') from the angle vertex. 7. **Reflection and Intersection**:    Reflect side (a) over point (P) and consider the intersection of this reflection with segment (PB') inside the angle at point (B''). Triangles (PBB'') and (PAA') are reflections over point (P). 8. **Area Comparison**:    Since triangle (PBB'') is exactly half of triangle (PBB') and this reflection creates a valid interior point, the area of triangle (PBB') is larger than triangle (PAA'). Therefore, (A'B') through (P) cuts off a larger triangle than (AB).  Conclusion: The line passing through point (P) that intersects the angle sides in such a way that (P) bisects the segment between intersection points creates the triangle with the smallest area from the angle. # II.

For this distribution, we first choose the box for the 3 balls (3 choices), then choose the box for the single ball from the remaining two (2 choices), giving us 3 times 2 = 6 ways.

To gain a full hour (which is 60 minutes), we need to calculate how many real-time hours it would take for the clock's minute hand to gain 60 minutes. Let's set up a proportion to solve for the number of real-time hours (x) it would take for the clock to gain 60 minutes: Real time (minutes) : Clock time (minutes) = x : (x * 65) We know that the clock time should be 60 minutes more than the real time, so: Real time (minutes) + 60 = Clock time (minutes) Substitute the clock time (minutes) with (x * 65): Real time (minutes) + 60 = x * 65 Now, we need to express the real time in terms of x as well. Since the clock gains 5 minutes every hour, the real time in minutes is 60x: 60x + 60 = 65x Subtract 60x from both sides: 60 = 5x Divide both sides by 5: x = 12 So, it will take 12 real-time hours for the clock to gain a full hour ahead.

Using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, we can set up two equations based on the given information:    a_3 = a_1 + 2d = 1    a_7 = a_1 + 6d = 3 2. Solving these simultaneous equations, we get a_1 = -1 and d = 1. 3. Now we can find the ninth term: a_9 = a_1 + 8d = -1 + 8 = 7. 4.

Since there are 2 parts male, one third of the males is 2/3 parts. Since there are 7 parts female, two-thirds of the females is (2/3) * 7 = 14/3 parts. Adding these together, the total parts that prefer this career is (2/3) + (14/3) = (2 + 14)/3 = 16/3 parts. To find out how many degrees of the circle should be used to represent this career preference, we need to calculate the proportion of the circle that 16/3 parts represent out of the total 9 parts.

For roots of unity to be roots of z^3 + cz^2 + dz + e = 0, both the real roots (1 and -1) and any complex roots need to be considered.  1. **Real roots of unity**: 1 and -1.     - If 1 is a root, then substituting into the cubic gives 1 + c + d + e = 0, so e = -1 - c - d.    - If -1 is a root, then substituting gives -1 + c - d + e = 0, so e = 1 - c + d. 2. **Non-real roots of unity**:    - Consider the cube roots of unity, which include omega = e^{2pi i / 3} = -frac{1}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}i and overline{omega} = -frac{1}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}i.    - For omega and overline{omega} to be roots, substituting omega gives omega^3 + comega^2 + domega + e = 0.

Since roots of unity must satisfy the new cubic precisely with these conditions, calculating specific integer solutions for c, d, and e might be complex but feasible.

Since ( T ) and ( Y ) are midpoints, we use the Pythagorean Theorem in the triangle ( TPY ):    [    TP = frac{edge; length}{2} = 1, quad PY = frac{edge; length}{2} = 1    ]    Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:    [    TY^2 = TP^2 + PY^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 implies TY = sqrt{2}    ]    Similarly, all other sides formed by midpoints will be of the same length:        ( TU = TV = VW = WX = XY = YT = sqrt{2} ). 4. **Verify Angles of the Hexagon:**    Let's verify one angle, ( angle TYX ).

First, consider the given circles:    - The equation of the first circle is (x^2 + y^2 = 1). This is a circle centered at the origin ((0, 0)) with a radius of 1.    - The equation of the second circle is (x^2 + y^2 - 8x + 7 = 0). This can be rewritten in standard form by completing the square:      [      x^2 + y^2 - 8x + 7 = 0 implies (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16 - 7 implies (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 9      ]      So, this is a circle centered at ((4, 0)) with a radius of 3. 2. Define the distance between the centers of these circles. The centers are ((0, 0)) and ((4, 0)), so the distance (d) between the centers is:     [     d = sqrt{(4-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = 4     ] 3. For a circle to be tangent to two given circles, the standard method is using the radical axis theorem. For two circles to be tangent to others, we need to consider their radii and the distance between the centers, and understand that tangency can occur internally or externally. 4. **Case Analysis**:    - If a circle is tangent externally to both given circles, the radius (r) of such a circle can be:      - ( r + 1 + r + 3 = 4 )      [      2r + 4 = 4 implies 2r = 0 implies r = 0      ]      This implies that overly restrictive radius would result in a degenerate solution which isn't feasible for the geometry of the circle tangency properties in general cases.    - For tangency involving both internal or mix of internal and external, the loci would not traditionally validate in linear space terms: 5.

Additionally, the length of PQ is no more than 2. 2. **Observe the Property of Bisection**:    Denote PQ as an equal division line (meaning it bisects the area of the polygon). According to the definition of an equal division line, PQ must intersect at the interior of the polygon. 3. **Intersection of Division Lines**:    Construct all equal division lines of the polygon. Due to the nature of these division lines, they must intersect at the interior points of T. 4. **Analyzing Internal Angles**:    Suppose AC and BD are two equal division lines. Move point A along the border of the polygon to the left:        - If B is the nearest point among the endpoints of equal division lines from point A to the left, D must be the endpoint of another equal division line towards the left of point C.    - Otherwise, if there is another endpoint P between points C and D, such that PQ is an equal division line, then PQ would intersect both AC and BD, positioning within the segments between A and B. This creates a contradiction since B is assumed to be the closest left endpoint from A. 5. **Area Comparison**:    The area of the region between AC and BD can be determined as follows:     text{Area below } AC = text{Area below } BD = frac{1}{2}S quad (S text{ is the total area of polygon })     Hence, text{area of } triangle AOB = text{area of } triangle COD. 6. **Calculating the Sector Area**:    Denote the contained sector area as S_{text{sector}}, and the angle between AC and BD as alpha.    - Using trigonometry:       S_{text{sector}} = S_{triangle AOB} + S_{triangle COD} = frac{1}{2}AO cdot BO sin alpha + frac{1}{2}(AC - AO)(BD - BO) sin alpha     - Simplify this:       S_{text{sector}} = frac{1}{4} AC cdot BD sin alpha + left(frac{1}{2}AC - OAright)left(frac{1}{2}BD - OBright) sin alpha     - Since the second term is non-positive and the maximum values of AC and BD are both leqslant 2:       S_{text{sector}} < frac{1}{4} AC cdot BD sin alpha       Hence, the area of a sector is maximized when alpha is the smallest. 7. **Summing Up All Sectors**:    Consider all sectors formed by the equal division lines and their intersections, with their accumulated sum being less than alpha. Sum these angular sectors:     S_{text{polygon}} leqslant sum S_{text{sector}} < sum alpha = pi      8. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, the area of the convex polygon T is less than pi:     boxed{pi}"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x+2) = x^2  2x + 3, find the expression for the function f(x).","output":"Let us set x + 2 = t, which implies x = t - 2.

Since both places require boys, each boy must go to a different place. There are A_2^2 ways to arrange the 2 boys, which is calculated as follows: [A_2^2 = 2! = 2] **Step 2**: Arrange the 5 girls, considering that they must be split between two places. There are two scenarios for dividing the girls: - **Scenario 1**: Divide the girls into two groups, with one group having 1 girl and the other having 4 girls. The number of ways to select 1 girl from 5 is calculated using combinations: [C_5^1 = frac{5!}{1!(5-1)!} = 5] - **Scenario 2**: Divide the girls into two groups, with one group having 2 girls and the other having 3 girls. The number of ways to select 2 girls from 5 is: [C_5^2 = frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 10] Adding the ways from both scenarios for the girls gives us a total of 5 + 10 = 15 ways to split the girls. **Step 3**: Combining the arrangements of boys and girls. Since the boys can be arranged in 2 ways and the girls can be arranged in 15 ways (the sum from both scenarios), the total number of ways to distribute the 5 girls and 2 boys to two places is: [A_2^2 times (5 + 10) = 2 times 15 = 30] However, we need to account for the fact that there are 2 places, which has already been implicitly considered in our approach for both boys and girls.
