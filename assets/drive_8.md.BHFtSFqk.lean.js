According to the Department of Justice, the anti-competitive practices employed by the companies effectively stifle innovation and ultimately hurt consumers. For Apple, the lawsuit primarily focuses on the company's App Store. The DOJ claims that the company has monopolized the distribution of apps on iPhones and iPads, thereby taking control over pricing and distribution within its mobile ecosystem. Google, on the other hand, is accused of using its dominance in the online search market to stifle competition in their advertising business. The lawsuit alleges that Facebook has engaged in anti-competitive behavior by making acquisitions of smaller competing companies such as Instagram and WhatsApp. The lawsuit comes at a time when there is increased scrutiny over the power of these tech giants, who have a significant impact on the way we communicate, access news and information, and interact with one another in the digital age.

The report analyzed air quality data from over 4,300 cities in 108 countries and found that outdoor air pollution is responsible for the premature deaths of over 4 million people each year. The report highlights that air pollution is a significant public health issue, with transportation, industry, and household activities such as heating and cooking identified as the greatest contributors to this problem. Although many countries have policies and regulations aimed at improving air quality, the report calls for increased global cooperation and investment in order to address the widespread issue. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, stated that \\"Air pollution threatens us all, but the poorest and most marginalized people bear the brunt of the burden.\\" The report highlights that low- and middle-income countries are particularly affected, with over 90% of air pollution-related deaths occurring in these areas. The report provides recommendations for both governments and individuals, including increasing investment in clean technologies and infrastructure, reducing car use, and using cleaner household fuels. The report also states that urgent action is needed to reduce the amount of waste that is burned, which contributes significantly to air pollution. Many cities and countries are already taking action to improve air quality, with cities such as London, Paris, and Delhi implementing measures such as congestion charges and bans on certain vehicles. However, the report emphasizes that much more needs to be done in order to tackle this global issue and protect the health of people around the world. In conclusion, this report serves as a wake-up call for governments and individuals to take urgent action to combat air pollution.

The regulations aim to address concerns about monopolistic behavior and data security within the tech industry.

Companies will also be required to store their data within the country and risk facing hefty fines if they fail to comply. Another regulation puts a cap on the fees charged by payment platforms to merchants for using their services. This is likely to have a greater impact on payment giants such as Ant Group, which had its IPO suspended earlier this year after co-founder Jack Ma criticized China’s financial regulatory system. The regulations also include measures to prevent anti-competitive behavior, such as requiring companies to report any acquisitions or investments that could impact market competition. This follows recent crackdowns on tech monopolies, including Alibaba being fined 2.8 billion earlier this year for violating antitrust laws.

The new service will operate using small drones that can carry packages weighing up to five pounds. These drones will be designed to fly at low altitudes, avoiding obstacles such as buildings and trees, and will use advanced technology to safely and accurately navigate to their destination. The launch of the drone delivery service is expected to begin in a few months, with initial testing being carried out in select locations in the US. Amazon has not yet announced which cities will be selected for the test phase. The company has been working on developing its drone delivery technology for several years, and has invested heavily in research and development to make the service a reality. The drones will be equipped with sensors and cameras to help them avoid obstacles and to ensure safe delivery. Customers who opt-in to the service can expect their orders to be delivered in as little as 30 minutes, which is a significant improvement over the current delivery times of several hours or even days. The drone delivery service is part of Amazon's broader strategy to improve the customer experience and streamline its operations. The company has been experimenting with various delivery methods, including drones, self-driving cars, and even delivery robots. While there are still regulatory and logistical challenges to overcome before the drone delivery service can be fully implemented, Amazon is confident that it will become an important part of its business in the years to come.

The given problem is to find the minimum number of bags, denoted as ( n ), to distribute 77 candies such that each bag contains either 7 or 11 candies, and ensuring that every child gets an equal number of candies in integer bags. 2. We start by considering the possible sizes of the bags. Each bag can contain either 7 or 11 candies. We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that the total number of candies ( 7a + 11b = 77 ) with ( a + b = n ). Since 7 and 11 are relatively prime, i.e., (gcd(7, 11) = 1), we can use a combination of these numbers to form 77. 3. Next, we need to ensure that the bags can be distributed in such a fashion that ensures maximum utilization of the available candies and meets the constraints. 4. We can set up an equation (7a + 11b = 77) and solve for integer solutions.

Plugging in the values, we find: |AB|=sqrt {left(frac {16}{3}right)^2+4times frac {64}{3}}=sqrt{frac{256}{9}+frac{256}{3}}=sqrt{frac{256}{9}+frac{768}{9}}=sqrt{frac{1024}{9}}=frac{32}{3}.

The midpoint of AB is then frac {2+ sqrt {3}+2- sqrt {3}}{2}=2, which is not on point F. therefore The slope of the line l exists. Let the equation of the line be y=kx+1.

In the triangle (AOC_{1}), we know two angles, so we can calculate the third angle as follows: [ angle AOC_{1} = 180^circ - angle OAC_{1} - angle OC_{1}A = 180^circ - left( frac{alpha}{2} + frac{gamma}{2} right) - beta = frac{alpha}{2} + frac{gamma}{2}. ] 4. Hence, since (alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ), the triangle (AOC_{1}) is isosceles with ( C_{1}A = C_{1}O ), placing (C_{1}) on the perpendicular bisector of the segment (AO). 5. Similarly, one can show that (AOB_{1}) is also an isosceles triangle, with ( B_{1}) on the perpendicular bisector of (AO). 6.

Since the area of a rectangle is given by the product of its sides, we can set up the following conditions based on the problem statement. 2. **Area Relations**:        - The area of the square field (since a square's area is side squared):        [       r^2       ]        - The area of the rectangular field (one side is (p) and the other side is four times (p)) on the road between Borisovo and Vadimovo:       [       4p^2       ]        - The area of the forest along the road between Arkadino and Vadimovo is given by (12 times q):       [       12q       ]         Given that the area of the forest is 45 square km more than the sum of the areas of the two fields:       [       12q = r^2 + 4p^2 + 45       ] 3. **Solve the Equation**:    Plug in the given variables into the equation:       [       12q = r^2 + 4p^2 + 45       ] 4. **Understand the Problem Setup**:        The problem implies a correct setup without contradiction:         - The assumption that ( r^2 ) (square's area) and ( 4p^2 ) (rectangle's area) contribute appropriately and equated forests' conditions directly. 5. **Feasibility Check**:            Now solve for (q) assuming they naturally fit the geographical layout mentioned.    - From condition ( r+p > q Rightarrow  12r + 12p > 12q ), we get:           [           Rightarrow 12r + 12p > r^2 + 4p^2 + 45           ]    - Simplifying would be out context since geometrically variables align in straightaway, the structure solves feasibly without contradictions geometrically.

Given two sides of lengths 3 and 5, we calculate the range for the third side as follows: - The third side must be greater than the absolute difference between the two given sides: 5 - 3 = 2. - The third side must also be less than the sum of the two given sides: 5 + 3 = 8.

The statements made by the nephews are:    - First nephew: ( E ) and ( A ), but not ( M ).    - Second nephew: ( E ), not ( A ), ( M ), and not ( P ).    - Third nephew: not ( E ) and ( A ). 3. Since each nephew lied exactly once, let's analyze their statements while considering who lied about what. 4. Assume that ( E ) is false. Then the first nephew lied more than once:    - The first nephew claimed ( E ) (false) and ( A ) (true), and not ( M ) (undefined yet). They can't lie more than once. So, ( E ) is actually true. 5. Thus, ( E ) must be true. Since the statement of the third nephew includes \\"not ( E )\\" and ( E ) is true, the third nephew lied about \\"not ( E )\\". Therefore, ( A ) must be true because they only lie once. 6. Thus, ( A ) is true. Given:    - First nephew: ( E ) (true) and ( A ) (true), so \\"not ( M )\\" must be false. Therefore, ( M ) is true because the nephew lied about \\"not ( M )\\". 7.

Since ( n ) is odd and non-square, ( d ) and ( frac{n}{d} ) are distinct and each pair ((d, frac{n}{d})) corresponds to a unique pair ((a, b)). 4. **Relate ( f(n) ) to the number of divisors ( d(n) ):**    The number of positive divisors of ( n ), denoted ( d(n) ), is twice the number of pairs ((a, b)) because each pair ((d, frac{n}{d})) corresponds to a unique pair ((a, b)).

Find the angles of triangle ( ABC ).","output":"1. Consider triangle (ABC) where segment (BE) splits it into two similar triangles (BAE) and (BCE).     2. Note that (angle BAE = angle BCE) because triangles (BAE) and (BCE) are given to be similar by the condition. The condition also tells us the coefficient of similarity, which implies a precise proportional relationship between the sides of these triangles. 3. Since the triangles are similar, we can write:    [    frac{BA}{BE} = frac{BE}{BC}    ] 4. We know that in (triangle ABC), (angle BAC) is given as (30^circ). Thus, (angle ABE) would be the complement of (30^circ) in ( triangle ABE ) because (angle ABE + angle BAE = 90^circ):    [    angle ABE = 90^circ - angle BAC = 90^circ - 30^circ = 60^circ    ] 5. Since (angle ABE = 60^circ) and (ABC) is divided into two similar triangles, we use the property of the external angle theorem. The internal angle (angle ABC) of the right triangle will therefore be a combination of (angle ABE) (external to the smaller triangle (BAE)) and an adjustment of (angle BAE):    [    angle ABC = angle ABE + angle BAE = 60^circ + angle BAC = 60^circ + 30^circ = 90^circ    ] 6. With ( angle ABC = 90^circ ), it confirms (triangle ABC) is a right triangle. 7. Since (angle ABC = 90^circ), to determine the remaining angles, we recall the triangle sum theorem which states that the sum of the internal angles in any triangle is (180^circ):    [    angle BAC + angle ACB + angle ABC = 180^circ     ]    Given (angle ABC = 90^circ) and (angle BAC = 30^circ), we solve for (angle ACB):    [    angle BAC + angle ACB + 90^circ = 180^circ    ]    [    30^circ + angle ACB + 90^circ = 180^circ    ]    [    angle ACB = 180^circ - 120^circ = 60^circ    ] 8.

By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:    [    (a+d)^2 = (a-d)^2 + a^2    ] 3. Expanding and simplifying:    [    (a+d)^2 = a^2 + 2ad + d^2    ]    [    (a-d)^2 = a^2 - 2ad + d^2    ] 4.

The complementary event of a given event is the event that the given event does not occur.

This can be rephrased as having fewer than 2 defective products, which is mathematically equivalent to having \\"at most 1 defective product\\".  Therefore, by the definition of complementary events: - The negation of \\"at least n\\" is \\"at most n-1\\". In this context, since n=2, the complementary event is \\"at most 1 defective product\\". Additionally, considering the total number of products, if we have at most 1 defective product, it implies that we have at least one non-defective product in the sample of 10 products.

Without loss of generality, assume the lines are horizontal, hence of the form ( y = c_1 ) and ( y = c_2 ). 2. **Connect the Midpoints**:    - Find the midpoints of the segments formed by these intersections, namely:      [      M_1 = left( frac{x_{P_1} + x_{P_2}}{2}, c_1 right) quad text{and} quad M_2 = left( frac{x_{Q_1} + x_{Q_2}}{2}, c_2 right)      ]    - Draw a straight line that passes through the midpoints ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ).

However, the sum of the numbers remains invariant modulo 31. This is because:    [    a + b + c rightarrow c + (a - frac{1}{10}) + (b + frac{1}{10}) = a + b + c    ]    Thus, the sum of the numbers modulo 31 remains unchanged. 5. **Reversing the Order**: To reverse the order, we need to show that we can swap any two numbers.

Specifically, we can swap (2) with (31), (3) with (30), and so on, until the sequence is reversed. 7. **Conclusion**: Since we can swap any two numbers and reverse the sequence, we can achieve the numbers (1, 2, 3, ldots, 31) in anti-clockwise order.

Convert this into a standard form for scientific notation, which requires a single digit before the decimal point. To do this, we can rewrite 29.47 times 10^3 as 2.947 times 10^1 times 10^3. 3.

Now, to find the number of arrangements where the 3 green plates are adjacent: - Consider the 3 green plates as a single entity, which reduces the number of objects to arrange in a circle to 12 (1 green entity, 6 blue, 3 red, 2 orange). - The number of ways to arrange these 12 objects in a circle is (12-1)!/(6!3!2!1!) = 11!/(6!3!2!1!).

Since 45% of the 120 passengers are female, we can calculate the number of female passengers as follows: Number of female passengers = 45% of 120 Number of female passengers = 0.45 * 120 Number of female passengers = 54 Now we know there are 54 female passengers in total. We are also told that there are 46 females in coach class. Therefore, the number of females in first class is: Number of females in first class = Total number of females - Number of females in coach class Number of females in first class = 54 - 46 Number of females in first class = 8 Since 1/3 of the passengers in first class are male, this means that 2/3 of the passengers in first class are female (because the only other option is female). We can now find out the total number of passengers in first class by using the number of females in first class: Let F be the total number of passengers in first class. 2/3 * F = Number of females in first class 2/3 * F = 8 To find F, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2: F = 8 * (3/2) F = 12 So there are 12 passengers in first class. Now we can find the percentage of passengers in first class out of the total number of passengers: Percentage of passengers in first class = (Number of passengers in first class / Total number of passengers) * 100 Percentage of passengers in first class = (12 / 120) * 100 Percentage of passengers in first class = 0.1 * 100 Percentage of passengers in first class = 10% Therefore, boxed{10%}  of the passengers sit in first class."},{"instruction":"The temperature (unit: ^{circ}mathrm{C}) in a laboratory changes with time t (unit: h) approximately following the function: fleft(tright)=10sqrt{3}cosfrac{π}{12}tsinfrac{π}{12}t, tin left[0,24right)<br/>(Ⅰ) Find the maximum temperature difference in the laboratory for that day;<br/>(Ⅱ) If the temperature in the laboratory should not exceed 11^{circ}mathrm{C}, during which time period does the laboratory need to cool down?","output":"To solve this problem, let's follow the steps closely related to the solution provided: **Part (Ⅰ): Find the maximum temperature difference in the laboratory for that day.** 1.

The trigonometric function sin(x) varies between -1 and 1, so we analyze the behavior of f(t) within these bounds:    When sinleft(frac{pi}{12}t + frac{pi}{3}right) = 1, the temperature reaches its maximum value:    f_{text{max}}(t) = 10 - 2cdot 1 = 8^{circ}mathrm{C}        When sinleft(frac{pi}{12}t + frac{pi}{3}right) = -1, the temperature reaches its minimum value:    f_{text{min}}(t) = 10 - 2cdot(-1) = 12^{circ}mathrm{C} 3. Therefore, the maximum temperature difference in the laboratory for that day is:    Delta T_{text{max}} = 12 - 8 = 4^{circ}mathrm{C}    So, boxed{4^{circ}mathrm{C}} is the maximum temperature difference. **Part (Ⅱ): Determine the time period during which the laboratory needs to cool down.** 1.

Suppose the lengths of these perpendiculars are d_{1}, d_{2}, ldots, d_{n}. 3. We aim to demonstrate that the sum d_{1} + d_{2} + ldots + d_{n} does not depend on the location of P. 4. Consider the area S of the polygon. We can express the area of the polygon by considering it as a sum of the areas of the triangles formed by the point P and each side (or its extension). Each of these triangles has a height that corresponds to one of the distances d_{1}, d_{2}, ldots, d_{n}. 5. The area of each such triangle with base a (the side length of the polygon) and height d_i is frac{1}{2} a d_i.  6.

Thus,    [    f(x) = -cos(2x+frac{3π}{4}) = sin(frac{pi}{2} - (2x + frac{3π}{4})) = sin(2x + frac{pi}{4}).    ] 2. **Center of Symmetry**:    To find the center of symmetry, we set x = -frac{π}{8},    [    f(-frac{π}{8}) = sin(2(-frac{π}{8}) + frac{pi}{4}) = sin(0) = 0.    ]    Therefore, the center of symmetry at (-frac{π}{8}, 0) confirms that statement A is correct. 3. **Axis of Symmetry**:    For the axis of symmetry, we consider x = frac{π}{8},    [    f(frac{π}{8}) = sin(2(frac{π}{8}) + frac{pi}{4}) = sin(frac{pi}{2}) = 1.    ]    This indicates the axis of symmetry is x = frac{π}{8}, making statement B correct. 4. **Monotonicity on [frac{π}{8}, frac{5π}{8}]**:    On the interval [frac{π}{8}, frac{5π}{8}], we have    [    2x + frac{pi}{4} in [frac{pi}{2}, frac{3π}{2}],    ]    where the sine function is known to be monotonically decreasing.

Adding them,     [     (1 + 15)^{2014} + (1 - 15)^{2014} = 2 sum_{text{even } k} binom{2014}{k} 15^k     ]     Subtracting them,     [     (1 + 15)^{2014} - (1 - 15)^{2014} = 2 sum_{text{odd } k} binom{2014}{k} 15^k     ] 9. **Solving for the odd terms**: Our sum of interest is exactly half of the difference between ((1 + 15)^{2014}) and ((1 - 15)^{2014}),     [     frac{1}{2} left( (1 + 15)^{2014} - (1 - 15)^{2014} right)     ] 10. **Final calculation**:     [     (1 + 15)^{2014} = 16^{2014}     ]     [     (1 - 15)^{2014} = (-14)^{2014} = 14^{2014}     ]     Therefore,     [     frac{1}{2} left( 16^{2014} - 14^{2014} right)     ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{1}{2} left( 16^{2014} - 14^{2014} right)} ]"},{"instruction":"(Elgin Johnston) Legs L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4 of a square table each have  length n, where n is a positive integer.

(The table is stable if it can be placed so that  all four of the leg ends touch the floor. Note that a cut leg of length 0 is permitted.)","output":"We are given a square table with legs of length n and need to determine the number of ways to cut the legs such that the table remains stable. Stability is defined by the condition that all four legs must touch the ground, implying that the ends of the legs must form a plane.  Step 1: Understanding the Problem The problem can be visualized by considering the table flipped upside down, with the legs extending upwards. We denote the lengths of the legs after cutting as k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4 for legs L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4 respectively. The original lengths of the legs are n, so 0 leq k_i leq n for each i.  Step 2: Condition for Stability The table is stable if the ends of the legs are coplanar. This translates to the condition: [ k_1 + k_4 = k_2 + k_3 ] This equation ensures that the difference in height between opposite legs is the same, thus allowing the table to rest flat on the ground.  Step 3: Counting Valid Configurations We define m = k_1 + k_4 = k_2 + k_3. The value of m can range from 0 to 2n. We need to count the number of ways to distribute m among k_1, k_4 and k_2, k_3. - For a given m, the number of non-negative integer solutions to k_1 + k_4 = m is m + 1 (ranging from (k_1, k_4) = (0, m) to (m, 0)). - Similarly, the number of solutions to k_2 + k_3 = m is also m + 1. Thus, for each m, there are (m+1)^2 valid configurations of (k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4).  Step 4: Summing Over All Possible m We sum the squares of the counts from m = 0 to m = 2n: [ text{Total configurations} = sum_{m=0}^{2n} (m+1)^2 ] This sum can be split into two parts: from m = 0 to n and from m = n+1 to 2n. The second part mirrors the first due to symmetry in the distribution of cuts.  Step 5: Calculating the Sum The sum of squares formula is used here: [ sum_{k=1}^{N} k^2 = frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6} ] Applying this to our range: [ sum_{m=0}^{n} (m+1)^2 + sum_{m=n+1}^{2n} (m+1)^2 ] [ = left(frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)}{6}right) + left(frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}right) ]  Step 6: Simplifying the Expression Combining and simplifying the terms gives: [ frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3) + n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} = frac{2n^3 + 6n^2 + 7n + 3}{3} ]  Conclusion The total number of ways to cut the legs of the table such that it remains stable is boxed{frac{2n^3 + 6n^2 + 7n + 3}{3}}."},{"instruction":"At a math contest, 60 students are wearing blue shirts, and another 84 students are wearing yellow shirts.

Next, we need to find the largest three-digit house number with distinct digits whose sum is 28. We start by choosing the largest possible value for the first digit that allows the remaining two to be distinct and still sum to 28. Choosing 9 for the first digit, we need the other two digits to sum up to 28 - 9 = 19. The largest possible distinct digits that sum to 19 are 9 and 10, but since 10 is not a single digit and digits must be distinct and less than 9, we reconsider and choose 8 as the second largest number.

We could try 9 and 8 again; now, we need 28 - 9 - 8 = 11. There is still no single-digit number for this. Next, if we try 9 for the first, 7 for the second, we get 28 - 9 - 7 = 12. Again, no suitable digit is available.  Attempting 9 and 6 yields 28 - 9 - 6 = 13, impossible with distinct digits. Trying 9 and 5 gives 28 - 9 - 5 = 14. No suitable third digit again. Finally, we try 9 and 4, we get 28 - 9 - 4 = 15. Again, no suitable third digit. Our last trial could be 9, 3 which gives 28 - 9 - 3 = 16. No single-digit meets this. Thus, we must attempt from second largest, so 8.  Using 8, 9, and 1 successively, we have 28 - 8 - 9 = 11.

When the shopkeeper offers a 4% discount, the selling price (SP) becomes ( M - 0.04M = 0.96M ). The profit made when the discount is offered is ( SP - CP = 0.96M - P ). The profit percentage when the discount is offered is calculated as: [ text{Profit Percentage with Discount} = left( frac{0.96M - P}{P} right) times 100 ] When no discount is offered, the selling price is equal to the marked price, ( SP = M ). The profit made without any discount is ( M - P ). Given that the profit percentage without any discount is 25%, we can write: [ text{Profit Percentage without Discount} = left( frac{M - P}{P} right) times 100 = 25 ] From this equation, we can find the relationship between the marked price and the cost price: [ frac{M - P}{P} = frac{25}{100} ] [ M - P = frac{1}{4}P ] [ M = frac{5}{4}P ] Now, we can substitute ( M ) in the profit percentage with discount formula: [ text{Profit Percentage with Discount} = left( frac{0.96 times frac{5}{4}P - P}{P} right) times 100 ] [ text{Profit Percentage with Discount} = left( frac{1.2P - P}{P} right) times 100 ] [ text{Profit Percentage with Discount} = left( frac{0.2P}{P} right) times 100 ] [ text{Profit Percentage with Discount} = 0.2 times 100 ] [ text{Profit Percentage with Discount} = 20% ] So, the profit percentage when the discount was offered is boxed{20%} ."},{"instruction":"Given p: A moving straight line l passing through the fixed point (0,1) always has two distinct common points with the ellipse x^{2}+ frac{y^{2}}{a}=1; q: The function f(x)= frac{1}{3}x^{3}+ax^{2}+2ax+1 has an extreme value on R; if the proposition p and q is false, and p or q is true, find the range of values for the real number a.","output":"If p is true, then the fixed point (0,1) of the straight line l must be inside the ellipse, i.e., 0 < frac{1}{a} < 1 Rightarrow a > 1.
