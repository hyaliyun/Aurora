So we can set up the equation: 10 * (3/2) * H = 600,000 Now, let's solve for H: (15/2) * H = 600,000 H = 600,000 / (15/2) H = 600,000 * (2/15) H = 40,000 * 2 H = 80,000 feet Therefore, the height of the mountain is boxed{80,000}  feet."},{"instruction":"Quadrilateral ABCD is a kite with diagonals intersecting at right angles.

Since the first digit (x) cannot be 0 (to ensure it's a 3-digit number), there are 9 options for x (digits 1 through 9) and 9 options for y (digits 1 through 9, since y can be equal to x). However, we must ensure y > x, reducing our choices for each x. - The correct calculation involves choosing any two different digits from 1 to 9 for x and y, which gives us binom{9}{2} = 36 possibilities. **Case 2: Numbers of the form xyz (z ne 0, x ne z).** - Here, we consider numbers where all digits are distinct and nonzero, with the middle digit being the largest. Since y must be greater than both x and z, and all digits are from 1 to 9, we first choose any 3 digits from these 9. - For each selection of 3 digits, there are 2 ways to arrange them into a mountain number (xyz and zyx), leading to 2 times binom{9}{3} = 168 mountain numbers. **Case 3: Numbers of the form xy0 (x ne 0, y ne 0).** - In this scenario, we're looking at mountain numbers that end with 0. The first digit (x) cannot be 0, and the second digit (y) must be greater than the first but cannot be 0 either. - Similar to Case 1, we choose any two different nonzero digits for x and y, which gives us binom{9}{2} = 36 possibilities.

Using the first equation (x + y + z = a + b + c), we obtain:     [     x + y + z = 2 sqrt{yz} sin u + 2 sqrt{zx} sin v + 2 sqrt{xy} cos(u + v)     ] 8.

Since squares are non-negative, we must have each term being zero:     [     sqrt{z} = sqrt{x} sin v + sqrt{y} sin u = frac{1}{sqrt{z}} left( frac{b}{2} + frac{a}{2} right)     ]     So, (z = frac{a + b}{2}). 10.

Verifying the solution, substitute (x = frac{b+c}{2}), (y = frac{c+a}{2}), (z = frac{a+b}{2}) into the original equations, and simplifying shows that they indeed satisfy both equations. # Conclusion: [ boxed{x = frac{b+c}{2}, quad y = frac{c+a}{2}, quad z = frac{a+b}{2}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that sin (pi+alpha)= frac {1}{2}, and alpha is an angle in the second quadrant, find the value of cos 2alpha.","output":"Since sin (pi+alpha)=- frac {1}{2} = -sin alpha, we can deduce that sin alpha = frac {1}{2}.

Different cases are based on the number of stamps used: 1. Combinations that use 2 stamps:    - (14,1), (13,2), ..., (1,14): there are 14 combinations with 1 arrangement each since the stamps are distinct. 2. Combinations that use 3 stamps without repetition (order matters):    - (1,2,12), (1,3,11), ..., (1,13,1) and others like (2,3,10), (2,4,9), ..., (2,12,1).    - Calculate factorials for permutations: 3! = 6 for distinct stamps in each case. 3. Combinations with 3 stamps that have repetition:    - (5,5,5), (3,6,6), (2,6,7), (1,7,7).    - When all three are same, 1 arrangement. When two are same, 3 arrangements. 4. Similar calculations for sets using 4, 5, or more stamps, including permutations and repetitions.

This means that for every point ( X ) not on ( OA ), the color of point ( X ) does not appear on the circumference of its associated circle ( C(X) ). 2. **Define Circle ( C_1 )**:    Let ( C_1 ) be any circle centered at ( O ). Define the radius of ( C_1 ) to be ( R_1 ). 3. **Locus of Points ( X ) for ( C(X) = C_1 )**:    Find the locus of points ( X ) such that the circle ( C(X) ) is exactly the circle ( C_1 ):    [    C(X) text{ has center } O text{ and radius } X text{ such that } OX + frac{angle AOX}{OX} = R_1    ]    This equation describes a complex spiral starting from ( O ) and reaching outwards, intersecting the circle ( C_1 ) at a particular point. 4. **Colouring Contention**:    We know from our assumption that every point ( X ) on this defined spiral must be a different color from all points on the circumference of the circle ( C_1 ). This is because if any point ( X ) on the spiral had a color matching any point on the circumference of ( C_1 ), the assertion would hold. 5. **Considering Smaller Circles**:    Now consider circles ( C_2, C_3, dots ), each with smaller radii than ( C_1 ). Suppose the radii decrease such that:    [    R_2 < R_1, R_3 < R_2, dots, R_{n+1} < R_n    ]    We are essentially choosing ( n+1 ) different circles, each with a radius less than the previous one. 6. **Contradiction Through Infinite Descent**:    Since there are only a finite number of colors, specifically ( n ) colors available, the coloring scheme will inevitably repeat. By continually reducing the radius, we eventually force at least one color to reappear among these ( n+1 ) circles.     Given that there are ( n ) colors, repeating a color within these ( n+1 ) circles implies that there is at least one circle ( C(X) ) where a point ( X ) not on ( OA ) has the same color as a point on its circumference. This contradicts our initial assumption. # Conclusion: Since our initial assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false.

For our function, a=m and b=-6m, so the symmetry axis is x=-frac{-6m}{2m}=3. - Given x_1=3+a and x_2=3-a, both points are symmetric about the line x=3. Therefore, the function values at x_1 and x_2 must be equal due to the symmetry of the quadratic function. - Thus, statement ① is true. **Statement ②:** - Substituting the coordinates of point C(2,-13) into the function y=mx^2-6mx-5 gives -13=4m-12m-5. Solving for m yields m=1. - With m=1, the function simplifies to y=x^2-6x-5. For x>3, the function is increasing since the coefficient of x^2 is positive. - If x_1 > x_2 > frac{9}{2}, then y_1 > y_2, implying frac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2} > 0. - Therefore, statement ② is false. **Statement ③:** - Rewriting the function as y=m(x-3)^2-5-9m shows the symmetry axis is at x=3. At x=3, y=-5-9m, and at x=6, y=-5. - For 3leqslant xleqslant 6, there are 4 integer values of y possible. If m>0, y increases with x in this interval, so -9 < -5-9mleqslant -8, leading to frac{1}{3}leqslant m < frac{4}{9}. - If m<0, y decreases with x in this interval, so -2leqslant -5-9m < -1, leading to -frac{4}{9} < mleqslant -frac{1}{3}. - Therefore, the conditions for m are -frac{4}{9} < mleqslant -frac{1}{3} or frac{1}{3}leqslant m < frac{4}{9}, making statement ③ true. **Statement ④:** - For m>0 and nleqslant xleqslant 3, y decreases with x.

To satisfy this symmetry, f(a-4)=-f(a). As f(x) is linear, we can write: f(a-4) = a cdot (a-4) + b = -[a cdot a + b] = -f(a) This simplifies to: a^2 - 4a + b = -a^2 - b Solving the above for a and b, we get: 2a^2 - 4a = 0 Factor out a: a(2a - 4) = 0 This gives us the solutions a = 0 or a = 2. Since a neq 0 (otherwise f(x) would not be a function of x), we have a = 2. Also, to satisfy the condition f(-x)=-f(x), we must have b = 0. Hence, f(x) = 2x. Now we have the function g(x)=bx+ frac{a}{x}, with a=2 and b=0, so g(x) = frac{2}{x}. Since g(x) is a hyperbolic function and it is decreasing on the interval x in [-4,-1], we can determine the range of g(x) by evaluating its value at the endpoints: g(-1)= frac{2}{-1} = -2  g(-4)= frac{2}{-4} = -frac{1}{2} Therefore, since g(x) is decreasing, the largest value of g(x) on the interval is g(-4) = -frac{1}{2} and the smallest value is g(-1) = -2.

Prove that the clowns will eventually all have the same number of balls.","output":"We need to prove that all clowns will eventually have the same number of balls. 1. **Definition and Initial Setup:**    For ( k in mathbb{N} ), let \\"step ( k )\\" denote the time period between the ( k )-th and ( k+1 )-th signal.    Let ( M(k) ) be the number of balls held by the clown who has the maximum number of balls at step ( k ). 2. **Behavior of ( M(k) ):**    - If ( M(k) ) is odd, it might increase by 1, particularly when a clown has ( M(k) ) balls and takes an additional ball from their pocket before passing half to the right.    - If ( M(k) ) is even, each clown distributes at most ( M(k)/2 ) balls to their right and keeps at most ( M(k)/2 ) balls. Consequently, no clown will have more than ( M(k) ) balls after the next signal. This implies ( M(k) ) is an upper bound for the number of balls any clown can have at step ( k ). 3. **Establishing an Upper Bound for ( M(k) ):**    By the recurrence relationship, ( M(k) ) remains bounded. Specifically, no clown will have more than ( M(0) + 1 ) balls, where ( M(0) ) is the maximum number of balls a clown has initially. Hence, ( M(k) leq M(0) + 1 ). 4. **Behavior of ( m(k) ):**    - Let ( m(k) ) be the number of balls held by the clown who has the minimum number of balls at step ( k ).    - Additionally, let ( c(k) ) represent the count of clowns with exactly ( m(k) ) balls. 5. **Behavior and Growth of ( m(k) ):**    The sequence ( {m(k)}_{k geq 0} ) is non-decreasing because no clown can end up with fewer balls than ( m(k) ) (thanks to the rule where they add a ball if their number is odd, ensuring they pass at least half their rounded-up count). 6. **Adjustment Based on ( M(k) ) and ( m(k) ):**    If ( M(k) > m(k) ), then there exists at least one clown with ( d(k) ) balls who has a neighbor with strictly more than ( d(k) ) balls. This configuration will cause ( d(k) ) to receive balls and potentially increase ( m(k) ).    Consequently, either:    - ( m(k) ) increases by at least 1, or    - ( c(k) ) (the count of clowns with ( m(k) ) balls) reduces by at least 1. 7. **Bounded Steps for Adjustment:**    Since ( 0 leq c(k) leq n ) (with ( n ) being the total number of clowns), it follows that ( c(k) ) can reduce up to ( n ) steps before ( m(k) ) must increase (if ( M(k) > m(k) )). This means within ( n ) steps, ( m(k) ) will increase by at least 1 whenever ( M(k) > m(k) ). 8. **Eating Up the Gap ( M(k) - m(k) ):**    Because ( m(k) ) must increase by at least 1 frequently, and given that ( M(k) ) is bounded by ( M(0) + 1 ), we conclude:    [    m(k) geq M(0) + 2 - m(0)    ]    Ultimately, we reach a contradiction if ( M(k) > m(k) ) indefinitely, indicating that: 9. **Convergence:**    There exists some ( k ) such that ( M(k) = m(k) ). This implies all clowns have the same number of balls from step ( k ) onward, i.e., they will maintain this balance in all subsequent periods since the rules ensure they share equally.

This is a contradiction. 8. **Conclusion:**     Hence, our assumption that the differences between each pair of adjacent numbers are all less than 5 must be incorrect. Therefore, there must exist at least one pair of adjacent numbers whose difference is not less than 5.

By extending this concept, we can apply it to the groups of 7 chests. 2. **Divisibility within each group of 7:**    Since coins can be equally redistributed among any selected 7 chests, the total number of coins in each group of 7 must be a multiple of 7.    Formally, let (C_i) denote the total number of coins in group (G_i):        [    C_1, C_2, ldots, C_{11}    ]        It follows that:        [    C_i equiv 0 mod 7 quad text{for each} quad i quad (1 leq i leq 11)    ]        As a result, the total number of coins across all 77 chests must satisfy:        [    sum_{i=1}^{11} C_i equiv 0 mod 7     ]  3. **Group the chests into groups of 11:**    Next, we'll look at the 77 chests by grouping them into 7 groups, with each group containing 11 chests.    [    text{Groups} = {H_1, H_2, ldots, H_7}     ]    Similarly to the previous observation, since coins can be equally redistributed among any selected 11 chests, the total number of coins in each group of 11 must be a multiple of 11.    Let (D_j) denote the total number of coins in group (H_j):        [    D_1, D_2, ldots, D_7    ]    It follows that:        [    D_j equiv 0 mod 11 quad text{for each} quad j quad (1 leq j leq 7)    ]        Therefore, the total number of coins across all 77 chests must also satisfy:        [    sum_{j=1}^{7} D_j equiv 0 mod 11     ] 4. **Combining the results:**    We have established that the total number of coins across all 77 chests is both a multiple of 7 and a multiple of 11.

An appropriate set that sums to 15 is 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1. 2. **Symmetric Sums and Coefficient B**: The coefficient B is the negative of the third elementary symmetric sum of the roots. The third symmetric sum s_3 is calculated as the sum of products of every combination of three distinct roots. 3. **Calculate s_3**: Using the roots 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1:    - **Three 3's**: Choosing three 3's from four, binom{4}{3} = 4, each product is 3^3 = 27.

Thus:    [    n leq |B| + 2|C| = n - 1    ]    This is a contradiction, hence ( x > 120^circ ) is impossible. 2. **Construct for each ( x in (0, 120] ):**    - The case ( x = 120^circ ) is trivial: partition the equilateral triangle ( ABC ) into ( triangle AOB, triangle BOC, triangle COA ), where ( O ) is the center of ( triangle ABC ).    - For ( 0 < x < 120^circ ):      Define an ( R )-trapezoid to be a trapezoid similar to ( ABCD ), where ( angle A = angle D = 60^circ ), ( angle B = angle C = 120^circ ), ( AB = CD = 1 ), and ( BC = R ). We say that a shape is *constructible* if it can be partitioned into triangles, each of which has an angle ( x^circ ).      **Lemma 1:** For all sufficiently large ( R ), the ( R )-trapezoid is constructible.      **Proof:** See figure below. (blacksquare)      **Lemma 2:** The 1-trapezoid is constructible.      **Proof:** Slice the 1-trapezoid horizontally into sufficiently thin ( R )-trapezoids (for ( R ) sufficiently large), each of which is constructible by Lemma 1. (blacksquare)      Finally, the equilateral triangle is constructible, since you can partition it into 3 1-trapezoids.

We have the following equations for downstream and upstream speeds:    [    v_{b} + v_{c} = frac{D}{a}    ]    [    v_{b} - v_{c} = frac{D}{b}    ] 3. **Solve for (v_b) and (v_c)**:    Add the two equations to solve for ( v_b ):    [    (v_b + v_c) + (v_b - v_c) = frac{D}{a} + frac{D}{b}    ]    [    2v_b = frac{D}{a} + frac{D}{b}    ]    [    v_b = frac{1}{2} left( frac{D}{a} + frac{D}{b} right)    ]    Subtract the second equation from the first to solve for ( v_c ):    [    (v_b + v_c) - (v_b - v_c) = frac{D}{a} - frac{D}{b}    ]    [    2v_c = frac{D}{a} - frac{D}{b}    ]    [    v_c = frac{1}{2} left( frac{D}{a} - frac{D}{b} right)    ] 4. **Find the time taken by the raft**:    Since the raft drifts with the current, its speed is ( v_c ):    [    v_{c} = frac{1}{2} left( frac{D}{a} - frac{D}{b} right)    ]    The time ( t ) taken by the raft to travel from ( A ) to ( B ) is:    [    t = frac{D}{v_c} = D div frac{1}{2} left( frac{D}{a} - frac{D}{b} right)    ]    [    t = frac{D}{frac{1}{2} left( frac{D}{a} - frac{D}{b} right)}    ]    Simplify the divisor:    [    t = frac{2D}{frac{D}{a} - frac{D}{b}}    ]    Factor ( D ) out from the denominator and cancel:    [    t = frac{2D}{D left( frac{1}{a} - frac{1}{b} right)}    ]    [    t = frac{2}{frac{1}{a} - frac{1}{b}}    ]    [    t = frac{2}{frac{b - a}{ab}}    ]    Simplify the fraction:    [    t = frac{2 cdot ab}{b - a}    ]  Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{2ab}{b-a}} ]"},{"instruction":"a bag, there are n red balls and 5 white balls, where n in mathbb{N}^*.

The total number of elementary events for drawing two balls is calculated using the combination formula: [ {C}_{n+5}^{2} = frac{(n+5)(n+4)}{2} ] Next, we calculate the number of ways to draw two balls of different colors. This can be done by choosing 1 red ball from n red balls and 1 white ball from 5 white balls: [ {C}_{n}^{1} cdot {C}_{5}^{1} = 5n ] Thus, the probability p(n) of drawing two balls of different colors is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes: [ p(n) = frac{10n}{(n+5)(n+4)} = frac{10}{n + frac{20}{n} + 9} ] To maximize p(n), we need to minimize the denominator n + frac{20}{n} + 9. Let's consider f(x) = x + frac{20}{x} for x > 0. The derivative of f(x) with respect to x is: [ f'(x) = 1 - frac{20}{x^2} ] Analyzing the derivative, we find that: - When x > 2sqrt{5}, f'(x) = 1 - frac{20}{x^2} > 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing. - When 0 < x < 2sqrt{5}, f'(x) = 1 - frac{20}{x^2} < 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically decreasing. Given that x must be a natural number (x in mathbb{N}), the minimum values of f(x) occur at x = 4 and x = 5, both yielding f(4) = f(5) = 9. Therefore, the minimum value of the denominator n + frac{20}{n} + 9 is 9, and thus, the maximum value of p(n) = frac{10}{n + frac{20}{n} + 9} is achieved when this denominator is minimized: [ p(n)_{text{max}} = frac{10}{18} = frac{5}{9} ] Hence, the maximum value of p(n) is boxed{frac{5}{9}}."},{"instruction":"The radius of the circle x^2 + y^2 + 4x  4y  1 = 0 is __________.","output":"To find the radius of the circle given by the equation x^2 + y^2 + 4x - 4y - 1 = 0, we first complete the square for both x and y.

Since the radiator contains 10 liters of the solution, the amount of antifreeze in the initial solution is (P/100) * 10 liters. When 2.85714285714 liters of the solution is replaced with pure antifreeze, the amount of antifreeze added is 2.85714285714 liters (since pure antifreeze is 100% antifreeze).

We want the resulting solution to be 50% antifreeze, which means there should be 5 liters of antifreeze in the 10-liter solution (since 50% of 10 liters is 5 liters).

The sides of this rhombus are segments of some faces of the tetrahedron. 2. **Identifying Parallel Edges:**    - Determine pairs of opposite sides in this rhombus. Let these sides of the rhombus lie on tetrahedron edges that we will identify next.    - Assume that one pair of opposite sides of the rhombus lies on the edges of the tetrahedron that are parallel to each other. 3. **Arista Paralela al Plano de Corte:**    - Since the opposite sides of the rhombus are parallel, the faces of the tetrahedron containing these sides will intersect in an edge parallel to the plane of the cut.    - Supposing our rhombus has one pair of opposite sides lying on the tetrahedron edges AB and CD, which are parallel to each other. Hence, these edges remain parallel to the plane cutting the tetrahedron. 4. **Orthogonality and Perpendicularity:**    - In a regular tetrahedron, pairs of opposite edges like AB and CD are orthogonal since they share no common vertex and intersect perpendicularly in the three-dimensional space.    - Thus, the plane of the cut being parallel to AB and CD means the angles between the adjacent sides of the rhombus (formed on the sectional plane) are perpendicular. 5. **Conclusion:**    - Because the adjacent sides of the rhombus are perpendicular, all interior angles must be right angles (90^circ).    - Therefore, a rhombus with right angles at each vertex is indeed a square.

We aim to show that (lambda_5 geq 2 sin 54^circ) regardless of the configuration of these points and determine the necessary condition for equality to hold. We'll consider two main cases in our analysis:  Case 1: Collinear Points If any three of the five points are collinear, say points ( A, B, text{ and } C ) with ( B ) lying between ( A ) and ( C ), and ( AB geq BC ), then: - The longest distance will be ( AC ), making (lambda_5 geq frac{AC}{BC} geq 2). It follows directly that: [ lambda_5 geq 2 > 2 sin 54^circ ]  Case 2: Non-Collinear Points Assume no three points are collinear. Consider the following subcases:  Subcase (a): Convex Pentagon When the five points form a convex pentagon, ( A, B, C, D, E ), at least one interior angle is not smaller than: [ frac{(5-2) times 180^circ}{5} = 108^circ ] Assume ( angle EAB geq 108^circ ) and ( EA geq AB ). In the triangle ( triangle EAB ): [ EB^2 = EA^2 + AB^2 - 2 cdot EA cdot AB cdot cos angle EAB ] Given that ( cos(180^circ - 108^circ) = -cos 72^circ ), we perform the following calculations: [ begin{aligned} EB^2 & geq 2 cdot AB^2 + 2 cdot AB^2 cdot cos(180^circ - 108^circ)       & = 2 cdot AB^2 (1 - cos 72^circ)       & = 4 cdot AB^2 cdot cos^2 36^circ       & = 4 cdot AB^2 cdot sin^2 54^circ end{aligned} ] Thus, we have: [ lambda_5 geq frac{EB}{AB} geq 2 sin 54^circ ]  Subcase (b): Convex Quadrilateral with Internal Point If the convex hull is a quadrilateral (ABCD) with point E inside: - Since (E) is within ( triangle ABC), at least one of ( angle AEB, angle BEC, angle CEA ) is at least (120^circ). Assume ( angle AEB geq 120^circ ). By a similar argument as in Subcase (a): [ EB^2 geq 4 cdot AB^2 cos^2 30^circ = 4 cdot AB^2 sin^2 60^circ > 4 cdot AB^2 sin^2 54^circ ] Therefore: [ lambda_5 > 2 sin 54^circ ]  Subcase (c): Internal Point with Triangle Convex Hull Lastly, if the convex hull is a triangle (ABC) with two internal points (D) and (E): - Following reasoning similar to Subcase (b), we find: [ lambda_5 > 2 sin 54^circ ] # Conclusion: Combining all cases, we have demonstrated that in all configurations either (lambda_5 geq 2 sin 54^circ) or (lambda_5 > 2 sin 54^circ). The equality (lambda_5 = 2 sin 54^circ) holds only in a case where the points form a regular pentagon: - All sides are equal. - All internal angles are: [ frac{(5-2) times 180^circ}{5} = 108^circ ] Therefore, each angle and corresponding lengths satisfy the condition where: [ lambda_5 = 2 sin 54^circ ] Thus, for equality, the five points must strictly be the vertices of a regular pentagon. The necessary and sufficient condition for: [ lambda_{5} = 2 sin 54^circ ] is that the points form the vertices of a regular pentagon.

Also given is that PF is tangent to the circle x^2 + y^2 = a^2 at point M, where M is precisely the midpoint of the line segment PF. Find the eccentricity of the hyperbola.","output":"First, let's denote the left focus of the hyperbola as F_1. By the definition of a hyperbola, we know that the distance from any point P on the hyperbola to the foci is a constant when the sum or difference is taken. Here, since P lies on the left branch, the distance PF_1 - PF is constant and equals 2a. As M is the midpoint of PF, and since the tangent at M is perpendicular to PF (property of tangents to circles), we have PF_1 perp PF. Let's denote F as the right focus, which means that triangle PF_1F is a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse PF = 4a and one leg PF_1 = 2a. Using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle PF_1F, we have: (F_1F)^2 = (PF)^2 - (PF_1)^2 = (4a)^2 - (2a)^2 = 16a^2 - 4a^2 = 12a^2. Thus, the distance between the foci F_1 and F is F_1F = 2c where c^2 = 12a^2/4 = 3a^2. Now recall that the eccentricity e of a hyperbola is defined as e = c/a, where c is the distance from the center to a focus, and a is the distance from the center to a vertex. Therefore, e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{3a^2}}{a} = sqrt{3}. However, we need to reconcile this result with the fact that the question indicates PF_1 is actually 2c which suggests a different relationship between a and c. Revisiting the right triangle PF_1F accounting for this detail, we should have: c^2 = a^2 + (2a)^2 = a^2 + 4a^2 = 5a^2. So the eccentricity e is actually: e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{5a^2}}{a} = sqrt{5}.

According to the definition of rational numbers, any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction frac{p}{q} of two integers, a numerator p and a non-zero denominator q, is considered rational. Therefore, frac{5}{7} is a rational number. - **Option B: 0.1010010001... (with one more zero between adjacent ones each time)**   This number is an infinite decimal that does not repeat.

This means that the total number of goals scored in the first four matches is 4x. After scoring 3 goals in his fifth match, his average increases by 0.2. This means his new average after five matches is x + 0.2. The total number of goals scored in five matches would be the sum of the goals scored in the first four matches (4x) and the goals scored in the fifth match (3).

We start by considering the expression (sin x cos y + sin y cos z + sin z cos x). We aim to find its maximum value for real numbers (x, y, z). 2. We can assume that (x, y, z) are between (0) and (frac{pi}{2}). This is because replacing (x, y, z) with their reference angles in this range switches all sines and cosines to positive without changing their absolute values, and hence only increases the sum. 3. Without loss of generality (WLOG), we can let (y) be the central number of (x, y, z). This means that (y) is between (x) and (z) in terms of their values. 4. Consider the sequences (sin x, sin y, sin z) and (cos z, cos y, cos x). These sequences are sorted similarly because (sin) and (cos) are both non-decreasing functions in the interval ([0, frac{pi}{2}]). 5. By the rearrangement inequality, the sum (sin x cos y + sin y cos z + sin z cos x) is maximized when the sequences are similarly sorted. Therefore, we have:    [    sin x cos y + sin y cos z + sin z cos x leq sin x cos z + sin y cos y + sin z cos x    ] 6. We know that (sin y cos y = frac{1}{2} sin 2y). Thus, the expression becomes:    [    sin x cos z + frac{1}{2} sin 2y + sin z cos x    ] 7. The maximum value of (sin 2y) is 1, which occurs when (y = frac{pi}{4}). Therefore, (frac{1}{2} sin 2y = frac{1}{2}). 8. For the remaining terms, (sin x cos z + sin z cos x), we use the identity (sin (x+z) = sin x cos z + cos x sin z). The maximum value of (sin (x+z)) is 1, which occurs when (x + z = frac{pi}{2}). 9. Therefore, the maximum value of (sin x cos z + sin z cos x) is 1. 10. Combining these results, we get:     [     sin x cos y + sin y cos z + sin z cos x leq 1 + frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2}     ] 11. Equality happens when (y = frac{pi}{4}) and (x + z = frac{pi}{2}). Also, we require that (cos y = cos z) or (sin x = sin y) for the rearrangement inequality to be equality, and hence (x = y = z = frac{pi}{4}). Therefore, the greatest value of (sin x cos y + sin y cos z + sin z cos x) is (boxed{frac{3}{2}})."},{"instruction":"a modified game, Bernardo and Silvia play with an integer between 0 and 999.

We will use strong induction on ( n ) to show that for any ( c ), given ( nc ) points and ( c ) colors, we can always draw ( n-1 ) chords. 1. **Base Case: ( n = 2 )**    - If ( n = 2 ), we have ( 2c ) points and ( c ) colors. Since there are at least 2 points of each color, we can always draw at least 1 chord.

This contradicts our assumption that left| 2 cos^2 alpha + a cos alpha + b right| leq 1. From Cases 1 and 2, we conclude b must equal -1. 3. Now, with b = -1, consider the equation:     [     2 cos^2 alpha + a cos alpha - 1.     ] 4. To maintain equality, choose alpha such that a cos alpha = |a|.

For example, if we choose the numbers 1, 2, 4, and 5, we can calculate the average as follows: frac{1 + 2 + 4 + 5}{4} = frac{12}{4} = 3 Thus, a possible set of ball numbers in plate A that meets the criteria is 1, 2, 4, 5.

For the right-hand side, we substitute n=1 into the formula: frac{n(n+1)}{2(2n+1)} = frac{1(1+1)}{2(2cdot1+1)} = frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3} Thus, the base case holds since both sides are equal. **Inductive Step**: Now assume that for some k in mathbb{N}^*, the following statement is true: frac{1^2}{1cdot 3} + frac{2^2}{3cdot 5} + ldots + frac{k^2}{(2k-1)(2k+1)} = frac{k(k+1)}{2(2k+1)} Add the term corresponding to n=k+1 to both sides and simplify: frac{k(k+1)}{2(2k+1)} + frac{(k+1)^2}{(2k+1)(2k+3)} To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator: frac{k(k+1)(2k+3)}{2(2k+1)(2k+3)} + frac{2(k+1)^2}{2(2k+1)(2k+3)} Now, combine the numerators and simplify: frac{2k^2(k+1) + 3k(k+1) + 2(k+1)^2}{2(2k+1)(2k+3)} Simplify and factor the numerator further: frac{k(k+1)(2k+3) + 2(k+1)(k+1)}{2(2k+1)(2k+3)} = frac{(k+1)(k(2k+3) + 2(k+1))}{2(2k+1)(2k+3)} Continue simplifying by expanding and factoring: frac{(k+1)(2k^2 + 3k + 2k + 2)}{2(2k+1)(2k+3)} = frac{(k+1)(2k^2 + 5k + 2)}{2(2k+1)(2k+3)} frac{(k+1)(2k+1)(k+2)}{2(2k+1)(2k+3)} Observe that (2k+1) can be cancelled from both the numerator and the denominator: frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2(2k+3)} Finally, express it as: frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)}{2(2(k+1)+1)} Hence, we have shown that if the statement holds for k, then it also holds for k+1.

Step 1: Determine the conditions for the first and last digits. - For the middle digit to be the average of the first and last digits, the sum of the first and last digits must be an even number. This is because the average of two integers is an integer only if their sum is even. Therefore, the first and last digits must be either both odd or both even. Step 2: Count the odd-odd combinations. - There are 5 odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).  - Since both the first and last digits can be any of these 5 odd digits, there are 5 cdot 5 = 25 odd-odd combinations. Step 3: Count the even-even combinations. - There are 5 even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), but the first digit cannot be 0 because we are looking for three-digit numbers. - Thus, there are 4 choices for the first digit (2, 4, 6, 8) and 5 choices for the last digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), making 4 cdot 5 = 20 even-even combinations that do not use zero as the first digit.

For example:     [     a_1 = 1, quad a_2 = 11, quad a_3 = 111, ldots     ]     Mathematically, this can be written as:     [     a_k = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 10^i = frac{10^k - 1}{9}     ] 3. **Euclidean Division**: Perform the Euclidean division of ( a_k ) by ( n ):     [     a_k = n cdot q_k + r_k     ]     Here, ( q_k ) is the quotient and ( r_k ) is the remainder when ( a_k ) is divided by ( n ). 4. **Pigeonhole Principle Application**: Since ( r_k ) (the remainder) can only take a finite number of values (from 0 to ( n-1 )), by the pigeonhole principle, there must exist two integers ( k < l ) such that:     [     r_k = r_l     ] 5. **Difference of Numbers**: Consider the difference ( a_l - a_k ):     [     a_l - a_k = n cdot q_l + r_l - (n cdot q_k + r_k) = n cdot (q_l - q_k)     ]     Since ( r_k = r_l ), the remainders cancel out, and we get:     [     a_l - a_k = n cdot (q_l - q_k)     ]     This means ( a_l - a_k ) is a multiple of ( n ). 6. **Form of the Multiple**: Note that ( a_l ) consists of ( l ) ones, and ( a_k ) consists of ( k ) ones. Therefore, ( a_l - a_k ) has ( l-k ) ones followed by ( k ) zeros:     [     a_l - a_k = 11ldots100ldots0     ]     Thus, we have found a multiple of ( n ) that is written only with the digits 1 and 0. 7. **Conclusion for the General Case**:    [ boxed{a_{l} - a_{k} text{ is a multiple of } n text{ that is written in the form of only 1's and 0's}} ] 8. **Special Case - When ( n ) is Odd and Not Divisible by 5**:     - If ( n ) is odd and not divisible by 5, we need to show ( n ) has a multiple consisting only of the digit 1.     - Since ( n ) is not divisible by 2 or 5, by Euler's theorem, we know there exists an integer ( d ) such that:         [         10^d equiv 1 pmod{n}         ]       This implies ( 10^d - 1 equiv 0 pmod{n} ), which can be written as:         [         n mid (10^d - 1)         ]       Here, ( 10^d - 1 ) is a number which has ( d ) ones:         [         10^d - 1 = 111 ldots 1 quad (text{d ones})         ]       Thus, ( n ) has a multiple written only using the digit 1. 9. **Conclusion for the Special Case**:    [ boxed{n text { has a multiple consisting only of 1's if ( n ) is odd and not divisible by 5}} ]"},{"instruction":"one of the teacher's meetings, it was agreed that each class will contribute specific amounts to three different school activities: 1. 90 for Activity A 2. 120 for Activity B 3. 150 for Activity C There are three classes participating with varying numbers of students and class funds: 1.

This means that s-1 must be divisible by 6, or in mathematical terms, s-1 equiv 0 pmod{6}. First, let's identify the range within which we are working. We are told the school has between 150 and 200 students, so we are looking for numbers in the range from 151 to 199 inclusive because if we had 150 students and one was absent, we would have 149, which is not divisible by 6. Next, we find the first and last numbers in this range that satisfy s-1 equiv 0 pmod{6}. For the first number, when s = 151, we have 151 - 1 = 150, which is divisible by 6. For the last number, when s = 199, we have 199 - 1 = 198, which is also divisible by 6. Thus, the numbers that satisfy the condition are 151, 157, ..., 199. To find the sum of these numbers, we recognize that they form an arithmetic sequence, where each term increases by 6. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: [ text{Sum} = frac{(text{first term} + text{last term}) times (text{number of terms})}{2}. ] The first term is 151, and the last term is 199.

Substituting these values into the formula gives us: [ text{Sum} = frac{(151 + 199) times 9}{2} = frac{350 times 9}{2} = frac{3150}{2} = 1575. ] Therefore, the sum of all possible numbers of students enrolled at the school is boxed{1575}."},{"instruction":"The polynomial Q(x) is a monic, quartic polynomial with real coefficients, and two of its roots are cos phi + i sin phi and cos phi  i sin phi, where frac{pi}{4} < phi < frac{pi}{2}.

First, let's identify the even numbers in the set: 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. There are 5 even numbers. The probability of drawing an even number on the first draw is 5/10 (since there are 5 even numbers out of 10 total numbers). After drawing one even number, there are now 4 even numbers left and 9 slips remaining in the hat. So, the probability of drawing another even number on the second draw is 4/9. Continuing this pattern, the probability of drawing an even number on the third draw is 3/8 (since there are now 3 even numbers left and 8 slips remaining). Finally, the probability of drawing an even number on the fourth draw is 2/7 (since there are now 2 even numbers left and 7 slips remaining). To find the overall probability of drawing 4 even numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities of each individual draw: (5/10) * (4/9) * (3/8) * (2/7) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2) / (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) Now, let's calculate the numerator and the denominator separately: Numerator: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 120 Denominator: 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 = 5040 So the probability is: 120 / 5040 = 1 / 42 Therefore, the probability that all 4 slips drawn have an even number written on them is boxed{1/42} ."},{"instruction":"The areas of two squares are in the ratio (16:49).

Given that sqrt{23.6} = 4.858, we notice that 23.6, 2.36, and 0.00236 are related by powers of 10. Specifically, 23.6 = 10^1 times 2.36 and 0.00236 = 10^{-3} times 2.36. This suggests that we can use the properties of square roots and powers of 10 to find sqrt{0.00236}. We are also given sqrt{2.36} = 1.536. This is a crucial piece of information because it directly relates to the number whose square root we want to find, 0.00236. To find sqrt{0.00236}, we can use the fact that sqrt{10^{-3} times 2.36} = sqrt{10^{-3}} times sqrt{2.36}.  Since sqrt{10^{-3}} = 10^{-3/2} = 10^{-1.5}, and knowing that 10^{-1.5} = 0.0316, we can multiply this by the square root of 2.36: sqrt{0.00236} = 10^{-1.5} times sqrt{2.36} = 0.0316 times 1.536 However, the correct approach to directly relate the given square roots to the answer without introducing incorrect intermediate steps is to recognize the pattern of moving the decimal point and its effect on the square root's magnitude.  Given sqrt{23.6} = 4.858 and knowing that moving the decimal point two places to the left (which is equivalent to dividing by 100) to get 2.36 reduces the square root by a factor of 10, we can apply the same logic to find sqrt{0.00236} by moving the decimal point three places to the left from 2.36: sqrt{2.36} = 1.536 Moving the decimal point three places to the left (dividing by 1000) to get 0.00236 reduces the square root by a factor of 10^{frac{3}{2}} = 31.6227766, approximately. This means we divide 1.536 by 31.6227766, but the correct understanding is that each step of moving the decimal point two places to the left (or dividing by 100) reduces the square root's magnitude by a factor of 10. Therefore, moving it three places to the left (or dividing by 1000) reduces the magnitude by a factor of sqrt{1000} = 10^{1.5} = 31.6227766, which is not directly applied here but helps understand the relationship between the numbers.

Since the trapezium is circumscribed around a circle, the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, the equation for the sides of the trapezium can be written as (2y + 0.8x + 0.8x = 2x). Also, using the given length of the longer base gives (y + 0.8x + 0.8x = 20). Solving these equations simultaneously: 1. (2y + 1.6x = 2x Rightarrow 2y = 0.4x) 2. (y + 1.6x = 20 Rightarrow y = 20 - 1.6x) Substituting (y = 0.2x) into (y = 20 - 1.6x) gives: [0.2x = 20 - 1.6x] [1.8x = 20] [x = frac{20}{1.8} = frac{100}{9}] Then, (y = 0.2x = frac{20}{9}).

To find the length of the arc of the curve given by the equation (y = ln frac{5}{2x}) within the interval (sqrt{3} leq x leq sqrt{8}), we use the formula for the length (L) of a curve (y = f(x)) from (x = a) to (x = b):     [     L = int_{a}^{b} sqrt{1 + left(f'(x)right)^2} , dx     ] 2. First, compute the derivative of the given function (f(x) = ln frac{5}{2x}):     [     f'(x) = left( ln frac{5}{2x} right)' = left( ln 5 - ln 2 - ln x right)' = - frac{1}{x}     ] 3.

(II) Does there exist an a such that f(x) attains a minimum value at x = 0? Explain your reasoning.","output":"(I) f'(x) = e^x + frac{1}{x+1} - a + sinx, (x > -1). First, we prove that e^x ≥ x + 1. Let g(x) = e^x - x - 1. Then g'(x) = e^x - 1. Let g'(x) = 0, we get x = 0. When x < 0, g'(x) < 0, g(x) is decreasing. When x > 0, g'(x) > 0, g(x) is increasing. Thus, the minimum value of g(x) is g(0) = 0, i.e., g(x) ≥ g(0) = 0. Hence, e^x ≥ x + 1. So, e^x + frac{1}{x+1} ≥ x + 1 + frac{1}{x+1} ≥ 2. Also, sinx ≥ -1, but the equality does not hold. So, e^x + frac{1}{x+1} + sinx > 1 ≥ a. Thus, f'(x) = e^x + frac{1}{x+1} - a + sinx > 0. Hence, f(x) is an increasing function on its domain (-1, +∞). (II) Note that f'(0) = 2 - a. Let f'(0) = 2 - a = 0, we get a = 2. Now, f'(x) = e^x + frac{1}{x+1} - 2 + sinx. Let h(x) = f'(x) = e^x + frac{1}{x+1} - 2 + sinx. Then h'(x) = e^x - frac{1}{(x+1)^2} + cosx. On (0, frac{π}{2}), e^x > 1 > frac{1}{(x+1)^2}, cosx > 0. So, h'(x) = e^x - frac{1}{(x+1)^2} + cosx > 0. Hence, h(x) is increasing on (0, frac{π}{2}), and h(x) > h(0) = 0. That is, f'(x) = e^x + frac{1}{x+1} - 2 + sinx > 0. On (-1, 0), let s(x) = (x+1)^2, t(x) = (x+1)^2cosx. Then s'(x) = (x+1)(x+3)e^x > 0, so s(x) is increasing on (-1, 0). Thus, s(-1) < s(x) < s(0), i.e., 0 < s(x) < 1. So there exists an interval (x₁, 0) ⊂ (-1, 0) such that s(x) > frac{1}{2}. That is, e^x > frac{1}{2(x+1)^2}. Also, 0 < (x+1)^2 < 1, cos1 < cosx < 1, i.e., 0 < t(x) < 1. So there exists an interval (x₂, 0) ⊂ (-1, 0) such that t(x) > frac{1}{2}. That is, cosx > frac{1}{2(x+1)^2}. Let (x₁, 0) ∩ (x₂, 0) = (x₀, 0). Then on the interval (x₀, 0), e^x > frac{1}{2(x+1)^2}, cosx > frac{1}{2(x+1)^2} hold simultaneously. So, h'(x) = e^x - frac{1}{(x+1)^2} + cosx > 0. Hence, h(x) is increasing on (x₀, 0), i.e., h(x) < h(0) = 0. That is, on the interval (x₀, 0), f'(x) = e^x + frac{1}{x+1} - 2 + sinx < 0.

Therefore, the total weight of the four packets (a, b, c, and d) is ( 4 times 80 = 320 ) kg. Now, we know that the weight of packet a is 75 kg, so the weight of packets b, c, and d together is ( 320 - 75 = 245 ) kg. Next, packet e replaces packet a. Packet e weighs 3 kg more than packet d. Let's denote the weight of packet d as ( D ) kg. Then the weight of packet e is ( D + 3 ) kg.

What is the smallest possible value for the second largest element? 1. **Initial Attempt Using Powers of 2:**    - We initially consider the set of integers {1, 2, 4, 8, dots, 1024} as this set allows for the generation of all integers up to 2047.    - However, we aim to generate all integers up to 1500 with fewer or smaller integers, thus optimizing the second largest element. 2. **Optimizing with Specific Integers:**    - Consider the set: {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 247, 248, 750}. This is specifically chosen to meet our goal of generating all integers up to 1500:      - Numbers 1 through 128 allow us to generate any integer up to 255 using sums of subsets (powers of 2).      - Adding 248 allows generation of integers in the range 256 to 503.      - Adding 247 covers the range 504 to 750.      - Finally, adding 750 ensures coverage up to 1500. 3. **Justification and Constraints:**    - To confirm, let the integers be a_1 < a_2 < dots < a_{11}. Define s_n = a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n.    - Let N be such that s_{N-1} < 1500 leq s_N. It must be true that 1500 leq s_{11} given 1500 is the maximum sum.    - Given a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, we establish N and note 1 < N leq 11. 4. **Bounding Relations and Induction:**    - For 1 < k leq N, using s_{k-1} < 1500 and s_{k-1} + 1 leq 1500, we recognize that a_k leq s_{k-1} + 1 since some subset sum must total s_{k-1} + 1.    - Using induction, we show s_k leq 2^k - 1:      - Base case k = 1: s_1 = 1 leq 2^1 - 1.      - Inductive step: Assuming s_{k-1} leq 2^{k-1} - 1, then a_k leq s_{k-1} + 1 leq 2^{k-1}. Thus, s_k = s_{k-1} + a_k leq (2^{k-1} - 1) + 2^{k-1} = 2^k - 1. 5. **Upper Bound and Evaluation:**    - Since 2^{10} - 1 = 1023 < 1500, N = 11 (all 11 elements are needed).    - Knowing s_{11} geq 1500, it follows that s_{10} geq 750.    - Given s_8 leq 255, we deduce a_9 + a_{10} geq 495. Thus, a_{10} geq 248. 6. **Conclusion:**    - The smallest possible value for the second-largest element (i.e., a_{10}) is boxed{248}."},{"instruction":"Among the applicants who passed the entrance exams to a technical university, the grades of excellent were received as follows: 48 people in mathematics, 37 people in physics, 42 people in literature, 75 people in mathematics or physics, 76 people in mathematics or literature, 66 people in physics or literature, and 4 people in all three subjects.

Since the triangles are congruent right-angled isosceles triangles, the height of the overlapping triangle is ( frac{1 - x}{2} ). 4. The area ( A ) of the overlapping triangle is given by:    [    A = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times (1 - x) times frac{1 - x}{2} = frac{1}{4} (1 - x)^2    ] 5.

We need to prove that one of these subsets contains all possible distances. We start by stating the lemma:        **Lemma:** If there is a sphere (mathcal{S}) with radius (r) that contains points from only two of the sets (say (A) and (B)), then either (A) or (B) contains every distance in ((0, r]). 2. **Proof of the lemma:**    Suppose that neither (A) nor (B) contains every distance in ((0, r]). This means that for some (d leq r), there are no two points in (B) on (mathcal{S}) with distance (d).    - If (mathcal{S}) contains only points from (A), we are done because (A) would contain every distance in ((0, r]).    - Otherwise, we can find a point (P in mathcal{S} cap B). Consider the circle ({X in mathcal{S} : |XP| = d}). This circle must only have points from (A) because there are no two points in (B) with distance (d). 3. **Diameter of the circle:**    The diameter of this circle is (2d sinleft(cos^{-1}frac{d}{2r}right)). We need to show that this diameter is at least (d):    [    2d sinleft(cos^{-1}frac{d}{2r}right) geq d    ]    Since (cos^{-1}frac{d}{2r} geq cos^{-1}frac{1}{2} = 60^circ), we have:    [    sinleft(60^circright) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} > frac{1}{2}    ]    Therefore,    [    2d cdot frac{1}{2} = d    ]    Hence, the diameter of the circle is at least (d), and we have found in (A) every distance from ((0, d]). 4. **Contradiction for larger distances:**    Now, if for some (d^* in (d, r]), we cannot find two points in (A) with distance (d^*), then a circle ({X in mathcal{S} : |XP| = d^*}) must be in (B), while containing two points with distance (d), which is a contradiction. This means that every distance in ((0, r]) occurs in (A), proving our claim.

If one of (A, B, C) is empty, reassign finitely many points from one of the infinite sets to the sets which are empty. 6. **Application of the lemma:**    Every sphere centered around a point in, say (C), with radius (c), will contain only points from (A) or (B). By the Lemma, either (A) or (B) will contain every distance in ((0, c]), hence either (a > c) or (b > c), or equivalently, (c < max{a, b, c}). 7. **Contradiction:**    We can say the same for (a) and (b) as well, yielding that neither of (a, b, c) can be the largest of them, which is absurd.

Note that squaring is valid because both sides are non-negative:    [    (sqrt{3 log_{a} x - 2})^2 < (2 log_{a} x - 1)^2    ]    This simplifies to:    [    3 log_{a} x - 2 < (2 log_{a} x - 1)^2    ] 2. **Expand the Right-Hand Side:**    Expand the squared term on the right-hand side:    [    3 log_{a} x - 2 < 4 (log_{a} x)^2 - 4 log_{a} x + 1    ] 3. **Rearrange the Terms:**    Bring all the terms to one side to form a quadratic inequality:    [    4 (log_{a} x)^2 - 7 log_{a} x + 3 > 0    ] 4. **Solve the Quadratic Inequality:**    Solve the quadratic equation (4y^2 - 7y + 3 = 0) where (y = log_{a} x):    [    4y^2 - 7y + 3 = 0    ]    Using the quadratic formula (y = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}), where (a=4), (b=-7), and (c=3):    [    y = frac{7 pm sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 cdot 4 cdot 3}}{2 cdot 4} = frac{7 pm sqrt{49 - 48}}{8} = frac{7 pm 1}{8}    ]    Thus, the solutions are:    [    y = 1 quad text{and} quad y = frac{3}{4}    ]    Therefore, the quadratic inequality factors as:    [    4 (log_{a} x - 1) (log_{a} x - frac{3}{4}) > 0    ] 5. **Find the Intervals:**    The inequality (4 (log_{a} x - 1) (log_{a} x - frac{3}{4}) > 0) holds under the following conditions:    [    log_{a} x < frac{3}{4} quad text{or} quad log_{a} x > 1    ] 6. **Additional Conditions:**    We also need to ensure the logarithm arguments are valid.

This can be rewritten as a leqslant x^{2}. To find the maximum constraint on a, we consider the minimum value of x^{2} in the given interval. Let f(x) = x^{2} for x in [1,2]. The minimum value of f(x) in this interval is f(1) = 1^{2} = 1. Therefore, to satisfy the condition for all x in [1,2], we must have a leqslant 1.

For a quadratic equation to have real roots, the discriminant Delta = b^{2}-4ac must be non-negative. Applying this to our equation, we get Delta = (2a)^{2}-4(1)(4) = 4a^{2}-16 geqslant 0. Solving this inequality, we find a^{2} geq 4, which implies a leqslant -2 or a geqslant 2. Thus, the range of a for proposition q to be true is a in (-infty, -2] cup [2,+infty). **Step 3: Combining Conditions When Only One Proposition is True** 1. If p is true and q is false, we combine the conditions aleqslant 1 and -2 < a < 2. The intersection of these conditions gives -2 < a leqslant 1, resulting in the range a in (-2,1]. 2. If p is false and q is true, we consider a > 1 and a leqslant -2 or a geqslant 2. The only feasible condition from these that does not overlap with the truth of p is a geqslant 2, giving us the range a in [2,+infty).

Now, we need to evaluate the function f(x) at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval [0, 4]:  f(0) = -frac{1}{3} cdot 0^3 + 0^2 = 0,   f(2) = -frac{1}{3} cdot 2^3 + 2^2 = -frac{1}{3}cdot 8 + 4 = -frac{8}{3} + frac{12}{3} = frac{4}{3},   f(4) = -frac{1}{3} cdot 4^3 + 4^2 = -frac{1}{3} cdot 64 + 16 = -frac{64}{3} + frac{48}{3} = -frac{16}{3}.  To find the maximum value, we compare the values of f(x) at each critical point and at the endpoints:  max{ f(0), f(2), f(4) } = max{ 0, frac{4}{3}, -frac{16}{3} } = boxed{frac{4}{3}}.  Therefore, the maximum value of the function on the interval [0, 4] is frac{4}{3}.

Identify the given circles (C_{1}) and (C_{2}) and their centers. 2. Draw the perpendiculars from the centers to the secant line. 3. Use the perpendicular properties to determine the required segments equal to (frac{m}{2}). 4. Ensure the feasibility through the condition (frac{m}{2} < C_{1}C_{2}).

All the touchings described in the problem occur externally.","output":"First, let's apply an inversion with respect to the circle (O_3) of radius (a). Specifically, if a point (P) inverts to a point (P') relative to circle (O_3), the radial inversion formula is: [ R(P) = a^2 / OP ] Using this transformation: 1. **Step 1: Inversion of ( O_3 )**:    - Upon applying inversion through the circle (O_3), this circle remains invariant. 2. **Step 2: Inversion of ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 )**:    - The circles (O_1) of radius (b) and (O_2) of radius (c) (both tangent at point (O), the center of (O_3)) transform into two parallel lines (ell_1) and (ell_2), respectively. Here, (ell_1) intersects (O_1) at point (A). These lines run parallel to each other due to the tangency at (O). 3. **Step 3: Relationship using Similar Triangles**:    - The triangles (OAB) and (OCA) are similar by given conditions. Hence, based on the similarity criterion:      [      frac{OA}{OB} = frac{OC}{OA}      ]      Given that (OA = a), it follows that:      [      a^2 = OA cdot OC cdot k      ]      where (k) is some constant.    4. **Step 4: Points B and C under Inversion**:    - Points (B) and (C) transform into each other. Hence, based on the inversion property:      [      a^2 = OB cdot OC      ]      Yielding (OC) from (OB):      [      OC = frac{a^2}{OB}      ] 5. **Step 5: Fixing O4 as external tangent circles**:    - Given that (O_4) touches (O_1) at (A) and (O_2) at some point (B), it meets parallel lines (ell_1) and (ell_2). Consequently, the transformation depicts (O_4) being tangent to both (ell_1) and (ell_2).  6. **Step 6: Computing Distance (AC)**:    - Projecting perpendicular from center (O) to (ell_1), intersecting circle (O_1) at another point (X) provides:      [      OH = frac{a^2}{OX} = frac{a^2}{2b}      ]      Similarly, for line (ell_2):      [      OH = frac{a^2}{OX} = frac{a^2}{2c}      ]      Therefore, the distance between (ell_1) and (ell_2) (which is the desired distance (AC)) becomes:      [      AC = frac{a^2}{2b} + frac{a^2}{2c} = frac{a^2}{2} left( frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} right)      ] # Conclusion: Thus, the distance (AC) is given by ( frac{a^2}{2} left( frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} right) ).

However, both roots have to be negative in order to satisfy the sum being negative (since any positive number subtracted by any number greater will yield negative):    Therefore, the quadratic equation does not have any positive roots.    Thus, option (A) is incorrect. 3. **Check for integer roots**:    If the equation has integer roots ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), they must satisfy:    [    x_1 x_2 = 3991.    ]    Analyzing the units digit in (3991) (i.e., 1), and considering the possible unit combinations:    - Possible units digits for integer factors of a product ending in 1 include: ((1, 1)), ((3, 7)), and ((9, 9)).

Therefore, the formula for the nth number in the third row is frac{1}{2} times left(-2right)^{n}.

Interest on the first part = Principal (x) * Rate (3%) * Time (8 years) / 100 Interest on the second part = Principal (1704) * Rate (5%) * Time (3 years) / 100 So, we have the equation: (x * 3 * 8) / 100 = (1704 * 5 * 3) / 100 Simplifying both sides by 100, we get: (x * 3 * 8) = (1704 * 5 * 3) Now, we can cancel out the common factor of 3 on both sides: (x * 8) = (1704 * 5) Now, we can solve for x: x = (1704 * 5) / 8 x = (1704 * 5) / 8 x = 1704 * 0.625 x = 1065 So, the first part of the sum is Rs. 1065.

For proposition p: The function y = log_a(1-2x) will be monotonically increasing if the base a of the logarithm is greater than 1 (since 1-2x is decreasing, a base greater than 1 will make it an increasing function) and the argument (1 - 2x) remains positive. So, we must have: 1. Base condition: a > 1 2. Argument condition: 1 - 2x > 0 implies x < frac{1}{2} Since x < frac{1}{2} must hold true for all x in the domain, we conclude that the domain of the function is (-infty, frac{1}{2}). There is no new restriction on a from the domain. For proposition q: The inequality (a-2)x^2 + 2(a-2)x - 4 < 0 must hold for all real numbers x. For a quadratic inequality to be always negative, its leading coefficient must be negative, and it must not have real roots (otherwise, there would be values of x for which the inequality is not satisfied).

Analyzing the sign of {f'}(x):    - If a geq 0, then {f'}(x) = frac{x^2+a}{x} > 0 for all x > 0. Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,+infty).    - If a < 0, then {f'}(x) = frac{(x+sqrt{-a})(x-sqrt{-a})}{x}. Here, {f'}(x) < 0 when x in (0, sqrt{-a}), indicating f(x) is monotonically decreasing. Conversely, {f'}(x) > 0 when x in (sqrt{-a}, +infty), indicating f(x) is monotonically increasing. 4. Summary for monotonicity:    - When a geq 0, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,+infty).    - When a < 0, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, sqrt{-a}) and monotonically increasing on (sqrt{-a}, +infty).

Since x geq 1 in our interval, x-1 geq 0, and since x-ln x > 0, it follows that h'(x) geq 0, indicating h(x) is monotonically increasing on [1,4]. 3. Therefore, the maximum value of h(x) over [1,4] is h(4) = frac{2}{2-ln 2}, implying the range of a is a geq frac{2}{2-ln 2}.

Using the above result iteratively, starting with ( M = max { |c_1|, |c_2|, ldots, |c_{100}| } ), for ( lambda in (0,1) ), there exists ( k_1 > 100 ) such that:    [    |c_{k_1}|, |c_{k_1+1}|, cdots, |c_{k_1+99}| leq lambda M.    ] 8. Continue this process recursively:    - There exists ( k_2 > k_1 + 99 ) such that:      [      |c_{k_2}|, |c_{k_2+1}|, cdots, |c_{k_2+99}| leq lambda^2 M.      ]    - Proceeding similarly for ( t ) times:      [      |c_{k_t}|, |c_{k_t+1}|, cdots, |c_{k_t+99}| leq lambda^t M.      ] 9. As ( lambda in (0,1) ), ( lim_{t to infty} lambda^t M = 0 ). Therefore, there exists a positive integer ( m ) such that ( |c_m| < (0.001)^2 ). 10. Since ( a_m, b_m > 0 ), we have:     [     left| c_m right| = left| a_m^2 - b_m^2 right| = left| (a_m + b_m)(a_m - b_m) right| > left| a_m - b_m right|^2 Rightarrow left| a_m - b_m right| < 0.001.     ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{|a_m - b_m| < 0.001} ]"},{"instruction":"f the function f(x)=ax^{3}2x^{2}+a^{2}x has a local minimum at x=1, then the real number a is ____.","output":"To find the value of a for which the function f(x)=ax^{3}-2x^{2}+a^{2}x has a local minimum at x=1, we first need to find the derivative of f(x) and then set it equal to zero at x=1 to solve for a.

The color of the squares can be changed such that in a single step, the color of all squares in an entire row or an entire column is inverted (black squares become white and white squares become black). Is it always possible to make all the squares on the chessboard black?","output":"# Problem: A (12 times 12) chessboard has some squares that are black, and the others are white. The colors of the squares can be changed such that a whole row or a whole column is reversed in color in one step. Can it always be achieved that all squares on the chessboard are black? To address this problem, we will follow these detailed steps:  I. Solution Using Parity Argument 1. **Count the number of white squares before and after painting a row or column:**    When flipping the colors of an entire row or column, exactly 12 squares will change color. If there were ( f ) white squares in that row or column before painting, after painting there will be ( 12 - f ) white squares. Notice that ( f ) and ( 12 - f ) have the same parity since the number 12 is even. 2. **Analyze the parity:**    The parity (even or odd nature) of the total number of white squares on the chessboard remains invariant under these operations. This is because each operation changes the count of white squares by an even number (either remains the same or changes by an even number). 3. **Determine the initial condition:**    If the initial number of white squares is odd, it cannot be changed to zero (an even number) despite any number of operations as the parity would remain unchanged.  4. **Conclusion for odd initial white squares:**    If the number of white squares is initially odd, it is impossible to reach a state where all squares are black.    Thus, if initially the number of white squares is odd, it is not possible to have all black squares.     5. **Final Conclusion:**    Hence, all squares on the chessboard cannot be made entirely black if the initial count of white squares is odd. [ boxed{text{No}} ]  II. Counting Possible Transformations 1. **Determine the number of possible transformations:**    Any configuration obtained by flipping rows and columns from an all-black board can be identified by the choice of rows and columns to flip. As there are 12 rows and 12 columns, there are ( 2^{12} ) ways to flip rows and another ( 2^{12} ) ways to flip columns, leading to ( 2^{12} times 2^{12} = 2^{24} ) distinct flipping combinations. 2. **Compare possible configurations to total configurations:**    The total number of colorings of a ( 12 times 12 ) chessboard is ( 2^{144} ), since each of the 144 squares can independently be black or white. 3. **Evaluate insufficiency of distinct transformations:**    Since ( 2^{144} ) (the total number of configurations) is much larger than ( 2^{24} ) (the number of reachable configurations by flipping), there must exist configurations that cannot be transformed into an all-black board through any sequence of row and column flips. 4. **Final Conclusion:**    Therefore, there exist initial configurations from which it is impossible to turn all the squares into black squares.

Since the train leaves by 3:00 P.M., and John arrives by 3:00 P.M., the region of interest is between x = 30 and x = 90. The shaded overlap begins at y = 30 (line starting diagonally from (30, 30) up to (75, 90)) and ends at x = 90, forming a triangular area instead of a parallelogram (since the train's window closes at 90 minutes).  Calculating this triangular area: - Triangular points are (30, 30) to (75, 90) to (90, 90). - Base = 90 - 30 = 60 minutes, Height = 90 - 30 = 60 minutes. - Area = 0.5 times 60 times 60 = 1800 square units. Total possible area where John can arrive is from 0 to 90 for both John and the train, yielding 90 x 90 = 8100 square units.

We know that 55.333333333333336% of the books were not sold, so we can calculate the number of unsold books as follows: Unsold books = Total stock * Percentage of unsold books Unsold books = 900 * 55.333333333333336 / 100 Unsold books = 900 * 0.5533333333333333 Unsold books = 498 (rounded to the nearest whole number since we can't have a fraction of a book) Now, we need to calculate the total number of books sold from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday, and then subtract that from the total stock to find out how many were sold on Wednesday. Books sold from Monday to Friday (excluding Wednesday) = Books sold on Monday + Books sold on Tuesday + Books sold on Thursday + Books sold on Friday Books sold from Monday to Friday (excluding Wednesday) = 75 + 50 + 78 + 135 Books sold from Monday to Friday (excluding Wednesday) = 338 Now, we subtract the number of books sold from Monday to Friday (excluding Wednesday) from the total stock and then subtract the unsold books to find out how many were sold on Wednesday.

The length of side AB, which runs vertically along the y-axis, is the absolute difference in y-coordinates (or just the y-coordinate of B since A is at the origin), which is 5 units. Similarly, side AC, along the x-axis, is 3 units long. Triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle since it aligns with the axes (angle BAC is 90 degrees). The area of a right triangle is calculated by the formula: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{Base} times text{Height} ] Here, AB (5 units) can be considered the height, and AC (3 units) as the base: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 3 times 5 = frac{1}{2} times 15 = 7.5 ] Thus, the area of triangle ABC is 7.5 square units.

A: dfrac{pi }{9} B:  dfrac{2pi }{9} C:  dfrac{pi }{18} D:  dfrac{pi }{24}","output":"To solve the problem, let's follow the transformations step by step: 1. **Translation to the Right by m Units:** The original function is f(x) = sin(3x + frac{pi}{6}). When we translate this graph to the right by m units, the x in the function's argument is replaced by (x - m) because moving to the right involves decreasing the input value by m. This gives us the function after translation: [y = sin(3(x - m) + frac{pi}{6}) = sin(3x - 3m + frac{pi}{6}).] 2. **Stretching the Horizontal Coordinates by 6 Times:** Next, we stretch the horizontal coordinates of each point on the graph by 6 times. This means that for a given y value, the x value that produces it is now 1/6th of what it was before the stretch. To represent this in the function, we replace x with frac{x}{6}, leading to: [y = sinleft(3left(frac{x}{6}right) - 3m + frac{pi}{6}right) = sinleft(frac{1}{2}x - 3m + frac{pi}{6}right).] This is the function g(x) after the transformations. 3. **Condition for g(x) to be an Odd Function:** For g(x) to be an odd function, its formula must satisfy the property g(-x) = -g(x). Since sin(-x) = -sin(x), for the sine function to be odd, its argument must be linear and pass through the origin. This means the constant term in the argument of the sine function in g(x) must be 0 for it to be purely odd. Thus, we set the constant term in g(x)'s argument to 0: [-3m + frac{pi}{6} = 0.] Solving for m, we get: [m = frac{pi}{18}.] This is the minimum value of m for which g(x) is an odd function, as any other adjustments would not satisfy the odd function criteria without altering the function's basic form.

To find this vertex, take the derivative of y with respect to x and set it equal to zero: [ frac{dy}{dx} = 2 - 2x = 0 ] [ x = 1 ] Now substitute x = 1 back into the function to find the maximum value of y: [ y_{text{max}} = 1(2 - 1) = 1 ] So the maximum value of y is boxed{1}, achieved when x = 1.

Let U_1, U_2, ldots, U_n be circles of unit radius centered at the points A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n respectively.

If we imagine translating all the circles U_i such that their centers coincide at a single point O, the combined area of all V_i still lies within a circle of unit radius centered at O. Within this circle, there must exist at least one point B that does not belong to any set V_i, because the total area of M and consequently the union of V_i is less than pi (the area of the circle of radius 1). 5.

But this is just ( AK ) since ( ABCD ) is cyclic, so ( DD' parallel AK ).    - **Case 3:** If ( A ) is the point at infinity along ( ell ), then ( ell ) is the ( A )-angle bisector of ( triangle ABC ).

Therefore, leftlceil frac{n}{101} rightrceil is the smallest integer k such that k geq frac{n}{101}. 2. **Rewriting the Inequality**:    Let k = leftlceil frac{n}{101} rightrceil. Then the inequality becomes:    [    k + 1 > frac{n}{100}.    ] 3. **Expressing k in Terms of n**:    Since k = leftlceil frac{n}{101} rightrceil, we have:    [    k - 1 < frac{n}{101} leq k.    ]    This implies:    [    101(k - 1) < n leq 101k.    ] 4. **Substituting k into the Inequality**:    Substitute k into the inequality k + 1 > frac{n}{100}:    [    k + 1 > frac{n}{100}.    ]    Multiply both sides by 100 to clear the fraction:    [    100(k + 1) > n.    ] 5. **Combining the Inequalities**:    We now have two inequalities:    [    101(k - 1) < n leq 101k,    ]    and    [    n < 100(k + 1).    ]    Combining these, we get:    [    101(k - 1) < n < 100(k + 1).    ] 6. **Finding the Range of n**:    Simplify the combined inequality:    [    101k - 101 < n < 100k + 100.    ]    This can be written as:    [    101k - 101 < n < 100k + 100.    ] 7. **Counting the Valid n**:    For each integer k, the number of integers n that satisfy the inequality is:    [    (100k + 100) - (101k - 101) - 1 = 201 - k.    ]    We need to sum this for all valid k. 8. **Summing Over All k**:    The valid range for k is from 1 to 100 (since n must be a positive integer). Therefore, we sum:    [    sum_{k=1}^{100} (201 - k).    ]    This is an arithmetic series with the first term 201 - 1 = 200 and the last term 201 - 100 = 101. The number of terms is 100.

What is the smallest number of any trees in this grove that must include trees of at least three types?","output":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of trees one must choose to guarantee that at least three different types of trees are present among the chosen trees. 1. **Establish Initial Condition**:     We start with 100 trees consisting of four types: birches, spruces, pines, and aspens. The problem states that any selection of 85 trees will necessarily contain all four types of trees.  2. **Analyze Minimum Requirements**:    First, consider if we assume there are no more than 15 trees of one type, say birches. Then, the remaining 100 - 15 = 85 trees must contain all four tree types, according to the problem statement. This would form a contradiction if there were less than 15 birches, implying that there must be at least 16 birches. This logic applies symmetrically to the other types of trees (spruces, pines, aspens). 3. **Illustrate General Conclusion**:    Every type of tree (birches, spruces, pines, aspens) must be represented by at least 16 trees. So, in any subset of 85 trees, each type definitely appears. 4. **Bound the Calculation for Three Types**:    Now, let’s determine the least number such that among any 69 chosen trees, there are always at least three different types of trees. 5. **Consider Contradiction Approach**:    Assume the chosen subset of 69 trees contains only two types of trees. Then, at least 100 - 69 = 31 trees are not part of this subset. These 31 trees must include at least 16 trees of each of the remaining two types. This gives rise to a contradiction because removing trees belonging to at least two types leaves enough for ensuring all four types in remaining trees. Thus, every possible set of 69 trees must contain more than two types of trees. 6. **Example for Counterverification**:    To verify, consider 34 birches, 34 spruces, 16 pines, and 16 aspens:    - In any subset of 85, all four types are present.    - However, if we take 34 birches and 34 spruces, the subset of these 68 trees consists only of two types (birches and spruces).

A lower variance indicates more stability.

We start by considering the expression inside the exponent, |x|-3. The absolute value ensures that |x| is always non-negative, so the smallest value |x|-3 can take is -3 when |x|=0. Therefore, we have |x|-3geqslant -3. 2. Given the property of exponential functions, as the exponent decreases, the value of {(frac{1}{2})}^{|x|-3} increases. Thus, we have 0＜{(frac{1}{2})}^{|x|-3}≤{(frac{1}{2})}^{-3}. 3. Simplifying the inequality, we find 0＜{(frac{1}{2})}^{|x|-3}≤8.

Applying the same substitution (a = 10^b), we rewrite the inequality:    [    100 < (10^b)^x < 1000    ]    which simplifies to:    [    100 < 10^{bx} < 1000    ]    In terms of exponents, this inequality becomes:    [    2 < bx < 3    ]    since (10^2 = 100) and (10^3 = 1000). 6. **Step 6: Determine the number of solutions**    The inequality (2 < bx < 3) is also an interval of length 1. Given how the earlier interval (1 < bx < 2) resulted in 5 solutions, we deduce that (2 < bx < 3) would behave similarly.

This further simplifies to c^2 - 2sqrt{3}ca + 3a^2 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation for c, we get c = sqrt{3}a. Thus, the eccentricity of the hyperbola is e = frac{c}{a} = sqrt{3}.

Given that f(x+2)=f(x)-f(1), we can deduce that f(1)=f(3)-f(1), which implies f(3)=2f(1).  For x in [2,3], we have f(x)=-2x^2+12x-18. Therefore, f(3)=-2(3)^2+12(3)-18=0. Since f(3)=2f(1), we get f(1)=0. Thus, the function f(x) satisfies f(x+2)=f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}. This means the function is periodic with a period of 2.  Given the period and the even nature of the function, the area of the closed figure formed by the lines x=0, x=3, y=0, and the curve y=f(x) can be calculated by finding the area under the curve from x=0 to x=2 and doubling it (to account for the symmetry about the y-axis). For x in [2,3], the function is given by f(x)=-2x^2+12x-18. To find the area from x=0 to x=2, we consider the symmetry and realize that the function's behavior from x=0 to x=2 mirrors its behavior from x=2 to x=3 due to its periodicity and even nature. Therefore, the area under the curve from x=2 to x=3 is the same as from x=1 to x=2. The area under the curve from x=2 to x=3 is given by the integral of f(x) from 2 to 3, which is the negative of the area we seek (since f(x) is negative in this interval). The area from x=2 to x=3 is calculated as follows: [ int_{2}^{3} (-2x^2+12x-18) , dx = left[ -frac{2}{3}x^3 + 6x^2 - 18x right]_{2}^{3} = (-18 + 54 - 54) - (-frac{16}{3} + 24 - 36) = 2 ] Therefore, the area of the closed figure formed by the lines x=0, x=3, y=0, and the curve y=f(x) is boxed{2}."},{"instruction":"Zayne sells bracelets for 5 each and two for 8.

Let ( x ) be the number of sets that have a sum of 20, and ( y ) be the number of sets that have a sum of 19. Clearly, ( x + y = 12 ).          The total sum of these 12 sets is then:     [     20x + 19y     ]     Given that the total sum must be 234:     [     20x + 19y = 234     ] 5. **Solve the equation**: We solve for ( x ) and ( y ).

This means there exists a line through the center of the square that does not intersect the triangle. 2. **Convexity Argument**: If every line through the center intersects the triangle, then the center must lie within the convex hull of the triangle. Since the triangle is a convex figure, this implies the center must lie inside the triangle or on its boundary. 3. **Constructing a Convex Quadrilateral**: Consider two lines through the center of the square. These lines will intersect the sides of the triangle at four points, forming a convex quadrilateral. Since the center of the square is inside this quadrilateral, it must also be inside the triangle. 4. **Regions and Intersection**: Draw a line through the center of the square. This line divides the square into two equal regions. Since the triangle has sides of length at least 1, it must span across both regions.  5. **Concyclic Quadrilaterals**: The quadrilaterals formed by the intersections of the triangle with the lines through the center are concyclic, meaning they can be inscribed in circles of diameter sqrt{2}/2. Since the sides of the triangle are at least 1, they must intersect both regions. 6. **Contradiction**: If one vertex of the triangle lies in the blue region, the next vertex must lie in the yellow region, and so on.

The remainder is a number formed by reversing the digits of the divisor.

What are the dividend and the divisor?","output":"1. Let the three-digit number be represented as ( 100x + 10y + z ) and the two-digit number as ( 10u + v ), where ( x, y, z, u, ) and ( v ) are digits (0-9). 2. According to the problem, we have the following conditions:    - The quotient when dividing the three-digit number by the two-digit number is the sum of the digits of the divisor.    - The remainder is the number obtained by reversing the digits of the divisor.    - When multiplying the remainder by the quotient and adding the divisor, the result is the reverse of the original three-digit number. 3. Let's translate these conditions into mathematical expressions:    [    100x + 10y + z = (10u + v) cdot (u + v) + (10v + u)    ]    [    100z + 10y + x = (10v + u) cdot (u + v) + (10u + v)    ] 4. Noting that the remainder must be smaller than the divisor, we have:    [    u > v    ] 5. Subtracting one equation from the other gives:    [    99(x - z) = 9(u - v) cdot (u + v) + 9(v - u)    ]    Simplifying further, we get:    [    99(x - z) = 9(u - v) (u + v - 1)    ] 6. Dividing both sides by 9, we obtain:    [    11(x - z) = (u - v)(u + v - 1)    ] 7. The expression on the right side must be divisible by 11. Since ( u - v ) is a difference of digits and hence less than 10, it cannot be divisible by 11. Therefore, ( u + v - 1 ) must be divisible by 11. Given ( u ) and ( v ) are digits, ( u + v ) is at most 18, so the only value that fits is:    [    u + v - 1 = 11 implies u + v = 12    ] 8. Substituting back for our first equation:    [    100x + 10y + z = (10u + v) cdot 12 + 10v + u = (9u + 12) cdot 12 + 120 implies 264 + 99u    ]     9.

Substituting ( u = 7 ) and ( v = 5 ):     [     10u + v = 75 implies (10u + v) cdot 12 + 10v + u = 957     ]     [     10v + u = 57; (10v + u) cdot 12 + 10u + v = 759     ] 11. We confirm our three-digit number is 957 and reverse of digit digits is 759.

Let's list the numbers: (1, 1, 1, 3, 3). 2. When we remove one of the numbers equal to 1:    - The remaining numbers are (1, 1, 3, 3).    - These can be split into two groups: ( (1, 3) ) and ( (1, 3) ), both having sum 4. 3.

Thus, the numbers (1, 1, 1, 3, 3) form a nearly-balanced sequence.  Part (b) To show that if a balanced sequence has three equal terms, then all five numbers must be equal, let's assume the sequence has three equal terms: 1.

Removing (y) leads to ( x + x = x + z ), which implies (x = z). Hence, ( x = z ). Therefore, all five numbers must be (x). Thus, the sequence must be ( x, x, x, x, x ), and all numbers are equal.  Part (c) We need to prove that if a balanced sequence ((a, b, c, d, e)) satisfies ( e + c = b + d ) and ( e + a = c + d ), and ( 0 < a leq b leq c leq d leq e ), then all five numbers are equal: 1.

The amount of the tank filled by pipe B in the first T/2 minutes is: (T/2) * (1/40) When both pipes A and B are used together, their combined rate is: (1/60) + (1/40) = (1/24) of the tank per minute.

With 2n + 1 and 2n - 1 being both odd and relatively prime, and their product being three times a square, one must be a square and the other three times a square. It is impossible for 2n - 1 to be three times a square as it results in 2n + 1 being a square congruent to 2 modulo 3, which is impossible. Therefore, 2n - 1 is a square, say b^2. Now, realize 2n + 99 also needs to be a square, say a^2. The equation modifies to (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 = 100. Looking for even a + b and a - b (as their product is even), the likely candidates by parity and factorization of 100 are a+b=50 and a-b=2.

Since each angle alpha is given between 0^circ to 180^circ, the total length required to form set F when rotated must cover 360^circ at least once. 3. **System of arcs:**        Suppose we arrange the arcs on the circle length such that the distance between their nearest ends equates to frac{360^circ}{n}. Each arc is placed in such a way that one full cycle covers up without gaps as many times as necessary rotations. 4. **Formally ensuring intersection given any rotation:**        To formally prove that any rotation of an arc by alpha degrees intersects with some part of the previous arc, we need each arc's length frac{180^circ}{n} ensuring all points phi values result in frac{360^circ}{n} cycle. 5. **Proof by assumption:**    Imagine having two identical copies of circles on which identical arcs of length frac{180^circ}{n} are placed.

To determine when this is an integer, we can rewrite it in terms of integers:    [    left(a+frac{1}{2}right)^n + left(b+frac{1}{2}right)^n = left(frac{2a+1}{2}right)^n + left(frac{2b+1}{2}right)^n    ]    Multiplying through by (2^n) to clear the denominators, we get:    [    2^n left(left(frac{2a+1}{2}right)^n + left(frac{2b+1}{2}right)^nright) = (2a+1)^n + (2b+1)^n    ]    Therefore, we need (2^n) to divide ((2a+1)^n + (2b+1)^n). 3. **Checking for Small Values of (n)**:    - For (n = 1):      [      (2a+1)^1 + (2b+1)^1 = 2a + 1 + 2b + 1 = 2(a + b + 1)      ]      Clearly, (2^1) divides (2(a + b + 1)), so (n = 1) works. 4. **Assuming (n geq 2)**:    We need to show that (n) must be odd. Assume (n) is even, say (n = 2k). Then:    [    (2a+1)^{2k} + (2b+1)^{2k}    ]    Since (2a+1) and (2b+1) are both odd, any odd number raised to an even power is congruent to 1 modulo 4:    [    (2a+1)^{2k} equiv 1 pmod{4} quad text{and} quad (2b+1)^{2k} equiv 1 pmod{4}    ]    Therefore:    [    (2a+1)^{2k} + (2b+1)^{2k} equiv 1 + 1 = 2 pmod{4}    ]    This implies that (4 nmid (2a+1)^{2k} + (2b+1)^{2k}), which is a contradiction since (2^n = 2^{2k} geq 4). Hence, (n) cannot be even. 5. **Considering (n) is Odd**:    Let (n) be odd. We need to show that (2^n) divides ((2a+1)^n + (2b+1)^n). We can write:    [    (2a+1)^n + (2b+1)^n = (2a+1 + 2b+1) left( sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2a+1)^k (2b+1)^{n-1-k} right)    ]    Simplifying the first term:    [    2a+1 + 2b+1 = 2(a+b+1)    ]    Therefore:    [    (2a+1)^n + (2b+1)^n = 2(a+b+1) left( sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2a+1)^k (2b+1)^{n-1-k} right)    ]    Since (n) is odd, the sum inside the parentheses is odd.

Let (v_2(a+b+1)) denote the highest power of 2 dividing (a+b+1). Then:    [    n-1 leq v_2(a+b+1)    ]    Therefore:    [    n leq v_2(a+b+1) + 1    ]    This shows that (n) is bounded above by a fixed number, hence the set of all such (n) is finite.

The merchant is preparing to offer a discount on the selling price, but the profit margin must not be less than 10%. Find the maximum discount rate that can be offered.","output":"To solve for the maximum discount rate that can be offered while maintaining a profit margin of at least 10%, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information. Let x represent the discount rate (as a percentage) that the merchant can offer on the selling price of the item. The original selling price of the item is 5 yuan, and the cost price is 4 yuan. 1. The selling price after applying the discount will be 5 times (1 - frac{x}{100}) yuan, because a discount of x% reduces the price by x% of its original value. 2. The profit after the discount is applied will then be the selling price after the discount minus the cost price, which gives us 5 times (1 - frac{x}{100}) - 4 yuan. 3. To maintain a minimum profit margin of 10% on the cost price, the profit must be at least 4 times 10% = 0.4 yuan. Therefore, we set up the inequality 5 times (1 - frac{x}{100}) - 4 geq 0.4. 4. Simplifying the inequality, we get 5 - 5 times frac{x}{100} - 4 geq 0.4 Rightarrow 1 - frac{5x}{100} geq 0.4. 5. Further simplifying, we have 1 - 0.4 geq frac{5x}{100} Rightarrow 0.6 geq frac{5x}{100}. 6. Solving for x, we find frac{0.6 times 100}{5} = x Rightarrow 12 = x. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the calculation. The correct approach to find the maximum discount rate while ensuring at least a 10% profit margin should involve correctly applying the discount to the selling price and comparing the profit to the required minimum profit margin. Let's correct the steps to align with the initial solution's intent but with accurate calculations: 1. The profit margin must not be less than 10% of the cost price, so the profit must be at least 4 times 10% = 0.4 yuan. 2. The selling price after discount can still ensure a profit of 0.4 yuan, so 5 - 5 times frac{x}{100} - 4 geq 0.4 was the intended inequality to ensure a minimum 10% profit margin, which simplifies to ensuring the discount does not exceed a certain percentage. 3. Correcting the approach: The profit with the discount applied should ensure a profit of at least 0.4 yuan over the cost. The equation should directly relate the discount to the selling price and ensure the profit margin is met. Given the discrepancy and the need to adhere closely to the provided solution, let's clarify the correct interpretation: The maximum discount rate that can be offered while ensuring a minimum 10% profit margin is calculated by ensuring the selling price after discount minus the cost price is at least 10% of the cost price. The provided solution's final answer and calculations seem to have a mistake in the formulation of how the discount rate affects the selling price and profit calculation. To correctly find the maximum discount rate while ensuring a 10% profit margin, one would need to correctly apply the discount to the selling price, ensure the profit is at least 10% of the cost price, and solve for the discount rate x accordingly. However, based on the provided solution steps, there's a need to correct the mathematical approach to accurately reflect these considerations. Given the constraints and aiming to adhere to the provided solution's intent, it's crucial to note that the correct maximum discount rate calculation should ensure the selling price after discount yields at least a 10% profit over the cost price. The provided solution's final step and answer suggest a maximum discount rate, but the calculation steps leading to this conclusion require correction to accurately reflect the relationship between the discount rate, selling price, and required profit margin. Therefore, the correct interpretation and calculation to find the maximum discount rate while ensuring a 10% profit margin would involve accurately applying the discount to the selling price, ensuring the profit meets the minimum requirement, and solving for x. The provided solution's final answer indicates a maximum discount rate, but the calculation steps and explanation need adjustment to accurately align with these requirements.

Substituting this back into the expression gives us: [ frac{x}{(x+1)(x-1)} cdot frac{-(x+1)}{x} ] Since the x in the numerator and the denominator cancel out, and the (x+1) terms also cancel out, we are left with: [ -frac{1}{x-1} ] 2. **Evaluate the Expression:** Given x=tan 45^{circ}+cos 30^{circ}, we know that tan 45^{circ} = 1 and cos 30^{circ} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.

From the original solution, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find that s_2^2 = 2r^2. Thus, s_2 = rsqrt{2}, and the area of this square is s_2^2 = 2r^2. The ratio of the areas of the two squares is then dfrac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} = dfrac{r^2/4}{2r^2} = dfrac{1}{8}.

Therefore, based on the definition of f(x) and the fact that log_2 6 is less than 3, we can rewrite f(log_2 6) as f(log_2 6 + 1).  Now, we consider the new argument log_2 6 + 1.

This statement fails to recognize the presence of all three altitudes in a right triangle. - **Statement C**: Every triangle, regardless of its type (acute, right, or obtuse), has at least one altitude inside the triangle.

We will use a certain strategy to achieve this.     - In the first step, we select all piles that have more than 63 pebbles and remove 64 pebbles from each of these piles. This ensures that the remaining number of pebbles in any pile is at most 63. In other words, no pile has more than 63 pebbles left.          Let's denote the number of pebbles in the piles after this step as x_i' leq 63 for all piles. 2. **Step 2:** Next, we remove 32 pebbles from appropriate piles (those which still have more than 31 pebbles). This step ensures that every pile now has at most 31 pebbles remaining.     After this step, we have x_i'' leq 31 for all piles. 3. **Step 3:** We continue by removing 16 pebbles from each pile where possible (piles that have more than 15 pebbles). After this, every pile has at most 15 pebbles remaining.     The number of pebbles in the piles becomes x_i''' leq 15 for all piles. 4. **Step 4 to 7:** The steps follow similarly:         - In the 4th step, remove 8 pebbles from each of the remaining piles with more than 7 pebbles, leaving at most 7 pebbles per pile:            [       x_i'''' leq 7 quad text{for all piles}       ]     - In the 5th step, remove 4 pebbles from each of the remaining piles with more than 3 pebbles, leaving at most 3 pebbles per pile:              [       x_i''''' leq 3 quad text{for all piles}       ]     - In the 6th step, remove 2 pebbles from each of the remaining piles with more than 1 pebble, leaving at most 1 pebble per pile:              [       x_i'''''' leq 1 quad text{for all piles}       ]     - In the 7th step, remove the last pebble from each pile, leaving 0 pebbles in all piles:              [       x_i''''''' = 0 quad text{for all piles}       ]    By following this method, we have demonstrated that all piles can be reduced to 0 pebbles in exactly 7 steps. 5. **Proof that 6 steps are insufficient:**     Suppose it were possible to remove all the pebbles in just 6 steps. During these 6 steps, let's consider that we remove a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{6} pebbles from selected piles in each respective step.      - Assign a 6-digit binary number to each pile based on the steps in which we removed pebbles from that pile. Let the i-th digit be 1 if we removed a_i pebbles from the pile in the i-th step, and 0 if not.     - For instance, if the binary number is overline{x_{6} x_{5} x_{4} x_{3} x_{2} x_{1}}, it implies that we removed x_{1} cdot a_{1} + x_{2} cdot a_{2} + cdots + x_{6} cdot a_{6} pebbles from that pile across all steps.     Each different pile size originally numbered from 1 to 100 uniquely corresponds to a distinct binary code based on the steps of reduction. However, a 6-digit binary number can represent at most 2^{6} = 64 different values. Since we have 100 different piles, we need at least 100 different binary codes, which exceeds the capacity of 6-digit binary numbers.

This forms the block ( bbabaa ). 3. **Reduction Process:**    - Observe that within the block ( bbabaa ), there are two identical double-digit pairs ( baba ).     - We can remove these pairs since they are identical, leaving us with the combination ( ba ). 4. **Swapping Pairs:**    - This process effectively shows that any adjacent pair of digits ( ab ) can be swapped to ( ba ) by using allowed operations. 5. **General Reduction:**    - By continuously applying the pair reduction/swap process, we can place any two identical digits next to each other regardless of their initial positions.    - Each reduction operation (deleting identical pairs) does not alter the overall parity of the number of digits. 6. **Limitations and Constraints:**    - There are 6 different digits in use.    - Any addition or deletion of digits retains an odd number of digits in the transformation process. This means that we can reduce the number to at most a single digit multiple times. 7. **Final Reduction Steps:**    - After sufficient successive deletions, the number will be reduced from 2019 digits to a number with significantly fewer digits.    - A combination of two identical digits can always be deleted as they arise adjacent to each other upon swapping. 8. **Conclusion:**    - Continuing the reduction process will potentially reduce the number to a 5-digit number.    - Considering 5 different digits ( 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ) or ( 9 ), a 5-digit number will be less than ( 10^5 ).    - Further reductions ensure that at least one pair of identical digits can always be adjacent for deletion, leading us to an even smaller number.

Given that when the value of x increases by 1, the value of the polynomial decreases by 2, we can express this relationship algebraically. Let's denote the polynomial as P(x). Then, according to the given condition, we have: [P(x + 1) = P(x) - 2] To find a polynomial that satisfies this condition, we can make an educated guess based on the relationship. Since the polynomial decreases linearly (by a constant amount) as x increases, a linear polynomial (a polynomial of degree 1) is a good candidate. A general form of a linear polynomial is ax + b.  Substituting x + 1 into the polynomial, we get: [P(x + 1) = a(x + 1) + b = ax + a + b] According to the condition, this should equal P(x) - 2, where P(x) = ax + b. Therefore, we have: [ax + a + b = ax + b - 2] Simplifying this equation, we find that a must equal -2 for the equation to hold true for all x. Therefore, the polynomial can be of the form: [P(x) = -2x + b] Where b is any constant.

Consider three transformations on this square: left(1right)L: counterclockwise rotation by 90^{circ}. left(2right)R: clockwise rotation by 90^{circ}. left(3right)S: reflection about the origin. The above three operations can transform the square into itself, but the positions of points A, B, C, D will change. For example, after applying transformation R to the original square, vertex A moves from (1,1) to (1,1), and then after applying transformation S, A moves to (1,1). Denote the sequence of k transformations on the original square as a_{1}a_{2}cdots a_{k}, where a_{i}in {L,R,S}, i=1,2,cdots,k. If after k transformations, the positions of the vertices return to their original locations, we call such a transformation a kidentity transformation. For example, RRS is a 3identity transformation. There are _______ 3identity transformations in total; for a positive integer n, there are _______ nidentity transformations in total.","output":"To analyze the problem, we start by identifying the 3-identity transformations. Given the operations L, R, and S, we note that any 3-identity transformation must include S to ensure the vertices can return to their original positions. This results in the following possible combinations: LLS, LSL, SLL, RRS, RSR, and SRR. Therefore, there are boxed{6} 3-identity transformations. Next, we consider the general case for an n-identity transformation. We assign numerical values to the operations: L as 1, S as 2, and R as 3. The condition for an n-identity transformation is that the sum p+2q+3r (where p, q, and r are the counts of L, S, and R respectively) must be a multiple of 4.  To find the number of n-identity transformations, we analyze the remainder when the sum p+2q+3r is divided by 4. Let a_{n}, b_{n}, c_{n}, and d_{n} represent the number of cases where the remainder is 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, after n transformations. We derive the following relationships based on the possible outcomes of the nth transformation: - a_{n}=b_{n-1}+c_{n-1}+d_{n-1} - b_{n}=a_{n-1}+c_{n-1}+d_{n-1} - c_{n}=a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}+d_{n-1} - d_{n}=a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}+c_{n-1} Adding the last three equations, we obtain b_{n}+c_{n}+d_{n}=3a_{n-1}+2(b_{n-1}+c_{n-1}+d_{n-1}). Substituting into the first equation, we find that a_{n+1}=2a_{n}+3a_{n-1}, which simplifies to a_{n+1}+a_{n}=3(a_{n}+a_{n-1}). This indicates that {a_{n+1}+a_{n}} forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 3. Given that a_{3}=6 and a_{2}=3 (from the 2-identity transformations LR, RL, SS), we have a_{3}+a_{2}=9. Therefore, {a}_{n+1}+{a}_{n}=({a}_{3}+{a}_{2})times{3}^{n-2}=9times{3}^{n-2}={3}^{n}. Multiplying both sides by (-1)^{n+1} and applying the summing method, we derive {a}_{n}=frac{3cdot(-1)^{n}+{3}^{n}}{4}.
