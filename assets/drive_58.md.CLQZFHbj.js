This process takes place in chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll (a green pigment) that absorbs light energy. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide (CO2) is taken in from the air and water (H2O) is taken in from the soil. In the chloroplasts, the light energy is used to split water molecules into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen ions (H+). The oxygen is released into the air as a byproduct, while the hydrogen ions are used to power the production of glucose. The glucose produced by photosynthesis is used by the plant as a source of energy for cellular respiration, and excess glucose can be stored in the form of starch. Overall, photosynthesis is a vital process for the survival of most living organisms, as it enables the production of food and oxygen in our ecosystem."},{"instruction":"(CNN) The United Nations has warned that the world is facing a crisis in the supply of freshwater, which is essential to human life and the environment.

Authorities say that Salazar was caught after the police tracked him down using the car's GPS system. He was arrested and charged with burglary, grand theft, and possession of stolen property.

The man, identified as Abdul-Majeed Marouf Ahmed Alani is accused of tampering with a navigation system on a plane that was scheduled to fly from Miami to the Bahamas with 150 passengers on board. Alani was arrested on Thursday, August 29th, and appeared in court on Friday, August 30th. He was charged with \\"willfully damaging, destroying, disabling, or wrecking an aircraft\\" and faces up to 20 years in prison. According to the criminal complaint, Alani admitted to tampering with the plane's navigation system in order to \\"cause a delay or have the flight canceled in anticipation of obtaining overtime work.\\" Alani's plan was foiled when another mechanic discovered the tampering before the plane took off. The mechanic noticed a discrepancy in the FOH (Forward Overhead) panel and notified the security team. The plane in question was a Boeing 737-800, and it had been scheduled to fly from Miami to the Bahamas on July 17th, 2019.

The sum ( p + q + r ) changes by 1 in each step because we always replace two numbers with one number.     3. **Parity Consideration**:    - Begin by noting that the initial count of each digit must have certain parities (even or odd). The parity (oddness or evenness) of ( p, q, ) and ( r ) will change through each step.    - When two different numbers are removed and replaced by a third number, the parities of ( p, q, ) and ( r ) are altered. 4. **Final Step Analysis**:    When there is only one number left on the blackboard, among ( p, q, r ), one must be 1 and the others must be 0.

We need to demonstrate that after moving, it's possible to paint the 1000 houses in three different colors such that no individual ends up in a house of the same color as their original house. To do this, we use mathematical induction.  Base Case: 1. **Base Case for n = 2 and n = 3:**    - For **n=2**:        - Consider two houses and two individuals moving houses. Since there are only two houses, the only movement is swapping houses.        - We can paint the first house Blue (B) and the second house Green (G).        - After swapping, the person originally in the Blue house moves to the Green house, and vice versa. Thus, no individual ends up in a house painted the same color as the original.       - For **n=3**:        - Consider three houses and three individuals moving houses.        - If the individuals move in a cyclic manner (1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1), each individual moves to a different house.        - We will paint the three houses with three different colors, for instance, Blue (B), Green (G), and Red (R).        - Since each person has moved in a cyclic manner, no two houses out of the original and new houses will share the same color. That is, the person from B will move to G, G to R, and R to B.  Induction Hypothesis: 2. **Induction Hypothesis:**    - Assume the statement is true for all integers n less than k. That is, it is possible to paint the houses such that no person ends up in a house of the same color as their original house for any n<k.  Inductive Step: 3. **Inductive Step for n=k:**    - We now need to prove that the statement is true for n = k.    - Consider n=k houses and individuals. Number these houses from 1 to k.    - Now, look at the movement: pick house 1, and let’s define house 2 as the new house for the individual from house 1. Continue defining this way until someone ends up back in house 1.    - This will form a permutation cycle. Once this cycle is formed, we get a whole cycle comprising a certain number (m) houses (specific (m leq k)).    - Paint house 1 one of the three colors (e.g., Blue). Using the sequence of Blue, Green, Red, proceed sequentially through the houses in this cycle.    - If the cycle completes before all houses are painted (i.e., (m < k)), then use the inductive hypothesis to color the remaining k-m houses.  Conclusion: 4. **Conclusion for all n = k:**    - By the inductive hypothesis, ensure no two adjacent elements in the cycle have the same color as the starting house.    - Repeat, ensuring all k houses are painted such that no person ends up in a house of the same color as their original house.    - Thus, by induction, the initial hypothesis holds true for all integers n geq 2. # Conclusion: Thus, it is possible to paint the 1000 houses in three colors as per the given statement.

Consider an arbitrary triangle triangle ABC with an incircle touching its sides at points D, E, and F. It is known that the lines connecting these points of tangency to the opposite vertices (i.e., A to D, B to E, and C to F) are concurrent at a single point, called the Gergonne point. 2. Now, let's extend the same concept to a tetrahedron. Let ABCD be a tetrahedron with an insphere touching its faces at points A_1, B_1, C_1, and D_1. We are to prove that the lines connecting these tangency points to the vertices, i.e., AA_1, BB_1, CC_1, and DD_1, are concurrent if and only if the tetrahedron is isogonal, meaning each edge subtends an angle of 120^circ at the tangency points of the insphere. 3. First, assume that ABCD is an isogonal tetrahedron. According to the properties of an isogonal tetrahedron:    - Any edge, e.g., BC, subtends the same angle at the points where the insphere is tangent to the opposite face, e.g., the face ABD. Thus, the angle angle BA_1C is 120^circ.    - Consequently, angle B_1AC =120^circ, where B_1 is the tangency point on face ACD and angle BB_1C = 120^circ . Given this symmetry, we can assume:      AA_1, BB_1, CC_1, text{ and } DD_1 text{ are concurrent lines.} 4. To show that these lines intersect in a common point, we consider the properties of their intersection within the plane BC. By the previous observations:    - The segment DA_1 bisects the angle angle B_1AC due to the tangency of the insphere.    - Because of the equal tangency properties, the bisected tangents divide angle AA_1 and angle BA_1 consistently. 5. Similarly, analogous arguments can be made for other faces and edges, leading to the conclusion that this point of concurrency lies on all transversals text{AA}_1, text{BB}_1, text{CC}_1, and text{DD}_1 if the tetrahedron is isogonal. Thus, they all intersect at one point.  6. Conversely, if the tetrahedron is not isogonal, then the angle subtended by edges of tetrahedron at the points of tangency would not all be equal to 120^circ. By Bang's Theorem, since not all angles are 120^circ, transversals ( AA_1 ) and ( DD_1 ) will not intersect at a common point. Instead, they will lie in different planes and thus will form a skew configuration. Consequently, not all transversals can intersect at a point. # Conclusion: Therefore, the lines connecting the tangency points of the insphere of a tetrahedron to the opposite vertices are concurrent if and only if the tetrahedron is isogonal, meaning all edges subtend angles of 120^circ at the points of tangency. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"A conference center has six rooms.

The third quadrant is characterized by negative x and y values. For the line not to enter this quadrant, we need to ensure two conditions based on the slope (m-2) and the y-intercept (m-1): 1. **Slope Condition (m-2<0):** The slope of the line, given by m-2, must be negative. This ensures that as x increases, y decreases, which is a characteristic of lines that do not enter the third quadrant when starting from a positive y-intercept. Mathematically, this condition is expressed as:    m-2<0 implies m<2 2. **Y-intercept Condition (m-1geq 0):** The y-intercept of the line, given by m-1, must be non-negative.

Consider smaller sets and see when the condition holds. For instance:    - Choose ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( a ) and ( b ) are co-prime. This means (gcd(a, b) = 1) and therefore (|a - b| = 1), which only holds for consecutive integers.    - Choose any integer ( a = 1, b = 2 ). Clearly, ( |1 - 2| = 1 = gcd(1, 2) ). 3. **Observation with Specific Construction:**        One specific example is the set of consecutive integers starting from 1. Consider the following:    - If we take ( a = 1, 2, ldots, 2020 ):      - For any two integers ( a ) and ( b ), ( gcd(a, b) = 1 ) if they are consecutive.      - This helps us formulating the series of pairs that follow the pattern ( |a - (a+1)| = 1 ). 4. **Test with More General Sets:**        If we extend this to a bigger set, each smaller group within 2020 integers must follow the previous observation to maintain the ( gcd ) and difference relationship. 5. **Verification by Testing Larger Set Construction:**        Constructing sets with larger groups while maintaining distinct integers and observing above patterns continuously fits within broader examples. By verifying steps for more set sizes up to 2020 integers, probability calculation matches the assertions from simplified test:    - Incrementally confirming the desired property ( |a - b| = gcd(a, b) ). 6. **Combining All Pairs to General Conclusion:**        Bringing each verified sub-pattern collectively for a combined aggregation to cover 2020 integers demonstrates the negligible difference making ( gcd(a, b) = |a - b| ). 7. **Conclusion:** Based on outlined steps: This confirms that existence of 2020 different integers satisfying is feasible via logical assertions.

Geometrically, this means that (z) lies on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining (z_1) and (z_2). Therefore, the locus of (z) is a straight line.  2. **Consider (lambda neq 1):**     - When (lambda neq 1), we rewrite the given equation as:       [       left|z - z_{1}right| = lambda left|z - z_{2}right|       ]     - Without loss of generality, let's assume (lambda > 1).

We can simplify their computation by focusing on whether each number is odd or even. Writing a row solely by the parity of its contents: - 0 represents an even number. - 1 represents an odd number. The addition rule simplifies: - (0) (even) + (0) (even) = (0) (even) - (0) (even) + (1) (odd) = (1) (odd) - (1) (odd) + (1) (odd) = (0) (even) This simulation can be handled up to the 50th row, but for brevity, the pattern shows that rows are entirely even (excluding the 1's at each end) exactly when the row index is a power of 2.

Let ( Q ) be a point on the ray ( PA_1 ) that is inside the cube.    - By definition, ( Q ) cannot be on the segment ( PA_1 ), so ( Q ) must be on the extension of ( PA_1 ) beyond ( A_1 ). 4. **Splitting Space by Cube's Planes**:    - The cube’s planes passing through ( A_1 ) divide space into eight regions (right-angled trihedral regions).    - For ( P ) to see ( A_1 ), ( P ) must be in the trihedral region that does not contain any interior points of the cube accessible along ( PA_1 ). 5. **Generalizing to All Vertices**:    - By similar logic, each vertex ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_8 ) can be associated with one such trihedral region where ( P ) can be placed to see that specific vertex. 6. **Non-Intersection of Trihedral Regions**:    - These trihedral regions are mutually exclusive: if ( P ) is in the region corresponding to one vertex, it is not in any region corresponding to any of the other vertices.    - Each region only allows ( P ) to see one specific vertex. 7. **Conclusion**:    - Since these trihedral regions do not overlap and each is isolated from the others in space, ( P ) can be in at most one such region at any given time. Hence, from a point ( P ), one can see at most one vertex of the cube.

Let's find the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = ax - (1 + a^2) + frac{a}{x} = a left( x - frac{1}{a} right) - frac{a^2}{x}.  To discuss monotonicity, we partition our analysis depending on the value of a: 1. If a leq 0, then f'(x) = a left(x - frac{1}{a} right) - frac{a^2}{x} leq 0 for all x > 0.    Therefore, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval (0, +infty) and has no intervals of increase. 2. If a > 0, setting f'(x) = 0 yields x = frac{1}{a} or x = a.        a. When a = 1, we have f'(x) = (x - 1)^2 / x geq 0 for x > 0.    In this case, f(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (0, +infty) and has no intervals of decrease.        b. If 0 < frac{1}{a} < a (i.e., a > 1), then f'(x) > 0 on (0, frac{1}{a}) and (a, +infty),    and f'(x) < 0 on (frac{1}{a}, a). Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, frac{1}{a}) and (a, +infty),    and monotonically decreasing on (frac{1}{a}, a).    c. If 0<a<frac{1}{a} (i.e., 0<a<1), then f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, a) and (frac{1}{a}, +infty),    and monotonically decreasing on (a, frac{1}{a}). (Ⅱ) To prove when a = -1 and b = 0 that f(x) + e^x > -frac{1}{2}x^2 - x + 1, consider the function g(x) = e^x - ln{x} - 1 for x > 0. We want to show that g(x) > 0 for all x > 0. The derivatives of g(x) are: g'(x) = e^x - frac{1}{x}, quad g''(x) = e^x + frac{1}{x^2} > 0. Since g''(x) > 0, g'(x) is an increasing function on (0, +infty). Furthermore, g'(frac{1}{2}) = sqrt{e} - 2 < 0 and g'(1) = e - 1 > 0. Therefore, there exists a unique x_0 in (frac{1}{2}, 1) such that g'(x_0) = 0 and e^{x_0} = frac{1}{x_0}.  Hence, g(x) is decreasing on (0, x_0) and increasing on (x_0, +infty). The minimum value of g(x) is boxed{g(x)_{min} = g(x_0) = e^{x_0}-ln{x_0}-1 = frac{1}{x_0} + {x_0} - 1 geq 2 - 1 = 1}. Since g(x)_{min} > 0, the inequality is proved. An alternative proof for (Ⅱ) is to show that x - 1 geq ln{x} for x > 0. Define h(x) = x - 1 - ln{x}, and note that h'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x} = frac{x - 1}{x}. This derivative is zero if x = 1.  Since h(x) is decreasing on (0, 1) and increasing on (1, +infty), we have h(x)_{min} = h(1) = 0. Hence, h(x) geq h(1), leading to x - 1 geq ln{x}. This implies that ln(1 + x) leq x and therefore e^{x} geq x + 1 > 1 + ln{x}. As a result, we have e^x > 1 + ln{x}, and the inequality e^x - ln{x} - 1 > 0 is verified. qed"},{"instruction":"Of the 84 parents who attended a meeting at a school, 25 volunteered to supervise children during the school picnic and some volunteered both to supervise children during the picnic and to bring refreshments to the picnic.

Translating a point to the right on the Cartesian coordinate system means we add to its x-coordinate. Since we are moving 3 units to the right, we add 3 to the x-coordinate of point A. 3. **Calculating New Coordinates**: The x-coordinate of point A is 1. Adding 3 units to this gives us 1 + 3 = 4. The y-coordinate does not change because the translation is horizontal, so it remains 2. 4. **Point B's Coordinates**: Combining the new x and y coordinates, we find that point B is located at (4,2).

To understand why, note that each golden term ( b ) must be divisible by the term ( a ) immediately before it. Therefore:    [    a leq frac{b}{2} leq frac{2021}{2} < 1011    ]        This implies that ( a ) must be one of the first 1010 numbers in the sequence, i.e., ( a in {1, 2, 3, ldots, 1010} ). Therefore, there can be at most 1010 different original terms corresponding to golden terms.

Therefore, the angle at time (4: M) is given by:     [     theta = left|120^circ + 0.5M - 6M right|     = left|120 - 5.5M right|     ]     We need this angle to be exactly (120^circ), the same as at 4:00 PM. 3. **Solve for (M):**     The equation we need to solve is:     [     left|120 - 5.5M right| = 120     ]     This gives us two possible cases:     [     120 - 5.5M = 120  quad text{or} quad 120 - 5.5M = -120     ]     - For the first case:       [       120 - 5.5M = 120       ]       [       -5.5M = 0 quad Rightarrow quad M = 0       ]       However, this is just 4:00 PM, which is the same point in time.     - For the second case:       [       120 - 5.5M = -120       ]       [       240 = 5.5M       ]       [       M = frac{240}{5.5} = frac{2400}{55} = frac{480}{11} approx 43.overline{63}       ]       Since we are looking for the previous instance when this angle was the same, we convert the minutes before 4:00 PM: 4. **Find the minutes before 4:00 PM:**     Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to subtract:     [     60 - 43.overline{63} approx 21.overline{82} quad text{minutes before 4:00 PM}     ]     Therefore, the time is approximately:     [21 frac{9}{11} approx 21.82 text{ minutes before 4:00 PM}] # Conclusion: (boxed{21 frac{9}{11} approx 21.82 text{ minutes}})"},{"instruction":"Find all twodigit numbers, each of which is 13 more than the sum of the squares of its digits.","output":"1. **Define the two-digit number:**     - Let the two-digit number be denoted by overline{xy}, where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit.

Therefore, we should prioritize using exponentiation to achieve the largest possible number. 2. **Formulate potential expressions**:    We can form expressions like ( 3^{3^{3^{8^{8^{8}}}}} ) or ( 8^{3^{3^{3^{8^8}}}} ).

(2) Since g(x)=2x^{2}-4x+2+aln x, Therefore, g'(x)=4x-4+ frac{a}{x}= frac{4x^{2}-4x+a}{x}, Since the function g(x) has two extreme points, let the two extreme points be x_{1}, x_{0}, Therefore, x_{1}, x_{0} are the two roots of the equation 4x^{2}-4x+a=0, Therefore, Delta =16-16a > 0, 0 < a < 1, and x_{1}+x_{0}=1, Since the function y=4x^{2}-4x+a opens upwards and intersects the x-axis at two points, x_{0} is the local minimum point of the function g(x), Therefore, x_{1} < x_{0}, thus  frac{1}{2} < x_{0} < 1, From 4 x_{0}^{2}-4x_{0}+a=0, we get a=-4 x_{0}^{2}+4, x_{0}in(0,1), g(x_{0})=2(x_{0}-1)^{2}+(4x_{0}-4 x_{0}^{2})ln x_{0}, Let h(t)=2(t-1)^{2}+(4t-4t^{2})ln t (frac{1}{2} < t < 1), Since h'(t)=4(1-2t)ln t > 0, Therefore, h(t) is increasing on (frac{1}{2},1), Therefore, h(t) > h(frac{1}{2})= frac{1}{2}-ln 2, Therefore, g(x_{0}) > boxed{frac{1}{2}-ln 2}."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},_={key:0,class:"empty-state"},G=["disabled"],N={key:0},H={key:1};function E(i,e,h,p,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),w(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",_,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
