For every 1 yuan decrease in price, the mall sells 3 more items. If the price is reduced by x yuan, the increase in sales volume is 3x items.    - Therefore, the daily sales volume increases by 3x items. - **Profit Per Item**:    - The initial selling price is 280 yuan, and the cost price is 220 yuan, so the initial profit per item is 280 - 220 = 60 yuan.    - If the selling price is reduced by x yuan, the new selling price becomes 280 - x yuan. Thus, the profit per item becomes (280 - x) - 220 = 60 - x yuan.   - Therefore, the profit per item is (60 - x) yuan. Hence, for part (1), the daily sales volume of the mall increases by 3x items, and the profit per item is (60 - x) yuan. # Part (2): Reduction in Price to Achieve a Daily Profit of 3600 Yuan - **Setting Up the Equation**:    - To achieve a daily profit of 3600 yuan, we use the formula for total profit, which is the product of the number of items sold and the profit per item. Given the increase in sales volume and the change in profit per item, the equation is (30 + 3x)(60 - x) = 3600. - **Solving the Equation**:    - Expanding and simplifying the equation gives us a quadratic equation in terms of x. Solving this quadratic equation yields two possible values for x, which are x_1 = 20 and x_2 = 30. - **Choosing the Optimal Solution**:    - Since the goal is to reduce inventory more effectively, we choose the larger reduction in price to increase sales volume. Therefore, we select x = 30. Thus, to make the profit from selling this kind of item reach 3600 yuan per day and to reduce inventory more effectively, each item should be reduced by boxed{30} yuan."},{"instruction":"Grisha wrote 100 numbers on the board.

After i increments, the new numbers are:    [    a_{1} + i, a_{2} + i, ldots, a_{100} + i    ]    The product of these numbers can be expressed as a function of i:    [    P(i) = (a_{1} + i)(a_{2} + i) cdots (a_{100} + i)    ]    Since the product does not change after each increment, this implies:    [    P(i) = text{constant}    ] 2. **Polynomial Representation:**    To explore this constancy, consider the polynomial representation of the product. Define:    [    P(x) = (x + a_1)(x + a_2) cdots (x + a_{100})    ]    If the product remains constant irrespective of the increments, the polynomial must take the same value at k+1 distinct points, namely a_1, a_1 + 1, a_1 + 2, ldots, a_1 + k. 3. **Degree and Constant Value:**    A polynomial of degree 100 cannot take the same value at more than 100 distinct points unless it is a constant polynomial. However, since our polynomial has 100 distinct roots (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{100}), it is not constant. Therefore, the number of distinct points at which it can take the same value must be limited by its degree.

In a standard domino set (double-six set), there are 28 tiles, where each tile has a pair of numbers ranging from 0 to 6. 3. Consider the distribution of tiles for each specific number:    - **Zero:** (0-0), (0-1), (0-2), (0-3), (0-4), (0-5), (0-6) - 7 tiles    - **One:** (1-1), (1-2), (1-3), (1-4), (1-5), (1-6), (0-1) - 7 tiles    - **Two:** (2-2), (2-3), (2-4), (2-5), (2-6), (1-2), (0-2) - 7 tiles    - **Three:** (3-3), (3-4), (3-5), (3-6), (2-3), (1-3), (0-3) - 7 tiles    - **Four:** (4-4), (4-5), (4-6), (3-4), (2-4), (1-4), (0-4) - 7 tiles    - **Five:** (5-5), (5-6), (4-5), (3-5), (2-5), (1-5), (0-5) - 7 tiles    - **Six:** (6-6), (5-6), (4-6), (3-6), (2-6), (1-6), (0-6) - 7 tiles 4. If we try to form a chain where a tile with a six is at one end and a tile with a five is at the other, we must consider the arrangement principles:    - Each number at the ends of the chain must appear an odd number of times in the entire set.    - However, each number (0 through 6) appears exactly 7 times in total (an odd number), but if one number is at one end and another number is at the other end of the chain, each of those numbers need to appear an even number of times inside the chain. 5. Now, according to the rules of domino:    - Each numbered tile (except doubles like (6-6)) contributes to matching with another same numbered tile.    - So, if a six is on the end, all other tiles involving six cannot be paired off internally in the middle of the chain, implying one unpaired six.    - Meanwhile, a similar situation happens with a tile numbered five on the other end, implying one unpaired five. 6. Having both a six and a five on opposite ends without other unpaired numbers inside the chain violates the structure's requirement of paring and even distribution: Therefore, it is not possible to arrange all 28 domino tiles in such a manner that a six is on one end and a five is on the other end per the game's rules.

Here's a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Set Up the Problem:**    - We are given 2009 triangles, each with sides colored blue, red, and white.    - For each color, we sort the side lengths:      [      begin{aligned}      b_1 & leq b_2 leq ldots leq b_{2009} && text{(blue sides)},       r_1 & leq r_2 leq ldots leq r_{2009} && text{(red sides)},       w_1 & leq w_2 leq ldots leq w_{2009} && text{(white sides)}.      end{aligned}      ]    - We need to find the largest (k) such that for all (j = 1, 2, ldots, k), the triplet ((b_j, r_j, w_j)) can form a non-degenerate triangle. 2. **Non-degenerate Triangle Condition:**    - A non-degenerate triangle with sides (a), (b), and (c) must satisfy the triangle inequalities:      [      begin{aligned}      a + b & > c,       a + c & > b,       b + c & > a.      end{aligned}      ]    - For our sorted lists, we need (b_j, r_j, w_j) to satisfy these inequalities for as many (j) as possible. 3. **Analyzing the Largest Values:**    - Consider the largest values (b_{2009}, r_{2009}, w_{2009}).    - Without loss of generality, assume (w_{2009} geq r_{2009} geq b_{2009}).    - We need to check if (b_{2009} + r_{2009} > w_{2009}):      [      b_{2009} + r_{2009} > w_{2009}.      ]    - For any given triangle, by definition, the sides satisfy (b + r > w). Since (b_{2009} geq b) and (r_{2009} geq r), it follows:      [      b_{2009} + r_{2009} geq b + r > w.      ]    - Thus, (b_{2009}, r_{2009}, w_{2009}) satisfy the triangle inequality. 4. **Examining Smaller Indices:**    - Consider the sequence of triangles (Delta_j) with the following side lengths:      [      begin{aligned}      b_j & = 2j, && text{(blue side)},       r_j & = j, && text{(red side)},       w_j & = j quad (1 leq j leq 2008),       w_{2008} & = 4018,       r_{2009} & = 4018,       w_{2009} & = 1.      end{aligned}      ] 5. **Checking Validity for (j leq 2008):**    - For (1 leq j leq 2008), we have:      [      begin{aligned}      w_j + r_j & = j + j = 2j,       b_j & = 2j.      ]    - Hence, (w_j + r_j = b_j), which does not satisfy (a + b > c) for a triangle. Thus, for these values of (j), ((b_j, r_j, w_j)) do not form a triangle. 6. **Conclusion:**    - From the above analysis, the only valid index (j) where (b_j, r_j, w_j) can form a triangle is when (j = 2009). Therefore, the largest possible integer (k) such that the triples (b_j, r_j, w_j) form a non-degenerate triangle is: [ boxed{1} ]"},{"instruction":"The number of terms in the expansion of (x+y+z)^4 is ( ).

This is because every number on a segment appears exactly once in a white circle and once in a black circle. 3. **Expressing the Sum in Terms of Segment Values**:     - Let the numbers on the segments be (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6).     - The sums of the numbers in the circles can be expressed as:       - (A = x_1 + x_6) (sum for circle 1 - white)       - (B = x_1 + x_2) (sum for circle 2 - black)       - (C = x_2 + x_3) (sum for circle 3 - white)       - (D = x_3 + x_4) (sum for circle 4 - black)       - (E = x_4 + x_5) (sum for circle 5 - white)       - (F = x_5 + x_6) (sum for circle 6 - black)      4. **Equating the Sums**:     Since we colored the circles alternately, the sum of the values in the white circles must equal the sum of the values in the black circles:     [     text{Sum of white circles} = A + C + E = x_1 + x_6 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5     ]     [     text{Sum of black circles} = B + D + F = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6     ]     This implies:     [     A + C + E = B + D + F     ]     But since we observe above both sums are effectively representing the total sum of the segments. 5. **Finding the Missing Number**:     Suppose the missing number is the number in circle 6 (black).

The product of the other two terms will be frac{3006}{49} = 61.35, which is not integer. This issue arises because 7^2 is not a suitable term to isolate for minimizing the sum of a+b+c.

Therefore, all primes ( p_i ) must indeed be distinct. 5. **Prime Count Constrains ( k ):**    Each ( p_i ) is a distinct prime number and since ( p_i ) must be less than or equal to ( n ):    The number of distinct primes less than or equal to ( n ) is given by ( pi(n) ). 6. **Conclusion:**    Hence, the number of integers ( k ) must be less than or equal to ( pi(n) ):    [    k leq pi(n)    ] Thus, we conclude that  [ boxed{k leq pi(n)} ]"},{"instruction":"A large square was cut out of graph paper along the grid lines.

Therefore:      [      N^2 - M^2 = 79      ]    - This can be factored using the difference of squares formula:      [      (N - M)(N + M) = 79      ] 3. **Analyze Factoring:**    - Since 79 is a prime number, it only has two positive integer factors: 1 and 79. Therefore, we can set:      [      begin{cases}      N - M = 1       N + M = 79      end{cases}      ] 4. **Solve the System of Equations:**    - Add the two equations:      [      (N - M) + (N + M) = 1 + 79 implies 2N = 80 implies N = 40      ]    - Subtract the first equation from the second:      [      (N + M) - (N - M) = 79 - 1 implies 2M = 78 implies M = 39      ] 5. **Conclusion:**    - Thus, the side lengths are N = 40 and M = 39.    - For the smaller square (39 x 39) to be fully cut out from the larger square (40 x 40), it would necessarily have to be aligned with one of the corners of the larger square. Otherwise, it would overlap the boundary of the larger square, resulting in fewer cells remaining. Therefore, the cut smaller square must contain one of the corner cells of the larger square.

It also requires computational skills. First, we find the original function f(x) from its derivative. We have f'(x)=x^{2}+2cos x, so f(x)=frac{1}{3}x^{3}+2sin x+c. Given that f(0)=0, we find c=0. Therefore, f(x)=frac{1}{3}x^{3}+2sin x. This function is an odd function. Next, we examine the monotonicity of f(x). The second derivative of f(x) is f''(x)=2x-2sin x=2(x-sin x). In the interval (0,2), f''(x)>0, and in the interval (-2,0), f''(x)<0. Therefore, f'(x)=x^{2}+2cos x is increasing in (0,2) and decreasing in (-2,0). Thus, f'(x)=x^{2}+2cos x has a minimum value of 2 at x=0. Consequently, f(x)=frac{1}{3}x^{3}+2sin x+c is increasing in (-2,2). From f(1+x)+f(x-x^{2}) > 0, we get f(1+x) > f(x^{2}-x).

Hence, statement A is correct. **B**: Conversely, as |r| approaches 0, the linear correlation between the variables weakens. This is because r = 0 indicates no linear correlation between the variables.

First, let’s denote some necessary parameters:     - ( n ) = the number of sides of the base polygon, which is 20.     - Let the radius of the circumscribed sphere be ( R ).     - Let the radius of the inscribed sphere be ( r ).     - Let the height of the pyramid be ( h ).          Because the centers of both spheres coincide (which we'll call the common center), this simplifies certain angles and distances within the geometry of the pyramid. 2. We use the formula for the flat angles of the side face and note some crucial geometrical observations:     - In a right pyramid where the base is a regular polygon, the side faces are all congruent isosceles triangles.          Because of the symmetry, each flat angle involves both the radius of the circumscribed and the inscribed sphere. 3. To find the exact flat angles of the side faces, note:     - The vertex of the pyramid subtended by the base angles can be found through the known parameters.     - The two equal base angles of each isosceles triangle comprising the side faces can be calculated based on the geometric relationship between the inscribed circle and the circumscribed circle. 4. Calculations:     - Each side face of the pyramid is an isosceles triangle having a vertex angle and two congruent base angles. Hence, breaking down:         - Each external vertex angle of the base polygon (regular 20-gon) is ( frac{360^circ}{20} = 18^circ ).         - Therefore, each base angle within each triangular face of the pyramid ( theta ) is half of 180 degrees minus the vertex angle labeling:             [             theta = frac{180^circ - 18^circ}{2} = 81^circ             ]     - Given the inscribed and circumscribed spheres agree at the same center:         - The congruent side face angles can slightly differ due to the symmetry and angles. 5.

We choose each vertex and draw a diagonal to the vertex that is ((n-1)/2) vertices away in either direction. 3. This selection ensures that all diagonals intersect each other inside the polygon because:     - They span sufficiently across the polygon to guarantee intersections.     - All diagonals drawn in this manner span roughly half the polygon's perimeter, which ensures they do not miss each other in crossing the interior. Example for ( n = 5 ): - Consider vertices labeled ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ). - Draw diagonals from each vertex to the one ((5-1)/2 = 2) vertices away.     - So, vertex 1 connects to 3.     - Vertex 2 connects to 4.     - Vertex 3 connects to 5.     - Vertex 4 connects to 1.     - Vertex 5 connects to 2.

Let the side of length a be denoted as a, and the other side, being 5 times a, be 5a. 1. **Total area of the rectangle:**    [    text{Area of the rectangle} = a times 5a = 5a^2    ] 2. **Total area of the resulting square:**    Since the area remains unchanged when the rectangle is transformed into a square and area conservation is a key principle here, the area of the square will also be 5a^2. Let the side of the square be s. Then:    [    s^2 = 5a^2    ]    Taking the square root of both sides, we get:    [    s = sqrt{5}a    ] 3. **Cutting the rectangle into smaller pieces:**    To transform the rectangle into a square, we cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces. Consider making the following steps for cutting:        - Divide the rectangle vertically at a, making one piece a times a (a small square of side a).    - Cut the remaining rectangle of size 4a times a into four smaller rectangles, each of size a times a.    Thus, we have obtained 5 squares each of size a times a. 4. **Arranging the squares to form a big square:**    Place the five a times a squares in such a manner that they form a larger square of side sqrt{5}a. This can be visualized better from a diagram, where the five squares are positioned to fill the entirety of the larger square without any gaps or overlaps.     One possible way to do this involves placing the squares in a \\"cross\\" configuration, but the exact arrangement can be derived from a careful visual rearrangement. 5. **Illustration:**    ![Cut and rearrange](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_5c7615c1304192c8e489g-4.jpg)    Ensure that the final arrangement respects the dimensions derived and fills the square entirely. Each smaller square of a times a fits together to form the s times s square where s = sqrt{5}a. 6. **Conclusion:**    By performing these steps, it is shown how to cut a rectangle into 5 parts and rearrange them into a square.

A rover driver in foggy conditions can distinguish the number and relative positions of the lit bulbs on the traffic light (for example, if two bulbs are lit, whether they are in the same horizontal row or different ones, whether they are in the same vertical column, adjacent vertical columns, or in the two outermost vertical columns). However, the driver cannot distinguish unlit bulbs and the traffic light's frame. Therefore, if only one bulb is lit, it is impossible to determine which of the six bulbs it is. How many different signals from the Martian traffic light can the rover driver distinguish in the fog? If none of the bulbs are lit, the driver cannot see the traffic light.","output":"**Step 1:** Determine the Nature of the Problem An analysis of the Marsian traffic light signals is needed. These consist of six lamp bulbs arranged in two horizontal rows, each with three bulbs. The signals are identifiable by the quantity and position of the illuminated bulbs. Given the constraints in the problem, we need to calculate the total number of distinguishable signals in foggy conditions. **Step 2:** Consider the Unique Identifiers of the Signals The driver can only distinguish between the arrangement and positions of the lights and not the bulbs that are off. Thus, signals that differ only by horizontal or vertical shifts of the illuminated bulbs are indistinguishable to the driver. **Step 3:** Calculate the Total Number of Combinations Compute the total possible combinations in which the bulbs can be lit. Each of the 6 bulbs can either be on or off. [ 2^6 = 64 ] Given 64 total combinations (from all bulbs being off to all being on). **Step 4:** Subtract the Indistinguishable State There is one case where no bulb is lit, which the problem refers to as the driver not being able to see the signal. Therefore, subtract this case from the total number of combinations: [ 64 - 1 = 63 ] **Step 5:** Account for the Symmetry and Overlapping Identifiable Situations As the problem hints, the symmetry and overlapping (when analyzed under the constraints provided) ensure that every distinguishable signal must also allow at least one bulb in the top and one in the left vertical row to be lit distinctly. - Because if it functions on shifting principles, it will include all variations that maintain distinguishability.

Which number should Dima name to win? Rectangles that differ by rotation are considered the same. For example, the rectangles 2 times 3 and 3 times 2 are identical.","output":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number that Dima should choose to maximize the number of different rectangles with integer sides whose perimeter matches the chosen number. We'll break down the solution in a series of logical steps, including detailed calculation and reasoning. 1. **Perimeter of a Rectangle**:         Let's recall that the perimeter ( P ) of a rectangle with sides ( a ) and ( b ) is given by the formula:    [    P = 2a + 2b = 2(a + b)    ]        For a given perimeter ( P ), the equation simplifies to:    [    a + b = frac{P}{2}    ]        Hence, ( P ) must be an even number for ( a ) and ( b ) to be integers. 2. **Counting Possible Rectangles**:        For a given even ( P ), since ( a ) and ( b ) must be positive integers, we can denote ( k = frac{P}{2} ). Thus, we are now solving:    [    a + b = k    ]        where both ( a ) and ( b ) are positive integers. The pairs ((a, b)) are directly linked to the number of ways we can partition ( k ) into two positive integers. The solution combinations ((a,b)) are:    - ((1, k-1))    - ((2, k-2))    - ((3, k-3))    - (ldots)    - ((k-1, 1))    Since rectangular pairs ((a, b)) and ((b, a)) are considered identical, each unique pair should be counted only once. Therefore, the total number of unique pairs equals (leftlfloor frac{k-1}{2} rightrfloor). 3. **Maximizing the Count:**        To maximize the count of unique rectangles, we need to maximize (leftlfloor frac{k-1}{2} rightrfloor). This is effectively maximizing ( k = frac{P}{2} ) as ( P ) increases, provided ( P leq 97 ) (since neither player can choose a number greater than 97).        The best you can do is to take the largest even ( P ) less than or equal to 97, which is 96.

Let's explore if this can be a square number. The number ( a09 ) for any digit ( a neq 0 ) cannot be a perfect square. For instance: - ( 109 = 10^2 + 9 ) - ( 209 = 14^2 + 5 ) - ( 309 = 17^2 + 8 ) None of these remainders are zero, hence ( a09 ) isn't a perfect square for any ( a neq 0 ).

Then: [ underbrace{a 0 ldots 09}_{n+1} = k^2 ] For ( k^2 - 3^2 ), we get: [ k^2 - 3^2 = (k-3)(k+3) = underbrace{a 0 ldots 0 0}_{n+1} = a cdot 10^{n+1} + 9 ]  Step 3: Factoring and Analysis When expanded further, ( a cdot 10^{n+1} + 9 ) can be factorized into its prime elements.

Hence, the remainder will be a number of the form (10^k mod M ).    - Note that there are only 221 possible remainders, since each remainder can be a number between 0 and M-1.    - Therefore, there are only 221 distinct values that (10^k mod M ) can take. 3. **Consider ( N ) formed by any natural number with at most 1988 ones**: Let N be a natural number such that its decimal representation consists of only 0s and a maximum of 1988 ones.        - We represent N as:      [      N = sum_{i=0}^{1987} a_i 10^{k_i}      ]      where a_i in {0, 1} and k_i are the powers of ten corresponding to each digit.        - Since N can be written using at most 1988 terms each of which is 10^{k_i}, and there's only a limited number of distinct remainders ( 10^{k_i} mod M ) can take (at most 221), from the pigeonhole principle, it follows that some remainders must repeat. 4. **Transform Repeated Remainders**: If a certain power 10^n occurs more than 10 times in the representation of N, we can replace ten such occurrences with a higher power.        - For example, if 10^n appears more than 10 times, replace every 10 of them with 10^{n+1}.    - Continue this process for all repeated powers in N.  5. **Final Sum of Unique Powers of 10**: After all such replacements:        - The final form of N will have unique powers of 10 up to 10^{218} at most (since there are only 1988 ones). 6. **Determine the final conclusion**: Because 9 times 221 = 1989, which is greater than the number of digits (1988) in our problem, it follows from all previous transformations and reductions, we must have some number (N) with the needed constraints that is still not divisible by (M). # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Существует}} ]"},{"instruction":"A train travels from Albany to Syracuse, a distance of 120 miles, at an average rate.

Consider the function f(x)=2x^2 - 1.

We are to place each of the  n  weights on the balance, one after another, in such a way that the right pan is never heavier than the left pan. At each step we choose one of the weights that has not yet been placed on the balance, and place it on either the left pan or the right pan, until all of the weights have been placed. Determine the number of ways in which this can be done. *Proposed by Morteza Saghafian, Iran*","output":"1. **Define the problem and notation:**    We are given ( n ) weights of ( 2^0, 2^1, cdots, 2^{n-1} ) and a balance. We need to place these weights on the balance such that the right pan is never heavier than the left pan. We denote ( s_k ) as the number of ways to place ( k ) weights satisfying the condition. 2. **Establish the recurrence relation:**    The key idea is to consider the placement of the largest weight ( 2^{n-1} ). Suppose we place ( 2^{n-1} ) after ( k ) other weights have been placed. The remaining ( n-1 ) weights can be freely distributed among the pans.     - There are ( binom{n-1}{k} ) ways to choose which ( k ) weights are placed before ( 2^{n-1} ).    - The number of ways to place these ( k ) weights is ( s_k ).    - After placing ( 2^{n-1} ), there are ( (n-k-1)! cdot 2^{n-k-1} ) ways to place the remaining weights.    Therefore, the recurrence relation is:    [    s_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} binom{n-1}{k} s_k 2^{n-k-1}    ] 3. **Simplify the recurrence relation:**    Notice that:    [    binom{n-1}{k} = frac{(n-1)!}{k!(n-1-k)!}    ]    Thus, the recurrence relation becomes:    [    s_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} frac{(n-1)!}{k!(n-1-k)!} s_k 2^{n-k-1}    ] 4. **Transform the recurrence relation:**    Multiply both sides by ( 2n ):    [    2n s_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} frac{n!}{k!(n-1-k)!} s_k 2^{n-k}    ]    Notice that the right-hand side is similar to the expression for ( s_{n+1} ):    [    s_{n+1} = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} s_k 2^{n-k}    ]    By comparing terms, we get:    [    s_{n+1} = 2n s_n + s_n = (2n+1) s_n    ] 5. **Solve the recurrence relation:**    The recurrence relation ( s_{n+1} = (2n+1) s_n ) can be solved by recognizing it as a product of odd numbers:    [    s_n = (2n-1)!!    ]    where ( (2n-1)!! ) denotes the double factorial of ( 2n-1 ).

This sphere's center is directly above the centroid of the triangle formed by the three spheres below it.    - If the first layer's centers are r above the base, the top sphere's center is at an additional height r vertically above the centroid whose distance from each base sphere’s center is frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}r. Thus, the total height from the base to the top sphere's center is r + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}r = frac{3 + 2sqrt{3}}{3}r. 5. **Slope of Cone's Side**:    - The slope from the vertex, through the sphere's tangency point on the cone’s side, to the base's edge forms a right triangle with height 15 and base 7.    - The slope is sqrt{15^2 + 7^2} from the vertex to the base edge, i.e., sqrt{324} = 18. 6. **Radius Calculation**:    - The distance from the base to the top sphere's center must be equal to the position the cone's slope first reaches a radial point 18 units from the vertex.    - Equating, frac{3 + 2sqrt{3}}{3}r = 18.    - Solving for r: r = frac{18 times 3}{3 + 2sqrt{3}}. 7. **Simplification**:    - Rationalize ( r = frac{54}{3 + 2sqrt{3}} times frac{3 - 2sqrt{3}}{3 - 2sqrt{3}} )    - This simplifies to frac{162 - 108sqrt{3}{3}}, yielding r = frac{162 - 108sqrt{3}}{3}.

The property of Gamma being the incircle of triangle ABC implies that segments overline{AY}, overline{BZ}, and overline{CX} are all angle bisectors of triangle ABC.

In triangle XYZ, since Gamma is the circumcircle and considering the angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle, triangle XYZ must be an isosceles triangle, which makes angle ZYX = angle ZXY. From here, angle ZYX is calculated as it is half of angle BAC due to Gamma's property. Thus, angle ZYX = angle ZXY = frac{1}{2} angle BAC = 30^circ and angle XYZ = 80^circ due to the angle sum property in triangle XYZ.

(A K) is chosen on (NM) such that (A K parallel CM). Since (AK parallel CM) and (ACMK) forms a parallelogram, (AC = KM) and (CK = AM). 5. In the equilateral triangle (ABC), all angles are (60^circ). Therefore, (ABC) has side lengths equal, say (AB = BC = CA = a). 6. In parallelogram (ACKM), the angles ( angle ACM) and (angle KMA) are both (60^circ) as well since they are corresponding angles to the angles in triangle (ABC). 7. Considering triangle (AKN) and the properties of the equilateral triangles and parallelograms, (AKN) is equilateral. 8. Given that (AKN) is equilateral, (NK = NA = AM). 9. (AC = NK) due to parallel properties and symmetry from triangle (AKN). This means (NK = AC). Now focusing on medians in triangle (BNM): 10.

This is a significant triangle property. We analyze properties at point (O): 12. Since (triangle NBM) is equilateral, the median (BN), (BM), and (NM) intersect equally at (O). 13. As per the property of medians in an equilateral triangle, every segment divided by medians intersects at (30^circ). Considering triangle (ODC): 14. (O) divides the medians equally; thus, (DO) is also a median for (triangle OCK) where (K) and (O) also divide segments equally. 15. Since ( angle DOA = angle DOC = 30^circ) (angles made by medians in an equilateral system), and the intersection angles formed by any median converge to (60^circ). Use the result in an isosceles context as: 16. Since ( angle KOC) covers (180^circ), considering median properties, the angle sum relations, ( angle KOC = 120^circ ) as intersection (completely validates our triangle laws). Finally adding: 17.

Rolls around the vertex showing faces in the same cyclical order.     5. **Extending to the Triangular Grid**:    - The grid's overall pattern can be extended indefinitely, meaning the face-down orientation repeats predictably for each triangle within the grid.    - Since rolling is symmetric and cyclic around vertices, any triangle corresponds uniquely to a specific orientation. 6. **Move to the Shaded Triangle**:    - By analyzing the cyclic nature, every triangle encountered while rolling relates to the initial triangle through symmetry: rolled once, twice, and so forth get unique but predictable face orientations.    - Regardless of route, reaching the specific shaded triangle implies a consistent orientation given by its position in the hexagonal pattern.     7. **Face Orientation in Shaded Triangle**:    - The die started with face 4 down → Roll once face 1 down → Roll again face 2 down.    - Persisting this pattern through steps, the shaded triangle consistently ends with face 1 down due to the predictable cyclic order. **Conclusion**: The face of the die resting in the shaded corner of the triangular grid holds 1 pip down, regardless of the path taken through the grid.

Place 18 spies on a 6 times 6 board so that no spy can see another.","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**     The board is a 6 times 6 grid. Each spy occupies one cell and has a specific line of sight:     - They can see 2 cells directly in front of them.     - They can see 1 cell to their left and right peripherally.    2. **Objective:**     Place 18 spies on the board so that none of them can see another. This involves strategic positioning to ensure their lines of sight don't overlap. 3. **Placement Strategy:**     One effective way to arrange the spies is in a pattern that ensures their lines of sight do not intersect with each other. In this case, we use a repeating pattern where the spies are oriented differently, covering the grid sufficiently. 4. **Illustration of the Placement:**     Here we denote the spies' positions and their directions as arrows to illustrate which way they are facing. These directions help in understanding that their lines of sight do not overlap.     The 6 times 6 board can be represented as follows (S represents a spy, the arrow direction indicates the direction they are looking):     [     begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}     hline     S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow & -  hline     - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow  hline     S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow & -  hline     - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow  hline     S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow & -  hline     - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow  hline     end{array}     ] 5. **Explanation of Positioning:**     - The spies are arranged in a checkerboard pattern.     - Every spy faces in the direction marked by an arrow.     - By placing them in this alternating pattern, we ensure that no spy can see another spy in front, to the left, or to the right of them. 6. **Verification:**     - Each S uparrow can see 2 cells ahead (which are empty).     - Each S uparrow can see 1 cell to the left and the right peripherally (which are either empty or on the edge of the board).     This ensures that no two spies' lines of sight intersect, fulfilling the requirement of the problem. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{This arrangement ensures 18 spies on a 6 times 6 board with none seeing another.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that b is a multiple of 570, find the greatest common divisor of 5b^4 + 2b^3 + 5b^2 + 9b + 95 and b.","output":"We use the Euclidean Algorithm.

Let's prove the stated properties for vectors in a three-dimensional space, focusing on maintaining the properties of vector operations as established for plane vectors:        a) **Commutativity and Associativity of Vector Addition, Associativity of Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar, and Distributive Laws for Multiplication of a Vector by a Sum of Scalars and Sum of Vectors by a Scalar.**        These can be proven in the same way as for plane vectors since these facts pertain to only two vectors which can be considered as vectors lying in an appropriate plane parallel to our vectors.    **Commutativity of Addition:**    Let vec{a} and vec{b} be any two vectors. We need to show that:        vec{a} + vec{b} = vec{b} + vec{a}        By definition of vector addition, this is evident as addition is commutative:        (a_1, a_2, a_3) + (b_1, b_2, b_3) = (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, a_3 + b_3) = (b_1 + a_1, b_2 + a_2, b_3 + a_3) = (b_1, b_2, b_3) + (a_1, a_2, a_3)        **Associativity of Addition:**    Consider three vectors vec{a}, vec{b}, and vec{c}. We need to show:        (vec{a} + vec{b}) + vec{c} = vec{a} + (vec{b} + vec{c})        Using the definition of vector addition:        ((a_1, a_2, a_3) + (b_1, b_2, b_3)) + (c_1, c_2, c_3) = (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, a_3 + b_3) + (c_1, c_2, c_3) = (a_1 + b_1 + c_1, a_2 + b_2 + c_2, a_3 + b_3 + c_3)        And:        (a_1, a_2, a_3) + ((b_1, b_2, b_3) + (c_1, c_2, c_3)) = (a_1, a_2, a_3) + (b_1 + c_1, b_2 + c_2, b_3 + c_3) = (a_1 + b_1 + c_1, a_2 + b_2 + c_2, a_3 + b_3 + c_3)        Thus, associativity is shown.    **Associativity of Scalar Multiplication:**    Let k and m be scalars, and vec{a} be a vector. Then:        k(mvec{a}) = (km)vec{a}        **Distributive Property for Multiplication of Vectors and Scalars:**    For scalars k and m and vectors vec{a} and vec{b}, we have:        k(vec{a} + vec{b}) = kvec{a} + kvec{b}        and        (k + m)vec{a} = kvec{a} + mvec{a}     2. **Associativity in addition also transfers without change, since it reduces to checking the relationship  (overrightarrow{OA} + overrightarrow{AB}) + overrightarrow{BC} = overrightarrow{OA} + (overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{BC}) , which is obvious.**    3. **Distributive Property for Scalar Multiplication of the Sum of Vectors:**    Let overrightarrow{OA} = vec{a}, overrightarrow{OB} = vec{b}, and overrightarrow{OM} = vec{m} (see Figure 78). Suppose overrightarrow{OC} = vec{c} = vec{a} + vec{b}. We need to prove that:        vec{m} cdot vec{a} + vec{m} cdot vec{b} = vec{m} cdot vec{c}        Consider the parallelogram MAMB', where:        overrightarrow{AM} = overrightarrow{MB'} = vec{m} - vec{a}, quad overrightarrow{BM} = overrightarrow{MB} = vec{m} - vec{b}, quad overrightarrow{AB} = vec{b} - vec{a}            overrightarrow{MM'} = overrightarrow{OM} - overrightarrow{OM'} = vec{m} - (vec{c} - vec{m}) = 2vec{m} - vec{c}         4. **Using the fact that the sum of the squares of the parallelograms' diagonals equals the sum of the squares of its sides:**        2(vec{m} - vec{a})^2 + 2(vec{m} - vec{b})^2 = (vec{a} - vec{b})^2 + (2vec{m} - vec{c})^2     5. **Expanding and simplifying:**        4m^2 + 2a^2 + 2b^2 - 4vec{m}vec{a} - 4vec{m}vec{b} = a^2 + b^2 - 2vec{a}vec{b} + 4m^2 + c^2 - 4vec{m}vec{c}            a^2 + b^2 + 2vec{a}vec{b} - 4vec{m}vec{a} - 4vec{m}vec{b} = c^2 - 4vec{m}vec{c}     6. **Using c^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2vec{a}vec{b} (cosine theorem):**        -4vec{m}vec{a} - 4vec{m}vec{b} = -4vec{m}vec{c}         Therefore, we have:         vec{m}vec{a} + vec{m}vec{b} = vec{m}cdot(vec{a} + vec{b})            boxed{} Concluding that scalar multiplication and vector operations retain all their properties when extended to three-dimensional space."},{"instruction":"Find a quadratic with rational coefficients and a leading coefficient of x^2 that has sqrt{5}3 as a root.","output":"Given that one root of the quadratic is sqrt{5}-3, the other root, due to the requirement for rational coefficients, must be its conjugate -sqrt{5}-3.

Consider a point (t, e^{t}) on the curve f(x)=e^x. The derivative of f(x), denoted as f'(x), equals e^x. Thus, the slope of the tangent at any point on f(x) is e^t. 2. The equation of the tangent line at (t, e^{t}) can be derived from the point-slope form of a line, y-y_1=m(x-x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line. Substituting m=e^t and (x_1, y_1)=(t, e^t), we get: [y-e^{t}=e^{t}(x-t)] Simplifying, we obtain: [y=e^{t}x+(1-t)e^{t}]① 3. For the curve g(x)=ln x+2, its derivative g'(x) equals frac{1}{x}.

Let's generalize this scenario. 3. **Sum of Three Consecutive Numbers**: We want to sum three consecutive integers in such a way that the third number makes the total a perfect square.    - Consider any integer n.     - The next consecutive integer is n+1.    - The next consecutive integer after that is n+2.    - We look for:      [      n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3      ] 4. **Choosing Specific Integers**: We need 3n + 3 to be a perfect square. 5. **Formulate the Strategy**: Consider n = 3x^2 - 1 where x is any positive integer.    - Then n geq 0.    - Check that 3x^2 - 1 is not a perfect square and lies in the residue class 2 modulo 3:      [      3x^2 - 1 equiv 1 (mod  3)      ]    - Ensure 3x^2 - 1 is not a perfect square by modulo analysis. 6. **Next Numbers**: Berta adds the next number:    - 3x^2 - 1 + (3x^2) = 6x^2 - 1    - Verify 6x^2 - 1  modulo 3:      [      6x^2 - 1 equiv 2-1 equiv 1 (mod  3)       ]    - 6x^2 - 1 is not a perfect square either. 7. **Anton Adds**: Anton then adds the next number:    - 6x^2 - 1 + (3x^2 + 1) = 9x^2, which is a perfect square since:      [      9x^2 = (3x)^2      ]     8. **Conclusion**:    - Anton wins by following this strategy with any positive integer x.    - He can pick n = 3x^2 - 1, and by this choice, Berta and Anton move will cycle down to Anton making the sum into perfect square.

The given function can be rewritten as y = (x + 1)^2, which means the vertex is at (-1, 0), and the axis of symmetry is the line x = -1. Step 2: Determine the relative positions of points A, B, and C to the axis of symmetry.

We need to show that ( N ) is divisible by 3 but not by 9.        Since the number ( N ) consists of 300 ones followed by some zeros, we can write ( N ) as:    [    N = underbrace{111 ldots 1}_{300 text{ ones}} underbrace{000 ldots 0}_{k text{ zeros}}    ] 2. **Step 2: Sum the digits of ( N ).**    The sum of the digits of ( N ) is simply the sum of 300 ones since the zeros do not contribute to the sum.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 5, 9, and 11 can be found by multiplying the highest powers of all prime factors present in the numbers.  5 is a prime number, so its highest power is 5^1 = 5. 9 is 3^2 (since 9 is 3 * 3). 11 is a prime number, so its highest power is 11^1 = 11.

Let's decode each step: 1. **Step 1: Understanding \\"日\\" (0)**:    - By default, \\"日\\" looks like a square with sticks on the top, bottom, left, and right sides.    - This represents the number 0. 2. **Step 2: Removing one stick to form \\"一\\" (1)**:    - If we remove the stick from the bottom-left side of \\"日\\", we form the number \\"一\\" which corresponds to 1. 3. **Step 3: Removing three sticks to form \\"二\\" (3)**:    - If we remove the top, bottom, and bottom-left sticks from \\"日\\", we are left with \\"二\\", which corresponds to 3. 4. **Step 4: Further mappings**:    - According to the reference solution, removing specific sticks will form the following mappings:       - \\"日\\" itself maps to 0       - Removing one stick (bottom-left): maps to 1       - Removing three sticks (top, bottom, bottom-left): maps to 3       - Removing four sticks (sides, left and right): maps to 4       - Vertical line \\"丨\\" maps to 5 So, we can have the following distinct mappings: - 0, 1, 3, 4, 5 5. **Conclusion**: We find that there are 5 different possible numbers that can be mapped from the initial symbol \\"日\\" by removing various sticks.

When the knight reaches close to the top of the board, there will be no black cross cells left due to restricted space. 8. **Reaching the Target**:    Thus, eventually, Player 1 ensures to move the knight on each move towards the main diagonal until the move is essentially forced into the top-right cell by restricted options on Player 2’s part. 9. **Conclusion**:    Through strategic diagonal movements and understanding the knight’s move limitations on board boundaries, Player 1 can always eventually move the knight to the top-right corner of the chessboard, effectively winning the game.

Prove that any crosssection of the polyhedron by a plane not containing any vertices is a polygon with an even number of sides.","output":"Let's denote the given convex polyhedron as P. We are to prove that any section of P by a plane that does not contain any of its vertices results in a polygon with an even number of sides. # Step-by-Step Solution 1. **Initial Setup and Observation:**    The polyhedron P is convex, and each vertex v of P is connected by an even number of edges. This condition is crucial for our proof.  2. **Perturbation of the Plane:**    Consider a plane pi that intersects P but does not contain any vertices of P. Because edge intersections with pi generate the polygon, slight perturbations of pi do not change the essential nature of the intersections; pi can be moved slightly without becoming parallel to any edge of P or missing any vertices of P. 3. **Behavior of the Intersecting Plane:**    As the plane pi moves through the polyhedron parallel to itself, it intersects a set of edges when passing through the polyhedron’s volume, forming the sides of a polygon. The vertices of this polygon are simply the points where pi intersects the edges of P. 4. **Vertex and Edge Combination Analysis:**    Let us now suppose the plane pi intersects an edge at a single point (which is not a vertex). Every time pi passes an edge, it intersects two faces of the polyhedron that share this edge. 5. **Even Number Condition Analysis:**    When pi moves and intersects vertices (as it can), the number of edges in the section polygon changes. We need to show that these changes keep the number of sides of the polygon even.    Let's analyze what happens as pi moves past a vertex v. Vertex v has an even degree (it connects to an even number of edges). If m edges lie above pi and n edges lie below pi, then when pi moves slightly through v, it intersects k = m + n edges. Since v has an even degree, k is even. This means the transition does not change the parity of the polygon's side count.    Let's detail:    [    text{Change in the number of sides} = (n + m) - 2m = 2k - 2m    ]    Since k is even (k = 2k'), the equation simplifies to    [    2k' - 2m text{ (which is even as well)}.    ] 6. **Conclusion:**    Initially, as pi intersects nothing, the polygon has 0 sides (even number). Whenever pi intersects an edge, it happens in pairs due to the even degree condition ensuring the total number of sides remains even until pi leaves P entirely.        Hence, any section of P by a plane pi results in a polygon with an even number of sides.

Step 1: Relate the given asymptote to the hyperbola's equation. The slope of the asymptote for a hyperbola frac{{x}^{2}}{a^{2}}-frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1 is given by pmfrac{b}{a}. In our case, the equation of the asymptote is sqrt{3}x+my=0, which implies a slope of -frac{m}{sqrt{3}}. This should be equal to the slope derived from the hyperbola's equation, which is pmsqrt{m} (since a^2 = m and b^2 = 1 for our hyperbola). Step 2: Solve for m. Setting the slopes equal gives us: [ -frac{m}{sqrt{3}} = sqrt{m} ] Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root yields: [ frac{m^2}{3} = m ] Multiplying both sides by 3 and then subtracting m from both sides gives us: [ m^2 = 3m implies m^2 - 3m = 0 ] Factoring out m gives us: [ m(m - 3) = 0 ] Since m > 0, we discard the solution m = 0 and are left with: [ m = 3 ] Step 3: Determine the focal length of the hyperbola. With m = 3, the equation of the hyperbola becomes frac{{x}^{2}}{3}-y^{2}=1. The focal length 2c of a hyperbola is found using the formula c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Here, a^2 = 3 and b^2 = 1, so: [ c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = sqrt{3 + 1} = sqrt{4} = 2 ] Therefore, the focal length is 2c = 2 times 2 = 4. Thus, the focal length of the hyperbola C is boxed{4}."},{"instruction":"Six numbers are written in a row. It is known that among them there is one unit and any three consecutive numbers have the same arithmetic mean. Find the maximum value of the geometric mean of any three consecutive numbers in this row if the arithmetic mean of all 6 numbers is A.","output":"1. Let's denote the six numbers in the series as ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 ). 2. We are given that the arithmetic averages of any three consecutive numbers are equal. Therefore, we have: [ frac{1}{3}(a_1 + a_2 + a_3) = frac{1}{3}(a_2 + a_3 + a_4) ] 3. Simplifying this equation, we get: [ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = a_2 + a_3 + a_4 ] Subtracting ( a_2 + a_3 ) from both sides, we get: [ a_1 = a_4 ] 4. Similarly, we have: [ frac{1}{3}(a_2 + a_3 + a_4) = frac{1}{3}(a_3 + a_4 + a_5) ] Which simplifies to: [ a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = a_3 + a_4 + a_5 ] Subtracting ( a_3 + a_4 ) from both sides, we get: [ a_2 = a_5 ] 5. Lastly, we have: [ frac{1}{3}(a_3 + a_4 + a_5) = frac{1}{3}(a_4 + a_5 + a_6) ] Which simplifies to: [ a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = a_4 + a_5 + a_6 ] Subtracting ( a_4 + a_5 ) from both sides, we get: [ a_3 = a_6 ] 6. Thus, we can rewrite the sequence as ( x, y, z, x, y, z ), where: [ a_1 = a_4 = x, quad a_2 = a_5 = y, quad a_3 = a_6 = z ] 7. It's given that one of the numbers is 1. Without loss of generality, let's assume ( z = 1 ). Therefore, the sequence is ( x, y, 1, x, y, 1 ). 8. The arithmetic mean of the six numbers is given by ( A ): [ text{Arithmetic mean} = frac{1}{6}(x + y + 1 + x + y + 1) = frac{1}{3}(x + y + 1) = A ] From this, we cge 9.

We now find the maximum value of the geometric mean of any three consecutive numbers, which is given by: [ g(x) = sqrt[3]{x cdot (p - x) cdot 1} = sqrt[3]{x(p - x)} ] 12. The function ( g(x) ) has its maximum value at the same point where the function ( f(x) = g^3(x) = x(p - x) ) has its maximum. 13. The function ( f(x) = x(p - x) ) is a quadratic function (a parabola), and its maximum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of the parabola ( y = ax^2 + bx + c ) is given by: [ x = frac{-b}{2a} ] Here, ( f(x) = x(p - x) ), so: [ x = frac{p}{2} ] 14. The maximum value of ( f(x) ) is: [ fleft(frac{p}{2}right) = left(frac{p}{2}right) left(p - frac{p}{2}right) = frac{p^2}{4} ] 15. Thus, the maximum value of the geometric mean is: [ gleft( frac{p}{2} right) = sqrt[3]{frac{p^2}{4}} = sqrt[3]{frac{(3A - 1)^2}{4}} ] 16.

Each ingot costs 5. 18 ingots * 5 per ingot = 90 However, we know that Thomas only paid 72 for the ingots. This means he received a discount. 90 (original price) - 72 (discounted price) = 18 discount Now, let's calculate the discount percentage.

Given that D(k)=ntimesfrac{1}{2}timesleft(1-frac{1}{2}right), we find D(Y)=36times ntimesfrac{1}{2}timesleft(1-frac{1}{2}right)=9n.

The symmedian of a triangle is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector. Therefore, g passes through the midpoint of A'B', which we will call K. 3. **Establish the relationship between A'B' and AB:**    - Since A'B' is antiparallel to AB in triangle ABC, the midpoint K of A'B' lies on the symmedian g. 4. **Show that h passes through K:**    - We need to show that h passes through the midpoint K of A'B'. This requires proving that angle AHC_0 = angle BHK. 5. **Use similarity of triangles:**    - Note that triangle ABH is similar to triangle A'B'H because they share the same angles (both are right triangles with a common angle at H).    - Since C_0 and K are the midpoints of AB and A'B' respectively, triangle AHC_0 is similar to triangle BHK by the Midline Theorem (the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half as long). 6. **Conclude the angle equality:**    - From the similarity triangle AHC_0 sim triangle BHK, we have angle AHC_0 = angle BHK. 7. **Intersection on A'B':**    - Since g passes through K and h also passes through K, the lines g and h intersect at K, which lies on A'B'.

This means that the outcome of previous draws does not influence the next draw.    - Each number, including 84, has an equal probability of being chosen in any given draw regardless of its previous occurrences.  3. **Calculating the Probability of Drawing 84:**    - Suppose the lottery consists of drawing 5 winning numbers out of 90 possible numbers.    - The probability v_1 that the number 84 (or any specific number) will be drawn in the next draw is:      [ v_1 = frac{5}{90} = frac{1}{18} approx 0.0556 ]     4. **Probability of Drawing 84 in Subsequent Weeks:**    - The probability v_2 that number 84 is drawn in the second week (not the first week) involves two stages:      - It should not be drawn in the first week.      - It should be drawn in the second week.    - The probability of not drawing 84 in the first week is (1 - v_1 = 1 - frac{1}{18} = frac{17}{18}).    - Thus, the combined probability v_2 is:      [      v_2 = left( frac{17}{18} right) cdot v_1 = left( frac{17}{18} right) cdot left( frac{1}{18} right) = frac{17}{18} cdot frac{1}{18} approx 0.0525      ]     5. **Generalizing to the (n)-th Week:**    - For the (n)-th draw, the probability v_n that the number 84 is first drawn in the (n)-th week (and not before) can be expressed as:      [      v_n = left( frac{17}{18} right)^{n-1} cdot v_1 = left( frac{17}{18} right)^{n-1} cdot frac{1}{18}      ] 6. **Comparing Probabilities:**    - We observe that for n > 1, the probability v_n becomes smaller compared to v_1.      [      v_n = left( frac{17}{18} right)^{n-1} cdot frac{1}{18} < frac{1}{18}      ]    - Therefore, the highest probability for drawing the number 84 in any future draw occurs in the next draw (v_1). # Conclusion: Given the independence of weekly draws in the lottery, Kati's argument—that the probability of drawing the number 84 in the next draw remains the same as any other draw—is correct. Hence, Panni's belief in the improbability of drawing 84 soon is statistically unfounded. boxed{Kati; is; correct.; Panni's; assertion; does; not; hold; from; a; probabilistic; standpoint.}"},{"instruction":"a certain region, the state income tax is calculated as q% of the first textdollar 35000 of annual income plus (q + 4)% of any amount above textdollar 35000.

Since Ram's efficiency is K/2, we can write the following equation for the work (W) done by Ram in one day: W = (K/2) * 1 day Since it takes Ram 21 days to complete the task, we can say that the total work (T) is: T = W * 21 T = (K/2) * 21 Now, let's consider Vikas, who is two-thirds as efficient as Krish.

Given that Nissa takes 10 seconds to clip each claw, the time taken to clip all the claws would be: Time to clip all claws = 10 seconds/claw * 18 claws = 180 seconds It takes 90 seconds to clean each ear. Assuming the cat has two ears, the time taken to clean both ears would be: Time to clean both ears = 90 seconds/ear * 2 ears = 180 seconds It takes 5 minutes to shampoo the cat.

Therefore, the possible outcomes when rolling this die are: ( {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ). 2. **Labeling the Second Die**:     - We assign the numbers 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 to the faces of the second die. Therefore, the possible outcomes when rolling this die are: ( {0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30} ). 3. **Examining the Possible Sums**:      - When these dice are rolled, the sum of the numbers on the resulted faces ranges from the minimum sum (1 + 0 = 1) to the maximum sum (6 + 30 = 36).     - Therefore, the possible sums are given by ( (a + b) ) for every combination where ( a ) is a number from the first die and ( b ) is a number from the second die. 4. **Ensuring All Sums from 1 to 36**:     - By carefully analyzing, we can pair each number ( k ) (for ( k = 1, 2, 3, cdots, 36 )) with a unique sum ( (a + b) ):     - For example:         - Sum (1): (1 + 0)         - Sum (2): (2 + 0)         - Sum (6+1): (5 + 0)         - Sum (7): (1+6)         - Sum (12): (1+12)         - And so forth up to the largest sum (36): (6 + 30). 5. **Conclusion**:     - With these labels, every number from 1 to 36 can be formed as a unique sum of one number from the first die and one number from the second die.     - Given the uniform distribution of the numbers on both dice, each sum from 1 to 36 has an equal likelihood.

We know that by buying these meals, he saves 10 compared to buying the individual items. So, the cost of the 4 meals should be 36 (the cost of individual items) - 10 (savings) = 26 for 4 meals. Now, we need to find the cost of one special burger meal. Since he buys 2 burger meals and 2 kids' meals, and we know the cost of 2 kids' meals is 10 (because each kids' meal costs 5), we can subtract this from the total cost of the meals to find the cost of the 2 burger meals. 26 (total cost for 4 meals) - 10 (cost for 2 kids' meals) = 16 for 2 burger meals.

Draw another circle with center ( Q ) having the same radius, and note the point ( R ) where it intersects circle ( D ) inside ( C ). Let the line ( PR ) intersect circumference ( C ) at point ( L ). Then ( QL ) is the radius of the circle ( C ), as is ( LR ).","output":"To solve the problem of finding the radius of a circle using the described method, let us proceed step by step.

Formulate and prove the converse theorem.","output":"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the indications from problem № 270, as the solution hints that it is related. The problem deals with a point on the external angle bisector of an angle with a line intersecting the sides of the angle at segments a and b, and we aim to show that left|frac{1}{a}-frac{1}{b}right| is independent of the position of the secant line.  Step 1: Set Up the Problem Let’s denote the given angle as angle XAY and the external bisector as line l. Assume that there is a point P on the external bisector l, and a secant line through P intersecting the sides AX and AY at points B and C, respectively.  Step 2: Use Similar Triangles Since P lies on the external bisector of the angle angle XAY: - triangle ABP and triangle ACP are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) criterion for similarity (as they share angle angle BAP or angle CAP and have corresponding angles at A).  Step 3: Relationship with Angles Since triangle ABP sim triangle ACP, we have: [ frac{AP}{AP} = frac{AB}{AC} = frac{PB}{PC} ] However, since P is on the external bisector, there’s an additional property related to the segments cut off by any secant through P. We know that: [ angle BAX = angle CAY ] Thus, the triangle similarity tells us that the lengths AB and AC are proportional under the angle bisector theorem modified for external bisectors. From the Angle-Bisector Theorem, we have: [ frac{AB}{BX} = frac{AC}{CY} ] But since the bisector is external and we consider segments forming a secant, the essence of a and b is: [ a = AB + BX quad text{and} quad b = AC + CY ]  Step 4: Deriving left|frac{1}{a} - frac{1}{b}right| Since AB and AC are segments proportional to BX and CY, let's substitute: [ a = k_1 cdot AB quad text{and} quad b = k_2 cdot AC ] with certain constants of proportionality, k_1 and k_2. From the similarity relations, it follows that: [ frac{1}{a} = frac{1}{k_1 cdot AB}quad text{and}quad frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{k_2 cdot AC} ] Thus, [ left|frac{1}{a} - frac{1}{b}right| = left|frac{1}{k_1 cdot AB} - frac{1}{k_2 cdot AC}right| ] By cross multiplication and relations obtained from the angle bisector properties, [ left| frac{AC}{k_2 cdot AB cdot AC} - frac{AB}{k_1 cdot AB cdot AC} right| = left| frac{k_2}{k_1 cdot k_2 cdot k_2} - frac{k_1}{k_1 cdot k_1 cdot k_2} right| = frac{|k_2 - k_1|}{k_1 cdot k_2} ] Thus it is consistent and does not depend on the particular position of the secant lines as constants k_1 and k_2 serve the equal proportions. # Conclusion: [ boxed{left|frac{1}{a} - frac{1}{b}right| text{ is independent of the position of the secant line}} ]"},{"instruction":"A standard deck of 52 cards is used.

Let the foci correspond to points ( V_o ).      - Note that the altitudes are crucial in the setup of our ellipses as their corresponding foci (V_o) are aligned with the altitudes (AN) and (CH). 3. **Utilize the Definition of Ellipses**:     - Recall that an ellipse is the set of points such that the sum of the distances to the foci is constant.     - Since the foci of our ellipses are aligned along the directions perpendicular to (AN) and (CH), observe:         [         text{Distance from } H text{ along the ellipse } = text{Distance from } A text{ along the ellipse to } B_0         ]         This symmetry simplifies our analysis. 4. **Equal Distance and Ratio Relationship**:     - The distances from the orthocenter ( H ) to the points on the ellipses and the related ratios give:         [         text{Distance from } A text{ to } V_0 = text{Distance from } C text{ to } B_0         ]         - The above equality hinges on the orthocentric property where the altitudes intersect at a common point (H). 5. **Apply the Resulting Geometric Property**:     - For the points of intersection of the ellipses, as both ellipses relate to the orthocenter’s distances, their intersection implies a line passing through ( H ).     - Since the ellipses' definitions anchor on the common focus properties and intersection, the points of intersection must be collinear with the orthocenter. 6. **Confirm the Points on a Line**:     - By confirming the distances share identical focus-determined properties:         [         frac{text{Distance from a point on ellipse to } V_0}{text{Distance from another point on ellipse to } V_0} = 1 text{ (or reciprocal ratios)}         ]     - Hence, the points of intersection in coherence with the ratio polar property must be collinear, passing through (H) or some focal line connected to the orthocenter. # Conclusion: Since the geometric construction relies on the shared focus points and distances, and seeing that their intersection aligns with the orthocenter, it implies collinearity through fundamental ellipse intersection properties and triangle orthocentric properties. <div style=\\"text-align: center;\\">     (blacksquare) </div>"},{"instruction":"Let x, y, z be real numbers such that x + y + z = 6 and xy + xz + yz = 10.

For simplicity, assume the square is axis-aligned with vertices at ((a, b)), ((a, d)), ((c, b)), and ((c, d)).    - The boundary of the square consists of four line segments. Each line segment can be described by a linear polynomial equation:      - ( y = b ) for ( a leq x leq c )      - ( y = d ) for ( a leq x leq c )      - ( x = a ) for ( b leq y leq d )      - ( x = c ) for ( b leq y leq d )    - However, the interior of the square cannot be described by a single polynomial equation.

The equation of the full circle is:      [      x^2 + y^2 = r^2      ]    - The closed half-circle includes points where ( y geq 0 ).

We recognize that this series is a geometric progression with the first term (a = 1) and the common ratio (r = 10^2 = 100), and it has (k + 1) terms. 3. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:    [    S = a frac{r^{n} - 1}{r - 1}    ]    where (a) is the first term, (r) is the common ratio, and (n) is the number of terms. 4. Applying the formula to our series where (a=1), (r=100), and (n=k+1):    [    S = 1 frac{100^{k+1} - 1}{100 - 1} = frac{100^{k+1} - 1}{99}    ] 5.

This shows that both factors in the numerator are greater than 1. 8.

Since the slope of OB is frac{3-0}{3-0} = 1, the slope of the perpendicular bisector of OB will be -1 (perpendicular slopes are negative reciprocals). 2. **Equation of Perpendicular Bisectors:**    - For segment OA, the perpendicular bisector is y=2.    - For segment OB, using the point-slope form of a line, y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is the midpoint, we get y - frac{3}{2} = -1left(x - frac{3}{2}right).

Consider an integer ( k ) greater than 1. We define a positive integer ( n ) such that:    [    2^{n-1} leq k < 2^n    ] 2.

We note that an element ( x ) in ( A_n ) can be represented as ( x = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i 10^i ) where ( a_i ) is either 0 or 1. 3. The number of elements in ( A_n ) is given by:    [    |A_n| = 2^n    ] 4.

Given ( 2^n > k ), there must be at least two distinct elements ( x ) and ( y ) in ( A_n ) that leave the same remainder when divided by ( k ). This can be concluded by the Pigeonhole Principle. 6. Therefore, we have:    [    x equiv y , (text{mod} , k) Rightarrow k mid (x - y)    ] 7. Since ( x ) and ( y ) are both constructed from the digits 0 and 1, their difference ( p = |x - y| ) is formed using the digits 0, 1, 8, and 9 (due to subtracting binary numbers). Hence, ( p ) can only use at most these 4 different digits. 8. We now need to show that ( p ) is less than ( k^4 ). We start by bounding ( p ):    [    p leq max A_n = frac{10^n - 1}{9}    ] 9.

With (p = 2) and (q = 97), we now calculate the value of (frac{p}{q} + frac{q}{p}):    [    frac{p}{q} + frac{q}{p} = frac{2}{97} + frac{97}{2}    ] 5. To simplify (frac{2}{97} + frac{97}{2}), we need a common denominator:    [    frac{2}{97} + frac{97}{2} = frac{2 cdot 2 + 97 cdot 97}{2 cdot 97} = frac{4 + 9409}{194} = frac{9413}{194}    ] 6. Thus, the value of (frac{2}{97} + frac{97}{2}) is:    [    frac{9413}{194}    ] # Conclusion: Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{frac{9413}{194}})."},{"instruction":"Given 3 skew lines.

The perpendicular bisector of ( [AC] ) intersects ( (AB) ) at ( P ), and the perpendicular bisector of ( [AB] ) intersects ( (AC) ) at ( Q ). We need to demonstrate that ( PQ = BC ).  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Properties of Perpendicular Bisectors:**    - By definition, the point ( P ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of ( [AC] ). This implies that ( P ) is equidistant from ( A ) and ( C ). Hence, ( AP = PC ).    - Similarly, the point ( Q ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of ( [AB] ), making ( Q ) equidistant from ( A ) and ( B ). Thus, ( AQ = QB ). 2. **Equilateral Triangle Properties:**    - Notice that ( widehat{PAC} = widehat{BAC} = 60^circ ). Because ( AP = PC ) (as just proven), triangle ( APC ) is isosceles with ( widehat{PAC} = 60^circ ). An isosceles triangle with a ( 60^circ ) angle must be equilateral; therefore, triangle ( APC ) is equilateral, meaning ( AP = AC ).    - In the same way, observe ( widehat{BAQ} = widehat{BAC} = 60^circ ) and ( AQ = QB ). The triangle ( ABQ ) is also equilateral, meaning ( AQ = AB ). 3. **Symmetry Argument:**    - Define ( s ) as the reflection symmetry with respect to the angle bisector of ( widehat{BAC} ). Since the angle bisector of ( widehat{BAC} ) is 60 degrees and both ( widehat{PAC} ) and ( widehat{QAB} ) are symmetric around this line, the perpendicular bisectors and their respective points ( P ) and ( Q ) will similarly be symmetric. 4. **Reflection Mapping:**    - In symmetry ( s ), point ( C ) maps to point ( P ), denoted as ( s(C) = P ).    - Similarly, point ( B ) maps to ( Q ), denoted as ( s(B) = Q ). 5. **Equal Segments:**    - By this symmetry mapping, segment ( [PQ] ) is the image of segment ( [BC] ) under the reflection ( s ). Hence, ( PQ ) and ( BC ) are congruent (equal in length).

The Baron claims that if you take one weight of each kind, the total weight of these 1000 weights will be less than 2^{1010}, and this weight cannot be achieved by combining weights from this set in any other way. Could the Baron's words be true?","output":"1. **Problem Statement Recap**:     Baron Munchausen has a set of weights consisting of 1000 distinct integers, with 2^{1000} weights of each integer. The claim is if he takes one weight of every possible kind, the total weight will be less than 2^{1010}, and this total weight cannot be achieved by any other combination of weights from this set.  2. **Weight Set Definition**:     Let's define the set of weights as follows:    [    a_{k-1} = 2^k - 2^{k-1},quad a_{k-2} = 2^k - 2^{k-2},quad ldots,quad a_0 = 2^k - 2^0    ]    where ( k = 1000 ). 3. **Sum of Weights Calculation**:    We need to calculate the sum ( S ) of these 1000 weights:    [    S = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (2^k - 2^i)    ]    Simplifying, we separate the summation into two parts:    [    S = k cdot 2^k - sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i    ]    The sum of powers of 2 from ( 2^0 ) to ( 2^{k-1} ) is a geometric series:    [    sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i = 2^k - 1    ]    Substituting this back into our expression for ( S ):    [    S = k cdot 2^k - (2^k - 1) = (k-1) cdot 2^k + 1    ] 4. **Validation Against the Upper Bound**:    For ( k = 1000 ), we check the expression:    [    S = 999 cdot 2^{1000} + 1    ]    We need to show ( S < 2^{1010} ). Considering the growth rates:    [    999 cdot 2^{1000} < 1000 cdot 2^{1000} = 2^{1000} cdot 10^3    ]    As ( 2^{1000} times 10^3 ) is significantly smaller than ( 2^{1010} ):    [    2^{1000} times 10^3 < 2^{1010}    ]    This validates ( S < 2^{1010} ). 5. **Uniqueness by Modulo Analysis**:    We use modulo arithmetic to confirm the uniqueness of the sum:    [    S equiv 1 pmod{2^k}    ]    Suppose there is another combination of weights giving the same sum ( S ). Each ( a_i equiv -2^i pmod{2^k} ). Thus, to achieve 1 modulo ( 2^k ) by summing these ( -2^i )'s, one would need to form a set that sums to:    [    2^k - 1 = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i    ]    This is only possible if the sums ( a_{k-1}+a_{k-2}+cdots+a_0 ). Any deviation would result in combinations exceeding the required modular sum properties. 6. **Replacement and Sum Increase Proof**:    If we replace one power of 2 by two smaller ones (or vice versa), it inherently increases the sum due to the weights defined. This means our chosen method is indeed the unique sum ( S ). **Conclusion**: The uniqueness and condition ( S < 2^{1010} ) hold true. Therefore, Baron Munchausen's statement is correct.

This statement is key to showing a contradiction.    **Base case:**    - For a single ( 3 ), i.e., ( 3^1 = 3 ), the 10s digit is considered to be 0 by convention.    - For a single ( 7 ), i.e., ( 7^1 = 7 ), the 10s digit is again considered to be 0.    **Induction step:**    - Suppose ( 3^m times 7^n ) has an even 10s digit.    - When we multiply by 3 or 7, we have to check the resulting 10s digit parity.      - Multiplying ( 1, 3, 7, 9 ) by ( 3 ) results in the final digits ( 3, 9, 21 rightarrow 1 (carry 2), 27 rightarrow 7 (carry 2) ). Hence, the carries are ( 0, 0, 2, 2 ), all even.      - Multiplying ( 1, 3, 7, 9 ) by ( 7 ) results in final digits ( 7, 21 rightarrow 1 (carry 2), 49 rightarrow 9 (carry 4), 63 rightarrow 3 (carry 6) ). Hence, the carries are ( 0, 2, 4, 6 ), all even. Thus, by inductive reasoning, the 10s digit in every case remains even. 4. **Contradiction and conclusion:**    Since based on above fact ( N ), having a 10s digit that must remain even, does not meet the constraints for digits from ({1, 3, 7, 9}), we must conclude that we cannot form such numbers using only factors ( 3 ) and ( 7 ). Therefore, any number formed strictly from digits ( {1, 3, 7, 9} ) must have a prime factor (geq 11).

We want to rearrange the coins in the correct order of their weights, but we do not have any extra space, so we can only swap two coins (not necessarily adjacent) in each step. Prove that during this rearrangement process, at some step, we had to swap a gold coin with a silver coin.","output":"To address the problem of proving that we must exchange an odd number of steps between a gold and a silver coin, we will delve into the details utilizing the proposed methods.  First Method 1. **Initial Coloring of Coins**:    Let's denote the coins sequentially from 1 to k. We will color the positions as follows:    - If a coin in position i is silver, color it white.    - If a coin in position i is gold, color it yellow. 2. **Initial Positioning**:    According to the problem, the heaviest coin (say gold) is mistakenly placed in the last position, while the second heaviest is placed first, and so forth. 3. **Exchange Effects on Coloring**:    - If we exchange two coins of the same type (both gold or both silver), their positions' colors do not change.    - If we exchange two coins of different types (one gold and one silver), their positions' colors change. 4. **Proof by Initialization**:    Given the starting arrangement and the fact that there are both gold and silver coins in the mix:    - Assume there exists at least one pair of consecutive positions (i, i+1), where one position contains a gold coin, and the other contains a silver coin (1 leq i < k).    - At the end, each initial position i that housed a coin has its coin advanced to the (i+1)-th position.    - Consequently, the adjacency previously noted changes its composition according to the exchange rules until the positions are correctly sorted. 5. **Necessary Condition for Sorting**:    Given the rules:    - If numbers i and (i+1) changed in color, we had exchanged a gold for a silver coin or vice versa. Since reordering necessitates appropriate positioning where the last coin is sorted by swapping with an adjacent lighter coin eventually, which would iterate until the entire sequence is sorted, there must be at least one instance where a gold coins exchanges places with a silver coin. Thus, we conclude that during the sorting process, it is mandatory to exchange a gold and a silver coin. blacksquare  Second Method: 1. **Initial Summation of Positions**:    Let S represent the sum of the positions of the silver coins initially:    [    S = sum (text{positions of silver coins})    ] 2. **Final Summation of Positions**:    - Since each coin should move exactly one step higher to maintain their relative heavier arrangement, our final sum transitions from S to S + k. Therefore:      [      text{Final sum } = S + k      ] 3. **Exchange Impact on Summation**:    - If we only exchanged silver for silver and gold for gold, the sum S would not change because same-type coin exchanges do not alter individual sums. However, since the sum transforms, this rigidity implies some steps involved different coin types. 4. **Conclusion based on Summation Proof**:    Given the necessary alteration made to the summation and the rules defined, it is an evident indication that silver must have exchanged places with a gold coin, enforcing the problem's thesis. Thus, we confirm that an interchange between different coin-type (gold and silver) is essential to achieve the complete reordering. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Michael runs 8 laps on the school track, each lap being 400 meters.

The length of the faster train is 75.006 meters, and it takes 15 seconds to pass the man in the slower train completely. To find the relative speed, we can use the formula: Relative speed = Distance / Time The distance is the length of the faster train, which is 75.006 meters, and the time is 15 seconds. Relative speed = 75.006 meters / 15 seconds Relative speed = 5.0004 meters per second Now, we need to convert this relative speed from meters per second to kilometers per hour to compare it with the given speed of the faster train (50 kmph). To convert meters per second to kilometers per hour, we multiply by 3.6 (since 1 m/s is equivalent to 3.6 km/h): Relative speed in km/h = 5.0004 m/s * 3.6 km/h per m/s Relative speed in km/h = 18.00144 km/h This relative speed is the difference in speed between the faster train and the slower train. Since we know the speed of the faster train is 50 kmph, we can find the speed of the slower train by subtracting the relative speed from the speed of the faster train: Speed of slower train = Speed of faster train - Relative speed Speed of slower train = 50 kmph - 18.00144 km/h Speed of slower train ≈ 31.99856 km/h Therefore, the speed of the slower train is approximately boxed{31.99856}  km/h."},{"instruction":"A conference has 500 delegates, and each delegate knows more than 400 other delegates.

Using triangular relations and triangular inequalities: If AD is also a unit length, mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{d} = cos angle AOD. Using spherical cosine rule or vector algebra, we compute mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{d} considering angle AOD. Since accurate computation might need actual angles or alternative vector components: [AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2 - 2 cdot AB cdot BD cdot cos angle ABD implies cos angle AOD = -frac{1}{7}] as a reasonable guess based on vector ADC being planar and symmetrical relations.

The contact triangle of a given triangle is formed by the points where the incircle touches the sides of the triangle. 3. **Midpoints of Contact Points**: Define P_{XY} as the midpoint of the segment joining the contact points X_1 and Y_1, where X, Y in {A, B, C, D, E, F}. 4. **Cross Ratio Invariance**: We use the property of cross ratios and the fact that they are preserved under projective transformations.

Since B is the upper vertex, its coordinates are (0, b). For any point P(x_0, y_0) on the ellipse, we have the equation of the ellipse as frac{x_0^2}{a^2} + frac{y_0^2}{b^2} = 1. This leads to the expression for x_0^2 as x_0^2 = a^2left(1 - frac{y_0^2}{b^2}right). Given that the distance |PB| leqslant 2b, we calculate |PB|^2 as follows: begin{align*} |PB|^2 &= x_0^2 + (y_0 - b)^2  &= a^2left(1 - frac{y_0^2}{b^2}right) + (y_0 - b)^2  &= a^2 - frac{a^2}{b^2}y_0^2 + y_0^2 - 2by_0 + b^2  &= a^2 + b^2 - 2by_0 + left(1 - frac{a^2}{b^2}right)y_0^2  &= a^2 + b^2 - 2by_0 - frac{c^2}{b^2}y_0^2, end{align*} where we used the fact that a^2 = b^2 + c^2 and thus a^2 - b^2 = c^2. The axis of symmetry for |PB|^2 as a function of y_0 is found by setting the derivative with respect to y_0 to zero, which gives y_0 = -frac{b^3}{c^2}. For the condition |PB| leqslant 2b to hold for all points on the ellipse, we need to ensure that the maximum value of |PB|^2 does not exceed (2b)^2 = 4b^2. When -frac{b^3}{c^2} leqslant -b, or equivalently b geqslant c, the maximum value of |PB|^2 occurs at y_0 = -b. Substituting y_0 = -b into our expression for |PB|^2 and setting it equal to 4b^2, we find that the condition simplifies to b^2 geqslant c^2, or a^2 - c^2 geqslant c^2. This gives us the inequality for the eccentricity e = frac{c}{a} leqslant frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Considering the range of e, we know that 0 < e < 1 for an ellipse, so combining this with our derived inequality, we find that the range of e is (0, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}].

The general expression for the static moment ( M_{ij} ) for the given triangle is:     [     M_{xy} = M_{yz} = M_{xz} = iint_{sigma} z , dsigma     ]          We need to integrate ( z = a - x - y ) over the triangular region defined by ( 0 leq x leq a ) and ( 0 leq y leq a - x ):     [     begin{aligned}     M_{xy} &= int_{0}^{a} int_{0}^{a-x} (a - x - y) cdot sqrt{3} , dy , dx      &= sqrt{3} int_{0}^{a} left( int_{0}^{a-x} (a - x - y) , dy right) dx      &= sqrt{3} int_{0}^{a} left[ (a - x)y - frac{y^2}{2} right]_{0}^{a-x} dx      &= sqrt{3} int_{0}^{a} left[ (a - x)(a - x) - frac{(a - x)^2}{2} right] dx      &= sqrt{3} int_{0}^{a} left( (a - x)^2 - frac{(a - x)^2}{2} right) dx      &= sqrt{3} int_{0}^{a} left( frac{(a - x)^2}{2} right) dx      &= frac{sqrt{3}}{2} int_{0}^{a} (a - x)^2 , dx      &= frac{sqrt{3}}{2} int_{0}^{a} (a^2 - 2ax + x^2) , dx      &= frac{sqrt{3}}{2} left[ a^2x - a x^2 + frac{x^3}{3} right]_{0}^{a}      &= frac{sqrt{3}}{2} left[ a^3 - a^3 + frac{a^3}{3} right]      &= frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{a^3}{3}      &= frac{sqrt{3}}{6} a^3     end{aligned}     ]     Therefore, the static moments are:     [     M_{xy} = M_{yz} = M_{xz} = frac{sqrt{3}}{6} a^3     ] 3. **Compute the Centroid Coordinates:**     The coordinates of the centroid ( (x_c, y_c, z_c) ) can be found from the symmetry and properties of an equilateral triangle. For an equilateral and homogeneous triangle, the centroid divides each median in the ratio ( 2:1 ), so each coordinate (due to symmetry) is:     [     x_c = y_c = z_c = frac{a}{3}     ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{ M_{xy} = M_{yz} = M_{xz} = frac{sqrt{3}}{6} a^3, quad x_c = y_c = z_c = frac{a}{3} } ]"},{"instruction":"Given the following propositions:  1.

The variance, which measures the spread of the data around the mean, remains unchanged by such a linear transformation that only shifts the data. Therefore, the sample variances of the two sets of sample data are the same.  **For option B:** The mean of the original data set x can be calculated as follows: [ overline{x} = frac{2 + 4 + ldots + 30}{15} = frac{2(1) + 2(15)}{2} cdot frac{15}{15} = frac{2 + 30}{2} = 16. ] For the transformed data set y, where y_{i} = x_{i} - 20, the mean is: [ overline{y} = overline{x} - 20 = 16 - 20 = -4. ] Thus, the sample means of the two sets of sample data are not the same, making option B incorrect. **For option C:** To find the 30th percentile of the sample data y_{1}, y_{2}, ldots, y_{15}, we calculate 30% of 15 which gives 4.5.

We need to prove that lines CK and A'B' are perpendicular. 2. **Step 1**: Since I is the incenter of triangle ABC, it lies on the angle bisectors AA' and BB'. The point K is the reflection of I across AB. Therefore, K is also equidistant from A and B. 3. **Step 2**: Consider the cyclic quadrilateral CBKA. Since K is the reflection of I across AB, K lies on the circumcircle of triangle CBI. This is because the reflection of a point across a line preserves the circumcircle property. 4. **Step 3**: Let CK intersect AB at point F. We need to show that FA'CA is cyclic. Since K is the reflection of I across AB, CK is the reflection of CI across AB.  5. **Step 4**: Since I is the incenter, angle AIC = 90^circ + frac{angle A}{2}. Reflecting I across AB does not change the angle angle AIC. Therefore, angle AKC = 90^circ + frac{angle A}{2}. 6. **Step 5**: Since FA'CA is cyclic, we have angle CA'A = angle CFA = 120^circ - frac{angle A}{2}. This follows from the fact that angle C = 60^circ and the sum of angles in a triangle is 180^circ. 7. **Step 6**: Since A'I = B'I (as I is the incenter), we have angle A'B'I = angle B'A'I = 30^circ. This is because the angle bisectors divide the angles into equal parts. 8. **Step 7**: To prove that CK and A'B' are perpendicular, we need to show that angle (CK, A'B') = 90^circ.

For every set of 3 collinear points, there is a single line passing through them instead of 3 distinct lines. This reduces the number of distinct lines by 2 for each set of 3 collinear points. 3. **Calculate the reduction in the number of lines:**    Let ( k ) be the number of sets of 3 collinear points. Each set of 3 collinear points reduces the number of distinct lines by 2. Therefore, the number of distinct lines is:    [    2080 - 2k    ]    Given that the number of distinct lines is 2015, we set up the equation:    [    2080 - 2k = 2015    ]    Solving for ( k ):    [    2080 - 2015 = 2k implies 65 = 2k implies k = frac{65}{2} = 32.5    ]    Since ( k ) must be an integer, this is a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that no set of 4 or more collinear points exists must be false. 4. **Conclusion:**    Since the assumption leads to a contradiction, there must be at least one set of 4 or more collinear points among the 65 points.

This implies that the sequence must also be eventually periodic modulo 8.    Consider the sequence modulo 8. If x_n is even and s(n) > 2, then x_{n+1} equiv 1 pmod{8}. Thus, if there exists k > N such that x_k equiv 3, 5, 7 pmod{8}, then s(k-1) leq 2.    Since k is in the period, the density of numbers k such that s(k) leq 2 must tend to frac{1}{T}. However, there are at most a + a^2 such numbers less than 10^a. For large enough a, frac{10^a}{T} > a + a^2 + c, leading to a contradiction.    Therefore, if x_n is in the period and is odd, then x_n equiv 1 pmod{8}. If x_n equiv 1 pmod{8}, then x_{n+1} equiv 2 pmod{8}, and the period alternates between odd and even.

If the sequence is periodic modulo m, then it is also periodic modulo p^k. Define A as the set of all residues of the period modulo p^k. First, we show that 2 in A:    Set n = 10^a(10^{phi(p^k)-1} + dots + 1) such that n > N. Then, phi(p^k) = s(n), thus x_{n+1} equiv c^{phi(p^k)} + 1 equiv 1, 2 pmod{p^k}. If it is equal to 2, we have 2 in A. Otherwise, x_{n+1} equiv 1 pmod{p^k}, then x_{n+2} equiv 2 pmod{p^k}. Either way, we have 2 in A.    Let x_{nT+r} equiv 2 pmod{p^k} for a constant r > N and all n geq 0. By looking at x_{Tn+r+1}, we have 2^{s(nT+r)} equiv 2^{s(r)} pmod{p^k}. Set n rightarrow 10^a cdot n for a very large a. Then, s(10^a nT + r) = s(nT) + s(r), so we conclude that 2^{s(nT)} equiv 1 pmod{p^k}. Call this **.

Set such a number as bT where it has i consecutive ones and j consecutive zeroes.    Now, n_1 = b(9 + 10^i), n_2 = b(9 + 10^{i-1}), then s(n_1 T) = 9 + s(n_2 T). Thus, putting these in ** and combining, we get that 2^9 equiv 1 pmod{p^k}. But 511 equiv 0 pmod{p^k}, which is a contradiction since p^k does not divide 511.

A spermatogonial cell with a genotype of AaX^bY, during the meiotic process, due to chromosome distribution disorders, produces a sperm with the genotype AAaY. Then the genotypes of the other three sperms would be aY, X^b, and X^b respectively. C.

The genotype AaBb, assuming independent assortment, can produce sperm with genotypes A, B, aB, ab, or Ab after meiosis. This is because each allele will separate during meiosis I and gametes will get one allele from each pair. So the statement is accurate. B. This statement claims a spermatogonial cell with the genotype AaX^bY can, due to a mishap in chromosome distribution, produce a sperm with the genotype AAaY. This is not possible under normal circumstances as meiosis creates gametes with one set of chromosomes. If a distribution error occurs, the resulting gametes would not have balanced sets of alleles as claimed. The secondary sperms would also not have the correct number of chromosomes. Hence, this statement is incorrect. C. This statement is false because a spermatogonial cell during mitosis will not necessarily end up with two Y chromosomes. The same goes for a secondary spermatocyte after meiosis II; it should end up with one sex chromosome, either X or Y. Thus, it cannot have two Y chromosomes normally. D. If the female animal is Aa, during meiosis, each oocyte will get either an A or an a allele. If there were 10 A alleles in primary oocytes, after meiosis, at most 5 ova with the a allele can be formed as each oocyte only contributes to one ovum after meiosis. This statement is correct.

Counting all possible such selections is straightforward: 5. **Calculation**:     [     text{Total possibilities} = 3^{20}     ]     Therefore, each term in the expansion (1 + x + y)^{20} is a product of 20 terms, where each term can be either 1, x, or y.

Then from the equation (c=2000((d+1)+(d+1))), it follows that (d+1) and (c) must be of the same color (since (2000((d+1)+(d+1)) = 2000 cdot 2 (d+1) = c)). 3. **Another Formulation**:     Alternatively, suppose (c=2000(d+(d+2))). From this, numbers (d), (d+2), and (d+1) must either be of the same color or each of a different color. 4. **Implication for Sequences**:      Hence, any three consecutive numbers must be either of the same color or of three different colors. Let's break this into:     - Start with 1, 2, 3:         - If 1, 2, 3 are of the same color, consider the triplet 2, 3, 4, then 3, 4, 5, and so on. By induction, all numbers will end up being the same color.            - Assume now 1 is color (A), 2 is color (B), 3 is color (C). For the sequence to hold:         - Considering 2, 3, 4: 4 must be color (A)         - Next 3, 4, 5: 5 must be color (B), and so forth. 5. **Mathematical Form Validation**:     Consider the general form:     - (a = 3k_1 + r_1)     - (b = 3k_2 + r_2)     - (c = 3k_3 + r_3), where (r_1, r_2, r_3) are the remainders when (a, b, c) are divided by 3.     From the equality (2000(a+b)=2000(3k_1 + r_1 + 3k_2 + r_2)=3M-r_1-r_2=c=3k_3+r_3) we see the requirement that (r_1 + r_2 equates r_3). Therefore:     - The sums of remainders (r_1, r_2, r_3) must be divisible by 3, implying they must either all be identical, or all distinctly different from one another. 6. **Conclusion**:     Finally, the required colorations which satisfy the condition are:     - Color all natural numbers the same color.     - Color numbers (3k - 2, k in mathbb{N}) color (A), numbers (3k - 1) color (B), and numbers (3k) color (C).

Let's color the (2D) lattice such that the point ((i, j)) has the same color as the integer (mi + nj). 2. Consider any unit square in this lattice. Each unit square consists of vertices at ((i, j)), ((i+1, j)), ((i, j+1)), and ((i+1, j+1)) for some integer (i) and (j).    Assign:    [    h = mi + nj    ]    The colors at these vertices will be the same as the colors of the integers:    [    h, quad h + m, quad h + n, quad h + m + n    ]     Suppose that any two of these points are the same color. The differences between any two of these points will be (m), (n), (m + n), or (pm(m - n)), respectively. This gives a direct contradiction to our supposition. 3. Consequently, each unit square on the lattice must have all four vertices in different colors. 4. Next, consider any three adjacent points on any row in the lattice.

Proceed to determine the adjacent colors as per the rule of initial assumption. 5. If we extend the process indefinitely, we will find that this pattern must repeat. But since ( m ) and ( n ) are distinct odd numbers, such a coloring pattern must be periodic with a period of at least 2. 6. To see why, consider:    - If three different points in any given row with different colors cannot exist, then each row must be periodic with period 2.    - Every subsequent row follows the same period until all rows follow a periodic pattern making the rows periodic with period 2.     7. Suppose all rows indeed have a period of 2.

The domain given is [-2,2b]. For the domain to be symmetric about 0, we require that -2 = -2b and 2b = 2. This implies that b = 1. Therefore, the domain is [-2,2]. 2. **Monotonicity Analysis**:    - The function is monotonically increasing on [-2,0]. Given that f(x) is an even function, this implies it is monotonically decreasing on [0,2] because the behavior on the positive side of the domain mirrors the behavior on the negative side. 3. **Inequality Transformation**:    - The condition f(x+1) leqslant f(-1) can be transformed using the property of even functions. For even functions, f(x) = f(-x). Therefore, we can rewrite the inequality as f(|x+1|) leqslant f(|-1|) because f(x+1) and f(-1) can be considered as f(|x+1|) and f(|-1|) respectively, due to the even nature of f(x). 4. **Solving the Inequality**:    - We derive two conditions from the transformed inequality:      - Condition ①: |x+1| geqslant 1.

It is sold at 144 after two successive discounts. The second discount is 20%. What is the first discount percentage?","output":"To find the first discount percentage, we need to work backwards from the final sale price to the original price. First, let's find the price after the first discount but before the second discount. Since the second discount is 20%, the price after the second discount (144) is 80% of the price after the first discount. Let's call the price after the first discount P. So we have: 0.80 * P = 144 To find P, we divide both sides by 0.80: P = 144 / 0.80 P = 180 Now we know the price after the first discount was 180. To find the first discount percentage, we need to compare this price to the original price. The original price was 199.99999999999997 (which we can round to 200 for simplicity). The discount amount for the first discount is the difference between the original price and the price after the first discount: Discount Amount = Original Price - Price After First Discount Discount Amount = 200 - 180 Discount Amount = 20 Now we can find the first discount percentage by dividing the discount amount by the original price and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage: First Discount Percentage = (Discount Amount / Original Price) * 100 First Discount Percentage = (20 / 200) * 100 First Discount Percentage = 0.10 * 100 First Discount Percentage = 10% So the first discount percentage is boxed{10%} ."},{"instruction":"Among the following numbers, the smallest one is: A: 0 B: 2 C: 1 D: sqrt{3}","output":"To determine the smallest number among the given options, we compare each of them: - Comparing 0 and -2, we have -2 < 0. - Comparing 1 and -2, we have -2 < 1. - To compare -sqrt{3} and -2, we note that sqrt{3} approx 1.73, so -sqrt{3} > -2 since -1.73 > -2.

The proof is then complete. blacksquare"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],W={key:0},N={key:1};function L(n,e,h,u,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
