Paragraph: Though prehistoric remains from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages have been unearthed in the Manzanares Valley, prior to Madrid's sudden elevation to capital city in 1561 its history was rather undistinguished. Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town. From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic monarchs that united all the provinces of Spain, first visited Madrid in 1477.

News article: General Motors CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday she wants to find out if GM engineering employees executed a coverup or were merely incompetent in failing to recall a defective part linked to 13 deaths.      In testimony before a House Energy and Commerce Committee panel investigating why the automaker waited years to fix the vehicles, Barra said she has asked former U.S. attorney Anton “Tony” Valukas to help figure that out.      Previously Valukas investigated the collapse of the Lehman Bros. financial services firm in 2008.      Barra also issued yet another apology for GM's failure to fix the problem years earlier. She conceded that company officials knew of issues with the faulty ignition switches behind the crashes and deaths for more than a decade.      Barra said she found the automaker's worries about the cost to fix defective cars \\"disturbing.\\" Those concerns were detailed in documents obtained by the House committee.      “That is not acceptable,” Barra said. “Today, if there is safety issue ... if we know that there is a safety defect on our vehicles, we don’t look at the cost but at the speed at which we can fix the problem.”      Barra’s apologies notwithstanding, GM legally shed responsibility for crashes before the automaker's 2009 bankruptcy and federal bailout. The restructuring created a new company, which bought the assets of the old GM, but allowed it to shed its debts and legal liabilities.      But Barra, in more than two hours of testimony, hinted GM might compensate victims and their families in connection with recall-related accidents that took place before the bankruptcy.      \\"We do understand we have civic responsibilities as well as legal responsibilities,\\" she said when asked about how the company would handle pre-bankruptcy crashes.      Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) asked if GM purposely withheld information about problems with the ignition switch and other safety issues when it was negotiating the terms of its bankruptcy and federal bailout in 2009.      Barra said she was not aware of any effort to hide information about potential liabilities, “but I can’t speak to every single person.”      Barra said the company has hired Kenneth Feinberg as a consultant to explore and evaluate options for the families of victims of accidents caused by the defective part.      “Mr. Feinberg is highly qualified, and is very experienced in the handling of matters such as this,” Barra said. “He brings expertise and objectivity to this effort, and will help us evaluate the situation and recommend the best path forward.”      Feinberg has previously handled compensation issues for victims of 9/11, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the Boston Marathon bombings.      “My mandate from the company is to consider the options for dealing with issues surrounding the ignition switch matter, and to do so in an independent, balanced and objective manner, based upon my prior experience,” Feinberg said.      Barra also told the panel that the automaker made “mistakes” in not recalling vehicles with a deadly flaw years ago.      Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) an industrial engineer, asked Barra why the company used an ignition switch that did not meet company specifications.      “Why in the world would a company with the stellar reputation of General Motors purchase a part that did not meet its own specifications?” he said.      Barra responded: “I want to know that as much as you do.”      When pressed on whether GM now would purchase parts that don’t meet specifications in the future, Barra said in some cases they do if the part meets safety, functionality and durability standards among others.      Barton called that answer “gobbledygook.”      “That’s not an acceptable answer for the American people,” he said. “There shouldn’t be a part used in any GM product ... that doesn’t meet the specifications.”      Although it knew about the problem as far back as 2001, GM only in the last two months has recalled 2.6 million vehicles to replace the defective ignition switch, which is now linked to 13 deaths. The switch can unintentionally turn off the vehicle and disable its airbags.      GM faces investigations from the NHTSA and the Justice Department into why it did not recall the vehicles sooner.      Barra is to be joined before the committee by David J. Friedman, the acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Lawmakers are set to quiz Friedman about why the safety agency didn’t force GM to recall the vehicles earlier. Documents show that the NHTSA was aware of the problem.      In his written testimony, Friedman said GM had failed to provide regulators “critical information” that could have triggered recalls years earlier. Only recently did GM provide “new evidence” that made it clear that the ignition problem could disable air bags, he said.      Meanwhile, families of victims of fatal crashes of the GM compact cars in question on Tuesday sharply criticized the automaker for delays in recalling the vehicles and called for legislation to prevent a repeat of the situation. About two dozen family members gathered in front of the Capitol to make their case before Barra and Friedman testified.      The families were joined by four Democratic lawmakers who want to toughen laws governing the disclosure of auto defects.      [For The Record, 5:46 p.m. PDT April 1: An earlier version of this post stated that Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) asked if GM purposely withheld information about problems with an ignition switch and other safety issues when it was negotiating the terms of its bankruptcy and federal bailout in 2009.

ADVERTISEMENT      GM CEO Mary Barra, testifying before Congress for the first time since taking the helm in January, expressed remorse to the people in the hearing room who lost family members in crashes linked to the defect.\\"Today's GM will do the right thing. That begins with my sincere apologies to everyone who has been affected by this recall, especially the families and friends who lost their lives or were injured. I am deeply sorry,\\" Barra said.Lawmakers pressed Barra to explain why it took so long for GM to address the problem with the vehicles, which rolled off assembly lines in the mid-2000s but were not recalled until earlier this year.“GM knew about this problem in 2001,” said Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.). “They were warned again and again over the next decade, but they did nothing.”DeGette held up an ignition switch with keys hanging from it to illustrate how easily the ignition in the vehicles could be cut.“If you had a heavy key chain like my mom, or … if you were short and you bumped up against the ignition with your knee, it could cause this key to switch right off,” DeGette said, adding that the problem was caused by a spring that costs “pennies.”Thirteen deaths have been linked to the ignition switch problem. Relatives of those victims were in attendance during Tuesday’s hearing and, earlier in the day, ripped the auto company during a press conference outside the Capitol.“Our daughters, sons, sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, wives and husbands are gone because they were a cost of doing business GM style,” said Maryland resident Laura Christian, whose daughter Amber Marie Rose was killed in a 2005 accident, while she was driving a Chevrolet Cobalt.Christian said GM executives “made a decision that ‘fighting’ the problem was cheaper and easier than ‘fixing’ the problem.”Barra took pains to distance herself from decisions that were made at the auto company before she took over as chief executive.\\"This is an extraordinary situation. It involves vehicles we no longer make, but it came to light on my watch, so I'm responsible for resolving it,” Barra told the panel. “When we have answers, we will be fully transparent with you, with our regulators and with our customers.”Lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee were hardly in a forgiving mood.      Representatives in both parties repeatedly pressed Barra to explain why the recall took so long and said complaints about the ignition switch started coming in almost as soon as many of the models hit the roadways.            “As soon as the Chevy Cobalt rolled off the production line in 2004, customers began filing complaints about the ignition switch,” said Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), the chairman of the subpanel.            “According to GM's public statements, it wasn't until December 2013 the company finally put the pieces together and linked the problems with the airbags with the faulty ignition switch almost 10 years after customers first told GM the Cobalt ignition switch didn't work,” Murphy said.            Murphy also questioned why regulators at the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) didn’t order the recall right away.            “The red flags were there for GM and NHTSA to take action, but for some reason, it did not happen. Why didn't GM and NHTSA put the pieces together for 10 years? Why didn't anyone ask the critical, important questions? Why did GM accept parts below their own company standards and specs?”            Barra was pressed about specific dates and times of GM’s actions involving the recalled cars, and appeared to get flustered, when lawmakers asked her to defend actions that occurred before her tenure as CEO.            “Clearly, there were a lot of things that happened,” she said. “There's been a lot of statements made as it relates. That's why we've hired [attorney] Anton Valukas to do a complete investigation of this process. We are spanning over a decade of time.”            Barra’s attempt to distance herself from her predecessors at GM was met with skepticism.            “You are the company right now,” Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said.            Barra attempted to stick to her forward-looking focus and told lawmakers said was determined to fix the damage done to the company and its customers.            She said GM has hired Washington attorney Ken Feinberg to be a consultant on the company’s response to the recall.            Feinberg is a specialist in corporate crisis compensation payments, having overseen payments to families of victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; the 2007 Virginia Tech University mass shooting and the 2010 BP oil spill.            Barr said she has told GM employees that “getting the cars repaired is only the first step” and is urging them to focus on being responsive to drivers of the recalled vehicles who are looking for repairs.            “Giving customers the best service possible is how we will be judged,” Barra said. ||||| During her opening statement, General Motors chief executive Mary Barra said that she does not know why it took years for the carmaker to announce a safety defect but she that she is committed to finding out. (The Associated Press)      During her opening statement, General Motors chief executive Mary Barra said that she does not know why it took years for the carmaker to announce a safety defect but she that she is committed to finding out. (The Associated Press)      General Motors chief executive Mary T. Barra on Tuesday deflected a barrage of questions on Capitol Hill about the automaker’s failure to fix a deadly ignition-switch flaw, telling lawmakers that she was unaware of the decade-old problem until early this year.      While she repeatedly apologized for a defect that GM has blamed for the deaths of at least 13 motorists, Barra also repeatedly ducked lawmakers’ sometimes testy queries, saying she is awaiting the results of an internal investigation.      A GM lifer who became the company’s top executive in mid-January, Barra took pains to make a distinction between the cost-conscious “old GM” — which, she admitted, missed a series of red flags and may have engineered a coverup — and the post-bankruptcy “new GM,” which Barra said is focused on customer safety.      “I cannot tell you why it took years for a safety defect to be announced,” Barra told a House Energy and Commerce Committee investigative panel. “I can tell you that we will find out.”      In her opening statement, Barra announced that Kenneth Feinberg, the lawyer who has helped mete out payments to victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and to victims of BP’s Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010, had been hired by GM to “explore and evaluate options in its response to families of accident victims.”      Prior to a House committee hearing with the chief executive of General Motors, lawmakers and families of victims killed in crashes involving GM cars held a news conference. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)      The move suggests that GM expects to face additional claims on behalf of people killed or injured in the recalled vehicles. Feinberg said Barra has asked him to examine options for compensating victims of the defect, which could include a broad settlement fund.      “Over the next 60 days, we hope to propose some objective claims-resolution approach that meets the needs of the victims, the company and the public interest,” Feinberg said in an interview.      GM has recalled 2.6 million Chevrolet Cobalts and other small vehicles because of the faulty switches. Lawmakers said GM could have fixed the defective switch for as little as 57 cents per vehicle. Still, the automaker waited more than a decade to issue a recall, despite mounting evidence of a problem, including 133 complaints to dealers and numerous legal settlements paid to families of people who perished in related accidents.      Barra’s testimony seemed to do little to mollify lawmakers, many of whom appeared to have scoured the thousands of pages of documents the company submitted to congressional investigators. One after another, they grilled her about questionable company decisions, such as installing switches that did not meet GM’s technical specifications and quietly approving a new switch design in 2006 without assigning a new part number or initiating a recall.      “Ms. Barra, I know this isn’t the most enjoyable situation for you. But we’re in a situation where we don’t trust the company right now,” said Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.).      The panel also heard from David Friedman, the acting head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which also failed for years to recognize the problem. Friedman pointed the finger at GM for not providing regulators with timely information that could have led federal regulators to order a recall.      “Our ability to find defects also requires automakers to act in good faith and on time,” Friedman said.      View Graphic A history of GM’s ignition problems      Asked by Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) whether GM had acted in good faith, Friedman said NHTSA has opened an investigation “to answer that exact question. And if we find they were not, we will hold them accountable.”      But lawmakers were also interested in NHTSA’s failures, demanding to know why the agency did not take action to determine why air bags in the Cobalt failed to deploy in a series of accidents — and to demand that GM remedy the problem.      Friedman defended the agency, saying it had compared the Cobalt’s track record with other vehicles and found no consistent trend. “When it came to [air bag] non-deployments, Cobalt was not an outlier,” he said.      Moreover, NHTSA investigators looking into specific crashes were not convinced that the air bags failed to deploy because of a faulty ignition switch. At the time, Friedman said, the idea that the switch could be jostled, flip to the “accessory” position and disable power steering, brakes and critical electronics, including air bags, was “one theory.”      “But in the crashes we looked at, investigators thought it was more likely that the air bag did not deploy because of the circumstances of the crash,” Friedman said.      “I know it looks like it should have been clear,” he added. “But it’s clear now in part because we have that clear connection from GM.”      The hearing took place in a room packed with observers, including the family members of people who died in the recalled vehicles. Photos of about a dozen crash victims — smiling young women, a Marine in his dress blues — were propped on a ledge at the back of the room.      Barra, who held a tearful meeting Monday night in GM’s Washington offices with nearly two dozen family members of crash victims, expressed her “sincere apologies to everyone who has been affected by this recall . . . especially to the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured. I am deeply sorry.”      She was less forthcoming about other matters. Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), the chairman of the subcommittee conducting the hearing, noted that GM had missed evidence of the defect for more than a decade. Citing documents submitted by GM, Murphy listed nearly a dozen specific instances where he said GM — or federal regulators — should have taken action.      “Why didn’t GM and NHTSA put the pieces together for 10 years? Why didn’t anyone ask the critically important questions?” Murphy said. “To borrow a phrase, what we have here is a failure to communicate — and the results are deadly.”      Barra said she found “very disturbing” a statement made by a GM official who in 2005 rejected a proposed fix for the flawed switch because it was not cost-      effective.      “That is not how we do business at today’s GM,” she said.      Throughout nearly two hours of testimony, Barra remained even-tempered and contrite. But she was also tight-lipped and, at times, evasive.      Asked how often the automaker uses parts that do not match its specifications, Barra said the company always aims to use parts that are safe and reliable. Parts that do not meet technical requirements, she said, are not necessarily defective.      “What you just answered is gobbledygook,” shot back Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.).      Later, after Barra had left the hearing room and been replaced at the witness table by Friedman, Barton summed up lawmakers’ reaction to her performance.      “I think it’s obvious,” he said, “that GM has some real questions that they’ve not done a very good job answering today.” ||||| Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Members of Congress on Tuesday pressed General Motors CEO Mary Barra on why apparently glaring signals over the years failed to prompt an earlier recall of potentially deadly cars. VPC      Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, arrives to testify before the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations during a hearing investigating the GM ignition switch recall in Washington. (Photo: H. Darr Beiser, USA TODAY)      WASHINGTON — In what already could be a turning point in her fledgling reign, General Motors CEO Mary Barra on Tuesday battled a congressional subcommittee that wanted far more information about GM's fatal ignition-switch foul-ups than she was able to provide.      She was battered for speaking \\"gobbledygook,\\" thumped for not firing an engineer who apparently concealed a change to the potentially deadly switches, and blasted because GM made an economic decision to keep the flawed component in production while knowing it didn't meet GM standards.      Barra, who has been CEO for less than three months, fielded questions from the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee for two hours, avoiding any obvious gaffes and keeping her cool but also largely ducking specific answers, saying an internal investigation is underway into why it took GM so long to address ignition-switch problems first detected in 2001 this year.      Representatives kept demanding \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" answers right now, while Barra, an engineer, wanted to explain. Nor could they fathom how the CEO of a company couldn't just find things out, while Barra said she shouldn't meddle in the internal investigation already underway by former U.S. attorney Anton Valukas.      She also announced that she is bringing in another outsider, a compensation expert, to help it sort out GM's response to consumers affected by the defect linked to 13 deaths: Ken Feinberg, an attorney who led victim compensation efforts in the World Trade Center attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the BP Gulf Coast oil spill and the Boston Marathon bombing.      Families of those losing their lives have asked that a victims fund be established. GM has remained silent on that subject but Barra said Feinberg will help \\"assess the appropriate next step.\\"      Barra told the panel looking into the recall of more than 2.53 million vehicles that the company has moved away from a \\"cost culture\\" to a more customer-friendly one.      \\"You talk about a new culture. Has anybody been held accountable?\\" demanded member Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La.      Barra said nobody has been fired or disciplined as a result of involvement in the switch fiasco, as far as she knows, but that could change when the investigation is finished.      Even then, she said, \\"we will share what's appropriate\\" and not necessarily the whole internal GM report. This irritated some committee members.      Some implied that GM might have concealed information about the problem-plagued switch to avoid carrying forward responsibility for damage, injuries and deaths caused by the switch into the \\"new GM\\" formed July 2009 after the car company's bankruptcy reorganization.      Barra seemed to suggest it was possible that happened: \\"I did not personally withhold anything. I can't speak to every single person.\\"      Asked about a report indicating that GM considered a fix in response to problems in 2004 because of the \\"lead time required, cost and effectiveness,\\" Barra said she \\"found that statement to be very disturbing\\" and called it \\"unacceptable. That is not how we do business in today's GM.\\"      \\"It's not acceptable to put a cost on a safety issue,\\" she later added under questioning.      With Barra facing the glare of a congressional investigation for the first time, however — and with the company's resurgent post-bankruptcy profits and reputation on the line — there was still little she could tell members to explain why it took GM more than a decade to link ignition switch issues with air bag deployment.      Over the past two months, the company has recalled millions of Chevrolet Cobalts and HHRs, Saturn Ions and Skys and Pontiac G5s and Solstices, saying the ignition switch could inadvertently be jostled out of position, potentially disabling the air bags in the event of a crash.      JAIL TIME? Key questions GM faces      STORY: Loved ones of crash victims speak out      The acting head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, David Friedman, was called to testify as well and said his agency missed the link, too, despite hundreds of complaints. Friedman, however, said the agency could have taken a closer look at the relationship between the ignition switches and air bag deployment if GM had shared more information with it.      Friedman said NHTSA considered investigating non-deployment in Chevrolet Cobalts and Saturn Ions in 2007 and in 2010 but that no discernible pattern was indicated. Neither car, he said, \\"stood out when compared to other vehicles.\\"      \\"We applied expertise, we applied understanding,\\" Friedman said. \\"I wish the connection was as direct as we now know it is.\\"      U.S. Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said Congress may need to make changes to ensure NHTSA considers a greater range of data and several legislators are talking about strengthening reporting rules for automakers in the wake of the recall.      \\"It appears we have a flaw in NHTSA's decision-making process,\\" Dingell said.      Barra and Friedman testify again Wednesday morning on the recall before a Senate subcommittee.      Rosie Cortinas, whose 23-year-old son Amador, of Caldwell, Idaho, died in a Cobalt crash five months ago, said she was frustrated with how the hearing went, believing Barra was holding back.      \\"I have to keep walking out,\\" she said, wiping a tear from an eye. \\"I feel like there is some kind of inhumanity in this room. They aren't looking at it as a human point of view. They are looking at it from a company's point of view.\\"      Committee members didn't appear to pull any punches and hammered away at Barra on information that the supplier of the switch, Michigan-based Delphi, told GM as early as 2002 that the switches did not meet the company's specifications yet it still accepted them.      \\"Why in the world would a company (like GM) purchase a part that did not meet its own specifications?\\" asked Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas.      \\"I want to know that as much as you do,\\" Barra responded, saying that it's part of the internal investigation but that she couldn't answer the question right now. \\"It's not how we do business today.\\"      During another part of her testimony, however, Barra suggested that there are circumstances where even if a part or product is substandard it doesn't mean that it's defective. Barton called this answer \\"gobbledygook.\\"      Members also questioned why an engineer at the company, identified in documents released by the committee from Delphi as Ray DeGiorgio, signed off on a change in 2006 to the ignition switch, apparently without the knowledge of others at GM. Another document from 2005 provided to the committee showed consideration of a change to the part but noted concerns over the cost — adding about 90 cents to the price of the switch.      Barra indicated that if the company had recalled all the switches in 2007, it would have cost the company less than 100 million. But there were clear indications that while a change was made to the part, \\"it appears there was information at one part of the company and another part of the company didn't have access to that,\\" she said.      While much of the questioning was polite, it was also dogged. Members of both parties continued to ask how GM — which knew there were issues with ignition switches as early as 2001 during preproduction of the Saturn Ion and approved the change to those switches in 2006 — could have missed so many warning signs for a recall.      \\"Documents produced to the committee show that both NHTSA and GM received complaints and data about problems with ignition switches and air bags. The complaints go back at least 10 years,\\" said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who chairs the full House Energy and Commerce Committee.      \\"A small spring inside the switch — a piece that cost pennies — failed to provide enough force, causing the switch to turn off when the car went over a bump,\\" added Rep. Diana DeGette, of Colorado, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee. \\"GM knew about this problem in 2001. They were warned again and again over the next decade but did nothing.\\"      Earlier in the day, the families of people who lost loved ones in crashes involving the recalled vehicles held a news conference, asking that GM take all the cars off the road until they are fixed; GM has said they are safe to operate as long as drivers take all the weight off the keychain.      The company has also agreed to provide loaners if drivers are nervous about the vehicles. To date, some 13,000 loaners have been provided, Barra said.      New parts are supposed to become available this month with Delphi expected to add a third shift at a Mexican facility to produce them. But committee members said they still have concerns, especially because Delphi officials told staff investigators that even after the 2006 change, the parts did not meet specifications.      Feinberg, meanwhile, could help the company determine what to do regarding potential claimants. GM is generally protected from liability claims for incidents before it went through bankruptcy in July 2009. That protection, however, could be limited if it can be shown GM officials knowingly hid the defects.      Families of those losing their lives have asked that a victims fund be established. GM has remained silent on that subject but Barra said Feinberg will help \\"assess the appropriate next step.\\"      \\"We understand we have civic responsibilities as well as legal responsibilities,\\" she said. GM expects to meet with Feinberg on Friday and expect it will take 30 to 60 days for him to report back. \\"We're going to work very hard to do the right thing for our customers.\\"      Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., the chairman of the subcommittee, asked pointedly whether there was \\"culture\\" at GM before the bankruptcy that \\"would put cost over safety.\\"      Barra — a veteran of GM — said the company \\"moved from a cost culture after the bankruptcy to a customer culture.\\"      GM has recalled 7 million vehicles worldwide since the beginning of the year.      \\"I know you're taking this job at an inauspicious time,\\" said Rep.

Barra revealed that she has asked former US attorney Anton “Tony” Valukas to help determine whether GM engineering employees executed a cover-up or were merely incompetent in failing to recall the defective part. Barra also hired Kenneth Feinberg as a consultant to explore and evaluate options for the families of victims of accidents caused by the defective part. Feinberg has previously handled compensation issues for victims of 9/11, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Boston Marathon bombings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The law does not regulate how much individuals can contribute to their own campaigns , a decided advantage for millionaires such as Schwarzenegger and Ueberroth . Do they have the same meaning?","output":"To determine whether these two sentences have the same meaning, I will analyze each sentence and compare their structures and elements. 1. Sentence Structure and Elements   - Both sentences contain the main clause \\"The law does not regulate how much individuals can contribute to their own campaigns\\".   - In both sentences, the advantage of this situation is described as \\"a decided advantage for millionaires\\".   - In the first sentence, \\"like Mr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. Ueberroth\\" is used, while in the second sentence, \\"such as Schwarzenegger and Ueberroth\\" is used. 2. Comparison   - The main difference between the two sentences is the use of \\"like\\" vs. \\"such as\\" and the use of \\"Mr.\\" as a title for the mentioned individuals.   - \\"Like\\" and \\"such as\\" can be considered synonyms in this context and serve to provide examples of millionaires who benefit from the unregulated campaign contributions.   - The use of \\"Mr.\\" as a title in the first sentence adds a more formal emphasis on the individuals mentioned, while omitting it in the second sentence makes it less formal. Conclusion: The two sentences have very similar meanings. They both convey that the law does not regulate how much individuals can contribute to their own campaigns, and this situation provides a decided advantage for millionaires, exemplified by Schwarzenegger and Ueberroth. The difference in formality created by the presence or absence of the title \\"Mr.\\" is relatively minor and does not significantly alter the underlying meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Recently, he was spotted dancing at one of the rock legend's concerts, showing off his moves as he celebrated the music of his favorite artist. The lively scene prompted reactions from both fans and critics alike. Background on Chris Christie and Bruce Springsteen: Christie has attended numerous Springsteen concerts throughout his life, proudly boasting over 140 concerts to his name. His love for \\"The Boss\\" has been well-documented, even playing a role in Christie's political life with the governor often professing his admiration for the rock icon. However, Springsteen has been vocal about his political differences with the former governor and has not reciprocated the same sentiment. The concert: Bruce Springsteen's most recent concert, held at the MetLife Stadium, attracted thousands of fans, including high-profile personalities such as Chris Christie. As Springsteen performed the hit song \\"Dancing in the Dark,\\" the former governor could be seen energetically replicating the famous dance moves from the song's music video, much to the amusement of those around him. Eyewitness accounts and reactions: Concertgoers who witnessed Christie's dance moves shared their experience on social media platforms, with many expressing amusement at his unabashed enthusiasm. Some fans commended the politician for embracing his love for the music despite Springsteen's public disagreement with his policy stances. Others, however, were critical of Christie's appearance at the concert, citing his track record as governor and accusing him of attempting to capitalize on Springsteen's popularity. The political undertones present in some of Springsteen's music led to discussions about the contrast between the musician's messages and Christie's actions during his time in office. Official statements and context: Neither Chris Christie nor Bruce Springsteen have made official statements about the incident. However, the event has prompted a conversation about the role of political affiliations in fandom and the importance of remaining true to one's personal values despite potential rejection from admired figures. Conclusion: As the dust settles on the lively spectacle of Chris Christie dancing at a Bruce Springsteen concert, this instance highlights the complexities of celebrity and politics intertwining. While their common love for music may never bridge the gap between the two figures, the unabashed joy displayed by Christie at the concert is a reminder of the unifying power of music in the face of differences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Audition: An audition is a trial performance or evaluation undertaken by an individual, often showcasing their skills, talents, and abilities in the fields of music, theater, dance, or other performing arts. Auditions are typically held by groups, companies, or institutions looking to cast roles in a production, recruit new members, or evaluate students for enrollment in programs. Actors, musicians, dancers, and others in creative industries often attend auditions to secure gigs or become part of a team. Auditions can range from individual performances or readings in front of a panel of judges to group or open call sessions, where multiple participants demonstrate their skills simultaneously. 4. Casting: Casting refers to the process of selecting actors, models, musicians, or other performers to fill specific roles in a production, advertisement, or project. The casting process usually consists of auditions, callbacks, and interviews, with the final decisions made by directors, producers, or other decision-makers based on the applicants' performances and whether they fit the desired characteristics of the roles. Casting is an essential part of the creative industries, as it helps to shape the overall vision of a project and can significantly impact the end result. Proper casting ensures that the talent selected for each role possesses the necessary skills, chemistry, and appearance to bring the project's characters and story to life."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and an answer term. Your job is to generate a question that can use the information provided to obtain the given answer. You should use the information on both passage and link information to create the question. Note that the answer to the question should be exactly the given answer, and if the answer is none, the answer to the question shouldn't be obtainable from the passage or linked information. Problem:Passage: In an early example of guerrilla filmmaking, Frankenheimer photographed Martin Balsam being ferried out to the supercarrier USS Kitty Hawk, berthed at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego (standing in for Gibraltar), without prior Defense Department permission. Frankenheimer needed a commanding figure to play Vice Admiral Farley C. Barnswell and asked his friend, well-known producer John Houseman to play him, to which he agreed, on condition that he have a fine bottle of wine (which is seen during the telephone scene), although he was uncredited for it. It was Houseman's American acting debut, and he would not appear onscreen again until his Oscar-winning role in The Paper Chase (1973). Frankenheimer also wanted a shot of Kirk Douglas entering the Pentagon, but could not get permission because of security considerations, so he rigged a movie camera in a parked station wagon to photograph Douglas walking up to the Pentagon. Douglas actually received salutes from military personnel inasmuch as he was wearing the uniform of a U.S. Marine Corps colonel. Several scenes, including one with nuns in the background, were shot inside Washington Dulles International Airport which had recently been built, and the production team were the first ever to film there. The alley and car park scene was shot in Hollywood, and other footage was shot in the Californian desert in 110 degree heat. The secret base and airstrip was specially built in the desert near Indio, California, and they borrowed an aircraft tail in one shot to make it look like a whole plane was off the picture. Originally the script had Lancaster die in a car crash at the end after hitting a bus, but finally this was edited out in favor of a small scene of him departing by taxi which was shot on a Sunday in Paris during production of The Train (1964).  Link Information: The ship was launched on 21 May 1960 Answer: 4 Solution:","output":"Part #1: Understanding the passage.  Usage: The passage describes various filming locations, actors, and situations in the production of an unnamed film. From this, we understand the story behind the scenes about the filming process, actors involved, their roles and circumstances that came about during the shoot. For example, in the statement \\"Frankenheimer needed a commanding figure to play Vice Admiral Farley C. Barnswell and asked his friend, well-known producer John Houseman to play him\\", we understand that Frankenheimer, probably the director, asked John Houseman to play a Vice Admiral character in his film. Part #2: Understand the linked information.  Usage: From the sentence \\"The ship was launched on 21 May 1960\\", the key piece of information is that the ship, possibly referring to USS Kitty Hawk mentioned in the passage, was launched on the date specified.  Part #3: Using the answer term in context.  Usage: The answer given in this task was '4'. In this context, it's unclear what '4' refers to, as it can be related to any aspect of the numerous details given in the passage and the link. Depending on the question generated, the answer '4' could denote a year, a number of people, or other numerical figures present or inferred in the story. Part #4: Generating a question from the passage and linked information. Usage: The goal is to generate a question that makes the answer '4' from the information provided in the passage and the link. An example question could be: \\"How many years after the launch of the USS Kitty Hawk did John Houseman have his Oscar-winning role in The Paper Chase?\\" The answer would be '4' years after the USS Kitty Hawk's launch in 1960, as Houseman's Oscar-winning role happened in 1964, according to the passage. Part #5: Ensuring the question's answer should exactly match the given answer.  Usage: Here, the generated question must have '4' as an exact answer. The previously given question \\"How many years after the launch of the USS Kitty Hawk did John Houseman have his Oscar-winning role in The Paper Chase?\\" fits this criteria, as its answer is indeed '4'. This is calculated by subtracting the launch year of the USS Kitty Hawk (1960) from the year of Houseman's Oscar-winning role (1964). The difference is four years, thus making the answer '4'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

While I started off with an open mind, after drinking most of the can I wished I kept a closed mouth.

Igor tried to put the soccer ball in the tube, but the","output":"diameter was too small to accommodate it. This sentence paints a vivid picture in the mind. Here, Igor is attempting to fit a soccer ball into a tube with unsuitable dimensions for such an action. They are unrelated objects in terms of their function, but in this scenario, Igor is exploring the possibility of an unusual interaction between them.  The soccer ball, typically with a circumference of between 68-70cm for a standard size 5 ball used in professional play, requires a relatively large hole or opening to pass through. On the contrary, the suggestive context implies that the tube Igor has may be designed for something less broad, perhaps a poster, blueprints, or some form of elongated, narrow materials. So naturally, this disparity in requirements creates a problem for Igor's intentions. In this narrative, there's also a display of the principle of physical fit, which predetermines what objects and shapes can fit into others. Like a puzzle piece, the soccer ball, with its spherical shape, cannot be forced into a cylindrical tube without enough diameter, preserving its initial form. However, if the tube were larger, or the ball smaller, a successful fit could occur. Furthermore, this situation could symbolize the larger life principle where not all things, no matter the effort or intent, can be forced to fit where they do not naturally belong. Similarly, it is about accepting the reality of circumstantial constraints, understanding limitations and the inherent properties of objects, or perhaps even people. Depending on the backstory of this scenario, this could also show a trial and error learning method from Igor’s part, exploring what works and what doesn’t. So while it seems like a simple sentence about a small act, there's a surprising amount of potential depth and context to be derived from the imagery. In conclusion, the given sentence \\"Igor tried to put the soccer ball in the tube, but the diameter was too small to accommodate it,\\" portrays an interesting scenario from a spatial and metaphorical perspective. It brings physical constraints into focus, shows the essence of trying, failing, and learning, and can also be regarded as a symbol for incompatible fits in broader life situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Grey Context: John Ottway (Liam Neeson) works in Alaska, killing wolves that threaten an oil drilling team. On his last day on the job, he shoots one. That evening, Ottway writes a letter \\"without purpose\\" to his wife, Ana (Anne Openshaw), explaining his plans to commit suicide. He hears a distant wolf howl and doesn't follow through. The next day, Ottway and other oil drillers board a plane. During the flight, Ottway dreams of sleeping with his wife in bed but is awakened by a loud bang. He buckles up in fear of a possible plane crash. Shortly afterwards, the back of the plane is torn off and luggage starts getting sucked out. Then the plane tips upside down and the roof gets ripped off. Ottway blacks out just before it crashes. Eight people including Ottway survive the crash. One of the team, Lewenden (James Badge Dale), is mortally wounded. Taking charge, Ottway sets the survivors on the task of building a fire. While doing this, he discovers a corpse, and is attacked by the grey wolf feeding on it. After saving Ottway, the group surmises that they are in the wolves' territory. They decide to take turns keeping watch for the predators. Later, Hernandez (Ben Bray) is killed by two wolves. Ottway suggests they leave the crash site, but Diaz (Frank Grillo) questions his leadership. While searching for the wallets of their deceased colleagues, intending to return them to their families, Diaz finds an emergency wrist watch containing a radio beacon. The group then leaves the site. While walking, Flannery (Joe Anderson) falls behind, and is killed by wolves. One of them spots a pack of wolves approaching, and the survivors run for the trees, lighting a fire in an attempt to ward off their attackers. The group sets about producing makeshift weaponry. Diaz threatens Ottway with a knife, but is disarmed and ultimately begins regretting his actions. An omega wolf sent by the alpha wolf to test them attacks, but they kill and roast it for food. Diaz beheads the corpse and throws the head back at the pack, a move noted by the group... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"The Grey,\\" the survivors, including John Ottway, run towards the trees after spotting a pack of wolves approaching them. This decision is taken as they believe that the trees would provide them with some protection against the wolves. In addition, they light a fire in an attempt to ward off their attackers, since wolves are often deterred by fire due to its brightness and heat. Upon reaching the trees, the group focuses on producing makeshift weaponry to defend themselves against the wolves. They manage to kill an omega wolf that was sent by the alpha wolf to test their capabilities. After roasting and eating the wolf, Diaz, one of the survivors, beheads the corpse and throws the head back at the pack as a symbol of defiance. Throughout their ordeal, the survivors continue to follow Ottway's lead, although there is some initial resistance from Diaz, who questions his leadership. The group understands that they are in the wolves' territory and that they need to be vigilant and resourceful in order to survive. As a result, they take turns keeping watch for the predators, and their journey becomes a desperate attempt to find safety while evading the wolf pack that is relentlessly pursuing them. The decision to run towards the trees and rely on fire and makeshift weapons for protection demonstrates the survivors' resourcefulness and determination in the face of a dire situation. It is their adaptability and unity, along with their innate survival instincts, which enable them to cope with the extraordinary challenges they face in the harsh and unforgiving Alaskan wilderness. Through their harrowing ordeal, the survivors learn important lessons about trust, resilience, courage, and the will to live, even when faced with the most life-threatening circumstances. As they continue to evade the ever-present danger from the wolves, their actions and decisions serve to underscore the power of human spirit and the importance of working together when faced with adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Clean the old contact lens case: Before storing the small pills in an old contact lens case, ensure that it is thoroughly cleaned. One could wash it with warm soapy water, rinse it properly, and let it air dry to remove any residue, bacteria, or contaminants from the previous use. 2. Label the case: Since contact lens cases usually have two compartments, using a permanent marker or a small label, clearly identify the sections of the case for differentiation purposes. This can help avoid any mix-ups, especially if one is storing different types/styles of pills. 3. Place the pills in the compartments: Open the lids of the case's compartments and carefully place the small pills in the appropriate sections. The contact lens case's standard size makes it suitable for storing a limited number of pills; therefore, consider the quantity of pills being stored vs their size and make sure not to overload the compartments. 4. Secure the lids: Once the pills have been placed appropriately, firmly close the lids of the contact lens case's compartments. Ensure that they are fully sealed to avoid any leaks or spills. 5. Store the case: Store the repurposed contact lens case with the pills in a cool, dry, and safe location. Keep it out of children's reach and ensure that it is easily identifiable to prevent any unintended consumption. Using an old contact lens case for small pill storage is a practical, compact, and readily available solution, compared to the [i] contact lens cleaner bottle.

Seattle Slew (February 15, 1974 - May 7, 2002) was an American Thoroughbred race horse who won the Triple Crown in 1977--the tenth of twelve horses to accomplish the feat. He is the only horse to have won the Triple Crown while having been undefeated in any race previous. Honored as the 1977 Horse of the Year, he was also a champion at age two, three and four. In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century Seattle Slew was ranked ninth. Seattle Slew was a dark brown colt with a small white patch of hair by his left rear hoof bred by Ben S. Castleman. He was sired by Bold Reasoning who won the Jersey Derby and Withers Stakes in 1971. His dam My Charmer went on to produce the 2000 Guineas winner Lomond and Seattle Dancer.  Horse owners since the early 1970s, Karen Taylor was a former flight attendant, and her husband, Mickey Taylor, was a lumberman. They lived in White Swan, Washington. Their friend Dr. Jim Hill, a veterinarian, recommended that they buy Seattle Slew, a son of Bold Reasoning out of the mare My Charmer, at a 1975 Fasig-Tipton yearling auction. Seattle Slew was foaled at Ben Castleman's White Horse Acres Farm near Lexington, Kentucky. Hill and his wife, Sally, had met the Taylors through the horse business. In partnership, they bought 13 prospects, including Seattle Slew, who was sold for 17,500 (equivalent to 80,000 in 2017). They named him for the city of Seattle and the sloughs which loggers once used to transport heavy logs. Karen felt that the spelling of slough--a slow-moving channel of the Pacific Northwest--would be too hard for people to remember, so the spelling was changed to Slew. A later co-owner was Glenn Rasmussen, the accountant for the equine partnerships.  Seattle Slew's owners sent the colt to Billy Turner, a friend and former steeplechase rider who had trained horses seasonally in Maryland since the early 1960s. Based at Belmont Park in the mid-1970s, Turner accepted Seattle Slew and another Taylor-Hill purchase and sent them to Andor Farm in Monkton, where his wife at the time, Paula, taught yearlings to be ridden.  At maturity, he reached 16 hands (64 inches, 163 cm) high.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions. In her experiment, she is going to pour one liquid into beaker R and the same amount of a different liquid into beaker T. After pouring the liquid into beaker R, there is no noticeable change. Pouring the liquid into beaker T, she observes a change in the liquid.  But I can use this background: A catalyst works by providing a lower energy pathway from reactants to products. The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier.

Like the leaves on trees, anything that is raised up has the potential to fall. It has potential energy. You can see examples of people with gravitational potential energy in 1.5 Figure below. Gravitational potential energy depends on two things. It depends on its weight, because a large falling rock can do more damage than a leaf falling from a tree. It also depends on its height above the ground. Like the skateboarder, the higher the ramp, the faster he will be going when he reaches the bottom. Like all energy, gravitational potential energy has the ability to do work. In this case, weight has the potential to deliver a force. More important for us is that it has the ability to cause change. What kind of change you may ask? Gravitational potential energy has the ability to cause motion.  After reading the above, is \\"The object would need to be right on the ground\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of position would an object need to possess gravitational potential energy?\\"?","output":"No, the statement \\"The object would need to be right on the ground\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of position would an object need to possess gravitational potential energy?\\" Based on the information provided, an object possesses gravitational potential energy when it is: 1. Elevated above the ground - The higher the object is above the ground, the more potential energy it possesses due to gravity. 2. Subject to gravity - The object's weight (mass times the gravitational acceleration) determines its potential energy. The greater the object's weight, the more potential energy it possesses. Therefore, an object needs to be at a certain height above the ground to possess gravitational potential energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Lane, a 58-year-old man, was found dead in an upstairs bedroom of his home. The shocking incident has left the community reeling as details about the teenagers' alleged planning and intentions have emerged. Chilling evidence suggests that the couple had been planning the murder for months, communicating via Skype and Facebook. Their heinous plot did not stop with the murder of Arnold's father; they also allegedly planned to kill Lane's fiance, Denise Geiger. The young couple's twisted scheme was ultimately cut short when the police intervened. On the night of the murder, officers arrived at the scene to find the teenagers in a nearby room, with Bulmer's hands and clothes covered in blood. The fact that they were in such close proximity to the victim's body indicates a shocking lack of remorse and a possible desire to revel in their brutal actions. A thorough investigation has since been launched to determine the motives behind the teenagers' disturbing crimes. The decision to charge Arnold and Bulmer as adults in this harrowing case highlights the severity of their actions and the potential threat they pose to society. While their youth may have played a role in their misguided decisions, it is ultimately the weight of the crime that has led to their adult charges. If convicted, the two could face severe legal repercussions, which could forever impact their lives and the community's sense of safety. This tragic case serves as a chilling reminder of the potential dangers lurking behind seemingly innocuous digital interactions. Authorities have urged parents to closely monitor their children's online activity, as it may reveal valuable information about their well-being and mindset. As the community comes to terms with the appalling murder of Dennis Lane, the focus must shift towards preventing such actions from occurring in the future.

It had advanced to a stage where it seemed impervious to the treatments that were usually effective in the early stages. The doctor had hoped that the aggressive combination of pharmaceuticals would have a more significant impact on the virus, but it had failed to slow down the relentless spread of the infection throughout the patient's body. Despite the grim nature of the situation, the doctor refused to lose hope. In his years of experience, he had encountered several cases of seemingly incurable conditions, yet he had always managed to discover new approaches or novel combinations of treatments that eventually led to recovery. With this perspective & determination, he tirelessly researched the latest medical journals, consulted with specialists, and explored alternative therapies to gain insight into any possible overlooked methods that could help overcome the disease's immense strength. Simultaneously, he closely monitored the patient's condition, adjusting the treatment plan as needed to alleviate symptoms and prevent further physical decline. Regular blood tests were conducted to track the progression of the disease and to assess the efficiency of the current medications. The patient, nestled in a cocoon of uncertainty but imbued with hope, complied with the doctor's recommendations to the best of their ability, doing their part to fight the disease ravaging their body. As weeks turned into months, the doctor finally stumbled upon a potential breakthrough in his relentless search for possible treatments. A recent study published in a respected medical journal revealed a new experimental therapy that had been successful in combating similar predatory diseases in pre-clinical trials. Although the treatment had not yet been approved for general use, the doctor felt that the risks associated with the experimental therapy were outweighed by the potential benefits, given the advanced stage of the disease. With the patient's consent, the doctor reached out to the medical research team responsible for the study and secured compassionate use permission to administer the experimental treatment. After obtaining the therapy, the doctor carefully prepared the treatment plan, account for the variables unique to the patient's case and this new therapy's potential side effects. The first dose was administered with caution, and the patient was closely monitored for any adverse reactions. Time seemed to stand still as the doctor and the patient waited with bated breath, their spirits a mix of hope and trepidation. To their relief, the treatment appeared to be well tolerated initially, allowing them to proceed with a full course outlined by the medical research team. As the days and weeks went by, the patient's condition slowly started to improve. The invasive nature of the disease seemed to have met its formidable foe. The doctor observed the incremental progress in the blood tests and clinical symptoms, slowly allowing optimism to replace their previously combined anxiety. They had seemingly found the weapon against the disease's overwhelming strength, a testament to their determination and unwavering spirit. Following months of hard-fought battles, the tide had finally turned in their favor. The patient's blood tests now showed drastically reduced levels of the virus, and their physical symptoms had significantly improved. The doctor continued to manage the aftercare with vigilance, ensuring that the recovery was sustained and the likelihood of any relapses minimized. Despite the initial failure of conventional medicine, the united efforts of the doctor and the patient had ultimately triumphed against the destructive strength of the disease. The case served as a reminder that the right combination of determination, experience, and ingenuity could overcome even the most formidable of adversaries – providing hope and inspiration to others facing seemingly insurmountable challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Amon was born in Bulls, and attended Wanganui Collegiate School. He was the only child of wealthy sheep-owners Ngaio and Betty Amon. He learned to drive at the age of six, taught by a farm worker on the family farm. On leaving school, he persuaded his father to buy him an Austin A40 Special, which he entered in some minor local races and hillclimbs along with practice on the family farm. Despite never winning a championship Formula One Grand Prix, Amon won eight non-championship GPs, the Silverstone International Trophy, the 1000 km Monza, the Daytona 24 Hours, the Tasman Series and, perhaps most significant of all, the famous 24 Heures du Mans (alongside Bruce McLaren). These races included many of Amon's otherwise more successful fellow Formula One drivers.  In Formula One, Chris Amon took part in 96 Grands Prix, achieving 5 poles, leading 183 laps in 7 races, reaching the podium 11 times and scoring a total of 83 Championship points. Amon holds the record for the most different makes of car raced by a Formula 1 World Championship driver, with thirteen. A biography Forza Amon by journalist Eoin Young charts Amon's racing career and gives some insights into his personal life. The book makes clear one point on which Amon himself disagrees with most commentators, the issue of his bad luck. Amon has pointed out on several occasions that he competed for a decade and a half in Formula One and survived some serious accidents, notably in 1976, whilst others, including friends like Bruce McLaren, suffered serious injury and death. In 2008, motorsport journalist Alan Henry rated Chris Amon as his 13th greatest driver.

Question: How are the directions of the velocity and force vectors related in a circular motion I found the following answer on Google: It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation (and constant speed), or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the answer you found does not directly address the relationship between velocity and force vectors in circular motion.  A more accurate and detailed answer is: In circular motion, the direction of the velocity vector is always tangent to the circular path, while the direction of the force vector (centripetal force) points toward the center of the circle. Centripetal force is a net force acting on an object in a circular path, which causes the object to consistently change direction. The centripetal force and velocity vectors are always perpendicular to each other. This is because centripetal force acts radially inward, while the velocity vector is tangent to the path. When considering uniform circular motion, the speed of the object remains constant, but the direction of the velocity vector continuously changes as it moves along the circular path. In non-uniform circular motion, both the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector change. In summary, the relationship between the velocity and force vectors in circular motion is that they are always perpendicular to each other, with the velocity vector tangent to the circular path and the force vector (centripetal force) pointing toward the center of the circle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: \\"In Pompeii, if the gods did not fulfill their side of the bargain, what were the consequences?\\"  Context: \\"Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The \\"contract\\" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In ancient Pompeii, if the gods did not fulfill their side of the bargain, the consequences were typically the withholding of the offered sacrifices or offerings. This means that the people would not proceed with the arranged rituals, which were considered a crucial part of the bargain with the gods. In the context provided, the imperial period saw a specific instance where sacrifice was withheld following Emperor Trajan's death because the gods had not kept him safe for the agreed-upon time. This action of withholding the sacrifice served as a consequence for the gods not fulfilling their side of the bargain or agreement. Another example mentioned was the offering of a bull to the Genius of the living emperor, a standard practice in Imperial cult, while minor offerings such as incense and wine were also made. If the gods failed to protect the emperor or provide the expected favours, these sacrifices or offerings would be withheld as a consequence. Overall, withholding the offerings and sacrifices demonstrated the dissatisfaction of the people towards the gods for not fulfilling their obligations in the bargains, and also reflected a sense of balance in the system of reciprocity that governed the relationship between humans and gods in ancient Roman society."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Paragraph: Indonesia confirmed 40 more deaths and its death toll accounts for nearly half of the more than 590 across Southeast Asia. More than 16,500 cases have been reported across the region. Indonesian health ministry official Achmad Yurianto said the country had registered 337 new infections, also a new daily high, taking the total to 3,293. Health experts say Indonesia faces a surge in cases after a slow government response masked the scale of the outbreak in Southeast Asia’s biggest country. Indonesia has brought in “large-scale social restrictions”, but President Joko Widodo has resisted bringing in the type of tough lockdowns imposed by neighbours and only moved to allow areas like Jakarta, where there has been a spike in cases, more powers to tackle the crisis. Researchers at the University of Indonesia have predicted there could be 140,000 deaths and 1.5 million cases by May without tougher curbs on movement and gathering. Indonesia has stepped up the number of tests to 16,511 as of Wednesday, but for a country with more than 260 million people it has one the lowest testing rates in the world   Neighbouring Malaysia, with only 32 million people, has conducted 69,675 tests. There are also growing fears that the outbreak could spread across the archipelago during the annual exodus to home villages for the Muslim Ramadan holiday.Widodo has said the government would give aid to poorer families, particularly in Jakarta, to persuade them to stay put but has rejected calls for an outright ban on the “mudik”, as the holiday is known. Malaysia reported 109 new infections on Thursday, the second-lowest daily increase since a partial lockdown was imposed on March 18. The data comes a day ahead of possible ministerial discussions on whether to extend the curbs on travel and non-essential businesses beyond April 14. The country has so far recorded 4,228 infections - the highest in Southeast Asia - with 67 deaths. But government officials have said the restrictions are showing results. “We have done well,” Ministry of Health Director General Noor Hisham Abdullah told a news conference. “We have a small window of opportunity. If we do it right we may be able to avert the surge that we have seen in other countries.” Claim: Indonesia reports biggest jump in coronavirus deaths as Malaysia trend improves.","output":"Part #1: The claim will always have supporting proof in the paragraph, and the paragraph will have a clear point of view supporting the claim. Usage: Indonesia confirmed 40 more deaths and its death toll accounts for nearly half of the more than 590 across Southeast Asia. This meets the criteria because it shows that Indonesia has seen a significant increase in coronavirus deaths, which supports the claim that it reports the biggest jump in deaths. Part #2: There can be instances where direct correlation to the claim is not available. Make use of the sentences in the paragraph to provide a corresponding output supporting the claim. Usage: Indonesian health ministry official Achmad Yurianto said the country had registered 337 new infections, also a new daily high, taking the total to 3,293. This indirectly supports the claim by showing that there has been a spike in coronavirus cases, which can be linked to the increase in deaths. Part #3: The explanation should be at least one and at most twelve sentences long. Usage: Indonesia reports the biggest jump in coronavirus deaths as it confirmed 40 more deaths, accounting for nearly half of the more than 590 across Southeast Asia. The country has seen a significant increase in infections, with 337 new cases reported, a new daily high. This spike in cases can be linked to the increase in deaths. Meanwhile, Malaysia reported 109 new infections on Thursday, the second-lowest daily increase since a partial lockdown was imposed on March 18. The country has so far recorded 4,228 infections - the highest in Southeast Asia - with 67 deaths. But government officials have said the restrictions are showing results, as the trend for Malaysia shows improvement compared to Indonesia's surge in cases and deaths. This explanation meets the criteria as it provides a concise and clear connection between the claim and the supporting evidence from the paragraph."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Conservationists have unveiled plans to preserve and protect the world's most important species of coral, in a response to increasing threats that they say will lead to \\"functional extinction\\" within decades. Led by scientists at the Zoological Society of London, the Edge Coral Reefs project has identified 10 coral species in most urgent risk of becoming extinct.The scientists say that reefs are under pressure from a variety of threats including rising sea temperatures due to climatic instability, increased acidity , overfishing and pollution. The Edge plan, which focuses on the most evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered species , will take a regional approach to conservation.This means focusing on the \\"coral triangle\\" around the Philippines, the West Indian Ocean around the Mozambique channel, and in the Caribbean channel. \\"Coral reefs are threatened with functional extinction in the next 20-50 years, due predominantly to global climatic instability,\\" said Catherine Head, coordinator of the reefs project.\\"In these regions, we'll be supporting and training in-country conservationists to carry out research and implement targeted conservation actions,\\" she said.\\"Their projects will last initially for two years.We provide them with a whole host of tools to carry out their projects including funding and intensive training.\\" She added. Coral reefs are the planet's most diverse marine ecosystem , known as the rainforests of the oceans.Despite taking up under 0.2% of the ocean floor, they provide food and shelter for almost a third of all sea life.If we lose the ecosystems, we lose not only the biodiversity  , but we also lose the capability of people to obtain income and food from coral reefs. Climatic instability, which leads to rising sea temperatures, causes corals to bleach.Bleaching occurs when sea temperatures rise and this causes the coral tissue to expel their symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae - these are what give the coral their colour.Bleached corals often die if the stress continues.Among...

Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Where did painters meet? Context: In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \\"bistro\\" means \\"quickly\\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.

Information:  - The British Antarctic Expedition 190709, otherwise known as the Nimrod Expedition, was the first of three expeditions to the Antarctic led by Ernest Shackleton. Its main target, among a range of geographical and scientific objectives, was to be first to the South Pole. This was not attained, but the expedition's southern march reached a Farthest South latitude of 88° 23' S, just from the pole. This was by far the longest southern polar journey to that date and a record convergence on either Pole. A separate group led by Welsh Australian geology professor Edgeworth David reached the estimated location of the South Magnetic Pole, and the expedition also achieved the first ascent of Mount Erebus, Antarctica's second highest volcano.  - Dumfries (; possibly from ) is a market town and former royal burgh within the Dumfries and Galloway council area of Scotland. It is near the mouth of the River Nith into the Solway Firth. Dumfries was a civil parish and became the county town of the former county of Dumfriesshire. Dumfries is nicknamed \\"Queen of the South\\". People from Dumfries are known colloquially as \\"Doonhamers\\".  - The Solway Firth is a firth that forms part of the border between England and Scotland, between Cumbria (including the Solway Plain) and Dumfries and Galloway. It stretches from St Bees Head, just south of Whitehaven in Cumbria, to the Mull of Galloway, on the western end of Dumfries and Galloway. The Isle of Man is also very near to the firth. The firth comprises part of the Irish Sea.  - Arrol - Aster was a British car maker founded in 1927 when Arrol - Johnston and Aster merged . The Wembley , London works of Aster was closed and production concentrated at the Heathhall , Dumfries factory of Arrol - Johnston . At first , manufacture of all the cars previously made by the two companies was continued along with those made under the Galloway badge but in 1928 a rationalisation was carried out . The cars were complex and expensive and sales were poor resulting in the company going into receivership in 1929 and finally closing in 1931 . The company was responsible for making the body for Sir Malcolm Campbell 's Blue Bird car in 1929 and an Arrol - Aster car was entered in the 1931 24 Hours of Le Mans .  - Arrol-Johnston (later known as Arrol-Aster) was an early Scottish manufacturer of automobiles, which operated from 1896 to 1931 and produced the first automobile manufactured in Britain. The company also developed the world's first \\"off-road\\" vehicle for the Egyptian government, and another designed to travel on ice and snow for Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition to the South Pole.  - A royal burgh was a type of Scottish burgh which had been founded by, or subsequently granted, a royal charter.

The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.

The reviewer has mentioned several points that position this He-Man/She-Ra Christmas special as a potential new addition to one's Christmas movie collection. Some key factors the reviewer has pointed out are that the movie has elements common with other classic Christmas tales - such as lost kids trying to get home, adorable pets, mean characters turning good, and an epilogue emphasizing the true spirit of Christmas. Additionally, the reviewer indicates that their child enjoys watching this movie, and they themselves appreciate the break it offers from traditional Christmas films.

Dick Grayson is long since retired from his superhero days and raising a family with to his wife Barbara Gordon. After his former mentor's death, however, he decides to resume his crime-fighting days as Robin. Remarkably, Grayson does not take up the Nightwing identity. The filmmakers said they chose this because many people outside the comic book community are unfamiliar with Nightwing and they wanted to appeal to a wider audience.Commissioner Gordon is aware of Grayson's secret identity and assists him by supplying official documents. In addition, Gordon provides the voiceover narration at the beginning of the trailer. The head of the investigation into Batman's death is indicated to be Chief O'Hara, a character from the 1960's Batman TV series, who apparently also knows Grayson's identity (noting that Grayson's \\"crimefighting days are over\\") His role is suspicious since he strongly wants Grayson to not become involved, even to the point of aligning with Selina Kyle/Catwoman to eliminate Robin and shouting at reporter Clark Kent that he wants \\"him [presumably Grayson] out of the equation!\\" O'Hara is also seen rolling up his sleeves, preparing to assault an angry captive Gordon.  Grayson is aware of Superman's secret identity; he addresses him as \\"Clark\\". Superman apparently is also motivated (obviously from O'Hara) to discourage Grayson's return to crimefighting and three angry confrontations between the characters are shown, in and out of costume.

Sent 4: His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. Sent 5: 1496).

The first group of antelope, group A, have long necks and strong teeth. The second group of antelope, group B, have shorter necks and weaker teeth. Because of their longer necks and stronger teeth, the antelope from group A are more easily able to pick fruit and leaves from the tall trees in the region compared to antelope from group B.  Which group of antelope is less adapted to the environment?  Hint: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. The answer is:","output":"Group B antelope, which have shorter necks and weaker teeth, are considered less adapted to the environment when compared to Group A antelope in sub-Saharan Africa. The theory of evolution by natural selection, as proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, provides a framework to understand this adaptation. In the given scenario, Group A antelope have longer necks and stronger teeth, which provide them with a significant advantage in obtaining food resources, such as fruit and leaves from tall trees. This trait increases their overall fitness and ability to thrive in the environment. As a result, these antelope are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to their offspring. Over time, these heritable traits will become more common in the population due to the selective pressure of the environment. On the other hand, Group B antelope with their shorter necks and weaker teeth are less adapted to access the same food resources as Group A antelope. As a result, they are at a disadvantage in terms of survival and reproduction, making it more challenging for them to pass on their traits to the next generation. The theory of natural selection predicts that, over time, the traits that are less advantageous for survival, such as shorter necks and weaker teeth, will become rarer in the population. In conclusion, based on the information provided and considering the theory of evolution by natural selection, the Group B antelope with shorter necks and weaker teeth are less adapted to the environment compared to the Group A antelope with longer necks and stronger teeth. Natural selection leads to the advantageous traits becoming more common, while the less helpful or harmful traits will become rarer in the population over time. In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, Group A antelope with longer necks and stronger teeth have a higher rate of survival and reproduction, making it more likely for these traits to persist and dominate the antelope population in the region."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs. Question: When did Chan go to dig up worms? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"Chan went to dig up worms one warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He usually did this between the fence and the west side of the house where it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, as worms seemed to favor this location."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?  [i] no; [ii] yes;","output":"[ii] yes; Developing muscles and strength without lifting weights is possible through a combination of bodyweight exercises, resistance bands, functional training, and various forms of cardio. In order to maximize muscle development without weightlifting, consider the following strategies: 1. Bodyweight exercises: These are exercises that use your own body weight as resistance. Examples include push-ups, pull-ups, dips, squats, lunges, and planks. By performing progressive variations of these exercises, you can target different muscle groups and improve overall strength. 2. Resistance bands: Resistance bands are elastic bands that provide resistance when stretched. They come in various levels of difficulty and can be used to perform a wide range of exercises that target different muscle groups. Resistance bands can be used for both strength training and muscle hypertrophy. 3. Functional training: Incorporate functional training exercises into your routine. These movements focus on improving core strength, balance, and flexibility. Examples include kettlebell swings, medicine ball tosses, and TRX suspension training. 4. Cardiovascular exercises: Engaging in activities like running, swimming, biking, and jumping rope not only helps improve cardiovascular health but can also contribute to muscle strength and endurance, particularly in the lower body. 5. Plyometrics: Plyometric exercises are explosive movements that generate a significant amount of power and force in a short period of time. They can aid in muscle development and overall strength. Examples include box jumps, jump squats, and clap push-ups. 6. Yoga and Pilates: Both yoga and Pilates can be effective in building strength through various poses and movements that engage the whole body. The focus on balance, flexibility, and core strength can lead to improved overall functional strength. 7. Calisthenics: Calisthenics is a form of workout that uses minimal equipment and primarily relies on body weight exercises. Examples include handstands, muscle-ups, and human flag. These movements help build overall strength and muscle endurance. 8. Nutrition: Proper nutrition is essential for muscle growth. Ensure you are consuming an adequate amount of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats to fuel muscle recovery and growth. 9.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Translate to English","output":"The remainder of the funds must come from eligible institutions or partners. In this statement, the French phrase \\"Le reste des fonds doit provenir des établissements ou des partenaires admissibles\\" has been translated to English. The English translation indicates that a portion of the funding required for a specific project or endeavor needs to be obtained from institutions or partners that meet certain eligibility criteria. This requirement is a common strategy for diversifying the sources of funding and ensuring the financial stability of a project. Eligibility criteria for institutions and partners may vary by country, industry, or specific project requirements, but typical criteria include financial capacity, reputation, expertise, technical know-how, and compliance with legal and regulatory frameworks. When seeking eligible institutions or partners to provide the remainder of the funds, organizations may engage in various strategies such as networking, seeking out grants and loans, reaching out to potential sponsors or investors, or pursuing public-private partnerships. Diversifying the sources of funding not only contributes to financial sustainability but also helps to mitigate risks and build resilience in the face of economic and market fluctuations. Moreover, receiving support from established and reputable institutions and partners not only ensures financial stability but also adds credibility to the project and opens up possibilities for collaboration, shared expertise, and knowledge exchange. In summary, the translated phrase \\"The remainder of the funds must come from eligible institutions or partners\\" refers to the requirement that, in order to secure the necessary funding for a project, organizations must identify and collaborate with institutions and partners that meet specific eligibility criteria.

Paragraph: In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama  Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of  Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: The clicking away of a shorthand typewriter was doing what while hearing testimony? Possible A: anger, nodding, listening, take notes, writing down  Why is \\"take notes\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Take notes\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for a variety of reasons. First, let's analyze the given question: Q: The clicking away of a shorthand typewriter was doing what while hearing testimony? The question is asking what action is performed by the shorthand typewriter when it is being used during the process of hearing testimony. It provides some context by mentioning the auditory cue of \\"clicking away,\\" signifying that the typewriter is actively being used. Now, let's consider the possible answers and why \\"take notes\\" makes the most sense: 1. Anger: This choice suggests that the typewriter is experiencing an emotional state, specifically anger. This does not align with human common sense because a typewriter is an inanimate object and does not possess emotions. 2. Nodding: Nodding is a physical gesture typically performed by humans to indicate understanding or approval. Since a typewriter is not a person and lacks the ability to communicate through physical gestures, this answer does not align with human common sense. 3. Listening: The act of listening implies an active cognitive process and receptiveness to auditory information. While the typewriter may be present during the proceedings and \\"hearing\\" the testimony by virtue of being in the room, it does not possess the capability to process and understand spoken language. Thus, this option does not align with human common sense. 4. Take notes: This answer suggests that the typewriter is being utilized to document and record the information being presented during testimony. This action is the primary function of a shorthand typewriter, which is designed to quickly and accurately transcribe spoken language into written words. As such, \\"take notes\\" aligns well with human common sense, because it accurately reflects the purpose and function of a shorthand typewriter in this context. 5. Writing down: Although this option somewhat overlaps with \\"take notes,\\" it is less specific and less representative of the typewriter's intended purpose. The act of writing down can apply to any instrument used for writing, be it a pen, pencil or a typewriter. \\"Take notes,\\" on the other hand, explicitly conveys the function of shorthand typewriters within a testimony context, which involves accurately and efficiently transcribing spoken content. In conclusion, \\"take notes\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it accurately reflects the purpose and use of a shorthand typewriter during the process of hearing and documenting testimony. This answer is not only grounded in the functional reality of the typewriter but also encompasses the practical aspect of testimony transcription. The other possible answers either anthropomorphize the inanimate object (attributing emotions or actions not applicable to a typewriter) or do not capture the full context of the typewriter's role during testimony."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By 1987, the band's membership was down to just Jeczalik and Dudley. That year saw the release of their album In No Sense? Nonsense!  The album featured Jeczalik's most advanced rhythmic collages to date, plus lush string arrangements, pieces for boys' choir, and keyboard melodies from Dudley. It did not produce any hits, although their record label made efforts to push remixes of \\"Dragnet\\" into the dance clubs and the single reached No. 60 on the UK charts.  In 1987, The Art of Noise provided the score for two movies, Hiding Out and Dragnet, and one particular movement was used in both films. Their brass-based connecting passage between sections from the original Dragnet television show's theme song was used as incidental music during a dramatic scene--an armed chase through the rafters of a gymnasium--near the end of Hiding Out.  In 1988, a one-off collaboration with singer Tom Jones (a cover of Prince's \\"Kiss\\"--a staple in Jones' stage shows) renewed the public's interest in the Art of Noise and provided the group's biggest hit in the mainstream.

Despite being best friends since childhood, Ryan's phobia had always been a subject of lighthearted mockery between them, and Logan felt it was high time to exploit it for some fun. He knew exactly what to do. They had been to a store earlier that week where he had seen a frighteningly realistic toy rat. Now, with a gleam in his eye, he went ahead and purchased that toy. It was made of a realistically soft material, almost like actual rat hair, and even had a winding key that made it move like real one. His plan detailed, Logan waited till their usual Friday movie night at Ryan's place. He arrived early, while Ryan was still out picking up pizza, to set up his prank. He ever so silently, very carefully placed the wind-up rat in the kitchen, near the trash-bin, a spot where you could reasonably expect to find a real rat. He felt a mix of glee, apprehension, and guilty excitement - the perfect cocktail for a prankster awaiting the payoff. As Ryan returned home, Logan had to muster all his strength not to give away the secret as he watched his friend enter the kitchen to fetch plates and drinks. Suddenly there was the gasping sound Logan had been waiting for, followed by a crash as Ryan knocked a stack of plates out of sheer terror. Logan couldn't help himself; he busted out laughing as he rushed into the kitchen to find Ryan panting heavily, backed up against the wall. It took only a few seconds for Ryan to realize the reality of the situation through his friend’s eruption of laughter. Logan displayed the wind-up mechanism of the rat to him, which only added fuel to his simmering embarrassment. But Ryan was a good sport, he laughed along, swearing revenge. For several weeks after that, Logan lived in semi-terrified suspense, waiting for the moment when Ryan would exact his prank-vengeance. And when Ryan finally did strike back, it was in the most unexpected circumstances possible. He tricked Logan into believing a well-known publisher loved his manuscript and wanted to publish his work, a dream for Logan. The bitter-sweet realization when he found out it was an elaborate hoax created a memory of uncontrollable laughter and light-hearted banter that would last a lifetime. These pranks, though seemingly child-like, became an essential component of Logan and Ryan's friendship. Each humorous antic brought them closer and paved the way to share hearty laughs and created enduring memories. Their bond proved stronger through these comic diversions, their camaraderie unwaveringly powerful. For them, friendship wasn't just about the serious moments and the thick and thins.

Hypothesis: This competition is held on the season that is temperature-wise the opposite of summer","output":"After carefully analyzing the given paragraph, it can be concluded that the hypothesis that the Cyprus International Football Tournaments is held during a season that is temperature-wise the opposite of summer is mostly true. The paragraph mentions that the Cyprus International Football Tournaments is an annual winter association football competition for national teams that traditionally takes place in February. As we know, winter is a season characterized by colder temperatures as opposed to summer, which tends to have higher temperatures. With this information, we can infer that the competition occurs during a season with relatively lower temperatures, making it the opposite of summer in terms of weather. It's worth noting, however, that the severity of winter conditions can vary depending on a country's geographical location and climate. Cyprus, being an island situated in the northeastern area of the Mediterranean Sea, experiences a Mediterranean climate. This means that although winters are cooler than summers, they might not be as cold as one might experience in countries located farther north. Nevertheless, it can still be considered as the temperature-wise opposite of summer when comparing the two seasons within Cyprus. In conclusion, the hypothesis claiming that the Cyprus International Football Tournaments take place in a season that is temperature-wise the opposite of summer is mostly accurate since the competition is held during winter in February - a time known for cooler temperatures than the summer season. The specific temperature conditions might not be drastically different, especially considering Cyprus' Mediterranean climate, but winter in Cyprus is still colder than summer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Planet in sweet spot of Goldilocks zone for life      WASHINGTON (AP) — A newly discovered planet is eerily similar to Earth and is sitting outside Earth's solar system in what seems to be the ideal place for life, except for one hitch. It is a bit too big.      The planet is smack in the middle of what astronomers call the Goldilocks zone, that hard to find place that is not too hot, not too cold, where water, which is essential for life, does not freeze or boil. And it has a shopping mall-like surface temperature of near 72 degrees, scientists say.      The planet's confirmation was announced Monday by NASA along with other discoveries by its Kepler telescope, which was launched on a planet-hunting mission in 2009.      That is the first planet confirmed in the habitable zone for Kepler, which already had found Earth-like rocky planets elsewhere. Twice before astronomers have announced a planet found in that zone, but neither has been as promising.      \\"This is a phenomenal discovery in the course of human history,\\" Geoff Marcy of University of California, Berkeley, one of the pioneers of planet-hunting outside Earth's solar system, said in an email. \\"This discovery shows that we Homo sapiens are straining our reach into the universe to find planets that remind us of home. We are almost there.\\"      The new planet, named Kepler-22b, has key aspects it shares with Earth. It circles a star that could be the twin of Earth's sun and at just about the same distance. The planet's year of 290 days is even close to Earth's. It probably has water and rock.      The only trouble is the planet's a bit big for life to exist on the surface. The planet is about 2.4 times the size of Earth. It could be more like the gas-and-liquid Neptune with only a rocky core and mostly ocean.      \\"It's so exciting to imagine the possibilities,\\" said Natalie Batalha, the Kepler deputy science chief.      Floating on that \\"world completely covered in water\\" could be like being on an Earth ocean and \\"it's not beyond the realm of possibility that life could exist in such an ocean,\\" Batalha said in a phone interview.      Kepler cannot find life itself, just where the conditions might be right for it to thrive. And when astronomers look for life elsewhere, they are talking about everything ranging from microbes to advanced intelligence that can be looking back at us.      So far the Kepler telescope has spotted 2,326 candidate planets outside Earth's solar system with 139 of them potentially habitable ones. Even though the confirmed Kepler-22b is a bit big, it is smaller than most of the other candidates. It is closest to Earth in size, temperature and star than either of the two previously announced planets in the zone.      The confirmation of one of two, though, has been disputed. The latest discovery has been confirmed several ways, including by two other telescopes.      This year, a European team of astronomers said they had confirmed another planet in the habitable zone, but that one was hot and barely on the inside edge of the habitable zone.      For Marcy, who is on the Kepler team, the newest planet is a smidgen too large. But, \\"that smidgen makes all the difference,\\" he said.      Because its size implies that it is closer to Neptune in composition than Earth, \\"I would bet my telescope that there is no hard, rocky surface to walk on,\\" Marcy said.      Chief Kepler scientist William Borucki said he thinks the planet is somewhere between Earth and gas-and-liquid Neptune, but that it has a lot of rocky material. It is in a size range that scientists do not really know anything about. Measurements next summer may help astronomers have a better idea of its makeup, he said.      The planet is 600 light years away. Each light year is 5.9 trillion miles. It would take a space shuttle about 22 million years to get there.      Kepler spots a planet when it passes in front of its star. NASA requires three of those sightings before it begins to confirm it as a planet. Borucki said the third sighting for 22b happened a year ago, just before the telescope shut down for a while. It took several months to finish the confirmation.      \\"It's a great gift,\\" Borucki said. \\"We consider this sort of our Christmas planet.\\"      Copyright © 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. ||||| MOFFET FIELD, CALIFORNIA—For the first time, astronomers have found a planet smack in the middle of the habitable zone of its sunlike star, where temperatures are good for life. \\"If this planet has a surface, it would have a very nice temperature of some 70° Fahrenheit [21°C],\\" says William Borucki of NASA's Ames Research Center here, who is the principal investigator of NASA's Kepler space telescope. \\"[It's] another milestone on the journey of discovering Earth's twin,\\" adds Ames director Simon \\"Pete\\" Worden.      Unfortunately, the true nature of the planet, named Kepler-22b, remains unknown. It is 2.4 times the size of Earth, but its mass, and hence its composition, has not yet been determined. \\"There's a good chance it could be rocky,\\" Borucki says, although he adds that the planet would probably contain huge amounts of compressed ice, too. It might even have a global ocean. \\"We have no planets like this in our own solar system.\\"      Kepler-22b is 600 light-years away. Every 290 days, it orbits a star that is just a bit smaller and cooler than our own sun. The Kepler telescope, launched in 2009 to scan the skies for Earth-like worlds, found the planet because it sees the orbit edge on. That means that every 290 days, the world transits the surface of the star, blocking out a minute fraction of its light.      Borucki likes to call the new discovery the Christmas planet. \\"It's a great gift,\\" he said at a press conference here this morning. \\"We were very fortunate to find it.\\" The first of the three observed transits occurred only days after Kepler started observing. The third one was seen just before Christmas 2010, shortly before the spacecraft was unable to carry out any observations because of a technical glitch. Says Borucki: \\"We could've easily missed it altogether.\\"      \\"There are two things really exciting about this planet,\\" adds Natalie Batalha, Kepler's deputy science team leader. \\"It's right in the middle of the habitable zone [the region around a star where temperatures are neither too high or too low for liquid water to exist], and it orbits a star very similar to our sun.\\" Previously discovered \\"habitable\\" planets orbited dim, red dwarf stars, or they were located at the edge of the habitable zone, with more extreme temperatures.      At the press conference, which marked the start of the 5-day First Kepler Science Conference here at NASA Ames, Batalha also announced 1094 new planet candidates found by Kepler since February 2011, bringing the total to a whopping 2326. So far, only 29 of these (including Kepler-22b) have been confirmed to be genuine planets, but Kepler scientists have good reasons to expect that at least 90% of all candidates will turn out to be real.      Forty-eight of these planet candidates orbit in the habitable zone of their parent stars. Most are substantially larger than Earth, but 10 are about the same size as our home planet. Some of these are in multiplanet systems. \\"It's conceivable that any-or many-of these 48 habitable zone candidates, or their moons, could have life,\\" Borucki says.      Jill Tarter of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, says the habitable Kepler planets are prime targets for the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), carried out with the dedicated 42-dish Allen Telescope Array in northern California. \\"We're taking everything we can get from our Kepler colleagues to look for techno-signatures\\" that might betray the existence of an alien civilization, she says.      So far, the question about extraterrestrial life is very much open. \\"We don't know whether Earth as it is, and life as we know it, is very unusual or very common,\\" Tarter says. However, if scientists find a second place in the universe where life once got started, it will be obvious that life must be widespread. Says Tarter: \\"In this field, the number two is important. We count one, two, infinity.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Astronomers have discovered a new planet called Kepler-22b, located outside Earth's solar system in the prime location for life, known as the Goldilocks zone. The Goldilocks zone is the region where temperatures are neither too high nor too low for liquid water to exist. Kepler-22b shares some key characteristics with Earth, such as orbiting a star similar to Earth's sun, having a surface temperature close to 72 degrees Fahrenheit (21°C), and a 290-day year. However, one aspect that may hinder life on the planet is its size; Kepler-22b is approximately 2.4 times larger than Earth and could resemble Neptune, with only a rocky core and mostly ocean. Scientists are considering the possibility of life existing on this potentially water-covered world, while acknowledging that further research and measurements are needed to better understand its composition. Kepler-22b is located 600 light-years away, making it difficult to study in detail, but its discovery gives scientists renewed hope of finding other habitable planets in the universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Process:  - Magma rises through cracks in the Earth&#x27;s crust - The pressure causes plates to move - Magma explodes to the surface - The lava from the eruption cools to form new crust - After several eruptions, the rock builds up and a volcano forms -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the ground is stable happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, which suggests the ground is stable, can have a significant influence on the occurrence and intensity of smaller volcanic eruptions. While it may not necessarily lead to a direct impact on the magma production process, it can indirectly affect the various stages associated with the formation and development of volcanic eruptions. To fully comprehend the potential implications, it is necessary to breakdown the process of a volcanic eruption and analyze how each step might be influenced by stable ground conditions. 1. Magma Rises Through Cracks in the Earth's Crust: Under stable ground conditions, it could be more difficult for magma to rise through the Earth's crust as there may be fewer cracks for it to seep through. This scenario could lead to the accumulation of more substantial volumes of magma in the subsurface chambers, which could potentially trigger more significant eruptions once sufficient pressure is built up. 2. The Pressure Causes Plates to Move: When the ground is more stable, the pressure generated by the ascending magma might need to reach higher levels before causing the tectonic plates to move. This increase in pressure might result in more powerful eruptions when they eventually occur, rather than a series of smaller eruptions. 3. Magma Explodes to the Surface: The stability of the ground can reduce the frequency of smaller eruptions by limiting the opportunities for the pressurized magma to escape through cracks and fissures. As a result, the pressure within the magma chamber may continue to increase until a large-scale eruption occurs, as opposed to several smaller eruptions that could gradually release the built-up pressure. 4. The Lava from the Eruption Cools to Form New Crust: With fewer smaller eruptions taking place due to stable ground conditions, the formation of new crust may be limited or considerably slowed down. This situation could contribute to a reduction in the growth of volcanic edifices and potentially affect the overall geodynamics of the region. 5. After Several Eruptions, the Rock Builds Up and a Volcano Forms: As mentioned in the previous steps, stable ground conditions can lead to larger eruptions at less frequent intervals. Consequently, the process of rock build-up and the formation of a volcano may be altered, with the possibility of fewer new volcanic structures emerging. In summary, while stable ground may not directly impact the production of magma, it can have several indirect effects on the process of volcanic eruptions. By reducing the availability of pathways for magma to rise and increasing the pressure required to move tectonic plates, stable ground conditions have the potential to decrease the occurrence of smaller eruptions. Instead, larger eruptions may occur after more substantial amounts of pressure have built up within the magma chambers. Furthermore, the overall process of volcanic formation and development might be affected, with fewer new volcanic structures emerging and a slower rate of crust formation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who hosted King Edward I at a castle? is inside the article: Brougham Castle (pronounced ) is a medieval building about 2 miles (3.2 km) south-east of Penrith, Cumbria, England. The castle was founded by Robert I de Vieuxpont in the early 13th century. The site, near the confluence of the rivers, Eamont and Lowther, had been chosen by the Romans for a Roman fort called Brocavum. The castle is scheduled as an Ancient Monument, along with the fort, as \\"Brougham Roman fort and Brougham Castle\\".In its earliest form, the castle consisted of a stone keep, with an enclosure protected by an earthen bank and a wooden palisade. When the castle was built, Robert de Vieuxpont was one of the only lords in the region who were loyal to King John. The Vieuxponts were a powerful land-owning family in North West England, who also owned the castles of Appleby and Brough. In 1264, Robert de Vieuxpont's grandson, also named Robert, was declared a traitor, and his property was confiscated by Henry III. Brougham Castle and the other estates were eventually returned to the Vieuxpont family, and stayed in their possession, until 1269, when the estates passed to the Clifford family through marriage. With the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence, in 1296, Brougham became an important military base for Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. He began refortifying the castle: the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger, more impressive stone walls, and a large stone gatehouse was added. The importance of Brougham and Robert Clifford was such that, in 1300, he hosted King Edward I of England at the castle. Robert's son, Roger Clifford, was executed as a traitor, in 1322, and the family estates passed into the possession of King Edward II of England, although they were returned once his son Edward III became king. The region was often at risk from the Scots, and in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked., can you guess it ?

It was an activity that allowed him to lose himself in thought while methodically wiping away the dirt and dust that had gathered on the floor. The gentle swish of the bristles against the ground was soothing, a stark contrast to the cacophony of sounds that came from the vacuum cleaner. As he continued to sweep, he discovered that his mind became more tranquil, his thoughts clearer and more focused. There was something almost therapeutic about the monotonous, repetitive motion, the rhythmic scraping sound that accompanied each penetration of the broom into the farthest corners of a room. With every stroke, he felt the mounting stress of the day gently dissipate as a newfound sense of calm settled over him. He would often muse on the dissimilarities between sweeping with a broom and vacuuming. The vacuuming process felt more like an invasion, a forceful attack on the debris that had penetrated his sanctuary. It was loud, resource-consuming, and somewhat jarring; the vacuum's grating and abrasive sounds invading his peace. Conversely, using a broom was a more delicate approach to maintaining cleanliness, a silent oath to preserve the sanctity of his personal space. He realized that the way he navigated the broom through his living space signified a delicate dance, a ballet of sorts. With each step he took, he guided the slender instrument gracefully, allowing the soft bristles to make contact with the hardwood surface, their gentle embrace collecting the intruding particles that had dared to interrupt the balance of his abode. The act of cleaning with a broom was more than just about sweeping particles of dirt. It was about connecting with the space, the physical exertion of bending over or reaching out to access areas otherwise ignored during the vacuuming process. It was a deliberate gesture of intimacy, an investment of time and energy, that bore fruit as the house gained a palpable sense of renewed freshness. To him, using the broom was akin to practicing mindfulness. Just as the bristles traced the floor's patterns and textures, so did his thoughts wander through the fabric of his mind, processing the ripples of emotion he experienced each day. The simplicity of the broom was an invitation to appreciate the smaller details of his environment, as well as the workings of his inner psyche. As sweeping became an almost ritualistic practice for him, his newfound love for the age-old tool increased exponentially. Despite the advances in technology and the convenience that came with it, the humble broom held a special place in his heart. It symbolized a slower, more conscious way of living; an existence where the modern-day hustle was traded for the quiet luxury of mindful moments spent nurturing oneself, and the space around them. Though the vacuum cleaner might one day become obsolete, he felt assured that the broom would endure the test of time, a steadfast companion offering solace and serenity, nestled peacefully in the corner of his home. And as his broom danced across the floor, he cherished the simple but profound peace brought forth by its gentle embrace."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The Suntop Homes also known under the early name of The Ardmore Experiment were quadruple residences located in Ardmore Pennsylvania and based largely upon the 1935 conceptual Broadacre City model of the minimum houses.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: How do I get the number of a person who is on Facebook & WhatsApp and I only know its last 2 digits? Answer: It's important to recognize that acquiring someone's phone number without their consent is a breach of privacy and may be considered unethical. However, if you need to reconnect with a long-lost friend or contact someone for a legitimate reason, it's best to try other methods of reaching out before resorting to trying to figure out their phone number. Here are some suggestions to find someone with limited information: 1. Use mutual friends: If you have mutual friends with the person you're trying to reach, you can ask them for their contact information. This is the least intrusive method as it involves connecting through people who already know both parties. 2. Social media search: While it's not guaranteed to find the person you're looking for, you can try searching through social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter to locate their profiles, which may contain contact information if the person has made it public. 3. Reverse search: You can try using reverse lookup tools available online to find information on the person, but this may require more than just the last two digits of their phone number. Please remember that it's important to respect other people's privacy and only pursue legitimate reasons for attempting to reconnect or contact someone. Question 2: What happens if I accidently send a WhatsApp message to a person who doesn't have my number saved and then delete my account? Do they still get my number on their WhatsApp chat history? Answer: If you accidentally send a WhatsApp message to someone who doesn't have your number saved and then delete your account, the message would still appear in the recipient's chat history. However, it would not be associated with your saved contact information and would only display the phone number. Deleting your account only erases the information on your end and deletes your profile from the WhatsApp server. It does not affect the messages that have already been sent and received by the recipient. It's important to remember that deleting your account is a permanent action and cannot be undone. Therefore, it's advisable to think carefully before taking such a step. In conclusion, the answers to these two questions are not the same.

Brazilian international made headlines after he picked banana up and ate it. A 26-year-old man is now facing three years in jail after he was arrested. Article:","output":"Title: Racism in Football: Villarreal Supporter Faces Jail Time for Banana Incident Involving Barcelona's Dani Alves Introduction: Racism has been a longstanding issue in the world of professional football. A recent incident involving Brazilian international and Barcelona player Dani Alves has brought this issue to the forefront once again. A 26-year-old Villarreal supporter now faces up to three years in jail after being arrested for throwing a banana at Alves during a match. Step 1: Describe the incident that transpired During a match held in Villarreal, a banana was thrown onto the field in the direction of Barcelona's Dani Alves. The act is a gesture steeped in racism, historically aimed at black players in an attempt to mock and demean them. It took place as Alves was about to take a corner for his team. Step 2: Detail Alves' response to the incident Rather than letting the negative act ruin his spirit, Alves picked up the banana and ate it in front of the entire stadium. His response has garnered widespread attention and praise from around the world, making headlines for standing up against the racist behavior. Step 3: Explain the consequences for the Villarreal supporter's actions As a result of the incident, a 26-year-old man has been arrested and now faces up to three years in prison. Authorities identified the individual responsible and promptly took decisive action to ensure that he will be held accountable for his actions. The severity of the charges represents a strong response from the legal and football communities against racism. Step 4: Discuss the impact and importance of Alves' reaction Dani Alves made a powerful statement by not allowing the gesture to disrupt his gameplay or affect him emotionally, although it was undoubtedly hurtful and an act of discrimination. By eating the banana, Alves displayed courage, resilience, and a disarming sense of humor. The act highlighted the importance of players standing up against racial bias and bigotry in the sport of football. Step 5: Conclusion: The fight against racism continues The incident with Dani Alves and the swift action taken against the offender serve as reminders that racism still exists in football, and that much remains to be done in the fight against prejudice.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential music band. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\"; as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the band were integral to pop music's evolution into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s. Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.  In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' - kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\\" Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \\"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \\"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\\". As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.  During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South. When informed that the 11 September show at the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida was to be held at a segregated venue, the Beatles expressed astonishment and announced that they would refuse to perform unless the show become integrated. Lennon stated: \\"We never play to segregated audiences and we aren't going to start now ... I'd sooner lose our appearance money.\\" The group's stand drew controversy in the local media, but city officials relented and agreed to allow an integrated show. On the tour the group also refused to stay in segregated hotels. Documents reveal that for their subsequent US tours in 1965 and 1966, the Beatles included clauses in contracts stipulating that shows be integrated. What does this mean","output":"This passage highlights the influence of the Beatles and Bob Dylan on each other's musical styles and their role in breaking down the cultural barriers between different sections of their fan base. It also showcases the Beatles' stance against racial segregation in the United States, as they refused to perform at segregated venues and insisted on having integrated shows. This advocacy for equality and the blending of musical genres had a significant impact on the evolution of pop culture and the counterculture movement of the 1960s."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: CDC recommends all pregnant women get flu shots. Doesn't matter what trimester of pregnancy, flu shot is safe. Woman's husband said she was scheduled to get a flu shot.","output":"Title: CDC Recommends Flu Shots for Pregnant Women – Safety Across All Trimesters Article: In a recent announcement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) firmly recommended that all pregnant women, regardless of their stage of pregnancy, should get flu shots. This move has been taken in light of protecting both prospective mothers and their soon-to-be newborns from influenza viruses and complications related to them.  The CDC's advice comes as a reassuring move for many, making the flu shot not just an option but a necessity for expectant women. The health organization underlined that it does not matter what trimester of pregnancy a woman is in; the flu shot is safe and strongly suggested across all.  The safety of the flu shot during pregnancy has been a concern for many. However, proving the trust in the recommendation, a man reported that his pregnant wife was scheduled to get her flu shot, thereby implying that the directive is being followed earnestly by the public. This exemplifies that the notion about flu vaccines being unsafe during pregnancy is gradually changing among prospective parents. The safety and benefits of a flu vaccine are plentiful and particularly vital for pregnant women. Unlike common misconceptions, the flu shot does not cause the flu. Instead, the flu shot prepares the immune system to fight off influenza viruses by introducing non-infectious versions of these viruses into the body. This then triggers an immune response, producing antibodies that protect against influenza if exposure occurs in the future.  Pregnant women are at a higher risk for severe illness from flu compared to non-pregnant women. The immune, heart, and lung changes during pregnancy make them more prone to severe illness and hospitalization from the flu. The flu shot, therefore, becomes an essential protective measure. Moreover, the flu shot's protection extends beyond the mother, benefiting the unborn child as well. These antibodies pass on to the developing baby, and provide immunity for several months after birth, during a period when the baby is not old enough to get vaccinated.  In conclusion, the CDC's recommendation for all pregnant women to get flu shots across any trimester of pregnancy forms an essential part of preventive healthcare. Not only does it aim to protect the woman but it safeguards the newborn against potential health complications related to influenza. The acceptance and implementation of this guidance by the public proves its importance and underscores the trust in medical advisories for ensuring the wellbeing of both mother and child.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: Where is Aronnax trying to go? Movie plot title: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea Movie plot: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is a film by Richard Fleischer based on the famous Jules Verne novel written in the 19th century. The film begins with the first page of the book, talking about rumors of a mysterious sea monster that prowled the South Seas in 1868. The camera switches to an old-fashioned ship sailing through apparently calm seas. A long, dark object with glowing lights like eyes at its head appears a short distance away from the ship. It drives straight toward the ship, making a loud whirring noise of a motor. It collides head-on with the ship, sinking it, and sails off. A man standing before a crowd in San Francisco offers a bonus to any man who will ship with an expedition to hunt the mysterious \\"monster\\". Another man interrupts him, warning the crowd not to sign; they will never make it back to collect their pay. He brings up an elderly seaman who tells a dramatic story of how the \\"monster\\" sunk the ship he was on, and proceeds to give a vivid description of the monster. A young sailor, Ned Land, challenges the old sailor's claim and makes fun of the way his breath smells. His companion, Casey, hits him over the head with the sailor's cane and a fight breaks out. The police arrive and drag Ned Land away. Farther down the street, French professor Pierre Aronnax and his apprentice, Conseil, are trying to find a ship that will take them to Saigon, but are told that no one will sail through the South Seas. Three reporters ask for a statement from the professor about the monster, but he gives them an ambiguous answer.

Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country.  - A PC booter, or booter, is a type of software for home computer era (early 1980s to early 1990s) personal computers that was loaded and executed in the bootup of the computer, from a bootable floppy disk, rather than as a regular program; a booter thus bypassed any operating system that might be installed on the hard disk of the computer.

The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense).  - The TRS-80 Micro Computer System (TRS-80; later known as the Model I to distinguish it from successors) is a desktop microcomputer launched in 1977 and sold by Tandy Corporation through their Radio Shack stores. The name is an abbreviation of \\"Tandy/Radio Shack, Z-80 microprocessor\\". It was one of the earliest mass-produced personal computers.  - Epyx, Inc. was a video game developer and publisher active in the late 1970s and 1980s. The company was founded as Automated Simulations by Jim Connelley and Jon Freeman, originally using Epyx as a brand name for action-oriented games before renaming the company to match in 1983. Epyx published a long series of games through the 1980s, but nevertheless went bankrupt in 1989 before finally disappearing in 1993.  - Rescue at Rigel is a 1980 science fiction computer role-playing game written and published by Automated Simulations (later known as Epyx). It is based on a modified version of their \\"Temple of Apshai\\" game engine, which was part of most of their releases in this era. The game was released for the Apple II, IBM PC (PC Booter), TRS-80, VIC-20, and Atari 8-bit family.  - The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari, Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992. All of the machines in the family are technically similar, and differ primarily in packaging. They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw. \\"Star Raiders\\" is widely considered the platform's killer app.    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'designer' with the subject 'star warrior'.

Today, we are going to learn about a big decision that the Labour Party in the United Kingdom wants to make. Let's start with some simple words to help us understand: - Labour Party: A group of people in the United Kingdom who want to make decisions for the country. - United Kingdom (UK): A big island where people called British live. It has four main parts: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. - European Union (EU): A big group of countries that have decided to work together. They share things like toys and rules, so everyone can have fun and be safe. - Single Market: A place where countries can share toys, candies, and other things without any trouble. - Customs Union: A rule that says all countries in the group must agree to use the same prices for things, so no one is confused. Now that we know what these words mean, let's understand what the Labour Party wants to do! The Labour Party has said that if they make decisions for the United Kingdom, they want the country to stay in the European Union's Single Market and Customs Union for a little while after they leave the group. This is called a 'transitional period.'  Imagine that you and your friends are playing together, sharing toys and following the same rules. One day, you decide that you want to play by yourself. But instead of stopping immediately, you think it would be a good idea to keep sharing toys and following the same rules for a little bit longer. This way, you can slowly learn how to play by yourself, without upsetting your friends or getting too confused. That's what the Labour Party wants to do for the United Kingdom. By staying in the Single Market and Customs Union after leaving the European Union, they can make sure that people still share their toys (like cars and food) and have the same prices without trouble during the transition. This will help the country slowly adjust to being on its own and make sure everyone is ready for the big change!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Commissioner, the European Union's energy security policy is based on the diversification of energy supply sources and routes. Translate to Finnish","output":"Arvoisa komissaari, Euroopan unionin energiaturvallisuuspolitiikka perustuu energialähteiden ja niiden toimitusreittien monipuolistamiseen. Euroopan unioni pyrkii vahvistamaan energiaturvallisuuttaan monipuolistamalla energiavaroja, energiaa tuottavia maita ja energian kuljetusreittejä. Tämä strategia auttaa vähentämään riippuvuutta yksittäisistä toimittajista ja lisäämään energian saatavuutta kaikille jäsenmaille. EU:n energiaturvallisuuspolitiikka on osa laajempaa energia-alan strategiaa, joka tähtää yhteisen energiamarkkinan luomiseen ja edistää energiatehokkuutta, uusiutuvien energialähteiden käyttöä ja vähähiilisen talouden kehittämistä. Tämän politiikan tavoitteena on varmistaa luotettavat, kestävät ja kohtuuhintaiset energiatoimitukset Euroopan kansalaisille samalla, kun kasvihuonekaasupäästöjä ja ympäristövaikutuksia vähennetään. Energialähteiden monipuolistaminen tarkoittaa erilaisten energiatyyppien, kuten fossiilisten polttoaineiden, ydinvoiman ja uusiutuvan energian tasapainottamista EU:n energiavalikoimassa. Se auttaa vähentämään riippuvuutta yksittäisistä energialähteistä ja lisäämään energiamarkkinoiden kilpailukykyä. Energiantuottajamaiden ja kuljetusreittien monipuolistaminen on myös keskeistä EU:n energiaturvallisuudelle. Esimerkiksi eurooppalaisten kaasuhankintojen suuntaaminen eri maista tarkoittaa suurempaa joustavuutta ja vähäisempää altistumista mahdollisille toimitusongelmille. Samaa ajatusta voidaan soveltaa öljyn ja muiden polttoaineiden hankintaan. EU:n energiainfrastruktuuri on olennainen osa toimitusreittien monipuolistamista, koska se mahdollistaa energian siirtämisen jäsenvaltioiden välillä. Tämä sisältää investoinnit kaasu- ja sähköverkkoihin, erityisesti niin sanottuihin Projects of Common Interest (PCI), jotka ovat keskeisiä EU:n energia-alan kehitykselle. Lopuksi on tärkeää huomata, että EU:n energiaturvallisuuspolitiikka ei ole staattinen vaan jatkuvasti kehittyvä prosessi. Unioni pyrkii parantamaan energiaturvallisuuttaan ottamalla huomioon uusimmat geopoliittiset tapahtumat, tekniset innovaatiot ja markkinamuutokset. Tämän myötä EU:n on jatkuvasti mukautettava ja päivitettävä energiaturvallisuusstrategiaansa tarpeen mukaan."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Hedren was born on January 19, 1930, in New Ulm, Minnesota, to Bernard Carl and Dorothea Henrietta (nee Eckhardt) Hedren. For much of her career, Hedren's year of birth was reported as 1935. In 2004, however, she acknowledged that she was actually born in 1930 (which is consistent with the birth registration index at the Minnesota Historical Society). Her paternal grandparents were Swedish immigrants, while her maternal ancestry is German and Norwegian. In 1952, Hedren met and married 18-year-old future advertising executive Peter Griffith. Their daughter, actress Melanie Griffith, was born on August 9, 1957. They were divorced in 1961. On September 22, 1964, Hedren married her then-agent Noel Marshall, who later produced three of her films; they divorced in 1982. In 1985, she married steel manufacturer Luis Barrenechea, but they divorced in 1995. Hedren was engaged to veterinarian Martin Dinnes from 2002 until their breakup in mid-2008. In September 2008, Hedren told The Sunday Times \\"I'm waiting for someone to sweep me off my feet.\\"  Hedren played a role in the development of Vietnamese-American nail salons in the United States. In 1975, while an international relief coordinator with Food for the Hungry, she began visiting with refugees at Hope Village outside Sacramento, California. When she learned the women were interested in her manicured nails, she employed her manicurist to teach them the skills of the trade and worked with a local beauty school to help them find jobs. Hedren's work with the Vietnamese-Americans was the subject of Happy Hands, directed by Honey Lauren, which won Best Documentary Short at the Sonoma International Film Festival in 2014. CND and Beauty Changes Lives Foundation (BCL) have announced the BCL CND Tippi Hedren Nail Scholarship Fund to support professional nail education and will be administered starting January 1, 2014.  Hedren suffered from severe and persistent headaches for a long time and therefore was unable to accept several projects, including a television series produced by and starring Betty White. After she got a titanium plate put in her neck, she improved and then agreed, with the blessing of her doctor, to take the part of a dying woman in the soap opera Fashion House. While she was rehearsing a scene, a gallon of water fell from the ceiling onto her head. The headaches returned after the incident and persisted. Hedren filed a suit to receive recompense following her inability to work. Hedren's lawyer, Joseph Allen, made a mistake in his discussions with the defendants that allowed them to block him from filing suit. Hedren sued Allen for malpractice. In 2013, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Hedren had been awarded a 1.5 million settlement, including 213,400 for past lost earnings and 440,308 for future lost earnings, against her former lawyer. Hedren was hurt by the report since she had not collected the award. She gave an interview to explain that her former lawyer does not have the money to pay her, and discussed how the report put her in a difficult situation since her foundation was in dire need of funds. She explained that she has to raise 75,000 monthly just to keep it going. \\"Chances are I won't ever even see the money, and that what hurts so badly, that in all of this pain and suffering that publication ran with a swift and not researched story, which told people around the world who have been so gracious and thoughtful about sending donations, that I no longer needed them.\\" When did she get a divorce the first time?","output":"Hedren got a divorce from her first husband in 1961."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

These larger cities were parts of the still larger Kingdoms of the Diadochi. Greeks, however, remained aware of their past, chiefly through the study of the works of Homer and the classical authors. An important factor in maintaining Greek identity was contact with barbarian (non-Greek) peoples, which was deepened in the new cosmopolitan environment of the multi-ethnic Hellenistic kingdoms. This led to a strong desire among Greeks to organize the transmission of the Hellenic paideia to the next generation. Greek science, technology and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): With the secession away from the smaller communities in the Grecian world, what living situation wasn't of great importance?","output":"With the secession away from smaller communities in the Grecian world and the movement towards larger cities and kingdoms, the living situation that wasn't of great importance during the Hellenistic period was the rural, small-town lifestyle. During the Hellenistic period, the focus shifted towards urbanization and the establishment of larger cities. Greeks were more inclined to migrate from the countryside and smaller settlements to cities like Alexandria and Pergamon, where greater opportunities for trade, culture, and education were available. Consequently, the traditional rural lifestyles and smaller polis-centered communities, which relied heavily on agriculture and local governance, lost their prominence and significance. The shift towards urban living offered Greeks access to institutions such as libraries, gymnasiums, and theaters, which were essential to the transmission of Hellenic paideia. These institutions fostered a rich cultural and intellectual life, promoting the study of Homer, classical authors, and the advancement of various fields, including science, technology, and mathematics. In the new cosmopolitan environment of the multi-ethnic Hellenistic kingdoms, interactions among various cultures and peoples intensified, therefore the rural living situation, with its limited connections to the outside world, became less relevant. This move away from agricultural communities also contributed to the decline in importance of traditional agrarian roles and activities. Furthermore, the political environment changed, with the smaller independent city-states losing power and influence in the face of rising empires and kingdoms. The Diadochi, or successors of Alexander the Great, expanded their rule across vast territories, leading to reduced autonomy and relevance for the smaller city-states and rural settlements. Thus, the focus shifted towards larger urban areas, where political power, wealth, and influence were concentrated. In summary, during the Hellenistic period, the rural, small-town living situation dwindled in importance as Greeks increasingly migrated to larger cities and became part of expanding multi-ethnic kingdoms. This transition allowed for an enhanced preservation of the Hellenic paideia and the flourishing of various intellectual disciplines, while the traditional agricultural communities and lifestyles became less significant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Instead, what unfolded on the screen was a trite, predictable film that failed to live up to the excitement and quality of its predecessors. Step 2: Discuss weak plot and character development The plot of \\"Generic Blockbuster\\" felt like a rehash of the previous two films' storylines but with little innovation. In fact, it almost felt as if the writers copy-pasted the script from the last installment and made a few minor changes. The character development was equally lacking, with very few surprises or significant growth for any of the main characters. This made it difficult to care about their struggles or invest in their success. Step 3: Criticize unconvincing dialogue and performances To make matters worse, the dialogue in \\"Generic Blockbuster\\" was downright unconvincing and, at times, laughable. The overly dramatic lines delivered by the cast failed to invoke any emotional response other than cringing, which was only heightened by the over-the-top acting. Despite the talented ensemble, every performance felt strained and awkward, as if the actors themselves knew they were part of a subpar project. Step 4: Address lack of originality in visuals and action sequences The visuals and action sequences in \\"Generic Blockbuster\\" might have been its saving grace, but they too suffered from a striking lack of originality. Many of the set pieces had a déjà vu quality, merely re-creating previous encounters and battles seen in the franchise. Any sense of tension or engagement in these scenes was quickly deflated by their familiarity and predictability. Step 5: Evaluate the movie's overall impact In the end, \\"Generic Blockbuster\\" is a massive disappointment for both fans of the franchise and cinema-goers in general. What could have been a thrilling new chapter in the series was reduced to a labored, derivative retread that offered few moments of genuine entertainment or excitement. Step 6: Provide a closing statement Unfortunately, \\"Generic Blockbuster\\" is a prime example of a film that squanders its potential and loses sight of what made the franchise popular in the first place. While the series may continue with future installments, it is my hope that the creators learn from their mistakes and prioritize storytelling and character development over easy cash grabs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who questioned Kündinger about a music career for his son? ?  Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky... The answer is:","output":"Ilya"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what occurs in water as the moon revolves around Earth?\\" is \\"gravity\\", given that  tides occur in water as the moon revolves around Earth? Answer:","output":"Answer: B). No. The question \\"what occurs in water as the moon revolves around Earth?\\" is not adequately answered by just saying \\"gravity.\\" Although gravity plays a significant role in the phenomenon, it is essential to provide a more detailed and comprehensive explanation to shed light on the entire process. Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of gravitational forces exerted by the Moon, the Sun, and the Earth's rotation. As the Moon revolves around the Earth, the gravitational pull between the Earth and the Moon results in two tidal bulges – one on the side facing the Moon and another on the opposite side. This generates the high and low tides we experience on Earth. The gravitational force of the Moon is stronger on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, resulting in a tidal bulge toward the Moon. Meanwhile, on the opposite side, the weaker gravitational force results in a smaller centrifugal force that pushes water away from the Moon, creating another tidal bulge. As the Earth rotates on its axis, different areas pass through these tidal bulges, causing the cyclical rise and fall in local sea levels. In addition to the Moon's gravitational pull, the Sun also contributes to the tidal behavior. The Sun's gravitational force acts in conjunction with the Moon to produce spring tides and neap tides. Spring tides are characterized by higher high tides and lower low tides and occur when the Moon, Earth, and Sun are in a straight line (during a full moon or a new moon). Neap tides, with less pronounced high tides and low tides, occur when the Moon is at a 90-degree angle concerning the Earth and Sun (during the first and third quarter moon). In summary, while gravity plays a significant role in the tidal phenomenon occurring in the water as the Moon revolves around the Earth, it is necessary to provide a more in-depth explanation that encompasses the interplay of gravitational forces from both the Moon and the Sun, as well as the Earth's rotation, which ultimately cause the rise and fall of tides."},{"instruction":"Generate a 4-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.linphone.

He trained as a civil engineer in the early 1960s, but did the job for a year in Delhi and hated it. His elder brother was already earning a living taking pictures and suggested Rai accompany a friend on a shoot to take photographs of children in a local village. When he got there, Rai's interest was sparked not by the children but by a donkey foal in a nearby field. \\"I tried to get closer, but when I was about 10 feet away, the donkey started running and the children started laughing,\\" he says now, more than 40 years later. Rai chased the donkey for the best part of three hours in order to amuse his audience. \\"I was enjoying myself. After a while, the donkey got tired and stood there so I got closer and took the shot. It was evening and the landscape was fading in soft light.\\" His brother entered the resulting picture into a weekly competition run by the Times in London. It was published. \\"The [prize] money I got was enough to live on for a month,\\" says Rai. \\"I thought, 'This is not a bad idea, man!'\\" That was 1965. The following year, he joined the Statesman newspaper in West Bengal as its chief photographer. He never went back to civil engineering. \\"My father worked for the irrigation department,\\" says Rai. \\"People would ask how many sons he had and he would say, 'I have four. Two have gone photographers', like he was saying, 'Two have gone mad.'\\" His father need not have worried. Over a career spanning four decades, his son has become one of the foremost chroniclers of the changing face of India. His images are famed for capturing both his country's brutality and its beauty, often within a single frame. Rai, who was born in a small Pakistani village and came to India during Partition, has been witness to some of the most significant events in his country's recent history. He was one of the first photographers on the scene after the 1984 Bhopal industrial disaster and has produced acclaimed documentary series on Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama and the late Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi. Championed in the west by Henri Cartier-Bresson, Rai joined Magnum Photos in 1977 and went on to judge the World Press Photo Awards from 1990 to 1997. His impressive body of work is now being featured in a retrospective at the Aicon Gallery in central London and in a landmark exhibition at the Whitechapel, charting 150 years of photography from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. At 67, Rai says he is not \\"proud\\" of what he has achieved, \\"but it's fulfilling to know one is going deeper into the layers of complexity of my country … I like being among my own people. I merge with them. I don't carry camera bags, I don't wear stylish clothes. I have one camera with a zoom lens so I am not alarming people; no one is saying, 'Here comes a photographer!'\\" Like Cartier-Bresson, Rai believes in the importance of the telling detail and the captured moment: the crucial accent that gives greater meaning to the whole. \\"Either you capture the mystery of things or you reveal the mystery,\\" he explains. \\"Everything else is just information.\\" At Bhopal, when a toxic gas leak caused the death of more than 3,000 people, Rai focused on the burial of a single unknown boy, his blinded eyes staring blankly out of the rubble. It became a landmark photograph, all the more disturbing for its strange beauty. Was Rai thinking of his own four children when he was taking it? \\"No, I don't become sentimental. At the time you see a tragedy, if you worry about your own children, you get carried away and it's not a good idea.\\" But is he never troubled by his role as a detached witness? \\"It is important to be a witness and at times it's very painful. At times, you feel very inadequate that you can only do so much and no more.\\" Not all of his work deals with such brutal subject matter. Many of his photographs of daily life in India are full of humour and affection. Often, his images intrigue rather than merely entertain, causing the viewer to question what they are seeing. \\"Most people don't see, they just glance,\\" Rai says. \\"When we take a picture, we have to be aware of every inch of space we're dealing with.\\" With a World Press Award to his name, countless accolades and two forthcoming London exhibitions featuring his work, I wonder what his father would make of him now? Rai laughs. \\"He lived to see my success,\\" he says, \\"and then he was very happy.\\" Summary:","output":"Once upon a time, there was a man named Raghu Rai. He was a civil engineer, but he didn't like his job. One day, his brother invited him to accompany a friend to take pictures of children in a village. When Raghu saw a baby donkey in a field, he decided to take a picture of it. He chased the donkey and finally took the shot. His brother entered the picture into a competition and it won! Raghu got money, and he thought maybe photography wasn't a bad idea. In 1966, he started working as a chief photographer for a newspaper and never went back to his old job. Now, many years later, Raghu Rai has become a famous photographer. He has taken pictures of important events and people in India, such as Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, and the late Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi. His work has been shown in art galleries and he has won awards for his photography. Raghu believes that a good photograph either captures the mystery of something or reveals it. He is happy doing what he loves and his father, who at first didn't understand his choice, is also proud of his son's success."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is maladaptive daydreaming just a symptom of ADD? Can anyone see a link between binge eating and maladaptive daydreaming? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"Maladaptive Daydreaming (MD) and Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) are distinct psychological conditions, but there might be some overlap or co-occurrence between these two conditions. Maladaptive Daydreaming is a psychological phenomenon characterized by extensive, vivid, and immersive daydreams that interfere with a person's daily functioning, relationships, work, or academic performance. This concept was first introduced by Dr. Eli Somer in 2002. People who struggle with MD often report spending hours each day lost in complex daydreams, which can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, and frustration. Maladaptive Daydreaming is thought to arise as a form of escapist behavior, allowing people to cope with uncomfortable emotions, anxiety, or trauma, by retreating into a rich fantasy world. Attention Deficit Disorder refers to a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent problems with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity or restlessness that interfere with various aspects of life, including at home, at work, and in relationships. ADD, also commonly known as ADHD - Predominantly Inattentive Presentation, is generally diagnosed in childhood, but some people might not receive a formal diagnosis until adulthood. This condition has a strong genetic component and is thought to result from imbalances in neurotransmitters, especially dopamine and norepinephrine, which play key roles in regulating attention and executive functioning. Although Maladaptive Daydreaming and ADD are separate conditions, there could be a potential overlap or comorbidity between the two. Both conditions share features related to problems with attention and impaired daily functioning. It is possible that certain individuals with ADD might experience MD as a secondary symptom or as a coping mechanism for their attentional problems. Regarding the link between binge eating and maladaptive daydreaming, while there isn't extensive research specifically establishing a direct connection between them, it is possible that they share common underlying factors, such as stress, emotional dysregulation, or mental health concerns. Binge eating is characterized by consuming large amounts of food within a short time frame while experiencing a sense of loss of control. Binge eating is often linked to emotional factors where individuals use food to cope with distress, anxiety, or other negative emotions. In a similar fashion, maladaptive daydreaming can serve as an escape from emotional turmoil or challenging situations. It is important to remember that these three conditions (MD, ADD, and binge eating) are distinct, with unique diagnostic criteria, but they can potentially co-occur or share interaction based on the individual's psychological profile and life circumstances. In conclusion, Maladaptive Daydreaming and ADD are separate psychological conditions with distinct diagnostic criteria, but there might be some overlap or co-occurrence between them. Binge eating and maladaptive daydreaming could also share common psychological underpinnings, although a direct relationship is not firmly established. The questions about MD's relationship with ADD and binge eating are not the same, but both queries explore possible connections between these psychological phenomena."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.  Question: \\"What is the cause for the change in leadership between prime ministers and presidents between 1910-1926?\\" Answer: \\"The killing of King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe\\" Is this answer correct?

The correct cause for the frequent changes in leadership between prime ministers and presidents from 1910 to 1926 is the confusion and crisis in Portugal after the end of the monarchy, leading to political instability.

Afonso de Albuquerque was born in 1453 in Alhandra, near Lisbon. He was the second son of Goncalo de Albuquerque, Lord of Vila Verde dos Francos, and Dona Leonor de Menezes. His father held an important position at court and was connected by remote illegitimate descent with the Portuguese monarchy. He was educated in mathematics and Latin at the court of Afonso V of Portugal, where he befriended Prince John, the future King John II of Portugal. The fleet left Lisbon on 6 April 1506. Afonso piloted his ship himself, having lost his appointed pilot on departure. In Mozambique Channel, they rescued Captain Joao da Nova, who had encountered difficulties on his return from India; da Nova and his ship, the Frol de la mar, joined da Cunha's fleet. From Malindi, da Cunha sent envoys to Ethiopia, which at the time was thought to be closer than it actually is. Those included the priest Joao Gomes, Joao Sanches and Tunisian Sid Mohammed who, having failed to cross the region, headed for Socotra; from there, Afonso managed to land them in Filuk. After successful attacks on Arab cities on the east Africa coast, they conquered Socotra and built a fortress at Suq, hoping to establish a base to stop the Red Sea commerce to the Indian Ocean. However, Socotra was abandoned four years later, as it was not advantageous as a base.  At Socotra, they parted ways: Tristao da Cunha sailed for India, where he would relieve the Portuguese besieged at Cannanore, while Afonso took seven ships and 500 men to Ormuz in the Persian Gulf, one of the chief eastern centers of commerce. On his way, he conquered the cities of Curiati (Kuryat), Muscat in July 1507, and Khor Fakkan, accepting the submission of the cities of Kalhat and Sohar. He arrived at Ormuz on 25 September and soon captured the city, which agreed to become a tributary state of the Portuguese king.  Hormuz was then a tributary state of Shah Ismail of Persia. In a famous episode, shortly after it's conquest Albuquerque was confronted by Persian envoys, who demanded the payment of the due tribute from him instead. He ordered them be given a stock of cannonballs, arrows and weapons, retorting that \\"such was the currency struck in Portugal to pay the tribute demanded from the dominions of King Manuel\\"  According to Bras de Albuquerque, it was Shah Ismael who coined the term \\"Lion of the seas\\", addressing Albuquerque as such. Afonso began building the Fort of Our Lady of Victory (later renamed Fort of Our Lady of the Conception), engaging his men of all ranks in the work.  However, some of his officers revolted against the heavy work and climate and, claiming that Afonso was exceeding his orders, departed for India. With the fleet reduced to two ships and left without supplies, he was unable to maintain this position for long. Forced to abandon Ormuz in January 1508, he raided coastal villages to resupply the settlement of Socotra, returned to Ormuz, and then headed to India.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Where did they take off to?","output":"They took off from Lisbon.

He is deciding whether to stretch the cord only partially or completely before releasing it.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will the bungee cord resist further stretching more when it's stretched partially or completely?  Hint: Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape.

The customer highlights two significant issues with the product. Firstly, they mention that the inside earpiece is too large and cannot be adjusted enough to provide a comfortable fit. This issue, in turn, causes their ear to hurt and become sore. Comfort is a crucial aspect of user experience when it comes to headphones, and products that cause discomfort are likely to leave users dissatisfied. If the headset is uncomfortable to wear, it significantly diminishes the chances of the customer using the product continually and frequently, thereby causing frustration. Secondly, the customer points out that the sound quality is subpar, with the headset sounding like an open microphone. Audio performance is another vital factor in determining the overall satisfaction of customers when it comes to audio equipment. Given that the headset does not meet the customer's expectations in terms of sound quality, we can deduce that the customer is not satisfied in this regard. However, despite these two prominent issues, the customer indicates that \\"other than that, it's great.\\" This statement implies that there could be elements of the product that they find satisfactory, although they do not elaborate on these aspects. Considering the two primary concerns they raise, which may outweigh the positive attributes, it is safe to say that the customer is generally dissatisfied with the Bluetooth headset 510 Plantronics. In conclusion, the customer appears to be predominantly dissatisfied with the Bluetooth headset due to issues with comfort and sound quality. While there may be other features they appreciate, it is apparent that the negative aspects have a more significant impact on their overall experience and satisfaction with the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Harker debarks at Castle Dracula, and the coach immediately rushes off. Somewhat hesitantly, Harker approaches the main door, whereupon a thin, tall, gaunt old man opens it. Harker asks, \\"Count Dracula?\\" \\"I am Dracula, enter freely and of your own will,\\" says the man at the door. Dracula takes Harker to his bedchamber where Harker notices that Dracula casts no reflection. Later, Harker goes to sleep. He wakes in an ancient crypt where he is seduced by three beautiful vampiresses. Dracula rushes into the room in a rage and orders them to leave Harker alone. Dracula explains, \\"This man belongs to me,\\" then gives the vampiresses a baby to feed on. Harker wakes up screaming in his room and assumes it was a nightmare, but two small wounds on his neck indicate otherwise. Harker soon realises he is a prisoner, and tries to escape by climbing out of his bedroom window. He finds his way back to the crypt where Count Dracula and his three brides rest in coffins. Harker runs out of the crypt screaming, and jumps out of the castle's tower into the river below.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Wilson Dam is near Memphis.","output":"No, the sentence \\"Wilson Dam is near Memphis\\" does not directly follow the given preceding text. The information states that Wilson Dam spans the Tennessee River between Lauderdale County and Colbert County in the U.S. state of Alabama. It does not mention its exact location or its proximity to Memphis. However, to provide more details on the relationship between Wilson Dam and Memphis, allow me to do the following: Wilson Dam, a National Historic Landmark constructed by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), is located near the cities of Muscle Shoals and Florence in northwestern Alabama. Memphis, a city in southwestern Tennessee, is approximately 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Wilson Dam. Though both Wilson Dam and Memphis are located within the Tennessee River watershed, they are not in close proximity to each other. Memphis is located near the Mississippi River, while Wilson Dam is in Alabama, bordering the Tennessee River. The Tennessee River, formed by the confluence of the Holston and French Broad rivers in eastern Tennessee, traverses through Tennessee, Alabama, and a small portion of Mississippi before re-entering Tennessee, looping through its northwestern corner, and finally joining the Ohio River at Paducah, Kentucky. With its course covering roughly 652 miles (1,049 kilometers), the Tennessee River is the tributary with the largest drainage basin feeding the Ohio River. The Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally-owned corporation established by the U.S. government in 1933, constructed Wilson Dam as part of a broader effort to address flooding, provide electricity, and bolster river navigation throughout the Tennessee Valley region. The TVA's system of dams and reservoirs has significantly impacted the region's economic development, agricultural output, and overall quality of life. In summary, Wilson Dam is a significant historical and functional structure in Northwestern Alabama. Although it is not in close proximity to Memphis, Tennessee, both locations are part of the broader Tennessee River watershed, with Wilson Dam playing a key role in managing the region's water resources and Memphis being one of the major cities within the river's reach."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Parents die, leaving kids devastated and unable to speak for days. Parents get deported, leaving kids despondent and hopeless. Children endure emotional, sexual, physical abuse. And more. The saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework. She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters. After going around and around for a while with me and the principal, her mother said that her divorce had really affected this girl, and she had been fighting so hard all her life to get into Berkeley, and what did I have against her daughter? She deserved to go to Cal! They were all in tears. The principal found a way to change her 64% to a 70.01%, and off she went. This young woman full of potential and energy, learned from her mother and my boss, that excuses rule the day. She appears to think that “social justice” means fighting to get your way because the deck is stacked against you, instead of doing the right thing. This is sad. I know this isn’t what you were after, and that this memory says more about me than it does about her. Many other kids I have counseled, who are getting through something life-changing, seem to understand that life is in session, there will always be challenges to rise above, and that focusing in the classroom is a great way to get one’s mind off one’s troubles, if the environment is supportive and the spirit is willing.

Options: - carpark - hospital - building - garage - bus stop  Explain why a human would choose \\"bus stop\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"bus stop\\" to answer the question above because, in this scenario, the person does not have a car and needs to get to a certain destination. Among the options given, the most logical choice for transportation is the bus stop. Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. Analyze the situation: The person does not possess a car but needs to reach a certain location. 2. Consider the options:     - Carpark: A carpark is a place where people park their cars. Although the person might find cars here, it wouldn't be of much use to them since they don't own one.    - Hospital: A hospital is a place for medical treatment and care. It doesn't directly address the transportation issue.    - Building: A building could be any structure, and, without more context, it's not clear how it would help the person to get anywhere.    - Garage: A garage is a place where people store their cars or have them repaired. Although a person might find cars or a potential ride in a garage, it's less likely that it would serve as a means of transportation than a bus stop.    - Bus stop: A bus stop is a designated place where passengers can board or alight from a public transport bus. It directly addresses the person's need for transportation. 3. Choose the most appropriate option: From the analyzed options, the bus stop stands out as the logical choice for someone looking to travel without a car.

Given these facts, what makes plants leaves get bigger among the following options: - Light  - heat  - Enzymes  - energy  - Snow  - Darkness  - Wind  - Dry soil Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's consider the factors that contribute to the growth of a plant and the enlargement of its leaves: 1. Light: Plants require light for photosynthesis, the process by which they convert light energy into chemical energy to fuel their growth. This energy is used for both increasing the height of the plant and the size of the leaves.  Step justification: Light is necessary for photosynthesis, which is essential for plant growth. 2. Heat: While not directly responsible for the increase in leaf size, heat can impact the rate of various plant processes, including growth. Optimal temperatures help to improve plant functions and potentially contribute to faster growth. However, it is not the primary factor for leaves getting bigger. Step justification: Heat, although it influences the growth rate, is not directly responsible for leaf enlargement. 3. Enzymes: Enzymes are involved in various plant processes, including growth. They help catalyze reactions within the plant, which may contribute to a plant's overall growth and the development of bigger leaves.  Step justification: Enzymes play important roles in plant growth, which is related to leaf enlargement. 4. Energy: Energy is required for plant growth, and it can be thought of as a more generic term encompassing light and photosynthesis. Plants use energy from light to grow, which results in larger leaves. Step justification: Energy is a necessary factor for plant growth, which involves leaf enlargement. 5.

Write highlights for this article: Militant preacher Anjem Choudary has been identified as a leading British influence for the Al Qaeda-linked terrorists who carried out the Kenya shopping mall atrocity, it emerged yesterday. London-based Choudary, who has been linked to dozens of terrorist suspects, is highlighted in a video issued by East African group Al-Shabaab. The video also says 11 Britons have died waging jihad in Somalia. One of the leading figures in Al-Shabaab – blamed for last month’s Nairobi attack which left 67 dead – is ‘white widow’ Samantha Lewthwaite. The whereabouts of Lewthwaite, former wife of 7/7 bomber Jermaine Lindsay, remains a mystery. Hate-preacher Anjem Choudary makes an appearance in the video saying that the British Prime Minster and President Obama treat 'Muslim blood like water' Mohammed Ansar, 39, left, a British documentary film-maker and journalist  was one of the figures singled out for criticising jihadists in the wake of the Lee Rigby's, right,  murder in Woolwich in May. A still from the video: The film opens with the narrator of the film, who has a British accent, praising the death of Lee Rigby and inciting others in the UK to carry out similar attacks. Counter-terrorism detectives at. Scotland Yard, who have been on a heightened state of alert following. the Kenyan outrage, are examining the 58-minute video by Al-Shabaab. which endorses Choudary. Called ‘Woolwich Attack: It’s an Eye. for an Eye’, the English-language production urges Muslims in Britain to. go to Somalia to fight jihad or carry out terror attacks in the UK if. they are unable to travel. It is the first such propaganda video to be entirely focused on recruiting Britons and inciting terror attacks in the UK. The content of much of the video. cannot be reported because of legal reporting restrictions and laws that. forbid the incitement of terrorism. Choudary, 46, features significantly. in the video and is lauded as a ‘Caller to Islam’, marking the first. time that he has been publicly endorsed by Al Qaeda. It suggested that he and a militant. colleague based in North-West London are the main points of contact for. Muslims eager to wage jihad in Somalia or Britain. Choudary is seen blaming British. foreign policy for terrorist attacks in the UK and warning of more. attacks. In a clip from the video – thought to be taken from the. internet – he says: ‘The Government want people to swallow something. that is completely nonsensical, it doesn’t make any sense: their foreign. policy has had a direct impact on the streets of London.’ The narrator is believed to be a. Briton who uses the name Abu Omar, who claimed that Muslims had turned. to jihad as ‘the only viable solution to counter the crusades engulfing. the entire Muslim world’. Scotland Yard said: ‘We are aware of the video and we are assessing its contents.’ Turning point: Mohammed Ansar, 39, made a BBC film about ex-English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson, who he famously hugged in the aftermath of Lee Rigby's killing. Mohammed Ansar, 39, a British documentary film-maker and journalist was one of the figures singled out in the hour-long video. Police visited him on Wednesday evening to discuss safety arrangement for him and his family following the film's release. He also made a BBC film about ex-English. Defence League leader Tommy Robinson, who he famously hugged in the. aftermath of the killing. The. video is not widely available on the internet, but it opens with the. narrator of the film, who has a British accent, praising the death of Lee Rigby and inciting others in the UK to carry out similar attacks. Targets: Other figures threatened in the video include broadcaster Ajmal Masroor. Harar 24, which saw a version of the film reported: 'In the video certain Muslim scholars and community leaders are referred to as being on the “government’s payroll” for speaking against the Woolwich attack and “distancing themselves from the mujahideen\\" '. 'Al-Shabaab in the video claims that the Woolwich attack was a result of British foreign policy, for killing Muslims and for aiding the United States in their “war of terror”' The narrator of the film, wearing a. black mask and holding an automatic weapon, tells viewers 'Do not. waste your time trying to re-invent the wheel. 'If you can’t afford to get hold of [a gun] then certainly a simple knife from your local B&Q will do the job.' He told followers to 'cut the necks of the disbelievers.' Mr Ansar told the Guardian that police were now regularly patrolling his residence and keeping in contacting by phoning every hour. 'If. they [jihadists] are going to start targeting British Muslims and set. fanatical extremists against them then that is a frightening new. dimension,' he said. On his. Twitter page Mr Ansar wrote this morning: 'My family and I would like. to thank the wonderful @HantsPolice and @HantsChiefAndy all their hard. work and diligence. ' Other. figures threatened in the video include Usama Hasan, a senior. researcher with the anti-extremist Quilliam Foundation and the imam and. broadcaster Ajmal Masroor. Mr. Masroor wrote on his Facebook page that he was visited by police. officers from Scotland Yard this week after he had put his children to. bed. Imam and broadcaster Ajmal Masroor was one of the figures threatened in the video. He wrote this post on Facebook. He said he was told his life was in danger when they showed him a piece of paper. 'The basic message contained in the paragraph was that my life was in imminent danger from the terrorists. The police officers were visiting me to give me a warning and asking me to be more vigilant. They were being the messengers. They left me a telephone number to call in case of emergency or if I felt under any immediate danger. They did not give me any further details and left me guessing. 'As soon as they left my house I started digging further and found an Al-Shabab video has been uploaded on the Internet and in it they name me as a Muslim who is an enemy of Islam and should be eliminated. 'They name a few others in their video message and encourage people to resort to using knives to behead people like me. I spend some time today to verify the threat and it was confirmed to me that it was this video that had spurred our security services to action.' The video is thought to have been filmed before last month's massacre at a Kenya mall which left at least 67 people dead. The. Somali Islamic group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the assault. and said it was in retaliation for Kenya sending troops into neighboring. Somalia. Scotland Yard told the MailOnline: 'We are aware of the video that has been released and we are currently assessing it's contents.'","output":"A militant preacher named Anjem Choudary is influencing a group of terrorists called Al Qaeda.

Translate to Finnish","output":"Ensuring a proper translation requires an understanding of the content you would like to have translated into Finnish. However, since you didn't provide specific text or context, I can provide general guidance on translating from English to Finnish. Finnish is a Uralic language, which is entirely different from Indo-European languages like English. Nevertheless, it is possible to translate between the two languages effectively. To achieve this, consider the peculiarities of Finnish grammar, vocabulary, and syntax. Here's an overview of the essential components for translating text into Finnish: 1. Vocabulary: Start by looking up English words' Finnish equivalents using a reliable dictionary or translation tool. While some words might have direct translations, others might not, and using idioms or phrases in Finnish may be necessary to convey the intended meaning. 2. Grammar: Finnish grammar differs significantly from English grammar. Finnish has 15 grammatical cases for nouns, pronouns, and adjectives that change their endings to indicate their function in a sentence. English, on the other hand, relies on word order and prepositions. Adjusting for these differences is crucial to formulating accurate translations. 3. Syntax and Word Order: The basic word order in Finnish is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), similar to English. However, Finnish word order can be more flexible, especially for emphasis or stylistic purposes. Additionally, Finnish doesn't use articles for nouns, so this is an essential aspect to consider when translating. 4. Formality: The Finnish language has two main forms – the formal and informal. The former is a more polite form, predominantly used for written communication and in formal situations. The latter is typically used among friends, family, and in casual conversations. Choose the appropriate form based on the context of the text to be translated. 5. Idiomatic expressions and sayings: These often prove challenging to translate because of cultural differences. To overcome these challenges, try to find Finnish idiomatic expressions that have similar meanings to their English counterparts. Alternatively, attempt to describe the meaning of the expression in a different way. 6. Proofreading and editing: Once you have translated the text, re-read it thoroughly to ensure the translation is accurate and that it retains the original meaning and context. It's also helpful to have a native Finnish speaker review the translation for naturalness, grammar, and syntax. Remember that translation is both a science and an art, so having a deep understanding of the nuances and subtleties of both languages is essential to producing accurate translations. If you provide the specific text or context you'd like translated, I'd be happy to provide a detailed Finnish translation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Let's break down each option: 1. *Trims the real hedge:* This choice does not make sense, as the man is already trimming hedges, implying that they are \\"real hedges.\\" Therefore, this option does not provide any relevant or new information. 2. *Trims a blue branch with the hedge trimmer:* This choice seems unlikely, as hedges and their branches are typically green or brown (when dry), and not blue. While it is possible to find plants with blue-tinged leaves or branches, these are not commonly seen as the primary color in standard hedge plants. Thus, this option seems improbable in a real-life context. 3. *Trims a smaller and smaller blue hedge with the trimmer:* This option is incorrect for the same reasons as the second choice – hedges are not usually blue. Additionally, the description of a hedge becoming \\"smaller and smaller\\" implies a continuous, repetitive action without necessarily progressing the scenario. 4. *Trims another hedge with trimmer:* This choice is the most logical and realistic one, as it continues the context provided in the initial statement. The man has already trimmed two hedges, and it is reasonable to assume that he will move on to trim another hedge as part of his task or routine. As a result, the most appropriate continuation of the sentence is: \\"The man trims another hedge with trimmer.\\" This choice showcases a logical progression of events and is anchored in a common understanding of hedge-trimming tasks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: For a stay-at-home mom, a computer with an Internet connection can truly be a lifeline . When diapers and baby talk become just too much, adult talk is just a click away. But for some moms, the attraction of the online world becomes too strong to resist  and instead of being an occasional thing, it becomes an addiction . Coleen Moore of the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery says she is seeing a growing number of young stay-at -home moms for whom blogs and social networking have become a passion, which will harm their real-world lives. Now, Internet addiction is not officially recognized as a mental disorder. But a recent survey showed 14 percent of Internet users find it hard to stay away from their computers for several days at a time, and that 8 percent use the Web to escape problems. Considering this, it is probably just a matter of time before it is. What drives a mom to the Internet is not different from what drives an alcoholic  to drink: an empty place that needs filling. \\"In addiction treatment, we talk about the fact that there's a void ,\\"says Moore. \\"Whatever that void may be -- whether it's emotional, spiritual, physical--we're trying to fill it.\\" So, how can you find the void? A journal tracking when and why you go online and what you may be avoiding when you do so can be helpful in finding it out. But what makes Internet dependence special is the fact that usually it is not just a way to escape the tiring parenting or make a connection with others, but also a way to make a statement and be heard.

As he got closer he called out,\\"Good morning!What are you doing?''

Question: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care.

British scientists said last Wednesday humans may have underestimated the woolly creature. They could be much smarter than we think. Researchers at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge, southern England, have shown that the animals have a good memory system and are extremely good at recognizing faces--which they think is a sure sign of intelligence. Behavioral scientist Keith Kendrick and his friends trained 20 sheep to recognize and distinguish 25 pairs of sheep faces and used electrodes   to measure their brain activity , which showed they could remember 50 faces for up to two years . \\"If they can do that with faces, they have to have reasonable intelligence; otherwise, what is the point of having a system for remembering faces and not remembering anything else?\\" Kendrick said in an interview. So hours of seemingly mindless eating grass may not be so mindless after all.

Not only would those who are able to pay for an organ enjoy a much better chance at recovery , but there would be more time , space , and resources for the people who could not afford to do this privately . 2. Allowing the sale of organs is merely an extension of this principle and provides utilitarian benefit . 3. Meanwhile , in the US , private healthcare is the norm . 4. There is , however , a general understanding that the NHS in the UK is overburdened and that increased private healthcare would help to balance this . 5. Critics have understood this as the government prolonging waiting lists until the patients remove themselves either by going private , or dying . 6. The ethics of private healthcare are not in question here ; indeed , the UK government has stated that as many people as possible should be encouraged to pay for private healthcare in order to relieve the strain on national resources . What claim can be made from these sentences?","output":"The claim that can be made from these sentences is that the privatization of organ sales and expansion of private healthcare services is a pragmatic approach for alleviating the ongoing burdens being placed on national healthcare systems, like the UK's National Health Service (NHS). This claim is based on the principle of offering a more efficient and resource-orientated solution for the scarcity problem in organ transplantation and generally healthcare provision.  The sentences suggest that those with the financial means could expedite their organ acquisition process, which in turn would free up resources, time, and space, and potentially increase the survival rates for those unable to independently finance an organ. The idea is not only envisioned as an extension of deciding freely about personal health choices but carries a utilitarian justification that signifies achieving the greater good for the most number of individuals. The scenario where private healthcare services are dominant, such as in the United States, is implied as a model to be considered elsewhere. This comparative note is further underscored with the situation concerning the UK's NHS, which is publicly funded and reportedly overstretched. The privatization avenue is recognized as a possible mechanism to manage and eventually lighten this overload by redirecting those who can afford to private services. Much of this reasoning, however, is clouded by criticisms interpreting the waitlist management as a strategic way to either force patients to opt for private healthcare or unfortunately meet their demise. Despite these opposing views, the embrace of private healthcare services - and by extension, organ sales - is portrayed as ethically sound, with even the UK government positioned as urging for as much participation from the population as feasible.  Thus, the overarching claim here is that privatizing organ sales and promoting private healthcare is a feasible and beneficial strategy that can potentially mitigate the strain on national healthcare resources for the sake of overall societal benefit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz.  I am facing a new situation today: David wants to categorize animals according to the sound waves they can hear. Eventually, he was able to categorize them in three different groups, group A, group B, and group C. He placed the animals that can only hear ifrasound in group A. Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound.

Please briefly summarize this news article: BeeTV HD is a Social TV Companion for the iPad TV recommendation engine BeeTV has just released a new iPad app designed to let users get personalized show recommendations and share what they are watching with their friends. The app, BeeTV HD [iTunes link] is designed to bring the full BeeTV website experience to the iPad. Users who opt to sign in using Facebook or Twitter can find out what their friends are watching. Users can also share what shows they are watching or planning to watch across their social networks. The main BeeTV page shows users what shows are currently trending — as well as what shows their friends are currently discussing or watching. The trending area is based on activity on Facebook and Twitter and is a good way to grasp what content is popular at a given time. Tapping on a show or movie page gives the user an overview of what others are saying about a particular program or movie as well as any comments that friends have made. In a lot of ways, BeeTV is similar to checkin services like GetGlue or Miso, but the difference is BeeTV’s approach is more focused on helping people find new things to watch — or share what they are currently watching — rather than necessarily being about checking into a program. Users can enter their zip code and select a television provider to get customized updates and recommendations for content to watch now or at a future time. Using Facebook likes and ratings within the BeeTV ecosystem, the recommendations are tailored to the user. Users can indicate that they plan to watch a future program by tapping a timer icon. They will then receive notification alerts before the program airs. BeeTV HD also lets users check out TV listings for their area, using a convenient link to Zap2it’s TV guide. The iPad app looks very much like the BeeTV home page. It’s easy on the eyes and arranges data in a flexible grid format. We did have some issues with the app crashing but overall found the interface to be quite good. Our favorite feature of BeeTV HD is the “upcoming favorites” section. I recently moved to a new city and still don’t have the cable lineup memorized; I also don’t know the syndication schedule very well. Being able to see that The Simpsons is on a local affiliate at 7:00PM is a nice touch. I also like that I can see a list of upcoming movies on the various premium stations. For those looking for a TV guide with a social twist, BeeTV HD is a great couch companion. Summary:","output":"BeeTV has launched a new iPad app, BeeTV HD, which aims to provide personalized TV show recommendations and enable users to share their viewing choices with friends. Signing in through Facebook or Twitter allows users to see what their friends are watching and share their own preferences. The main BeeTV page displays trending shows based on Facebook and Twitter activity and gives users access to comments on particular programs or movies. Unlike similar check-in services, BeeTV is more focused on helping users discover new content and share their current viewing habits. The app allows users to receive customized updates and content recommendations based on user-specific preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Possible answers: a). World b). Sports c). Business d). Science/Tech","output":"The appropriate topic that this information falls under is: c). Business. Below is a detailed explanation to justify this response: The given excerpt mentions the \\"head of information security at Toyota,\\" and he is addressing \\"press, analysts, and IT bosses.\\" Information security primarily concerns protecting business information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It’s a vital aspect of most modern businesses, particularly as they increasingly rely on digital platforms and infrastructure. Furthermore, he is discussing his concerns about claims made by some security vendors and resellers. Vendors and resellers are integral parts of a business environment, as they provide necessary equipment, solutions, or services to firms. In this context, they are most likely offering cyber security solutions or products - a key component of business operations in this digital era.  The fact that Toyota is involved, a multinational automotive manufacturer, further emphasizes this as a business matter. Toyota operates a vast and multifaceted business that addresses several markets and industries globally, and maintaining secure information systems is paramount for their operations. Thus, while there may be a tangential link to science/technology because of the reference to information security, the dominant theme in the provided information regards the operations, concerns, vendors, and strategies central to ambitious businesses like Toyota.

Your task is to classify whether the given answer is correct or not by providing \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\", based on the article. Input: Article: One of the traditions which is now a necessary part of Christmas is a that of Father Christmas, or Santa Claus. According to the modern legend, he is a magical figure who visits all the children of the world during the night before Christmas Day, leaving presents which they find the next morning. He flies through the night sky in a sledge pulled by reindeer, and enters houses by climbing down chimneys. This strange legend is based on the life of a man called Nicholas, but in fact we know very little about him. Historians think he was a Christian bishop in Turkey in about 285--350 A.D. One of the stories about him is that he helped three poor girls. No one would marry them because they were so poor. To provide them with money for their weddings, Nicholas secretly dropped some gold coins down the chimney of their house. After Nicholas died, he was made a saint  by the church.(The name Santa Claus thus comes from St Nicholas.) His feast day was celebrated in December, and parents started giving their children secret presents from St Nicholas. Over the years, this custom became part of our Christmas traditions. Recently, a psychologist has claimed that Father Christmas is \\"the perfect fantasy\\" for children. According to Professor Anthony Clare, children love the character of Father Christmas because he is like an ideal father: he loves children and gives them presents, but he never criticizes them, is never angry, and children do not even need to thank him for the presents. Other writers, however, point out that Father Christmas can be a frightening character to some children. Jane Bidder says that some children are terrified of this fat, bearded old man. It can certainly confuse many children. As parents, we warn our children to be careful of strangers and never to let them into the house, and yet we tell children that a strange man will come into their bedroom at night! Some children can become very worried about this idea and fear that he is a kind of burglar. Most children, however, understand from their parents and from the media that Father Christmas is basically a _ character, and look forward to his annual visit with joy and excitement.   Question: The writer mentions details such as Father Christmas's sledge, the reindeer and the way he climbs down chimneys because he/she  _   Options: (A) wants to make it clear that these things are impossible (B) is describing the history of St Nicholas (C) wants everyone to believe that Father Christmas is real (D) is explaining the modern legend of Father Christmas   Asnwer: A Output:","output":"No"},{"instruction":"After battling the way through traffic, Lee came to pick Quinn up from school.

Which scientist read more about  tree leaves falling on the forest floor?  Two pedologists studied different types of soil. Yun studied forest soils, while Jian studied grassland soil. They were both very surprised with they findings.  Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

Using chicken at room temperature, breading it, and slipping it into the GrandPappy, I found that when the coating reached a pleasing golden brown, the meat was not thoroughly cooked. When leaving the chicken in the pot long enough to be done, the breading burned--not at all tasty.The GrandPappy is a plug-and-play product without temperature control. The oil gets very hot, too hot. My candy thermometer revealed the oil temperature resides at 380 degrees. The recommended oil temperature for deep frying chicken is 365 degrees, explaining why the outside of the chicken is done well in advance of the inside.I would not recommend this product. Is this product review negative? A:","output":"Yes, this product review is indeed negative. The reviewer explicitly expresses their dissatisfaction with the product, the Presto GrandPappy deep fryer. They highlight several qualities that they find problematic, which negatively affected their overall user experience. The main issues they point out are: 1. Cooking Results: The user mentions their disappointment with the cooking outcome multiple times. When attempting to deep fry chicken, they found that the coating would reach a nice golden brown colour while the meat remained uncooked. When they left the chicken in the fryer long enough for the meat to fully cook, the breading ended up burning, rendering the final product unappetizing. 2. Lack of Temperature Control: Another critical problem the reviewer encountered was the absence of a temperature regulator on the deep fryer. The user deemed this as an indication of the lack of flexibility in adjusting the cooking process according to the type of food being cooked.  3. Overheating: Through their use of a candy thermometer, the reviewer discovered that the oil in the GrandPappy reached a scorching 380 degrees. Given that the recommended temperature for deep frying chicken is 365 degrees, this made the fryer too hot for the purpose and attributed to the aforementioned poor cooking results. 4. Lack of Recommendation: Perhaps the most telling sign that the review is negative is that the user outright declares that they would not recommend this product to others, signifying their general disapproval. Therefore, analysing these specific points, it's clear that the reviewer is not satisfied with the Presto GrandPappy deep fryer. Hence, the review is negative."},{"instruction":"Title: If the tiles would go into the squares, it would be great Review: I love Scrabble.

Disbelief: The user starts the tweet with \\"seriously?\\" which indicates disbelief and surprise at the information they've come across. 2.

As such, these processes are key mechanisms in the geological formation of various mineral deposits and rock types. Bread, on the other hand, is a food product made from a mixture of flour, water, yeast, and other ingredients. It is unrelated to geological processes like crystallization or dissolution of minerals. The main concern for bread storage is to prevent it from going stale or growing mold due to excess moisture. Storing bread in a plastic bag can help to retain its freshness by creating a barrier that keeps out external contaminants, reduces exposure to air, and maintains a consistent level of moisture. The plastic bag's properties help to slow down the staling process and prevent the growth of mold. Now, in terms of the potential relationship between bread storage in a plastic bag and the formation of minerals, there is no direct connection or influence. The specific processes involved in mineral formation are geological in nature and unrelated to the preservation of a food product like bread. Therefore, storing bread in a plastic bag would not directly affect the geological processes that lead to the formation of more minerals. However, if we were to consider the broader implications of using plastic bags for storage on the environment, there might be an indirect influence on geological processes. The production and disposal of plastic bags contribute to pollution and the release of greenhouse gases. This could potentially have effects on the Earth's climate, geology, and hydrology, which might indirectly influence geological processes such as mineral formation. However, this would be an indirect and complex relationship that cannot be directly quantified in terms of the \\"more, less or no effect\\" criteria of the question. To conclude, while keeping bread in a plastic bag may help preserve the bread, it has no direct effect on the formation of minerals through the processes of magma or lava cooling, crystallization, or dissolution. The use of plastic bags could have some indirect environmental implications that might contribute to geological processes in a complex, interconnected manner, but this is beyond the scope of the initial query and would require further assessment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the fact that:  Natural selection is the process by which living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring, so their traits become more common over time.  Answer the question:   If the number of offspring of an species is decreased, what happens to the number of traits they have in common with one another they will have more traits in common or they will have less traits in common? The answer is:","output":"If the number of offspring of a species is decreased, it may lead to a reduction in the genetic diversity within the species. This is because fewer offspring produced will result in a smaller gene pool for the future generations, making it more likely for individuals within the species to share similar traits. However, the specific impact on traits that the species have in common depends on several factors, including the variation of traits within the parental generation and the strength of the selective pressures acting on the population. If there are strong selective pressures (such as environmental factors or competition) on the species, natural selection will still favor the individuals with beneficial traits, increasing the likelihood of those traits being passed on to the limited number of offspring. In this case, the traits in common among the species may increase, despite the reduced number of offspring. On the other hand, if the selective pressures are weak or largely absent in the population, genetic drift might become more significant. This means that the frequency of traits in the population can increase or decrease due to random chance rather than as a result of natural selection. In this scenario, the decrease in offspring numbers could either lead to an increase or decrease in the traits they have in common with one another, depending largely on random chance and the initial genetic diversity of the population. Overall, the specific outcome depends on various factors, but generally speaking, a reduced number of offspring may lead to a decrease in genetic diversity and potentially a higher proportion of traits they have in common with one another, particularly in situations where there are strong selective pressures at play."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: A spokeswoman at the international forces’ joint command in Kabul said Friday that two American soldiers were killed Thursday by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan, but gave no further details. The deaths bring to three the number of United States service members killed in the Afghan war so far this month. October was the deadliest month of the war for American forces, with 59 deaths reported, according to icasualties.org, a Web site that tracks combat deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr. Brown reiterated that Britain would not abandon its role in the American-led NATO coalition. “We cannot, must not and will not walk away.” He continued, “If the Taliban insurgency succeeds in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda will once again cross the border and re-establish themselves in sanctuaries in Afghanistan from where they will plan, train and launch attacks on the rest of the world.” Mr. Brown said he had spoken several times this week to Mr. Karzai, who had promised that the first action of his new government would be to tackle corruption. “International support depends on the scale of his ambition and the degree of his achievement in five key areas: security, governance, reconciliation, economic development and engagement with Afghanistan’s neighbors,” Mr. Brown said. Mr. Brown also echoed calls this week by senior White House officials for Mr. Karzai and the Afghan government to establish an anticorruption commission to establish strict accountability for national and provincial officials. In addition, some American and European officials are pressing for at least a few arrests of what one administration official, speaking to reporters in Washington on Thursday, called “the more blatantly corrupt” people in the Afghan government. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue. Administration officials declined to provide the names of people they wanted to see arrested and acknowledged that such arrests were a long shot. The international community’s wish list of potential defendants includes Mr. Karzai’s brother Ahmed Wali Karzai, a suspected player in the country’s booming illegal opium trade; Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, who is accused of involvement in the killings of thousands of Taliban prisoners of war early in the Afghan conflict; and one of Mr. Karzai’s running mates, Marshal Muhammad Qasim Fahim, a former defense minister who is suspected of drug trafficking. On Friday, three retired officers who have held the top post in Britain’s armed forces, chief of the defense staff, criticized Mr. Brown in a House of Lords debate on the armed forces, saying, in effect, that he had denied British troops the financing and equipment they needed, exposing them to greater risks. One of the officers, Field Marshal Peter Inge, said of Mr. Brown that the armed forces “have felt that he has never really been on their side.” Adm. Michael Boyce said the Brown government “does not realize we are at war,” and Gen. Charles Guthrie said “dithering in London” had left “the people in the front line questioning whether the government is really, really committed to making progress” in Afghanistan. Britain is the second largest contributor to the coalition fighting the Taliban, with about 9,000 soldiers, compared with 68,000 Americans. But the steady increase of casualties is eroding public support for the conflict. On Thursday, the body of Sgt. Olaf Schmid, 30, who had died trying to defuse a roadside bomb, was flown back to Britain. As has now become the tradition, the body was driven on Thursday through the Wiltshire village of Wootton Bassett, close to a military airfield used by flights to and from Afghanistan, as a church bell pealed. Mourners stood in silence, laying flowers on a hearse bearing a coffin draped in the red, white and blue union flag. Such poignant moments, broadcast on national television, have raised public doubts about whether the war in Afghanistan could be won. Mr. Brown’s government insists that British troops will be able to withdraw only when Afghan forces are able to take over the campaign against the Taliban. John F. Burns reported from London, and Alan Cowell from Paris.

Article:","output":"Title: Torchbearer Jerri Peterson Keeps Unique Tattoo Despite Misspelled Name Introduction: When the world watched the relay for the Olympic torch back in 2012, one torchbearer's unique story caught the attention of many. Jerri Peterson, a 54-year-old hotel worker from Atlanta, US, found herself in a rather interesting situation. Despite having a misspelled tattoo, she decided to keep it as a testament to her unique personality.  Body: Jerri Peterson had the immense honor of carrying the Olympic torch through Derby on June 30, 2012. To celebrate the once-in-a-lifetime experience, she decided to commemorate the event with a tattoo. Little did she know, the name \\"Olympic\\" would be misspelled on her body.  Peterson paid 10 (£6.40) for the tattoo in her hometown of Atlanta. Proud of her new body art, she didn't immediately notice the spelling error in her souvenir. It took a friend pointing it out after the relay for her to realize that the word was unintentionally spelled as \\"Oylimpic.\\"  Instead of being mortified by the mistake, Peterson chose to embrace it. In interviews, she said she wouldn't correct the tattoo – and had no intention of ever getting it removed. She expressed that the misspelled tattoo was a unique part of her that showcased her one-of-a-kind personality. \\"I'm keeping it because it is as unique as I am,\\" she said, displaying an admirable level of self-assurance and confidence. \\"It was a fantastic experience, and I wouldn't want to change a thing about it.\\" Conclusion: Jerri Peterson's decision to keep her tattoo rather than removing or correcting it is a true testament to embracing our imperfections. By choosing to keep her tattoo with the misspelled name, she has turned a potentially embarrassing situation into an inspiring story about self-acceptance and confidence. As the world looks back at the 2012 Olympic torch relay and beyond, we can all learn a little something from Jerri Peterson's positive attitude in spite of this minor hiccup."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Alexander's body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey, which was in turn placed in a gold casket. According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest \\"would be happy and unvanquishable forever\\". Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative. While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. His successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late Antiquity. Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. The recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece, at Amphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege. Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. Caligula was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy. The so-called \\"Alexander Sarcophagus\\", discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus (died 311 BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Issus in 331. However, more recently, it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus' death.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What known alterations were made to Alexander's tomb?\\" is \\"It was stolen on the way to Macedon\\"?","output":"No, the statement \\"It was stolen on the way to Macedon\\" is not entirely accurate according to the provided paragraph. Based on the information, several alterations and occurrences influenced the state of Alexander's tomb: 1. Ptolemy initially seized Alexander's funeral cortege on its way to Macedon and took it temporarily to Memphis. 2. Alexander's body was later transferred to Alexandria by Ptolemy II.  3. Ptolemy IX then replaced Alexander's gold sarcophagus with one of glass so he could repurpose the gold.  4. The tomb was visited by several historical figures, including Pompey, Julius Caesar, Augustus (who accidentally knocked off the nose), and Caligula (who supposedly took Alexander's breastplate for his personal use). 5. Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public around AD 200. 6. Caracalla, Emperor Septimius Severus' son and successor, visited the tomb during his reign.  However, the exact events following Caracalla's visit are unclear, as the details about the tomb's fate thereafter are not well documented. So, the alterations made to the tomb include its location, contents, accessibility, and the physical state of the sarcophagus. It wasn't exactly 'stolen' but rather 'seized' and moved several times."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Our guide paddled the boat quietly while identifying the animals. Our children squawked with delight, and as we re-emerged to stunning views, my wife and I stared in awe. This stretch of surf was one of those rare places — extremely hard to find in Mexico and the Caribbean — with natural beauty and tourists, but not a squeeze-the-tourist attitude. There was no charge for the beach chairs at the waterfront; no waitresses waving plastic menus to coax us inside. Instead, chefs in open-air kitchens offered to cook us affordable food not on the menu if it meant our kids would eat. Then toys, a cat or a playmate (same age as our children, occasionally nude) would often magically appear as we were seated. The friendliness seemed unforced during our four-night stay at a rented house in San Agustinillo this spring. And it was a counterpoint to the monstrous waves and dangerous undertows that have kept the area from being overrun. Indeed, the Costa Chica was once hardly fit for tourists. For decades, the four small neighboring towns here — Zipolite, San Agustinillo, Mazunte and Ventanilla — were nearly empty except for fishermen hunting sea turtles or harvesting their eggs. Residents said the golden sand was often covered with turtle entrails, and with roads that were rocky at best, boats were the preferred form of transportation. That all began to change in the 1980s, as the turtle population dwindled and the first mass of Italian tourists arrived. When the Mexican government banned turtle hunting in 1990, the coast here became a test case for how to shift from an industry that created environmental degradation to others that are eco-friendly. And now, with investment from government, nonprofits and green-minded businesses (like the Body Shop founder who helped establish a cosmetics co-op run by local women) the shift is nearly complete. The fishermen here still occasionally pull in sharks despite pressure from the government and locals to end the practice; we saw (and smelled) carcasses from our table at La Termita during an otherwise enjoyable dinner of brick-oven pizza. But mostly, the area has found its sustainable groove. Much of the new construction is built to blend in with the surroundings, walkers outnumber drivers, and several business owners are now raving about plans for solar-powered streetlights. “They’re doing a good job,” said Hugo Ascención López, 37, the owner of Arte Sano, an artisan shop in San Agustinillo. His story was a typical one. He came here for a brief visit from the city of Puebla 10 years ago, then quickly decided to move here. “In the city, there is no time for anything,” he said, as his dog and 2-year-old son showed my own children around the store. “I wanted a different take on life, and this is something simpler.” Local residents who have been here longer are equally proud, showing off their cooking ingredients, or the parrots that seem to be the favored mascot. San Agustinillo has more charm than the other three towns on the coast, with its smaller beach, its preference for cafes and its handful of newer, upscale hotels like Punta Placer (Pleasure Point) and El Sueño (The Dream). From our perch in our two-bedroom house up a steep driveway — with doors that did not lock and a terrace that lacked any sort of barrier — we could see that the little village fell dark and quiet before midnight. Mazunte, a 10-minute walk away, was busier. Live music blared until a loosely enforced closing time — some said it was midnight, others guessed 2 a.m. At sunrise, on the main road between the towns, women in baggy pants appeared with yoga mats in their arms. One of them, a young New Yorker, offered to whisk our children away for a class that would help them find their “Eye Center.” (After I realized that my 3-year-old son would be more likely to scream than stretch, I turned them down.)

If \\"A happy girl in a forest with leaves falling from a tree.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A girl is having fun in the woods.\\"?","output":"While the phrase \\"A happy girl in a forest with leaves falling from a tree\\" strongly implies that the girl is experiencing positive emotions in a forest setting, it does not irrefutably establish that the girl is \\"having fun\\" in the woods. To fully analyze the logical conclusion of the statement, let's break down the elements of the given phrase: 1. A happy girl: This indicates that the girl is experiencing happiness or contentment. However, happiness can be derived from multiple sources, such as the girl enjoying the scenery, engaging in a fun activity, or contemplating something personally pleasing. 2. In a forest: This setting places the girl within a wooded environment. The forest is commonly associated with nature, peacefulness, and adventure. 3. With leaves falling from a tree: This detail implies that it might be the fall season when leaves commonly change color and fall from trees. This can add to the aesthetic appeal of the forest, making the setting more enjoyable for the girl. Having outlined these components, it is fair to draw a connection between the girl's happiness and the forest environment. However, the concept of \\"having fun\\" is subjective and nuanced, encompassing a wide array of activities and emotions. To say that the girl is having fun in the woods based on the given information is plausible, but it is important to bear in mind that the direct link between her happiness and specific activities in the forest remains uncertain. In conclusion, while it is reasonable to infer that the girl's happiness is linked to her presence in the forest, it is not definite that her happiness can be directly equated to having fun in the woods. The initial statement is a strong suggestion, but it does not conclusively confirm the latter statement concerning the girl's enjoyment of the forest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 04:23 EST, 24 September 2013 | UPDATED: 07:04 EST, 24 September 2013 She is well regarded as one of the most influential reformers in the middle east so it came as no surprise to those watching the world leaders flock to New York this week to see Queen Rania of Jordan arrive at her hotel in the city. Her arrival provides a temporary distraction from the week long debate over whether President Obama will meet with Iranian President Rouhani in what would be the first time in more than 30 years that leaders of their respective countries would come face-to-face.  OPTIONS: - Daily Mail himself is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly later this afternoon. - Iranian himself is scheduled to address the U.N.

Given the context of the story, the most relevant choices would be either President Obama or Iranian President Rouhani, as they are the primary figures the story is based upon.  However, the sentence structures given use \\"himself\\" which cannot be used in conjunction with the names Obama and Rouhani without including their titles of 'President'. In English usage, the pronoun 'himself' is often used for emphasis and is intrinsically connected with male beings. It is typically positioned after a noun, mainly to emphasize the subject. For example, 'President Obama himself'.  Considering these points in the structure of the sentence, the sentence \\"Obama himself is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly later this afternoon\\" or \\"Rouhani himself is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly later this afternoon\\" would make sense as they incorporate the title and name of the persons discussed in the article, and relate to the current situation in the world leaders meeting.  Yet, we need to consider the focus of the article. The primary focus seems to be on Queen Rania's arrival in New York amidst the speculation of the possible meeting between Obama and Rouhani. The story does not necessarily aim at presenting Obama or Rouhani being scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly. Therefore, the last sentence should provide a conclusion relevant to the story's focal point rather than reiterate a fact that is not the main focus. So finally, considering the story's focused context, none of the sentence options provided would fit as the concluding sentence.

This causes the sudden appearance of a \\"new\\" bright star, before slowly fading from sight over several weeks or months.   - An atmosphere is a layer of gases surrounding a planet or other material body, that is held in place by the gravity of that body. An atmosphere is more likely to be retained if the gravity it is subject to is high and the temperature of the atmosphere is low.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In applying statistics to, e.g., a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as \\"all people living in a country\\" or \\"every atom composing a crystal\\". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.  - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.  - Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.  - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown.  - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.  - An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis. Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. There also exists natural experimental studies.  - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.  - A calculation is a deliberate process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more results, with variable change. The term is used in a variety of senses, from the very definite arithmetical calculation of using an algorithm, to the vague heuristics of calculating a strategy in a competition, or calculating the chance of a successful relationship between two people.  - Celestial navigation, also known as astronavigation, is the ancient science of position fixing that enables a navigator to transition through a space without having to rely on estimated calculations, or dead reckoning, to know their position. Celestial navigation uses \\"sights,\\" or angular measurements taken between a celestial body (the sun, the moon, a planet or a star) and the visible horizon. The sun is most commonly used, but navigators can also use the moon, a planet, Polaris, or one of 57 other navigational stars whose coordinates are tabulated in the nautical almanac and air almanacs.  - Polaris, designated Alpha Ursae Minoris (Ursae Minoris, abbreviated Alpha UMi, UMi), commonly the North Star or Pole Star, is the brightest star in the constellation of Ursa Minor. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. The revised Hipparcos parallax gives a distance to Polaris of about 433 light-years (133 parsecs), while calculations by other methods derive distances around 30% closer.  - In physics, a wave is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy that travels through a medium (space or mass). Frequency refers to the addition of time. \\"Wave motion\\" transfers energy from one point to another, which displace particles of the transmission mediumthat is, with little or no associated mass transport. Waves consist, instead, of oscillations or vibrations (of a physical quantity), around almost fixed locations.  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.  - Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa (DATA) was a multinational non-government organization founded in January 2002 in London by U2's Bono along with Bobby Shriver and activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign.  - A statistical model is a class of mathematical model, which embodies a set of assumptions concerning the generation of some sample data, and similar data from a larger population. A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process.  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - Natural science is a branch of science concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on observational and empirical evidence. Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.  - Before calculators were cheap and plentiful , people would use mathematical tables -- lists of numbers showing the results of calculation with varying arguments -- to simplify and drastically speed up computation . Tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions were common in math and science textbooks . Specialized tables were published for applications such as astronomy , celestial navigation and statistics .  - Navigation is a field of study that focuses on the process of monitoring and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another. The field of navigation includes four general categories: land navigation, marine navigation, aeronautic navigation, and space navigation.  - Cosmology (from the Greek , \\"kosmos\\" \\"world\\" and -, \\"-logia\\" \\"study of\\") is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.   - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - Computation is any type of calculation that follows a well-defined model understood and expressed as, for example, an algorithm.  - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole.  - In navigation, dead reckoning or dead-reckoning (also ded for deduced reckoning or DR) is the process of calculating one's current position by using a previously determined position, or fix, and advancing that position based upon known or estimated speeds over elapsed time and course. The corresponding term in biology, used to describe the processes by which animals update their estimates of position or heading, is path integration.  - In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment. A statistical population can be a group of actually existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker). A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population.  - A nautical almanac is a publication describing the positions of a selection of celestial bodies for the purpose of enabling navigators to use celestial navigation to determine the position of their ship while at sea. The Almanac specifies for each whole hour of the year the position on the Earth's surface (in declination and Greenwich hour angle) at which the sun, moon, planets and first point of Aries is directly overhead. The positions of 57 selected stars are specified relative to the first point of Aries.  - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.

Manchester United have given their much-vaunted loan striker Falcao until April to prove himself in the Premier League before deciding whether to sign him on a permanent basis. The 28-year-old Colombian has effectively been placed on a four-month trial after United agreed with his parent club Monaco that should be the cut-off point in sorting out the player's future. United are prepared to be patient with £265,000-a-week Falcao who they believe is one of the few genuinely world-class centre-forwards out there. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal: We dominated from the first to the last minute Radamel Falcao (right) made his return from injury as a substitute in Manchester United's 3-0 win over Hull While injuries have decimated his defence and midfield,","output":"Van Gaal has remained optimistic about Falcao's potential to make a significant impact in the latter half of the season. The Colombian forward is eager to demonstrate his worth as a star striker and to secure his place with the Premier League giants. Manchester United's manager Louis van Gaal has faith in Falcao's ability to shine once he is fully fit and has adjusted to the playing style and pace of the Premier League. As a result, Van Gaal has allowed the talented forward sufficient time to recuperate from his injuries and regain his match fitness. The team's coaching staff have worked closely with Falcao to develop a tailored fitness program to ensure his potential is soon realized on the pitch. His teammates have also shown their support for the striker, acknowledging his immense talent and expressing their hope that he will soon regain his form. In the coming months, Falcao will be given multiple chances to prove his worth. As the season progresses, Manchester United will face several crucial fixtures, including matches against rivals Manchester City, Liverpool, and Chelsea. These games will serve as an opportunity for Falcao to display his abilities on the pitch and to cement his status as a strong contender for a permanent role in the team. In addition to guiding the team to victory in these highly anticipated matches, Falcao will need to consistently deliver strong performances against other Premier League clubs. To secure a long-term position with Manchester United, Falcao will need to demonstrate his ability to score goals and contribute to the team's overall success. Consequently, fans and analysts alike will be carefully watching the Colombian striker's contribution to the team throughout the remainder of the season, especially during crucial matches.  Should Falcao successfully rise to the challenge and showcase his potential, Manchester United would be faced with a tough decision regarding the player's future. Securing the sought-after striker on a permanent basis would come with a hefty price tag, but could prove to be a worthwhile investment. Falcao's reputation as a highly skilled finisher could reinforce the team's attack and ultimately strengthen their bid for domestic and European honors in the years to come. On the other hand, if Falcao fails to deliver in the coming months or continues to struggle with injuries, United may decide against exercising the option to sign him permanently. In such a scenario, the club would likely explore alternative options for bolstering their forward line during the summer transfer window. In conclusion, Manchester United's decision regarding Falcao's future with the club hinges on the player's ability to prove himself as a valuable asset in the Premier League. With the clock ticking and the pressure mounting, Falcao must consistently perform at the highest level until April to secure his place in the team and justify the significant financial commitment that would be required to make his move from Monaco permanent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - water  - carbon  - nitrogen  - oxygen  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"The pain of angina means the heart muscle fibers need more oxygen. Angina is a type of chest pain that occurs when there is not enough blood flow and oxygen reaching the heart muscle. This lack of blood supply and oxygen is mainly due to the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, which are the blood vessels responsible for supplying the heart with blood and oxygen. The narrowing or blockage is usually a result of fatty deposition, inflammation, and scarring, which are often the consequences of atherosclerosis or coronary artery disease. Angina can manifest as a feeling of discomfort, heaviness, pressure, squeezing, or burning pain in the chest, and it may also involve other nearby areas, such as the neck, jaw, arms, or back. The pain is primarily due to the heart muscle fibers not receiving enough oxygen. In other words, the cells in the heart muscle do not get enough fuel to continue normal function, leading to pain and discomfort. The heart muscle fibers need oxygen because it is a crucial element for their survival and proper functioning. Oxygen is required by the heart's cells to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through various metabolic pathways, predominantly through the process of cellular respiration. ATP is the molecule that provides the energy required for the contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle and the electrical impulses that trigger these contractions. When the blood flow to the heart muscle is restored, either through medication, angioplasty, or bypass surgery, oxygen delivery to the heart muscle also improves. This alleviates the pain associated with angina and helps the heart muscle fibers to regain their normal function. In summary, the pain of angina signifies an increased need for oxygen in the heart muscle fibers. Receiving adequate oxygen is essential for the heart muscle cells to produce energy and maintain proper function. When the oxygen supply is restored to optimal levels, the angina pain subsides, and the heart can function more effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow.

Your fear will then come across on the page and your experience or exploration of this fear will also grip the reader.  Make a list of your greatest fears. Then, think about how you would react if you were trapped or forced to confront these fears. You could also take a poll of what scares your family, friends, or partners the most. Get some subjective ideas of horror. Another approach is to look at a normal, everyday situation like taking a walk in the park, cutting up a piece of fruit, or visiting a friend and adding a terrifying or bizarre element. Such as coming across a severed ear during your walk, cutting up a piece of fruit that turns into a finger or a tentacle, or visiting an old friend who has no idea who you are or claims you are someone you are not. Use your imagination to create a horrifying spin on a normal, everyday activity or scene. One way to create a situation that will induce terror in a reader is to restrict your character’s movements so they are forced to confront their fear and then try to find a way out.  Think about what kind of confined spaces scare you. Where would you dread or fear being trapped in the most? Trap your character in a confined space like a cellar, a coffin, an abandoned hospital, an island, or an abandoned town. This will create an immediate conflict or threat to the character and set your story up with immediate tension or suspense. Maybe your character is a werewolf who doesn’t want to hurt anyone on the next full moon so they lock themselves in a cellar or room. Or maybe your character is so fearful of a severed finger in the bathroom, he does everything to avoid the bathroom until the finger haunts him so much he forces himself to go into the bathroom and confront it. Because horror hinges on the subjective reaction of the reader, the story should work to create several extreme feelings in the reader, including:  Shock: the simplest way to scare the reader is to create shock with a twist ending, a sudden image of gore or a quick moment of terror. However, creating fear through shock can lead to cheap scares and if used too much, can become predictable or less likely to scare the reader. Paranoia: the sense that something is not quite right, which can unnerve the reader, make them doubt their own surroundings, and when used to its full effect, make the reader doubt even their own beliefs or ideas of the world. This type of fear is great for slow tension-building and psychological horror stories. Dread: this type of fear is the horrible sense that something bad is going to happen. Dread works well when the reader connects deeply to the story and begins to care enough about the characters to fear something bad that is going to happen to them. Inspiring dread in a reader is tricky as the story will need to do a lot of work to keep the reader engaged and involved, but it is a powerful type of fear. Balance intense negative emotions with intense emotions of wonder or positivity. Stephen King argues there are several key ways to create a feeling of horror or terror in a story, which can then create different reactions from the reader.  Using gross-out details like a severed head tumbling down a flight of stairs, something green and slimy landing on your arm, or a character landing in a pool of blood. Using unnatural details (or fear of the unknown or impossible) like spiders the size of bears, an attack from the living dead, or an alien claw grabbing your feet in a dark room. Using terrifying psychological details like a character who comes home to another version of him or herself, or a character who experiences paralyzing nightmares which then affect their sense of reality. Once you find your premise or scenario, your setting, determine which extreme emotions you are going to play on, and decide the types of horror details you are going to use in the story, create a rough outline of the story.  You can use Freytag’s pyramid to create an outline, which begins with exposition of the setting and life or day of the character(s), moves into the conflict of the character (a severed finger in the bathroom, two men in a car), shifts upward into rising action where the character tries to solve or work against the conflict but meets several complications or roadblocks, reaches the climax, and then falls downward with falling action, into the resolution where the character is changed, shifted (or in the case of some horror), meets a terrifying death. Think of a short title that hints at the terror in your story.

Write some highlights for the following article: Clarke Carlisle has admitted he threw himself in front of a lorry in an attempt to take his own life in December. Speaking for the first time since the incident that left him in hospital for six weeks, the 35-year-old former Premier League footballer and chairman of the PFA said he had been battling serious depression for 18 months. Sportsmail revealed that Carlisle had been critically injured when he was struck by a lorry near his home on the morning of December 22 on the A64, near York. The married father of two had to be airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary, with North Yorkshire Police confirming that an investigation was under way after a collision that ‘involved a male pedestrian and a lorry’. Clarke Carlisle was pictured for the first time since leaving hospital after a collision with a lorry. Carlisle finally returned home from hospital last Friday and, speaking to The Sun newspaper, said his life spiralled out of control after being told by ITV he was losing his £100,000-a-year Champions League pundit role. He says he went straight to a casino and blew in one night what money he and his wife had before, only hours later on December 20, being charged with drink-driving. ‘I had to die,’ he said. ‘This wasn’t escaping or running away. This was the perfect answer. It made everyone happy and it ticked every box.’ He said he had sat in the police cell and concluded that he could not let his children ‘have a criminal father’. He said he walked out of the police station having decided he ‘had to die’. Carlisle says he then vanished for 40 hours, sleeping rough while planning his suicide. Having found a spot on the A64, he then stepped over a barrier and jumped towards an oncoming lorry ‘like a shoulder charge’. Carlisle admitted in an interview with The Sun that he tried to kill himself by jumping in front of a lorry. He claims to have also contemplated drowning, falling under a bus, diving under a train; even hanging himself at York City, where he had once played. ‘Nothing could be left to chance,’ he said. At one stage he found himself standing on railway tracks staring at an oncoming train. ‘I thought, “That’s not going quick enough — you’re not going to die this way and it has to be definitive”. At the last second I threw myself out of the way.’ Only after that did he walk to the A64. ‘Throwing yourself in front of a truck is a very difficult thing to do,’ he said. ‘I saw the big truck. There was no rush. I walked up to the barrier, stepped over it casually. The lorry was about 20 yards away. ‘I thought “You’re the one”. I took two steps into the road and then jumped into the truck, like a full shoulder charge. I can remember that impact. Bang. Then lights out. I don’t know how long had passed. It must have been a few minutes. Carlisle was recently released from hospital six weeks after he was injured in a collision with a lorry. The 35-year-old former footballer played for QPR (left) and Burnley (right) during his playing days. ‘I opened my eyes and I could see my hands in front of me and there’s blood dripping down them. I thought, “You’re kidding me”.’ At hospital it was discovered he had suffered only cuts, bruises, internal bleeding, a broken rib and a shattered left knee. He said he had ‘overwhelming feelings of shame, guilt and embarrassment’ On Christmas Day, Carlisle was admitted to a psychiatric unit in Harrogate and placed on suicide watch. He is now having counselling, with The Sun claiming the police are taking no further action over the A64 crash. On Wednesday night, Carlisle’s wife, Gemma, said on Twitter: ‘We send our love and thoughts to the lorry driver & family. It could have been anyone and Clarke is desperately sorry that it was him. Suicide & depression is not selfish. It’s a serious illness where your world & reality are warped.’","output":"Clarke Carlisle, a former football player, recently talked about his struggles with serious depression.

Article: One of the most popular American singers of the twentieth century was Elvis Presley. He made the Rock & Roll music popular around the world. He sold millions of records and made many successful films, and he helped change the direction of popular music in the 1960s. Elvis Presley was born in a poor family in 1935. His parents were simple country people who often took him to church, where he learned to sing and he never forgot the kind of songs that he used to sing in church as a child. When he was a teenager, Elvis moved from Tupelos to Memphis in Tennessee, where he attended high school, but he was not a good student. His only real interest was singing. He began to sing in the style that is called \\"country and western\\". In 1955 he recorded some songs for his mother's birthday. The people at the recording studio liked his singing and his music. There was something different about it. It was country and western music, but it also sounded a little like the music, which black people used to sing in the American South, music known as \\"blues\\". Shortly after that, Elvis met Tom Parker, who became his manager and arranged concerts for him across the United States and new recordings as well. Soon Elvis rose to fame all over the country. Later, Elvis went to Hollywood and began to appear in films like Love Me Tender and King Creole. But Elvis found it hard to live with success, like many other entertainment personalities   .He began to take drugs and his health began to suffer. When he died at an early age of 42 in 1977, his many millions of fans were shocked. \\"The King Is Dead!\\" the newspaper said.

It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).

Argentina Upends The Netherlands, 0-0 (4-2), Makes Date With Germany In Final Argentina prevailed over the Netherlands in what had been billed as a battle of the best offenses at the Cup. The match ended a scoreless tie and was decided 4-2 in a penalty shootout. The second semifinal of the World Cup between Argentina and the Netherlands was played in whistling wind and driving rain in São Paulo, and the attacking spirits of the two sides seemed to be as dampened as everything else. The first half was largely uneventful, with the clearest scoring opportunity for either side not coming until stoppage time when Argentinean striker Gonzalo Higuaín took an excellent pass from Leo Messi and took a shot that glanced off a goal post. The Dutch kept a clutch of defenders around Messi wherever he roamed, effectively shutting him down as a scoring option. Of necessity, his few effective moments were dishing the ball to teammates. There was a scary incident in which Dutch midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum knocked heads with Javier Mascherano, and the Argentinean defender stayed down on the turf for more than a minute. But Mascherano was allowed to play on, without discernable ill effect. The second half was more of the same, with neither goalkeeper being tested. Sergio Agüero, the star forward who has seen limited Cup action due to nagging injuries, entered the match in the 82nd minute, replacing Higuaín. A few minutes later, Agüero was fed the ball by Messi, but his shot was weak and easily blocked by the Dutch defense. In the first minute of stoppage time, Arjen Robben had the ball apparently by himself against the goalie, Sergio Romero, when Mascherano slid out of nowhere and knocked the ball out of bounds. In the overtime, the Dutch came out looking sharper, less satisfied to let the game get to a shootout, but apart from a long distance attempt by Robben that Romero covered up, there wasn’t much danger. In the second overtime, another Argentinean defender, Pablo Zabaleta, spend considerable time on the turf thanks to a blow from the shoulder of Dirk Kuyt. Zabaleta walked off the field with a cotton gauze sticking out of his mouth and returned to the field a minute later. In the 115th minute, Maxi Rodríguez looped a perfect pass to Rodrigo Palacio just steps from the goalie, but his rushed header was aimed straight at Dutch keeper Jasper Cillessen’s hands. A minute later, Messi charged down the right side and crossed the ball nicely to Rodríguez near the far post, who was unable to do any better than knock the ball straight into the ground in front of Cillessen. The shootout started badly for the Netherlands, with Robben having the first attempt blocked by Romero. It was a fitting end to a frustrating day for one of the world's greatest players. Romero also stopped Wesley Sneijder's penalty attempt. Rodríguez shot fourth for Argentina, and he sealed the victory without problem. For the Netherlands, it was a bitter defeat. After losing last Cup’s final against Spain, they will now face Brazil in Saturday’s third-place consolation game. The final on Sunday will feature Germany and Argentina, teams that have played each other in the second phase of the Cup many times, including the 1986 final, which Argentina won over then West Germany, 3-2.

The Netherlands, after suffering this loss, would face Brazil in the third-place consolation game.

Notable moments included a shot by Argentina's Gonzalo Higuaín hitting the goalpost, an injury scare involving Dutch midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum and Argentinean defender Javier Mascherano, and a last-minute goal-saving intervention by Mascherano against Dutch forward Arjen Robben. The penalty shootout saw Argentine goalkeeper Sergio Romero successfully block attempts by Robben and Wesley Sneijder, paving the way for Maxi Rodríguez to score the winning penalty for Argentina.

Given these facts, when cells start to divide uncontrollablly, they may form a what among the following options: - anemia  - tissue  - fever  - cell  - organ  - fibroid  - acid rain  - illness Answer:","output":"When cells start to divide uncontrollably, they may form a fibroid among the given options. However, it is important to note that not all cases of uncontrollable cell division result in fibroids; it depends on various factors, such as the type of cells involved and the location of the abnormal cell growth.  A fibroid, also known as a leiomyoma, is a benign (non-cancerous) tumor that originates from the smooth muscle layer and connective tissues of the uterus. Fibroids are the most common benign pelvic tumors in women, affecting approximately 20-80% of females during their reproductive years. They do not necessarily cause symptoms but, in some cases, can lead to heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, or pressure on nearby organs. While fibroids and other tumors (such as warts and cancers) result from uncontrollable cell division, a few other options listed can also relate to abnormal cell processes: 1. Anemia: This is a condition where there is a reduced number of healthy red blood cells in the body. Though anemia is not directly related to uncontrollable cell division, it can be associated with decreased production of red blood cells or increased destruction of red blood cells due to various factors. 2. Tissue: This term broadly refers to a collection of cells that function together to perform a specific function within the body. So while this option can be related to cells, it does not inherently describe the process of uncontrollable cell division associated with tumors. 3. Illness: This is a general term used to describe any health condition that negatively impacts a person's overall well-being. While not all illnesses result from uncontrollable cell division, it is important to recognize that many illnesses, such as cancers, can arise due to abnormal cell growth and division. The remaining options - fever, cell, organ, and acid rain - are not directly related to the process of uncontrollable cell division and the formation of tumors."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I’m important and you are not!” the white nationalist leader would sometimes tell her when he was angry, she claimed in the divorce filings.      The allegations in the divorce filings were first reported by Buzzfeed News after multiple attempts by Spencer to keep them under seal.      Spencer called his wife’s allegations of abuse “a wild mischaracterization of who I am” and said he would not comment on her specific allegations. “I’m not going to be engaging with specifics,” he told the Guardian.      Spencer rose to prominence during Trump’s presidential campaign as a well-dressed, media-savvy white nationalist eager to explain to journalists why Trump’s presidential campaign was a political step forward for American neo-Nazis and members of the Ku Klux Klan.      Prominent US neo-Nazi arrested on domestic violence charge Read more      He became internationally famous after shouting “Hail Trump! Hail our people!” and being greeted with Nazi salutes at a white nationalist event in November 2016, shortly after Trump was elected president. In 2017, he was one of the most prominent participants in the violent white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia, which included violent clashes in the streets, attacks on black Charlottesville residents, and a car attack on a crowd of counter-protesters that left 32-year-old Heather Heyer dead.      Spencer and Koupriianova married in 2010 and have been living separately since July 2017, according to the filings. They have two young children.      In the divorce filings, his wife argued that Spencer’s abusive behavior, drinking and white nationalist political activism put their children at risk.      “Most if not all of [Spencer’s] public speaking events end in violence,” his wife noted.      Koupriianova, who has her own ties to the Russian far right, has previously defended Spencer and his views. In December 2016, the month after the “Hail Trump!” event, Spencer’s prominence as a racist advocate had sparked outrage in Whitefish, Montana, where Spencer and his family sometimes lived. Koupriianova wrote an op-ed in a local newspaper suggesting that her husband had been the subject of a “witch hunt” and claiming that Spencer “promotes positive identity for peoples of European descent around the world”.

Photograph: Joshua Roberts/Reuters      Spencer had been “misrepresented” by the “establishment media”, she wrote in 2016, in a plea for “free speech” and “being respectful” to differing views.      In divorce filings, she suggested that Spencer, a believer in “traditional marriage” and “traditional” gender roles, had sometimes failed to provide for his family and care for her and their children, as well as engaging in physical violence and verbally abusing her in front of their children.      Last year, after she returned from hospital after the birth of their second child, Spencer left her alone without any help to care for the newborn and their toddler daughter, his wife alleged.      During their marriage, the white nationalist leader sometimes told her to use her own savings to pay for groceries, saying that his money was “for the cause”, she alleged. He also regularly failed to pay water, internet, electricity and cellphone bills and failed to make healthcare payments, causing their health insurance to lapse three times, including once shortly before the birth of their second child.      In 2014, when she was pregnant with their first child, he held her down with his body weight and grabbed her by the neck and the jaw, leaving bruises, she alleged. In 2017, when she was nine months pregnant, he attempted to punch her in the face, she claimed.      After he was punched in the face in Washington DC on the day of Trump’s inauguration in 2016, Spencer left a loaded .38 pistol on the table in their bedroom in Montana, where it was easily accessible to their then two-year-old daughter, Koupriianova alleged. When his wife confronted him about the risk to their child, “he did not seem to adequately appreciate the danger”, she claimed.      She claimed he repeatedly told her to kill herself and asked if her parents would attend her funeral. Much of the abuse happened in front of their children, she alleged.      Spencer “has noticeably increased his alcohol intake in recent years, which contributes to his aggressive behavior and reduces his impulse control”, she said. During their video chats, he would sometimes be holding a bottle of liquor early in the afternoon, she claimed.      Richard Spencer acted like gang boss, Charlottesville conspiracy trial hears Read more      The older daughter, who was three years old this summer, has witnessed Spencer’s outbursts and heard his verbal abuse of his mother and her babysitter, whom Spencer called a “fucking sub-mediocre human being”, Koupriianova alleged.      In the filings, she describes the daughter as trying to intervene when Spencer berated her mother, including putting herself between her parents and trying to distract her father or ask him to stop, and said the little girl was suffering from “sleeplessness, nightmares and anxiety” as a result of witnessing the abuse.      While Spencer repeatedly attempted to have the divorce proceedings sealed from public view, Judge Heidi Ulbricht denied the motion, citing the Montana constitution and first amendment press protections.      Matthew Heimbach, another prominent young neo-Nazi leader, was arrested on domestic violence charges in March. ||||| “The only language women understand is violence,” Nina Koupriianova said Spencer told her. Spencer said, “I dispute many of her assertions.”      Twitter; Tasos Katopodis / Getty Images Koupriianova and Spencer.      The wife of Richard Spencer, the white nationalist leader, has accused him of being “physically, emotionally, verbally and financially abusive” throughout their marriage, according to divorce filings in Flathead County District Court in Montana. Nina Koupriianova, who married Spencer in August 2010 and has two young children with him, alleges that Spencer physically abused her, including instances where she was “being hit, being grabbed, being dragged around by her hair, being held down in a manner causing bruising, and being prevented from calling for help.” Koupriianova — who went by Kouprianova in some public interviews and N.K. in the documents — “has been reluctant to call police or seek an order of protection for fear of further reprisal by” Spencer, her lawyers said in court documents. “Much of the abuse has occurred in the presence of the parties’ children.” The documents said that Spencer’s “controversial public life” has led “his entire family to be targets of violence,” and Spencer kept a loaded weapon in his bedroom that was “accessible by children” after he was “assaulted in public” on the day of President Donald Trump’s inauguration. “Despite the risk to his family,” Koupriianova argued in court, “[Spencer] continues to engage in extremely polarizing public speech advocating ‘peaceful ethnic cleansing’ and a white-only ‘ethno-state’ which tends to invite passions and violence.” “Most, if not all, of [Spencer’s] public speaking events result in violence,” the affidavit states. Spencer, who claims to have coined the term “alt-right,” has promoted his beliefs on a national stage at events and rallies that have more often than not attracted violence. Spencer attended the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, where a woman protesting white supremacy was killed. “I dispute many of her assertions,” Spencer said in court filings, adding he “denies each, every, and all allegations.” Spencer told BuzzFeed News his lawyers would send a comment. Koupriianova's lawyer declined to comment.      Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Spencer and his supporters clash with Virginia State Police in Charlottesville.      Koupriianova and Spencer’s lawyers attempted to seal the divorce filings three times — but the judge denied those motions. The judge ruled that sealing the case would “infringe upon Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution and the Freedom of the Press under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.” The judge goes on, claiming the “parties have not established that their right to privacy supersedes the merits of public disclosure,” and “as with their previous two motions seeking the same result, the instant motions is DENIED.” The couple has been living separately since July 1, 2017, with Spencer splitting his time between Whitefish, Montana — where Spencer and Koupriianova live in separate residences — and the Washington, DC, area. Spencer has previously stated he was separated from his Russian-born wife, who also holds Canadian citizenship, as early as Nov. 22, 2016, in a Washington Post profile. He added in that article that his work was taking a “toll” on their relationship. Koupriianova has tried to explain some of Spencer’s positions. When asked by the Observer to explain her husband’s desire to create an ethnostate, she said, “In my understanding, these comments are about a theoretic future — a dream — for people of European descent, per se, not concrete policy suggestions for contemporary United States.” She added, “‘Ethnic cleansing’ is a very heavy, loaded term. There are some recent examples of fairly peaceful separations.” When asked in the same interview, “Do you think that people of other races should be eradicated in order to achieve the perfect society?” She responded, “No.” In the divorce filings, Koupriianova alleged Spencer had increased his “alcohol consumption,” which “contributes to his aggressive and erratic behavior and reduces his impulse control.” Spencer denied this. The documents also claim that Spencer was verbally abusive to their children’s babysitter, including in front of their children, where he allegedly called the babysitter a “fucking sub-mediocre human being” and a “fucking moron.” The court filing goes on to claim both children had been adversely impacted by his behavior. “None of the allegations of ‘abuse’ have anything to do with my children,” Spencer wrote in his own 48-page affidavit. Spencer goes on to write that Koupriianova “obviously and litigiously, tries to rope the children into our dispute by saying they were in the room next door or they overheard abusive talk.” Koupriianova’s 78-page affidavit includes exhibits containing text messages and emails that are meant to corroborate her claims, in addition to photos that supposedly show bruising suffered by Koupriianova. Copies of the court documents provided by the Flathead County clerk are in black and white and are overexposed. Koupriianova said that Spencer’s favorite statement to her was, “The only language women understand is violence.” He also allegedly told her once, “I’m famous, and you are not! I’m important, and you are not!” In January 2011, about five months after their civil wedding ceremony and three weeks before their church wedding ceremony, Koupriianova said that Spencer dragged her down the stairs by her “legs, arms and hair” and threw her on a couch, resulting in bruises. “I was very sick with the stomach flu, could not keep food or water down, and wanted to stay in bed recovering. Mr. Spencer wanted to watch a movie downstairs and did not take ‘no’ for an answer,” she wrote. “He dragged me out of bed by my arms, legs, and hair, dragged me down the stairs, and threw me onto the couch. At that point he calmed down and turned on his movie. The incident resulted in bruises.”      Court files      In 2012, she said, Spencer “had me down on the ground smashing my head into the floor.” She added, “I remember feeling ashamed that the neighbors might hear what’s going on.” In early July 2014, Koupriianova said that when she was four months pregnant, Spencer “got on top of me, held me down with his bodyweight, and held me by my neck and lower jaw,” which she said caused bruising. She included in court records an email exchange from July 7 where she wrote to Spencer saying, “I am not ready to converse with you after what you’ve done. My jaw is bruised.” “I’m sorry, and I feel terrible,” Spencer responded.      Court files      Days later, while visiting her mother in Canada, Koupriianova said, “my mother noticed bruises on my jaw, chest, and leg. She urged me to document them,” which at that point, she said, were “faded and yellow.” Koupriianova included the photographs in the court filings via an email to herself she titled “Bruises.” Koupriianova said that incident while they were watching a movie and happened after she “attempted to cuddle” with Spencer. “He often went into ‘Mr. Hyde’ in the evenings and had issues with handling physical intimacy, including hugs.” In late October 2017 — when she was nine months pregnant — she said Spencer tried to “punch me in the face” during an unexpected visit. In a transcript of an audio recording in the court file allegedly from the same night, Koupriianova said to Spencer, “You’re going to hit a pregnant woman?” And later, “You just tried to push me into the freaking stove.” And in February 2018, she said, after the first mediation session, Spencer “grabbed, pulled, and held me by my hair in the car.”      Court files      The affidavit also contains pages of transcripts of conversations with Spencer that Koupriianova surreptitiously recorded on her phone. In one transcript, she said Spencer asked her, “Do you think your parents will attend your funeral?”      Court filings      In his affidavit, Spencer goes into great length to express his longing to see his children since divorce proceedings were initiated, and how interaction with his children is important for their own maturation. Spencer says that Koupriianova repeatedly prevented his visitation by “stonewalling, coming up with implausible excuses,” and “willingly ignoring polite requests,” and provided screenshots of text message conversations as evidence of the excuses and stonewalling. “Childhood separation from parents may be considered child abuse,” he wrote. In October, a judge said Spencer could have supervised visits with his children at two neutral locations and could FaceTime with his children four times a week for 30 minutes each. The judge also directed Spencer to “enter into counseling focusing on anger and communication issues, so he can learn how to effectively communicate in a contentious situation.” Before Koupriianova filed for divorce in June 2018, Spencer had faced fallout related to his unabashed positions on white supremacy and his advocacy for a white ethnostate. In January of this year, Spencer told BuzzFeed News he couldn’t find a lawyer to defend him in a lawsuit that seeks to hold multiple people and groups responsible for the violence at the rally in Charlottesville. The rally captured international headlines as violence broke out between various white supremacist groups and protesters in Charlottesville over the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Heather Heyer was killed when a car allegedly driven by James Alex Fields Jr., 21, drove into a group of counterprotesters, resulting in more than 30 others being injured. And in April, Facebook took down two Facebook pages belonging to Spencer, Vice News first reported. In May, his website AltRight.com was taken down by hosting service GoDaddy because it “crossed the line and encouraged and promoted violence in a direct and threatening manner.” ||||| KALISPELL, Mont. (AP) — The wife of white nationalist leader Richard Spencer has accused him of physically, verbally and emotionally abusing her throughout their eight-year marriage.

She also said he \\"attacked\\" and bruised her again in 2014, when she was four months pregnant with their first child.      Spencer told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he is \\"not an abusive person\\" and said his wife was \\"never in a dangerous situation.\\"      Spencer popularized the term \\"alt-right\\" to describe a fringe movement mixing white nationalism, anti-Semitism and other far-right extremist views.

Article: The idea of building a tunnel under the Irish Sea has been raised since 1895, when it was first investigated. Several potential Irish Sea tunnel projects have been proposed, most recently the Tusker Tunnel between the ports of Rosslare and Fishguard proposed by The Institute of Engineers of Ireland in 2004. A rail tunnel was proposed in 1997 on a different route, between Dublin and Holyhead, by British engineering firm Symonds. Either tunnel, at 50 mi (80 km), would be by far the longest in the world, and would cost an estimated £15 billion or €20 billion.

News article: Last week, the NY Times broke the story that Roger Ailes had urged various colleagues to lie to Federal investigators; (David Corn explains the background to this here).      NYT:      “It was an incendiary allegation — and a mystery of great intrigue in the media world: After the publishing powerhouse Judith Regan was fired by HarperCollins in 2006, she claimed that a senior executive at its parent company, News Corporation, had encouraged her to lie two years earlier to federal investigators who were vetting Bernard B. Kerik for the job of homeland security secretary . . . Now, court documents filed in a lawsuit make clear whom Ms. Regan was accusing of urging her to lie: Roger E. Ailes, the powerful chairman of Fox News and a longtime friend of Mr. Giuliani. What is more, the documents say that Ms. Regan taped the telephone call from Mr. Ailes in which Mr. Ailes discussed her relationship with Mr. Kerik.”      Here’s what I learned recently: Someone I spoke with claimed that Ailes was scheduled to speak at their event in March, but canceled. It appears that Roger’s people, ostensibly using a clause in his contract, said he “cannot appear for legal reasons.”      I asked “What, precisely, does that mean?”      The response: “Roger Ailes will be indicted — probably this week, maybe even Monday.”      You read it here first . . .      Category: Financial Press, Legal ||||| AP      On Sunday morning, the economics analyst and TV commentator Barry Ritholtz dropped a bombshell on his blog: Roger Ailes, the powerful president of Fox News, will be indicted in connection with allegedly telling a News Corp. executive to lie to federal investigators, according to Ritholtz's blog post.      The story, which was based on what an unnamed source told Ritholtz, quickly boomeranged around the Web and Twitter. Several well-read web sites, including Business Insider and Political Wire, picked up the report.      As it turns out, Ritholtz's source for the post was a man he happened to meet and strike up a conversation with at a Barbados airport over the weekend, he told me in an interview this afternoon.      Here's what happened, according to Ritholtz, who just got back from a vacation on the tropical island: He was sitting in the Barbados airport waiting for a plane to arrive and he struck up a conversation with an older man sitting next to him.      \\"We started chatting and next thing I know, we're waiting to leave the gate, his phone rings and he tells his wife, 'yeah Ailes just canceled the event,' Ritholtz says, describing the man as \\"obviously annoyed and frustrated.\\"      The man runs an annual event in March at which Ailes was scheduled to speak, according to Ritholtz, who declined to specify the event. When he asked the man why Ailes canceled, the man said Ailes was about to be indicted. He describes the man, who he would not name, as an \\"Upper East Side Democrat.\\"      Ritholtz says that everyone assumed any indictment would be related to a matter reported on by the New York Times last week: that Ailes allegedly told News Corp. executive Judith Regan to lie to federal investigators who were vetting Bernie Kerik, the New York police commissioner who was nominated to be the first Secretary of Homeland Security. Regan had had an affair with Kerik at a lovenest near Ground Zero; Ailes allegedly wanted to protect the political ambitions of Kerik's boss, Rudy Giuliani. The allegations emerged in a civil lawsuit filed by Regan -- who claimed that she had a phone recording of Ailes talking about the matter -- against News Corp. Much about the episode is still unclear because Regan was paid 10 million to settle the suit, and she signed a confidentiality agreement.      It's not entirely clear what Ailes would be charged with in connection with the episode. I've reached out to a Fox spokesperson for a response to all this, and I will update this post if I hear back.      Ritholtz, for his part, describes his attitude in writing the post as \\"passing along what an informed person had said.\\"      \\"If it's true we'll find out. If it's not, no big deal,\\" he says. \\"We'll see where this goes.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News, has been accused of urging former publishing executive Judith Regan to lie to federal investigators in 2004.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Unexplained death and potential pharmacy mix-up prompts investigation Subtitle: Douglas Lamond passed away after receiving someone else's drugs; pharmacy branch name undisclosed, and police are still investigating The mysterious circumstances surrounding the recent death of Douglas Lamond have raised concerns about the potential role that a pharmacy mix-up could have played in the tragic outcome. Mr. Lamond, a regular at his local Boots pharmacy, is believed to have been mistakenly handed another person's medication, which he subsequently consumed. Frustratingly, Boots has opted not to reveal the specific location where the medication was ordered from, and authorities have not yet established whether the incorrect drugs directly contributed to his untimely death.  Douglas Lamond, a well-known and respected member of his community, suddenly fell ill after ingesting the unidentified medication. Unaware that he had been given the wrong prescription, Mr. Lamond took the unidentified drugs without hesitation, believing them to be the correct treatment for his existing medical conditions.  Investigations into the death have since been undertaken by local law enforcement personnel, with police treating the matter as an unexplained death. While the authorities have yet to conclusively determine whether the wrong drugs played a factor in Mr. Lamond's passing, concerns have been raised regarding the risk of further pharmaceutical mix-ups occurring at Boots branches and the potential consequences for unsuspecting customers. Critics have questioned Boots’ decision not to disclose the branch where the drugs were dispensed, with many speculating that the organization may be trying to protect its reputation and avoid possible liability. The decision has led to growing calls for transparency and accountability, particularly from the public and Mr. Lamond's bereaved family members who seek answers and, if necessary, justice for their loved one. The ongoing investigation into Mr. Lamond's death could ultimately lead to significant legal repercussions for Boots, should the pharmacy's alleged negligence be proven to have contributed to his passing. In response, many have urged the healthcare giant to evaluate its current processes and safeguards in place for dispensing medication to customers, to ensure that such a tragedy is not repeated in the future.  Moreover, the case highlights the importance of vigilance on the part of customers when collecting prescriptions from pharmacies. Medical professionals recommend that individuals double-check the labels on their medication packages and discuss any concerns with their pharmacist or healthcare provider before consumption. This could help to minimize the risk of medication errors, thus preventing further incidents like Mr. Lamond's tragic and untimely passing.

Question: Which of Vidal's first two plays was considered more successful? Passage:After publishing the plays Weekend (1968) and An Evening With Richard Nixon (1972) and the novel Two Sisters: A Novel in the Form of a Memoir (1970), Vidal concentrated upon the essay and developed two types of fiction. The first type is about American history, novels specifically about the nature of national politics. About those historical novels, the critic Harold Bloom said that \\"Vidal's imagination of American politics ... is so powerful as to compel awe\\". The historical novels formed the seven-book series, Narratives of Empire: (i) Burr (1973), (ii) 1876 (1976), (iii) Lincoln (1984), (iv) Empire (1987), (v) Hollywood (1990), (vi) Washington, D.C. (1967) and (vii) The Golden Age (2000). Besides U.S. history, Vidal also explored and analyzed the history of the ancient world, specifically the Axial Age (800–200 B.C.), with the novel Creation (1981). The novel was published without four chapters that were part of the manuscript he submitted to the publisher; years later, Vidal restored the chapters to the text and re-published the novel Creation in 2002.

How to understand the basic rules of cricket  Memorize the five basic pieces of equipment.  These are the ball, the bat, the wickets, the stumps, and the bails. You may not have heard these words before, so take your time repeating them. Answer:","output":"(iii). Once you understand them, it becomes a matter of knowing them. How many players? How many bails the wickets and stumps are. To understand the basic rules of cricket, it is important to first familiarize yourself with the essential pieces of equipment used in the game. Once you know what each piece of equipment looks like, you can start to learn about the different roles they play and the rules surrounding them. There are 11 players on each team in a cricket match, with each team taking turns to bat and bowl. The primary objective of the game is to score more runs than the opposing team.  The wickets and stumps are essential components of the playing field. A wicket consists of three vertical stumps made of wood, which support two horizontal bails. There are two sets of wickets, placed opposite each other at a distance of 22 yards (20.12 meters) on the pitch. The area between the wickets is referred to as the 'pitch.' As a bowler, your main goal is to get the opposing team's batsmen 'out' by hitting the stumps directly with the ball or by inducing the batsman to hit the ball in such a way that it is caught by a fielder. The batsman, on the other hand, aims to protect their wicket while also scoring runs by hitting the ball into the field. Apart from understanding the roles and objectives of the players, it is crucial to know cricket's basic gameplay rules: 1. The game is divided into 'overs,' with each over consisting of six deliveries (balls) bowled by the same bowler. 2. There are many ways a batsman can be declared 'out,' including being bowled, caught, run out, stumped, leg before wicket (LBW), or hitting the ball twice. 3. The fielding team can make strategic choices about field placements, determining where each player stands to maximize their ability to get the batsman out or prevent the scoring of runs. This is done under the direction of the team captain. 4. The batting team accumulates runs either by striking the ball and running between the wickets or by hitting a boundary. A boundary occurs when the ball crosses the marked boundary line around the field, either by rolling (four runs) or being hit directly into the air (six runs). 5. The game can have various formats, such as Test matches, One-Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) matches, each with different rules and restrictions concerning the duration and structure of the game. By understanding these basic rules and the roles of players in a cricket match, you can begin to appreciate the strategy and skill required to play and enjoy the game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tori Amos (born Myra Ellen Amos, August 22, 1963) is an American singer-songwriter, pianist, and composer. She is a classically trained musician with a mezzo-soprano vocal range. Having already begun composing instrumental pieces on piano, Amos won a full scholarship to the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University at the age of five, the youngest person ever to have been admitted. She was expelled at the age of eleven for what Rolling Stone described as \\"musical insubordination. With her Atlantic contract fulfilled after a 15-year stint, Amos signed to Epic in late 2001. In October 2002, Amos released Scarlet's Walk, another concept album. Described as a \\"sonic novel\\", the album explores Amos's alter ego, Scarlet, intertwined with her cross-country concert tour following 9/11. Through the songs, Amos explores such topics as the history of America, American people, Native American history, pornography, masochism, homophobia and misogyny. The album had a strong debut at No. 7 on the Billboard 200. Scarlet's Walk is Amos's last album to date to reach certified gold status from the RIAA.  Not long after Amos was ensconced with her new label, she received unsettling news when Polly Anthony resigned as president of Epic Records in 2003. Anthony had been one of the primary reasons Amos signed with the label and as a result of her resignation, Amos formed the Bridge Entertainment Group. Further trouble for Amos occurred the following year when her label, Epic/Sony Music Entertainment, merged with BMG Entertainment as a result of the industry's decline. Amos would later hint in interviews that during the creation of her next album, those in charge at the label following the aforementioned merger were interested \\"only in making money\\", the effects of which on the album have not been disclosed.  Amos released two more albums with the label, The Beekeeper (2005) and American Doll Posse (2007). Both albums received generally favorable reviews. The Beekeeper was conceptually influenced by the ancient art of beekeeping, which she considered a source of female inspiration and empowerment. Through extensive study, Amos also wove in the stories of the Gnostic gospels and the removal of women from a position of power within the Christian church to create an album based largely on religion and politics. The album debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200, placing her in an elite group of women who have secured five or more US Top 10 album debuts. While the newly merged label was present throughout the production process of The Beekeeper, Amos and her crew nearly completed her next project, American Doll Posse, before inviting the label to listen to it. American Doll Posse, another concept album, is fashioned around a group of girls (the \\"posse\\") who are used as a theme of alter-egos of Amos's. Musically and stylistically, the album saw Amos return to a more confrontational nature. Like its predecessor, American Doll Posse debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200.  During her tenure with Epic Records, Amos also released a retrospective collection titled Tales of a Librarian (2003) through her former label, Atlantic Records; a two-disc DVD set Fade to Red (2006) containing most of Amos's solo music videos, released through the Warner Bros. reissue imprint Rhino; a five disc box set titled A Piano: The Collection (2006), celebrating Amos's 15-year solo career through remastered album tracks, remixes, alternate mixes, demos, and a string of unreleased songs from album recording sessions, also released through Rhino; and numerous official bootlegs from two world tours, The Original Bootlegs (2005) and Legs & Boots (2007) through Epic Records.

(Nov. 8) -- A giant global company like Google is bound to step on some toes now and again, and last week the Web behemoth found itself at the center of an international border dispute.When a former Nicaraguan guerilla, Edén Pastora, took some of his men across the border into neighboring Costa Rica, media reports said that Google Maps was to blame because it had inaccurately drawn the border line between the two Central American countries, causing some of Costa Rica's land to fall inside Nicaragua. On Friday, Google Maps met with the State Department, which confirmed the erroneous border. The company said on its blog that it would upload updated maps with the correct borders.Pastora, however, denied the reports that he had used Google Maps to justify his incursion. He said he was relying on the 1858 Cañas-Jerez Treaty, according to the Tico Times Regardless, Google is no stranger to controversy. Here are four other notable messes the company has found itself in.Last week's Nicaraguan invasion was not Google Maps' first bout with international border disputes. Last year, the company relabeled a disputed territory between China and India with Mandarin characters just hours before the two nations sat down to negotiate the decades-long disagreement. The act convinced many Indians that China and Google were co-conspiring against them. Google tried to placate both nations by offering different interpretations of the borders, depending on which country the user is accessing Google Maps from.Google Map enthusiasts were amazed when the service introduced its \\" Street View \\" feature, which allows users to zoom in to maps on the street level, getting a close-up look at building facades, street signs or even people walking their dogs. Some humorous snapshots , include a sneezing man, a bizarre E.T.-like figure and a woman's exposed thong have resulted. But some worry that the new technology, though not necessarily illegal, raises privacy concerns as millions of Web browsers embark on Google Maps' free virtual neighborhood tours.\\"There is a serious tension here, between the concepts of free speech, and open information, and the idea of privacy,\\" Kevin Bankston, staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Time . \\"There's definitely a privacy concern that an unmarked Google camera van can, and in fact has, captured images of people, whether in the street or in their homes, in a manner that could be embarrassing or even dangerous to them.\\"(For those of you not squeamish about the privacy of your fellow citizens, check out the blog Google Street View Sightings , which chronicles the strangest events caught on Google Maps' cameras.)The Chinese government was not happy with Google earlier this year after the company announced it would no longer censor search results on google.cn, its mainland Chinese search engine, despite having allegedly agreed to the censorship as part of its initial deal with China \\"Google has violated its written promise it made when entering the Chinese market by stopping filtering its searching service and blaming China in insinuation for alleged hacker attacks [on Google servers],\\" a Chinese government official said, according to Xinhua Google's precipitous rise to power started with PageRank, an algorithm that allows the search engine to measure the relevance of a link and rank its importance in search results. But the tool backfired in 2004 when the system returned Jew Watch -- an anti-Semitic website -- as the first result in a search for the word \\"Jew.\\" Google issued a disclaimer expressing its disgust with the results, while defending the search engine's ranking system. ||||| Google corrects mistake after Nicaragua blames site's maps for invasion of Costa Rica      Google Maps' depiction of Nicaragua's border with Costa Rica has caused serious problems.      Google Maps is correcting its faulty maps of Nicaragua and Costa Rica after becoming the culprit in the latest border dispute between the two Central American countries.      Addressing the controversy in a blog entry on Friday titled \\"Regarding the boundary between Costa Rica and Nicaragua,\\" Google's Charlie Hale admitted Google had made a mistake and assured readers it would be fixed as soon as possible.      \\"We determined that there was indeed an error in the compilation of the source data, by up to 2.7 km (1.6 mi),\\" Hale wrote. \\"The U.S. Department of State has provided a corrected version and we are now working to update our maps.\\"      Earlier this week, former Sandinista commander Eden Pastora, who heads Nicaragua's controversial project to dredge the San Juan River which divides the two countries, used Google Maps as justification for incursion into Costa Rican territory.      \\"See the satellite photo on Google, and here you see the frontier. In the last 3,000 meters both sides are Nicaraguan. From there to El Castillo the border itself is the right bank, clearly,\\" Pastora told Costa Rican newspaper La Nacion on Wednesday.      Costa Rica claimed that Nicaraguan troops set up camp on the Costa Rican side of the river, while Nicaragua denied these claims, according to Agence France Presse (AFP).      Costa Rica has no army and President Laura Chinchilla has increasingly asked international mediators to intervene.      \\"Costa Rica is seeing its dignity smeared and there is a sense of great national urgency,\\" Chinchilla said Saturday after a meeting with the Organization of American States Secretary General Jose Manuel Insulza, according to AFP.      Although both countries' official maps support Google's assertion, Nicaragua asked Google not to make the correction.      \\"I officially request that (the border marking) not be modified,\\" Foreign Minister Samuel Santos asked Google representative Jeffrey Hardy, AFP reports.      The nearly 200-year-old border dispute reignited in mid-October after Nicaragua started dredging the San Juan to restore its route to what it was a century and a half ago, according to news reports.      Pastora claimed the territory in question is a frontier because the river has changed its course since the borders were first drawn up, according to La Nacion.      This is not the first territorial dispute that Google Maps has been involved in.      Earlier this year Cambodia requested that Google correct borders on a map that the country's Secretary of State Sway Sitha called \\"devoid of truth and reality,\\" Reuters reports. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Google Maps found itself at the center of an international border dispute between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, when it inaccurately drew the border line between the two countries, causing some of Costa Rica's land to fall within Nicaragua. As a result, former Nicaraguan guerilla, Edén Pastora, took some of his men across the border into Costa Rica. When notified of the error, Google met with the State Department, which confirmed the erroneous border, and Google agreed to upload updated maps with the correct borders. However, this was not Google Maps' first border-related controversy, having triggered disputes involving China and India, as well as raising privacy concerns due to its \\"Street View\\" feature that allowed users to zoom in to street level, capturing potentially embarrassing or dangerous images."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the Martin's name? Movie title: The Hasty Hare Movie plot: Marvin the Martian (here referred to as Commander of the X2 vessel) is traveling to Earth. Upon landing, he opens his assignment envelope - return one Earth creature back to Mars (signed by General E=mcÂ²). With the help of his dog, K-9 (who \\"talks\\" to Marvin by handing him notes), he finds Bugs's rabbit hole. As the two observe the hole, they are pushed back when Bugs cleans out a bucket of carrot stems. Seeing their getup, Bugs assumes it must be Halloween, so he hands them each a bag of treats.

Bugs tries to act defiant, but goes slightly insane when Marvin uses his pistol against a nearby rock (which also disintegrates part of the ground under the rock).

Article: Beach volleyball  is one of those sports that can be an exciting game to play and watch. It's really easy, and all you need is sand, a net and a group of people, of any age or fitness level, who want to have fun. Beach volleyball can be played with as few as two people in each team, making a total of four people. However, if you are less skilled and experienced in the game, it will be easier to play with a larger team. The more players you have, the less ground each person will be responsible for covering and the more time they will have to recover between shots. If you only have a few players, each of you will get a lot of running for the ball after each volley  . If you are looking for a relaxing, fun, low-key experience, choose larger teams. Beach volleyball is similar to regular volleyball in its rules. However, even experienced volleyball players do not realize how much more difficult it is to run and jump on sand. Since it is harder to move quickly on sand than a hard surface, play will be much slower than regular volleyball on a court. When an athlete trains for beach volleyball, he will focus on building lower body strength as well as upper body strength. Strengthening his legs is extremely important. This improves the player's ability to move quickly and accurately on sand despite the resistance. The ability to jump high and land without injury is necessary for beach volleyball players. Whether you are in it for the competition, or just to have a great time with your friends, beach volleyball can be extremely exciting and fun. You may start out with friends and may soon fall in love with the sport. Question: When playing beach volleyball, in which of the following situation will you feel most relaxed? - Playing in a 2-person team. - Playing in a 4-person team. - Playing in a 6-person team. - Playing in an 11-person team.

When she discovers him seated directly behind her, Driftwood joins Mrs. Claypool, and introduces her to Herman Gottlieb (Sig Ruman), director of the New York Opera Company, also dining at the restaurant. Driftwood has arranged for Mrs. Claypool to invest 200,000 in the opera company, allowing Gottlieb to engage Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter Woolf King), the \\"greatest tenor since Caruso\\". Backstage at the opera house, chorister Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones) hires his best friend Fiorello (Chico) to be his manager. Ricardo is in love with the soprano, Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle), who is also being courted by Lassparri. Driftwood arrives and finds Lassparri attacking his dresser, Tomasso (Harpo), who knocks Lassparri unconscious by hitting him over the head with a mallet. Fiorello appears and identifies himself as the manager of the \\"greatest tenor in the world\\". Driftwood, mistakenly thinking Fiorello is referring to Lassparri, signs Baroni to a contract.

Escaping with a pair of handcuffs still attached, he jumps on a passing freight train where he meets a tramp who tells him to see Patian, a thief and a fence in San Diego, who can also remove his handcuffs. After meeting Patian, it is agreed that he will remove the cuffs on the condition that Joe drive the getaway car for a bank robbery.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Robin was very attracted to him and batted her eyes at Bailey.  Given the context: Why did Robin do this? A:","output":"In the given context, Robin batted her eyes at Bailey as a non-verbal signal to express her attraction towards him. This act can stem from various factors, including biological, psychological, and cultural influences. In interpreting Robin's actions, we can examine these underlying elements to gain a more comprehensive understanding. 1. Biological Factors: Biologically, humans have evolved to use non-verbal cues as a way of communication and building connections. Attraction, being a fundamental aspect of human relationships, has a variety of associated biological markers. When Robin batted her eyes at Bailey, she might have been unconsciously displaying a visual cue associated with alluring eyes. Furthermore, eyelash batting often directs attention to the eyes, making Robin's gaze more noticeable and engaging, thereby increasing the chances of creating a connection with Bailey. 2. Psychological Factors: Psychologically, batting one's eyes can be traced back to the innate behavior of infants, who bat their eyes to elicit affection and care from their caretakers. This implicates that, at a deeper level, Robin might be seeking comfort, attachment, and trust from Bailey. Additionally, such gestures can reinforce her own feelings of attraction, confirming her interest and making herself feel more connected with Bailey. 3. Cultural Influences: Socio-cultural factors play a significant role when it comes to flirting and courtship behaviors. In many cultural contexts, batting one's eyes is considered a flirtatious and playful gesture, often linked with the expression of romantic or sexual interest. By performing this action, Robin might be adhering to traditional gender roles and cultural norms, demonstrating her attraction in a more subtle and socially-accepted manner. 4. Emotional Expressions: Body language and non-verbal cues are essential for expressing emotions. Batting her eyes at Bailey could be Robin's way of expressing her feelings without directly stating them or potentially facing rejection. This emotional expression allows her not only to communicate her attraction but also to gauge Bailey's interest and response, potentially paving the way for a more in-depth interaction between them. 5. Playfulness: Flirting often involves playful elements and humor to create a sense of excitement and intrigue. Batting her eyes at Bailey could symbolize Robin's lighter and more teasing side, attempting to infuse levity and curiosity into the interaction. This playfulness may be essential for establishing rapport and building a connection, allowing for more profound emotions and experiences to emerge. In conclusion, Robin's act of batting her eyes at Bailey could be attributed to a combination of biological, psychological, and cultural factors, as well as her individual emotional expressions and playful intent. While her primary motivation may be to demonstrate her attraction, the layered and complex nature of human behavior should be considered in providing a comprehensive understanding of Robin's actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the United States, the verdict in criminal cases must be unanimous. A non-unanimous verdict results in a hung jury which in turn forces a mistrial. The question they are deciding is whether the defendant, a teenaged boy from a city slum, murdered his father. The jury is further instructed that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence. Under current American criminal law, a defendant must first be found guilty, and then the jury in the sentencing phase must find an aggravating circumstance and unanimously agree to recommend the death penalty, if the state has the death penalty.[citation needed] The jury of twelve retires to the jury room, where they begin to become acquainted with their personalities and discuss the case. The story revolves around their difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict, mainly because of the personal prejudices of several of the jurors. An initial vote is taken and eleven of the jurors vote for conviction. Juror number 8, the lone dissenter, states that the evidence presented is circumstantial and the boy deserves a fair deliberation, upon which he questions the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the fact that the knife used in the murder is not as unusual as the testimony indicates (he produces an identical one from his pocket), and the overall shady circumstances.

Yet another influential philosopher who had an influence on modern philosophy was Ibn Tufail. His philosophical novel, Hayy ibn Yaqdha, translated into Latin as Philosophus Autodidactus in 1671, developed the themes of empiricism, tabula rasa, nature versus nurture, condition of possibility, materialism, and Molyneux's problem. European scholars and writers influenced by this novel include John Locke, Gottfried Leibniz, Melchisédech Thévenot, John Wallis, Christiaan Huygens, George Keith, Robert Barclay, the Quakers, and Samuel Hartlib.","output":"Task: Read the passage and construct a question about the information present in the passage that is unambiguous, answerable from the passage, has a unique answer, and can be answered with a continuous text span from the paragraph.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: I first came across the concept of pay-what-you-can cafes last summer in Boone, N.C., where I ate at F.A.R.M (Feed All Regardless of Means) Cafe. You can volunteer to earn your meal, pay the suggested price(10) or less, or you can overpay--paying it forward for a future customer's meal. My only regret after eating there was not having a chance to give my time. So as soon as Healthy World Cafe opened in York in April, I signed up for a volunteer shift . F.A.R.M and healthy World are part of a growing trend of community cafes. In 2003, Denise Cerreta opened the first in Salt Lake City. Cerreta now runs the One World Everybody Eats Foundation, helping others copy her pay-what-you can model. \\"I think the community cafe is truly a hand up, not a handout,\\" Cerreta said. She acknowledged that soup kitchens  have a place in society, but people typically don't feel good about going there. \\"One of the values of the community cafe is that we have another approach,\\" she said. \\"Everyone eats here, no one needs to know whether you volunteered, overpaid or underpaid.\\" The successful cafes not only address hunger and food insecurity but also become necessary parts of their neighborhood -- whether it's a place to learn skills or hear live music. Some teach cooking to seniors; some offer free used books. Eating or working there is a reminder that we are all in this world together. My 10 am-1pm shift at World-Healthy-Cafe began with the cafe manager -- one of the two paid staff members. Our volunteer crew wasn't the most orderly, but we managed to prepare and serve meals with a lot of laughs in between. At the end of my shift, I ordered my earned meal at the counter, together with other volunteers. After lunch, I walked out the door, with a handful of new friends, music in my head and a satisfied belly and heart. Question: How did the author feel about working at Healthy World Cafe?

Question: How many IRA men are in Harold's car, holding him at gunpoint? Movie plot title: The Long Good Friday Movie plot: Harold Shand is the ruling kingpin of the London underworld and is trying to convince the American mafia to go into partnership with him, with plans to redevelop the London Docklands, including building a casino. However, his world is suddenly destabilised by a series of unexplained murders (including Harold's best friend, Colin) and exploding bombs from an unknown foe. He and his henchmen try to uncover his attackers' identity whilst simultaneously trying not to worry their American visitors, who Harold believes will not go into business with him if they think he's not in full control of his affairs. The situation worsens when a pub in which they are about to have dinner at is blown up and Harold's partner, Victoria, tells the Americans that they are under attack from an unknown enemy. She suspects that Harold's right hand man, Jeff, knows more than he has been letting on about the attacks, while Jeff simultaneously starts to fear that Harold might be onto him and tries to prevent people from talking through intimidation. After some detective work, Harold confronts Jeff, who confesses that he sent Harold's friend Colin on a job to Belfast to deliver money raised by Irish Navvies (construction workers) to the IRA. When Harold discovers Jeff accepted a job to deliver funds to the IRA, he becomes extremely angry and vows to destroy the IRA in London. Jeff advises against this and explains that the IRA aren't just annoyed about some of the money which had gone missing, but also wrongly hold Harold responsible for the murder of three IRA men. Under intense questioning, Jeff confesses that the IRA threatened to kill him and he was so scared that he \\"put the finger\\" on Harold, who loses his temper and kills him with a broken whisky bottle. Harold forces Councillor Harris to organise a meeting with the IRA, and appears to offer them Â£60,000 in return for a ceasefire but double-crosses them by having them shot and killed along with Harris.

Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing.

McCrea portrays Dr. Kildare in the character's first screen appearance. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer continued the Dr. Kildare series with \\"Young Dr. Kildare\\" (1938) starring Lew Ayres as Kildare and Laraine Day as a nurse in love with Kildare, similar to Stanwyck's role in this film. The film was released in the United Kingdom as \\"You Can't Take Money\\".  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - David Hoyt Canary (August 25, 1938  November 16, 2015) was an American actor, best known for his roles in \\"All My Children\\" and \\"Bonanza\\".  - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.  - The police procedural, or police crime drama, is a subgenre of detective fiction that attempts to convincingly depict the activities of a police force as they investigate crimes. Although traditional detective novels usually concentrate on a single crime, police procedurals frequently depict investigations into several unrelated crimes in a single story. Traditional mysteries usually adhere to the convention of having the criminal's identity concealed until the climax (the so-called whodunit), whereas in police procedurals, the perpetrator's identity is often known to the audience from the outset (the inverted detective story). Police procedurals depict a number of police-related topics such as forensics, autopsies, the gathering of evidence, the use of search warrants, and interrogation.  - Rodman Edward \\"Rod\\" Serling (December 25, 1924  June 28, 1975) was an American screenwriter, playwright, television producer, and narrator known for his live television dramas of the 1950s and his science-fiction anthology TV series, \\"The Twilight Zone\\". Serling was active in politics, both on and off the screen, and helped form television industry standards. He was known as the \\"angry young man\\" of Hollywood, clashing with television executives and sponsors over a wide range of issues including censorship, racism, and war.  - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east.  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Leonard Freeman (October 31, 1920  January 20, 1974) was an American television writer and producer who is best remembered as the creator of the CBS series \\"Hawaii Five-O\\" in 1968. The show was remade in 2010. He appeared in a 1953 episode (#112) of the TV series, \\"The Lone Ranger\\".  - A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing.  - Paramount Pictures Corporation (known professionally as Paramount Pictures and often referred to simply as Paramount) is an American film studio based in Hollywood, California, that has been a subsidiary of the American media conglomerate Viacom since 1994. Paramount is the fifth oldest surviving film studio in the world, the second oldest in the United States, and the sole member of the \\"Big Six\\" film studios still located in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Hollywood. In 1916 Zukor contracted 22 actors and actresses and honored each with a star on the logo. These fortunate few would become the first \\"movie stars.\\" Paramount Pictures is a member of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).  - A rerun or repeat is a rebroadcast of an episode of a radio or television program. There are two types of reruns  those that occur during a hiatus, and those that occur when a program is syndicated. Reruns can also be, as the case with more popular shows, when a show is aired outside of its timeslot (for example, in the afternoon).  - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\").  The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory.  - Frederick Schiller Faust (May 29, 1892  May 12, 1944) was an American author known primarily for his thoughtful and literary Westerns under the pen name Max Brand. Faust (as Max Brand) also created the popular fictional character of young medical intern Dr. James Kildare in a series of pulp fiction stories. Faust's Kildare character was subsequently featured over several decades in other media, including a series of American theatrical films by Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), a radio series, two television series, and comics. Faust's other pseudonyms include George Owen Baxter, Evan Evans, George Evans, David Manning, John Frederick, Peter Morland, George Challis, Peter Ward and Frederick Frost.  - Michael Landon (born Eugene Maurice Orowitz; October 31, 1936  July 1, 1991) was an American actor, writer, director, and producer. He is known for his roles as Little Joe Cartwright in \\"Bonanza\\" (195973), Charles Ingalls in \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" (197483), and Jonathan Smith in \\"Highway to Heaven\\" (198489). Landon appeared on the cover of \\"TV Guide\\" 22 times, second only to Lucille Ball.  - Spencer's Mountain is an American family drama film written, directed, and produced in 1963 by Delmer Daves from a novel by Earl Hamner, Jr. The film stars Henry Fonda, Maureen O'Hara, and in early appearances in their careers, James MacArthur, Veronica Cartwright, and Victor French. Longtime Hollywood actor Donald Crisp plays \\"Grandpa\\", his final screen role.  - Dr. James Kildare is a fictional American medical doctor character, originally created in the 1930s by the author Frederick Schiller Faust under the pen name Max Brand. Shortly after the character's first appearance in a magazine story, Paramount Pictures used the story and character as the basis for the 1937 film \\"Internes Can't Take Money\\". Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) subsequently acquired the rights and featured Kildare as the primary character in a series of American theatrical films in the late 1930s and early 1940s, several of which were co-written by Faust (as Max Brand), who also continued to write magazine stories and novels about the character until the early 1940s. The Kildare character was later featured in an early 1950s radio series, a 1960s television series, a comic book and comic strip based on the 1960s TV show, and a short-lived second 1970s television series.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math problem: Solve 0 = -3533*l + 3634*l - 808 for l. What is the solution?","output":"Okay kiddo, let's solve this one step at a time.  The problem is asking us to find what number 'l' is. To do that, we first want to get all the 'l' stuff together. So, we look at \\"-3533*l + 3634*l\\". This is just like if you have -3533 apples and then your friend gives you 3634 apples. You would have more apples than you did before, right?  So if we subtract 3533 from 3634, we get 101. We get 101*l in our equation.  So, now our equation looks like this: 0 = 101*l - 808.  Now, we're going to move that 808 to the other side of the equation to make it easier to find 'l'. To do that, we are going to add 808 to both sides. This is like if you had -808 candies and then over time you managed to gather 808 more candies, you would end up with zero candies at first, right? So, when we add 808 to both sides, we get: 808 = 101*l.  Now, the last step to find what number 'l' is, we divide both sides by 101. This is like if you had 808 candies and you decided to share them equally among 101 friends, each friend would get how many candies?  Once we divide 808 by 101, we get that 'l' is equal to 8.  So, 'l' in this problem is 8.  So, that's the solution, sweetie! Remember, all of these steps are just like moving and sharing your toys and candies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Jennifer is currently looking for a new city to move to since she is looking to change her life and just do something different. Jennifer is a strong environmentalist and doesn't want to move to a city that contributes a lot to climate change since she feels it's every person's duty to take care of the Earth. She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity. Dapperton, the other city she is considering, has a neat hobby shop that Jennifer likes and the city uses nuclear power for its electricity needs.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will Dapperton have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Jamestown?  Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. The answer is:","output":"Dapperton would have a lower chance of acid rain than Jamestown. This is because acid rain primarily results from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, which releases pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere. These gases rise into the atmosphere and mix with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form acid rain. Since Jamestown uses coal to generate its electricity, it is more likely to contribute to conditions that produce acid rain.  On the other hand, Dapperton uses nuclear power for electricity. Nuclear power plants produce electricity using nuclear fission, a process that, while it does produce radioactive waste, does not release the sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxide that contribute to acid rain. Therefore, Dapperton's use of nuclear power rather than fossil fuels like coal reduces its contribution to the production of acid rain.  However, it's essential to understand that many other factors can influence the occurrence of acid rain in a city, such as weather patterns, proximity to industrial regions, and city's geographical location. However, given only the provided information, Dapperton would have a lower chance of acid rain than Jamestown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  and the situation: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents.

This helps to prevent the ice cubes from melting quickly and stores them effectively in the freezer when not in use. 2. Twist or flex the ice cube tray: To remove the ice cubes from the tray, gently twist or flex the tray to loosen the ice cubes. The flexibility of the ice tray, whether it is made of plastic or silicone, allows the cubes to be easily separated from the tray. 3. Invert the ice cube tray: Once the ice cubes are loosened, carefully turn the tray upside down, and lightly tap it against your hand or a countertop to release the ice cubes into your hand or a bowl. You can also press on the bottom of each section of the tray to pop out the individual ice cubes if you prefer. 4.

This was a modest sum for a 1980s major label album; however, it quadrupled the amount spent on the band's previous album, Surfer Rosa.

The sessions lasted three weeks, concluding on November 23, with \\"nearly a song a day\\" being recorded.Production and mixing began on November 28. The band relocated to Carriage House Studios, a residential studio in Stamford, Connecticut, to oversee production and record further tracks.

During production, Haigler and Norton added layers of guitars and vocals to songs, including overdubbed guitars on \\"Debaser\\" and double tracking vocals on \\"Wave of Mutilation\\". During the recordings, Norton advised Francis to alter several songs; a noted example being \\"There Goes My Gun\\" which was originally intended as a much faster Hüsker Dü-style song. However, at Norton's advice, Francis slowed down the tempo.Norton's suggestions were not always welcome, and several instances of advice to add verses and increase track length contributed to the front man's building frustration. Eventually, Francis took Norton to a record store, where he handed him a copy of Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits, in which most of the songs are about two minutes long.

Bloodstream: As blood sugar levels rise, the glucose circulates throughout the body in the bloodstream. 3. The pancreas: In response to the increased blood sugar levels, the pancreas secretes insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels by allowing cells to take up glucose from the bloodstream. 4. Insulin lowers sugar levels: Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose by cells, which in turn reduces the overall amount of glucose in the bloodstream. Insulin also promotes the storage of excess glucose as glycogen in the liver and muscles, further lowering blood sugar levels. 5. Blood sugar goes back to normal: As the cells absorb glucose, and excess glucose gets stored as glycogen, blood sugar levels gradually return to a normal range, ensuring a balance in the body's energy needs and metabolic functions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Even Queen Victoria had her own private collection. When Edward was the king, the British had a cheap and good postal system. If anyone wanted to tell a friend that they were coming for tea in the afternoon, they would send a postcard in the morning. \\"Drop me a card\\" was as common then as \\"give me a ring\\" as now. In 1902 an important step was taken. The government said that half of the side that was used for the address on the postcard could be used for messages, and the whole of the other side could be used for a picture. It was then that the simple postcard, as we know now, was created. Which statement is TRUE? A) Postcards were not used in the 19th century.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Somali towns warned to expect continuous Kenyan attacks Residents of 10 Somali towns have been warned by Kenya’s military to expect to be “under attack continuously” as Kenya moves forward with its intervention in its lawless neighboring Horn of Africa nation, Reuters news agency reported Tuesday. Kenyan military spokesman Emmanuel Chirchir said on his Twitter account that anyone with relatives and friends in the towns, which included Baidoa, the port city of Kismayu and Afgoye, should be advising them accordingly. Kenya dispatched troops to Somalia last month in an attempt to quash the Somali Islamist militia the Shabab, which it blames for a spate of kidnappings of foreigners on Kenyan soil and frequent attacks on its defense forces along the countries’ shared border. The warning to residents of the Somali towns came the same day as Somali militants ambushed a Kenyan military convoy, according to Reuters. Several Shabab fighters were killed during a gun battle, and three Kenyan soldiers wounded, the news agency reported, citing Kenyan security sources. The commander of Kenya's defense forces has said that his troops will remain in Somalia until the threat from the Shabab is eliminated and Kenyans feel safe. The operation has been dubbed Linda Nchi, meaning \\"Protect the Nation\\" in Swahili, a national language of Kenya. The fact that the warning of continued attacks has gone out to towns beyond the southern part of Somalia where Kenyan troops are advancing suggests that those forces may step up airstrikes on areas where Shabab rebels are known to have strongholds, Reuters said. Kismayu, the port city, is considered to be one such stronghold. Other towns listed by the Kenyan military include Buale, Afmadow, Baar Dheere, Dinsoor and the southern town of Jilib. The news agency did not identify the remaining two towns. On Sunday in Jilib, five Somalis fleeing famine were killed and dozens more injured at a displaced persons camp when Kenyan forces bombed the camp, according to reports from the humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- What are reigning world champions Italy, European champions Spain, and football giants Brazil doing taking on teams like New Zealand and Iraq this month? Robinho (left) and Ronaldinho (right) celebrate Brazil winning the Confederations Cup in 2005. It sounds like a complete mismatch, but the eight-team FIFA Confederations Cup which starts in South Africa on Sunday, will see these teams pitted against one another in what is a dress-rehearsal of sorts for next year's World Cup. Dubbed by FIFA, world football's governing body, the \\"festival of champions\\", the tournament involves primarily the winning teams from regional competitions in each of the world's six football federations -- Spain from Europe (UEFA), Brazil from South America (CONMEBOL), Iraq from Asia (AFC), U.S. from the Americas (CONCACAF), New Zealand from Oceania (OFC), and Egypt from Africa (CAF). These sides qualified for the tournament by winning their respective regional competitions, while","output":"South Africa, as the host nation, was granted automatic qualification. Additionally, 2006 World Cup champions Italy were invited to participate, rounding out the tournament's eight teams. The dual objectives of this unique gathering are to provide a warm-up competition in preparation for the highly anticipated 2010 World Cup and to give each team a chance to prove their mettle against top-tier nations. The tournament is structured into two groups, with each group comprising four teams. The initial round-robin phase sees each team play the other three in their group, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the semifinals. The winners of the semifinals will then compete in the final match to determine the Confederations Cup champion. While mismatches may seem inevitable in this kind of competition, the Confederations Cup provides invaluable experience and exposure for countries such as New Zealand and Iraq, who are looking to improve on the world stage. Moreover, teams like Italy, Spain, and Brazil will have the opportunity to face a wider range of playing styles and strategies, ultimately strengthening their preparations for the 2010 World Cup. The Confederations Cup may largely be seen as a precursor to the main event, but its impact on participating teams' development and the excitement it generates among global football fans should not be underestimated. With the world's footballing giants taking on lesser-known challengers, the tournament offers a fascinating platform for surprises, innovations, and thrilling matches on the road to the 2010 FIFA World Cup."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then, the unit is suddenly ambushed by hundreds of Vietminh soldiers who kill the officers and, although the unit kills many Vietminh, it is eventually overrun. One Vietminh officer, Nguyen Huu An (Duong Don), hypothesizing that if they take no prisoners the French will eventually stop sending troops, orders the execution of all surviving French soldiers.Eleven years later, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), a dedicated U.S. soldier, is deeply committed to training his troops, who are preparing to be sent to Vietnam. The night before their departure, the unit's officers hold a party to celebrate. Moore learns from a superior officer that his unit will be known as the 1st Battalion / 7th cavalry regiment. He is disquieted because the 7th Cavalry regiment was the unit commanded by General George Custer in the 19th Century when he and his men were slaughtered at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. Moore is also dismayed because President Lyndon B. Johnson has decreed that the war would be fought \\"on the cheap,\\" without declaring it a national emergency.

Trudi's character is heart warming as you can relate to difficulties she is having along with the fact she is the only mother of the four.

Transportation Security Administration and airline officials said an unidentified man walked through a checkpoint exit around 5:20 p.m.      TSA spokeswoman Ann Davis said the agency was reviewing video from airport cameras at the terminal and was not sure whether the man went out the wrong way and then went back, or never went through screening.      \\"A male individual was observed walking the wrong way down an exit lane in Terminal C at Newark Liberty Airport,\\" Davis said. \\"TSA was notified and we immediately halted screening at the security checkpoints in Terminal C and worked with the Port Authority to pull the surveillance tapes in the area to determine what transpired and see if we could identify the individual in question.\\"      The individual had not been located by late tonight, the TSA said.      Rescreening began around 10:30 p.m., with passengers allowed to approach in groups of 25.      John Kelly, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Newark Liberty, said the agency’s police were assisting the TSA.      The incident immediately put a halt to all flights out of the terminal, including those with passengers who had already boarded and were awaiting takeoff on a cold, gusty night that already was causing delays.      Outbound flights in Terminal C, which mainly serves Continental Airlines, were held and passenger screening was halted. Around 7:45 pm, the TSA and Port Authority started moving passengers from the so-called \\"sterile side\\" of the terminal to the public side to await rescreening.      Aasmund and Line Skaar, who were returning to Houston from a visit with family in Norway, were in their seats with their two children aboard Continental Flight 405 when their flight was held. They remained on the aircraft for four hours before they were forced to get off and return to the terminal.      \\"It’s total chaos,\\" Line Skaar said.      Her husband said no one had given them any information about what was going on. \\"There have been different contradictory messages,\\" he remarked.      Tom Nicolicchia of Flanders said he was returning home with four relatives on Continental Flight 1434 from Arizona, and they waited on the tarmac for about an hour before they were allowed to get off the plane. He said there was precious little information on the plane and people were calling relatives to find out what was happening.      \\"The pilot said it was a security breach ... he told people with TVs that if they found out to let him know,\\" Nicolicchia said.      In fact there was little official news from anyone in charge. Most stranded passengers were learning about the problems from news broadcasts on terminal video monitors, or from their cell phones or BlackBerrys. Many were clustered around available electric outlets charging their devices after hours of use.      Jared Weaver of Ohio was charging his phone whil waiting for a flight to Akron. Earlier in the day, he had dropped his girlfriend off at a Coast Guard base in Virginia. Wind caused a three-hour delay in his connecting flight from Norfolk, Va., to Newark.      \\"I was 14 minutes from boarding,\\" Weaver said. As the lines crawled around 10 p.m., he said his only plans were to sleep and find contact lens solution.      Sitting on the floor near a baggage carousel, Debbie and Todd Wilson of Huntington Beach, Calif., tried to keep their 2-year-old son Ben occupied as they waited. They were returning home after visiting family in Tinton Falls and had been waiting to board their flight at Gate 133 when they learned there might be a problem.      \\"It got real quiet when it came on the news,\\" said Debbie Wilson. She added initial reports indicated only that there would be no flights coming in or out, but everyone assumed it was weather-related. Then they started to see a lot of security personnel.      Dipti Dua of Sterling, Va., was at the terminal’s security area seeing family off on a flight to India when they were all pushed down to the lower level.      \\"They made us form a line which no longer exists,\\" she said.      Meanwhile, a group of singers and songwriters from Nashville traveling to Mumbai, India, generated some smiles from other dispirited passengers when one pulled out a guitar and they all started singing Creedence Clearwater Revival’s \\"Bad Moon Rising.\\" When they were done, the second floor of the terminal erupted in applause.      \\"Everybody seemed a little down,\\" explained Josh Wilson, 26, the guitarist.      Gov. Jon Corzine on Thursday said the state had increased security measures for the holiday weekend, following the botched attempt to blow up the Detroit-bound airliner. The actions were a precaution, he said, noting there is no known threat to air traffic into and out of the state’s airports. He indicated security personnel and procedures would be heightened as a precaution at Newark Liberty, train stations and NJ Transit facilities.      Corzine could not be reached last night for comment.      According to Davis, a security officer should have been staffing the exit lane, as part of standard protocol.      \\"TSA is reviewing the circumstances to find out exactly what happened — and will take any disciplinary action as necessary,\\" the TSA spokeswoman said.      Hours after the lockdown, passengers were again being re-screened through security so they could board or reboard their flights. Scott Kaczmarek of Seattle, visiting friends and family in Morris Plains, was waiting on a long, slow-moving security line.      \\"My flight is supposed to go out at 11,\\" he said. \\"I don’t see that has happening.\\"      Erin Crabb, also waiting to board Continental Flight 1834 to Seattle, was told by airline agents that no flight would leave until everyone was able to get back through security.      \\"Even if we get there soon, we still have to wait for everyone else,\\" she said, as the departure monitors showed nearly all flights delayed hours behind schedule.

The incident happened at about 5:20 p.m. at Terminal C, when an individual walked from the public side to the secure \\"sterile\\" side for passengers who had cleared screening, according to the Transportation Security Administration.      No flights were allowed to leave from Terminal C Sunday evening and thousands of other travelers who had reached the sterile area after going through checkpoints were moved back to the public area to be re-screened, the TSA said.      Authorities are reviewing video from airport cameras. They are not sure whether the man was once on the sterile side and went back, or if he never went through screening, TSA spokeswoman Anne Davis said.      Watch more about the situation in Newark      The incident caused arrival delays and mainly affected Continental Airlines, which is the airport's largest tenant.      CNN's Alina Cho, who arrived at the airport Saturday night on a flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, described the hectic scene: \\"For the people who are hoping to fly out of Newark this evening, there is not a lot of movement.\\"      She said many passengers who had already boarded outgoing flights had to get off planes to be re-screened.      \\"I just saw one woman pleading with a gate agent, saying that she had two small children and a heart condition -- that she simply could not take this,\\" Cho said. \\"But of course, there will be no exceptions.\\"      Flying Continental?

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: I give two examples as to why intelligent life may not actually exist, though I admit that for me, or even for a physicist who devoted his or her entire life to researching and studying the universe, it's shocking to claim that completely no life exists elsewhere. Keeping that in mind, I'd just like to consider conditions elsewhere in the known universe. You really only need to look at our own solar system or the Earth at certain periods in its own history to appreciate that most places are much worse and much less suitable for life than our mild, watery globe. So far, space scientists have discovered about seventy planets outside the solar. But it appears that if you wish to have a planet suitable for life, you just have to be very lucky, and the more advanced the life is, the luckier you'll have to be. I'm by no means a space observer, but I can recognize some particularly fortunate breaks we've had on the Earth. For example: We are, to a degree, at the right distance from the perfect type of star, the one that is big enough to radiate a huge amount of energy, but not so big as to bum itself out quickly. Had our sun been ten times as huge, it would have burnt out completely after only ten million years, instead of ten billion and surely we would not exist. Too near, everything on the Earth would have boiled and withered away; any further, everything would have frozen over. The universe is a surprising place, and our existence within it is a wonder. If a long and unimaginably complex sequence of events dating back 4.6 billion years or so hadn't happened in a particular manner at a particular time --if, to take just one example, the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out by a meteor --we might still be a few centimeters long, with whisker  and a tail, and you'll be reading this in a cave somewhere. Question: What makes the Earth more suitable for life than other planets in the solar system? Answer: Available choices: (I) The Earth is the only planet that can receive energy from the sun.. (II) The sun is at the right distance from us and in proper size.. (III) The distance between the planets was neither too long nor too near.. (IV) The dinosaurs were no longer a threat to the Earth.. A:","output":"(II) The sun is at the right distance from us and in proper size. The article clearly specifies that Earth is located at just the right distance from the sun, which is also just the right size. Not being too large to burn out quickly or too close to cause Earth to boil nor too far away to freeze. This makes Earth more suitable for life than other planets in the solar system. Option (I) is technically false as other planets also receive sunlight, but unlike Earth, they are not in the \\"habitable zone\\". Furthermore, Options (III) and (IV) were not mentioned in the article as factors making Earth suitable for life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","output":"Daniel Keith Ludwig, born on June 24, 1897, in South Haven, Michigan, was a global business magnate known for his diverse business interests and significant philanthropic endeavors. Ludwig was the son of Daniel Flora Belle Ludwig (1875-1961) and F. Ludwig (1873-1960), and he grew up as an industrious individual with a keen interest in business. Throughout his life, Daniel K. Ludwig ventured into numerous and varied sectors, making a name for himself as a successful businessman. He served on the boards of several prominent companies, including the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Exportadora Institude de Sal, SA, Citricos de Chiriqui, SA, United Pocahontas Coal Company, European-American Securities, Inc., Cancer Southwest Savings and Loan Association, National Bulk Carriers, American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and Princess International Hotels. Particularly notable among his projects was the Jari Project, an ambitious endeavor that involved the development of a large-scale, self-sustaining plantation in the Amazon Basin. Although the project faced several challenges and criticisms, it showcased Ludwig's knack for innovation and his relentless pursuit of business expansion. Daniel K. Ludwig valued education and research and showed a strong dedication to philanthropy. The Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, one of his most notable endeavors, was established to foster cutting-edge research focused on understanding the fundamental mechanisms of cancer and finding innovative treatments. His investment in the institute and other research efforts demonstrated Ludwig's commitment to making a significant impact on society through his wealth and business acumen. In his personal life, Ludwig was married twice. His first marriage was to Gertrude Virginia Higgins (1897-1993), and his second marriage was to Gladys Madeline Jones (1904-1978). Together, they had one child, Patricia Margaret. Ludwig spent his later years residing at Park Cinq in Manhattan, New York. Sadly, on August 27, 1992, he passed away in Manhattan due to heart failure. Despite the challenges life threw at him, Ludwig's legacy as an accomplished businessman and a committed philanthropist remains an inspiration for young entrepreneurs and a testament to the power of ingenuity, perseverance, and dedication to the greater good."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Former Pope Benedict has said he resigned after 'God told me to' during what he called a 'mystical experience', a Catholic news agency reported. Benedict, whose formal title is now Pope Emeritus, announced his shock resignation in February and became the first pontiff to step down in 600 years. 'God told me to do it,' the Zenith agency quoted Benedict as saying to a visitor to the convent in the Vatican gardens where he is living out his retirement in near isolation. 'God told me to do it': Benedict, whose formal title is now Pope Emeritus, announced his shock resignation in February and became the first pontiff to step down in 600 years. 'Mystical experience': According to the Rome-based Zenith, Benedict (right) said the more he observes the way Pope Francis (left) carries out his papal duties, the more he realised the choice was 'wanted by God' According to the agency, Benedict told his visitor, who asked to remain anonymous, that God did not speak to him in a vision but in what the former pope called 'a mystical experience'. According to Italian media, Benedict’s decision to step down was influenced by the various scandals that blighted his eight-year papacy, including the arrest of his personal butler for leaking private documents alleging corruption in the Vatican. Cause of retirement? According to Italian media, Benedict’s decision to step down was influenced by the various scandals, including the arrest of his personal butler, Paolo Gabiele (left) for leaking private documents alleging corruption in the Vatican (right: St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican) He was succeeded by Pope Francis, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina, who was elected as the first non-European pontiff in 1,300 years. According to the Rome-based Zenith, Benedict told his visitor that the more he observes the way Francis carries out his papal duties, the more he realised the choice was 'wanted by God'. Last Sunday, Benedict spent a day at the papal summer retreat at Castel Gandolfo, south of Rome, to escape the heat of the capital. The visit indicated that the 86-year-old ex pope’s health was good enough for him to travel. There had been media reports that since his resignation, Benedict’s health had deteriorated dramatically. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In August 2013, it was reported by the Catholic news agency Zenith that former Pope Benedict XVI had a \\"mystical experience\\" in which God told him to resign as Pope.

While forming an integral part of the Christian calendar, particularly in Catholic regions, many Carnival traditions resemble those antedating Christianity. Italian Carnival is sometimes thought to be derived from the ancient Roman festivals of Saturnalia and Bacchanalia. The Saturnalia, in turn, may be based on the Greek Dionysia and Oriental festivals. For the start of the Roman Saturnalia, on December 17 authorities chose an enemy of the Roman people to represent the Lord of Misrule in each community.

(2) On December 17 , 2014 , he was one of nine Progressive Conservative MLAs who crossed the floor to join the Wildrose caucus . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Let's analyze the sentences step-by-step. Sentence 1: (1) On December 17, 2014, he was one of nine Progressive Conservative MLAs that crossed the floor to join the Wildrose Caucus. Sentence 2: (2) On December 17, 2014, he was one of nine Progressive Conservative MLAs who crossed the floor to join the Wildrose caucus. Step 1: Identify the main components of the sentences. Both sentences have the same components: - A date (December 17, 2014) - A subject (he) - A group (nine Progressive Conservative MLAs) - An action (crossed the floor) - A purpose (to join the Wildrose Caucus/caucus) Step 2: Determine whether the components are expressed in a similar way. In both sentences, the components are expressed similarly, with only minor differences in the use of punctuation, capitalization and relative pronouns: - \\"Caucus\\" is capitalized in sentence 1 and lowercase in sentence 2. This is a minor difference that does not change the meaning of the sentence. - \\"that\\" is used as a relative pronoun in sentence 1, and \\"who\\" is used as a relative pronoun in sentence 2. Both \\"that\\" and \\"who\\" can be used to refer to people in relative clauses, with \\"who\\" being more common and specific to people.  Step 3: Compare the meanings of the two sentences. Based on the analysis in steps 1 and 2, both sentences convey the same meaning: On December 17, 2014, the subject (he) was among nine Progressive Conservative MLAs who crossed the floor with the purpose of joining the Wildrose Caucus/caucus. In conclusion, yes, the two sentences mean the same thing. The differences in punctuation, capitalization, and relative pronouns do not affect the overall meaning of the sentences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose text shows elements of early Pietism? ?  Erschallet, ihr Lieder is the third of the Weimar cantatas. It was the first composed for a feast day, Pentecost Sunday (Whit Sunday), Pentecost being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the Acts of the Apostles, on the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1–13), and from the Gospel of John, in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach, in his Farewell discourse (John 14:23–31). As in many Bach cantatas, the libretto is compiled from Bible text, contemporary poetry and chorale. The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck, although the verses are not included in his printed editions. Several of Bach's early stylistic mannerisms appear here, such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement, arias following each other without a recitative in between, and dialogue in a duet.Franck's text shows elements of early Pietism: the expression of extreme feelings, for example \\"O seligste Zeiten!\\" (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a \\"mystical demeanour\\", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to \\"Gott will sich die Seelen zu Tempeln bereiten\\" (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His  temple, more literally: \\"God wants to prepare [our] souls to become his temples\\"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, \\"Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten\\" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\", which is based on the Latin hymn \\"Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium\\"....

Please answer the following question: Britain is facing a sharp rise in its rat population as growing numbers of people leave what they cannot finish of the fast food in the street, an environment group warned .Keep Britain Tidy said the rats were stopping their traditional hunts underground and were running across the streets, invited by burgers, pizzas and crisps left behind by man. \\"The rat population is on the rise and soon it'll be as common to see a rat on our street as it is to see a dog or a cat,\\" said group Director, Sue Nelson. The practice of spreading fast food litter and scraps on the street rather than in the dustbin--with young men the worst group--was behind the rise. According to the National Rodent Survey in 2005, Britain's rat population has grown by nearly one quarter since 2000 and is now estimated at 60 million, two million more than the human population. On average a rat can give birth every 24-28 days and just a single pair of rats can produce a family of 2,000 a year. Around 200 people a year get Weil's Disease -an infection which can lead to liver or kidney failure and eventually death and which is carried in rats' waste. To attract people's attention to the problem, Keep Britain Tidy produced a cinema ad with a title \\"How close do you want them to get?\\" The ad gave a shocking image of a young woman sleeping in a bed of rats--reminding people of the terrible scene from James Herbert's classic horror tale The Rats, in which rats begin to hunt for humans.

Drivers lined up from traffic signal to traffic signal and were anxious to get home. On a side street merging   into this highway was a timid driver who was afraid to edge in and no one let her in. Some of the drivers backed up behind her and loudly blasted their horns. This made her more upset and nervous.  On the right of this side street, the signal on Pacific Coast Highway turned red and traffic stopped. A driver who saw what was happening to this woman stopped a few car lengths behind her car and motioned to her to pull in front of his car. She quickly did and as he waited, two more cars dashed in behind her car.  While the woman he'd helped waited for the signal to turn green, she sank into her driver's seat and was deeply relieved. Although this thoughtful man couldn't see it, her body language expressed her gratitude. If you've been in a traffic situation like the one she was in, you know how upsetting it can be. But this little act of kindness allowed her to safely reach her home. She told others about this, which encouraged them to do something nice for someone else.  This kindness spreads.

Roberts has stated the characters in the story are largely invented, and that he merged different elements taken from true events and people into such events and characters like Prabaker 'of the big smile'. Prabhakar Kisan Khare was a real-life individual, as are the members of Khare family from the book (Kisan, Rukhma, Kishor and Parvati Khare) whose names appear on government issued identity cards. The family resides in the Navy Nagar slum where the lead character Shantaram also lived. The Khare family disputes many of Roberts' claims, although they acknowledge close association with Gregory Roberts in the 1980s. Prabhakar died in an accident in 1988 in circumstances matching the event in the book. In March 2006, the Mumbai Mirror reported they may have discovered the inspiration for the big smile of the character Prabhakar as belonging to a still living cab driver called Kishore, who took Roberts to his home village.

Having spent years honing her culinary skills, Sarah had become well-versed in various cooking techniques and was particularly passionate about preparing different cuts of meat to perfection. Having studied under some renowned chefs, she had developed a remarkable talent for creating mouth-watering dishes that wowed everyone who tasted them. As a result of her expertise, Sarah was more than happy to share her knowledge and skills with others, especially close friends like Monica. Although Monica was a good cook with a keen interest in gastronomy, she had yet to master the art of cooking the perfect medium rare steak. Sarah was eager to help her friend, as she knew that grasping this skill would open up a whole new world of culinary possibilities for Monica. In order to accurately show Monica how to prepare the steak, Sarah began by explaining the importance of choosing the right cut of meat. She emphasized selecting high-quality beef with good marbling, as this would ensure a tender and flavorful result. After guiding Monica through the process of selecting the best cut, Sarah demonstrated how to properly season the steak with just the right amount of salt and pepper. Next, Sarah instructed Monica on the proper technique to sear the steak in a hot pan, ensuring a delicious crust that would seal in the meat's juices. As they cooked together, Sarah shared tips on how to gauge the steak's doneness by touch, rather than relying on a meat thermometer. She explained that this method was preferred by professional chefs and would, with practice, become second nature to Monica. Once the steak was seared evenly on both sides, Sarah demonstrated how to properly rest the meat before slicing, a crucial step in preserving the steak’s succulent texture. Before they enjoyed their perfectly cooked steaks, Sarah also advised Monica on the ideal accompaniments - a simple green salad, roasted potatoes, and a delectable pan sauce made from the steak's flavorful drippings. Throughout the cooking lesson, Monica was impressed by Sarah's wealth of knowledge and her ability to convey complex culinary concepts in a clear and concise manner. She felt grateful to have a friend who was not only an excellent chef but also willing to share her passion for food. Thanks to Sarah's guidance, Monica gained confidence in her own skills and was eager to continue expanding her culinary repertoire. The time they spent together in the kitchen not only produced a delicious meal but also forged an even stronger bond between the two friends, united by their shared love of exquisite cuisine."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","output":"The answer provided touches upon some factors that stand out in the war against terror articles; however, it does not provide a comprehensive or detailed analysis of the factors that stand out. Before validating this answer, it is important to consider additional factors that have been prominently discussed and debated in the context of the war against terror. 1. Shift in US policy and strategy: The war against terror marked a significant shift in US foreign policy, moving from a focus on state actors to non-state actors such as terrorist organizations. The US adopted a more aggressive stance, with a willingness to engage in preventive military actions and covert operations. 2. Enhanced security measures: Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, there has been a considerable increase in security measures globally, such as the introduction of the USA PATRIOT Act, comprehensive airport security measures, and intelligence surveillance. 3. Coalition-building and international cooperation: The war against terror has involved extensive collaboration among nations, necessitating the formation of alliances and coalitions for military, intelligence, and diplomatic cooperation. 4. Controversial counter-terrorism methods: Some tactics employed in the war against terror have been highly controversial, including the use of torture, rendition, extrajudicial killings, and drone strikes, leading to significant human rights concerns. 5. The rise of homegrown terrorism: The war against terror has also led to greater awareness about radicalization and homegrown terrorism, as terrorist organizations have shifted their recruitment strategies, leading to threats originating from within the countries targeted by terrorism. 6. The impact of social media and the internet: Terrorist organizations have leveraged digital platforms for propaganda, recruitment, and communication, transforming the landscape of modern terrorism and forcing countries to address online radicalization and cyber terrorism. 7. The ongoing nature of the conflict: The war against terror has been a protracted and multifaceted conflict, with many terrorist organizations evolving or being supplanted by new ones, making it difficult to define clear end goals or victory conditions. In conclusion, to validate the answer, it would be advisable to incorporate the above factors to provide a more comprehensive and detailed response to the question.

Iain Duncan Smith has claimed his flagship Universal Credit scheme has been vindicated after evidence showed it is was helping people find work quicker and earn more.

They spent an average of four days more in work during that period, earning around £50 more, according to the analysis. Iain Duncan Smith said research showed those receiving Universal Credit are 5 per cent more likely to find employment within four months ' OPTIONS: - Iain Duncan Smith promised Universal Credit would save taxpayers £1.7 billion in reduced error and fraud. - Jobseekers Allowance promised Universal Credit would save taxpayers £1.7 billion in reduced error and fraud. - Labour promised Universal Credit would save taxpayers £1.7 billion in reduced error and fraud. - Tory promised Universal Credit would save taxpayers £1.7 billion in reduced error and fraud. - Universal Credit promised Universal Credit would save taxpayers £1.7 billion in reduced error and fraud. - Work and Pensions Secretary promised Universal Credit would save taxpayers £1.7 billion in reduced error and fraud.","output":"- Iain Duncan Smith promised Universal Credit would save taxpayers £1.7 billion in reduced error and fraud.

In this case, Iain Duncan Smith, a member of the Conservative party (also known as Tory), made the statement. - Universal Credit is the program being discussed; it cannot make promises itself, as it is a policy and not a person or entity. - Work and Pensions Secretary is the role held by Iain Duncan Smith when he made the promise, but the question is asking for the specific person who made the statement, which is Iain Duncan Smith himself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Where does digestion begin and end?\\" is \\"It begins in the mouth and ends in the large intestine\\"?","output":"Yes, that's right, little buddy! Digestion begins in the mouth when you chew and mix your food with saliva. Then, it goes through a few more organs, like the stomach and small intestine, to break it down more. Finally, it ends in the large intestine, where the body takes out the water and turns what's left into waste. So, digestion starts at the mouth and ends at the large intestine.

The answer is:","output":"Falling onto the elbow joint can fracture the distal humerus.  The humerus is the long bone in the upper arm that runs from the shoulder to the elbow. The distal part of the humerus refers to the lower end of the bone, closest to the elbow joint, where it articulates with the radius and the ulna to form the elbow joint.  Falling directly onto the outstretched elbow or onto an outstretched hand can result in a distal humerus fracture. When your hand or elbow makes contact with the ground, there may be a direct impact or a sudden force applied that is transferred from the wrist and forearm to the elbow joint, leading this area to be vulnerable to fractures. Distal humerus fractures can have various degrees of severity, depending on the force of impact and the angle at which the force is applied. There are three common types of distal humerus fractures, including: 1. Supracondylar fracture: The fracture occurs above the condyles – the rounded projections of the distal humerus that articulate with the radius and ulna. This type of fracture is more frequent in children. 2. Intercondylar fracture: The fracture occurs between the two condyles of the distal humerus. The force is often directed across the joint and may result in more complex fractures, affecting the stability of the elbow joint. 3. Intra-articular fracture: The fracture occurs within the joint capsule and disrupts the smooth articular surfaces of the humerus that make contact with the radius and ulna. This type of fracture can result in significant long-term problems if not treated appropriately due to the involvement of joint surfaces. Diagnosis of a distal humerus fracture should involve a thorough physical examination, including an assessment of the presence of swelling, deformity, or contusion around the elbow joint. Radiographic imaging, such as X-rays or CT scans, are essential tools for evaluating the extent of the fracture and determining the appropriate treatment plan. Treatment for distal humerus fractures depends on the severity and type of fracture, as well as the patient's age and overall health. Nonsurgical treatment, such as casting or splinting, may be appropriate for stable, minimally displaced fractures. However, surgical intervention may be necessary for more severe or displaced fractures or those involving the joint surfaces. Surgery often involves internal fixation using plates, screws, wires, or pins to stabilize the fractured bone fragments and facilitate proper healing. Rehabilitation plays a vital role in the recovery process following a distal humerus fracture. A combination of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and activity modification can help to restore the patient's range of motion, strength, and function in the affected arm. Regular follow-up exams with a physician or orthopedic specialist are also essential to monitor the progress of healing and ensure the best possible outcome."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Comics: Historical narratives of manga tend to focus either on its recent, post-WWII history, or on attempts to demonstrates deep roots in the past, such as to the Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga picture scroll of the 12th and 13th centuries, or the early 19th-century Hokusai Manga. The first historical overview of Japanese comics was Seiki Hosokibara's Nihon Manga-Shi[i] in 1924. Early post-war Japanese criticism was mostly of a left-wing political nature until the 1986 publication for Tomofusa Kure's Modern Manga: The Complete Picture,[j] which de-emphasized politics in favour of formal aspects, such as structure and a \\"grammar\\" of comics. The field of manga studies increased rapidly, with numerous books on the subject appearing in the 1990s. Formal theories of manga have focused on developing a \\"manga expression theory\\",[k] with emphasis on spatial relationships in the structure of images on the page, distinguishing the medium from film or literature, in which the flow of time is the basic organizing element. Comics studies courses have proliferated at Japanese universities, and Japan Society for Studies in Cartoon and Comics (ja)[l] was established in 2001 to promote comics scholarship.

Write a question about the following article: The Kerma culture was an early civilization which flourished from around 2500 BC to about 1600 BC in Nubia, present day Sudan, centered at Kerma. It seems to have been one of a number of Sudanese states during the Middle Kingdom period of Ancient Egypt. In its latest phase, lasting from about 1700-1500 BC, it absorbed the Sudanese kingdom of Sai and became a sizable, populous empire rivaling Egypt. Around 1500 BC, it was absorbed into the Egyptian Empire, but rebellions continued for centuries. By the 11th century BC, the more 'Egyptianized' Kingdom of Kush emerged, apparently from Kerma, and regained the region's independence from Egypt.","output":"What factors contributed to the growth and eventual absorption of the Kerma culture into the Egyptian Empire, and how did this influence the emergence of the Kingdom of Kush in the 11th century BC?"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: Jacob's Ladder Movie plot: On 6Â October 1971, American soldier Jacob Singer is with the 1st Air Cavalry Division, deployed in a village in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War, when his close-knit unit comes under attack. As many of Jacobâs comrades are killed or wounded, others exhibit abnormal behavior, including catatonia and a bloody seizure. A terrified Jacob flees into the jungle, only to be bayoneted in the gut. Jacob awakens in 1975, on a New York City Subway, with the novel The Stranger. Despite having a PhD, Jacob works as a postal clerk and lives in a rundown apartment in Brooklyn with his seductive girlfriend, Jezzie. Jacob misses his wife and their three sons, especially the youngest, Gabe, who died before the war. He is increasingly beset by disturbing experiences, including inexplicably locked subway exits, faceless vibrating people, a car trying to run him down, a nurse with grotesque teeth on the top of her head, and a bat-like monster penetrating Jezzie at a party, where Jacob collapses with a dangerous fever. The comrade who had gone catatonic, Paul, contacts him to reveal having had similar terrifying experiences, but is immediately killed when his car explodes. Commiserating after the funeral, the platoon-mates confess that all but one have also been living a nightmare. Jacob explains that the army must have done something to them, and they hire a lawyer to investigate. The lawyer backs out after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons. Jacobâs comrades also back out, looking scared, as Jacob demands they tell him who got to them. Jacob himself is later thrown into a car with intimidating men in suits who tell him to stop nosing around in military business, but he is able to jump from the moving car. Taken to the hospital, he finds himself strapped to a stretcher being wheeled over bloody body parts, past demented, disfigured inmates.

Three of us arrived on a Sunday for breakfast and there was no one to take your name or create a list of who had arrived first, which caused some chaos.   There were two groups in front of us who were doing some minor squabbling with each other over who should get the next available table. I walked in to the main counter, and a waiter approached me. He told me it would 10-15 mins for my party of three.  I went back to the patio and waited in line. A man and his parents arrived after us, asked me where they should put their name down, and I told him to just inform a waiter you're here.  After about 20 minutes (and now that we're next in line) a table opened up and the man with his parents just walked over and sat down. I followed, told him we were next in line and he just responded, \\"There is no 'real' line.\\"  That guy was clearly a schmuck, but the reason it happened was Vincent Market Bistro had no system to create a list for who should be seated in order of arrival. Considering that even the IHOP has mastered this concept, one would hope Vincent can get a grip on it going forward.  To be fair, the manger came over later and apologized and gave us a mountain of free deserts. But, he had no real response as to why there isn't a host or hostess to keep people happy.  The croissants are amazing, the ham and Gruyere omelette was average, and the service was decent (once we were seated, which we did ourselves since no one offered to seat us at anytime.)

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Plates on the Earth&#x27;s crust move slowly past each other - As the plates move, they exert a great force - When the force is large enough, the crust breaks - The stress is released as energy - The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves - We feel the earthquake -   suppose night will fall and wind will not pass as much happens, how will it affect crust is pushed forward.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of night falling and wind not passing as much would be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process in the context of plate tectonics and earthquakes. While the changes in wind patterns and the transition from day to night do not have a direct influence on the movement of tectonic plates, they can contribute to minor changes in the Earth's crust. These indirect effects stem from variations in temperature and atmospheric pressure during the day-night cycle. As the Earth cools at night, the surface contracts slightly, and this can result in minuscule adjustments in the stress and strain experienced by the crust. Moreover, changes in wind patterns can lead to minor alterations in the distribution of atmospheric pressure. This can have a subtle effect on local geological processes such as erosion and sedimentation. Over long periods, these small changes can accumulate and contribute to a modification in the overall stress distribution of the plates. However, it should be noted that these indirect impacts are unlikely to be significant enough to trigger an earthquake or substantially influence plate tectonic processes. Plate tectonics are mainly driven by forces originating deep within the Earth, such as mantle convection, which causes the plates to move and interact. Even though the factors mentioned earlier may play a minuscule role in the overall dynamics of the crust, they are typically overshadowed by the more powerful geological forces. In summary, the supposed perturbation of night falling and wind not passing as much can be seen as indirectly impacting a step of the process in plate tectonics and earthquake generation. Despite these indirect effects, they are unlikely to exert a significant influence on the occurrence of earthquakes or the motion of tectonic plates compared to the much stronger forces at play deep within the Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is some data: Alhambra, owner, P&O (company); P&O (company), location, London; Alhambra, powerType, Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes; Alhambra, builder, Samuda Brothers; Alhambra, length, 63800.0 (millimetres). Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The given data set provides information about a specific entity called Alhambra, its associations, and various attributes. The Alhambra is connected to the P&O company, which is based in London, and various aspects of the Alhambra's construction and technical specifications. Firstly, the owner of the Alhambra is mentioned to be the P&O company. P&O, or the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, is a British shipping and logistics company with a long and storied history, having been established in the 19th century. The P&O company has had diverse operations and holdings over the years, including various vessels and maritime resources, such as the Alhambra. In the data, we also find the P&O company's location, which is London. London, the capital city of the United Kingdom, has been a center for global commerce and maritime trade for centuries. As such, it is a fitting location for the headquarters of P&O, a company that has had significant contributions to the maritime industry. The power type of the Alhambra is specified as Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes. Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes are likely to be the manufacturers or developers of the propulsion system or engine technology used in the Alhambra. The company or partnership would have been responsible for providing the energy source that propels the Alhambra through the water, making them a crucial part of its overall design and construction process. The builder of the Alhambra is identified as Samuda Brothers. The Samuda Brothers were a well-known and respected British shipbuilding firm in the 19th century, which was involved in the construction of numerous iron and steel vessels during its operational time. They would have been responsible for the overall design, construction, and assembly of the Alhambra according to the specifications and requirements provided by P&O. Finally, the length of the Alhambra is given as 63,800.0 millimeters, which is equivalent to 63.8 meters or approximately 209 feet. This provides an understanding of the scale and dimensions of the Alhambra, offering insight into its size and capacity as a maritime vessel. This length would have played a role in determining various factors, such as the vessel's speed, carrying capacity, and maneuverability. In summary, the data set describes the Alhambra as a maritime vessel owned by the P&O company, which is headquartered in London. The Alhambra's propulsion technology is provided by Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes, while its design and construction process is credited to the British shipbuilding firm known as Samuda Brothers. The vessel's length is specified as 63,800.0 millimeters, or approximately 63.8 meters, highlighting its size and scale in the context of maritime transportation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The term \\"we're\\" is a contraction for \\"we are,\\" which can be translated to \\"My jsme\\" in Czech. As a personal pronoun, \\"My\\" already encompasses the verb \\"to be\\" as it is used in Czech, so we can shorten the phrase to just \\"My.\\" Adjust for language structure to make it even more natural, in this case we'll use \\"nám\\" which means \\"us\\" or \\"to us\\".

The question asks for a specific color, which is a property of an object rather than a description of it. (iii). Abbreviation: An abbreviation is the shortened form of a word or phrase, whereas the question is concerned with the color of a specific design element on the flag. (iv). Human: A human is a person or individual, while the question inquires about the color of a symbol on a flag, not a person. (v). Numeric: A numeric value refers to a number that can express quantity, size, or ordinal position, whereas the question calls for the identification of a color, which is not a numeric value. (vi). Location: A location indicates a specific point or area, often referring to a geographic place or position. The question seeks the color of a cross on a flag, which is unrelated to a particular location.

The phrase \\"without any of its sense of fun or energy\\" implies that the movie lacked the engaging and lively elements that the reviewer might have expected or hoped for. This kind of assessment suggests that the movie failed to capture the viewer's interest, and the overall experience was likely disappointing, dull, or tedious. It is essential to remember that a single sentence cannot capture the entirety of a reviewer's opinions, but this particular sentence certainly conveys a negative tone. However, to get a comprehensive understanding of the movie's reception, it would be beneficial to consider the broader context of the review, including other statements addressing various aspects of the film such as the plot, acting performances, cinematography, and directing. Moreover, other factors that could potentially impact the movie's overall evaluation include the reviewer's preferences and expectations. If the reviewer generally enjoys movies within the same genre or has high expectations based on the director's previous works or the movie's promotional material, these factors may contribute to the negative assessment of the movie. In conclusion, the sentence in question implies a negative view of the movie, suggesting that it didn't provide a sense of fun or energy the reviewer was looking for.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"A nectar feeding bird would be called what?\\" is in \\"Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Look for someone who has experience working with clients in your situation. Psychologists tend to concentrate on certain age groups or kinds of issue. Your candidates may have areas of interest listed on their website or wherever they are listed, or you may have to ask.  You may be interested in working with a psychologist who has experience with your age group. Some psychologists specialize in treating queer youth, or the elderly, or families. If you will need your psychologist to perform functions for you outside of individual sessions, such as testifying in court, make sure your psychologist has experience. Find someone who has expertise in custody battles, for instance, if you are about to enter divorce.  If you can't find information on your candidate's website, ask \\"What sort of experience do you have working with clients who are/who struggle with/who would like to…\\" At a minimum, a good psychologist will be licensed by the state or jurisdiction they practice in. This is a license that is only renewed for psychologists who demonstrate competence and adherence to professional ethics. Psychologists have doctoral degrees, so you should find a \\"PhD\\" noted after the name of any psychologist you are considering. Psychologists charge variable rates, so find one who you can afford to stay with as long as you need. If you have health insurance, your insurance may cover some of the costs of care. If you don't, or if your health insurance won't cover your mental health needs, you may find yourself paying between 100-250 out of pocket for a session. However, there are ways to find a psychologist you can afford: don't give up just because the initial costs seem high.  Many psychologists work on a sliding scale. Explain that your funds are limited, and ask for a low hourly rate. Ask for a cash discount. Some psychologists will give you a discount if you can pay in cash instead of by card or check. Ask your insurer for the list of psychologists in your area who are covered by your insurance, or search for mental health practitioners on your insurance company's website. If your insurance doesn't mention psychologists, ask what they do cover. Some policies may include social workers, for instance. Contact a community mental health center for free or low-cost services. Summary:","output":"This article talks about finding the right psychologist for your needs. First, you should look for someone who has experience working with people like you. Psychologists have different skills and interests, so pick one that fits you best. Make sure they have the right education and license to help people. Also, check if you can afford their fees. Some might offer discounts or work with your insurance.

Article:","output":"Title: Police Seeking Witnesses for Sexual Assault Investigation in Edinburgh The Edinburgh police are urgently appealing to the public for any information regarding a sexual assault that took place in a graveyard within the city. In particular, they are keen to speak with individuals who may have witnessed an earlier incident in a nearby pub, as this could provide critical clues to the ongoing investigation. On an unassuming evening in Scotland's capital, a woman was sexually assaulted in an Edinburgh graveyard in what has become a shocking and deeply concerning incident. The authorities were immediately informed, and the police launched a full investigation in an attempt to find the individual or individuals responsible for this heinous act. As part of their search for answers, the police have turned to the public for assistance. They are particularly interested in speaking with anyone who may have seen or heard anything unusual in a nearby pub earlier in the evening. This line of inquiry has been deemed crucial, as investigators suspect the connection between the incidents could be significant. By gathering evidence from witnesses of the earlier incident, investigators hope to piece together a timeline of events that could lead them to the perpetrator(s) of the sexual assault. Authorities urge anyone with information, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, to come forward, as every detail could be vital to the investigation. The police have reiterated their commitment to ensuring the safety of Edinburgh residents and have increased patrols in the area, imploring the public to stay alert and report any suspicious activity immediately. Edinburgh, a city rich in history and culture, has unfortunately not been immune to incidents like these. However, by working together, the community can hope to bring those responsible to justice and restore a sense of safety and peace for its residents. In conclusion, the Edinburgh police request any witnesses who may have knowledge about the earlier pub incident or the sexual assault to contact them as soon as possible. By uniting as a community, sharing information and supporting the authorities in their search for the truth, we can make Edinburgh a safer city and ensure that similar incidents become a thing of the past."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A specific job hunt will be more efficient than a random one . Schedule abundant interviews Use every possible method to get interviews-answering ads, using search firms, contacting companies directly, surfing the Web, and networking. Even if a job is not perfect for you, every interview can make you learn from it. Follow up Even if someone does not hire you, write them a thank-you note for the interview. Then. some weeks later, send another brief letter to explain that you still have not found the perfect position and that you will be available to interview again if the original position you applied for-or any other position, for that matter-is open. Do this with every position you interview for, and you may just catch a break. Make it your full-time job You can't find a job by looking infrequently. You have to make time for it. If you're unemployed and looking for a job, devote as much time as you would to a full-time job. If you have a job while you're looking, figure out an organized schedule to maximize your searching time. Network vertically In the research phase of your job hunt, talk to people who are on a level above you in your desired industry. They'll have some insights that people at your own level won't have, and will be in a good position to hire you or recommend you to be hired.

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disorder, also known as GERD or acid reflux, is a disorder is which contents from your stomach and intestines enter your esophagus. The acid from the stomach migrates upwards past your lower esophagus, causing a burning pain and, at times, actual erosion of the tissue of the esophagus. Approximately 25 to 35% of Americans are affected acid reflux.  It is uncomfortable and quite painful in some cases.   The discomfort can be assessed on a spectrum from just mild burning to a severe burning chest pain, mimicking a heart attack. The pain of acid reflux is brought on by the gastric fluid, which has a very low acidic pH. It migrates up the esophagus and finds its way into an environment where it doesn’t belong and is not intended to be, such as your esophagus. The migration of gastric fluid that causes acid reflux can be caused by a loose lower esophageal sphincter (LES). It can also be due to gravity, which can take effect if you lie down right after a meal. Acid reflux can also be caused by overeating and applying too much pressure to the LES, forcing the stomach contents back past the sphincter. Other situations that may cause acid reflux are smoking, obesity, high intake of sodium, low intake of dietary fiber, limited physical exercise, and taking certain medications. There are multiple underlying conditions that can cause or be caused by acid reflux. Other conditions that can lead to acid reflux are pregnancy and a hiatal hernia, which is where a hole in the diaphragm allows the upper portion of the stomach to enter the chest cavity.  Acid reflux can cause other conditions, such as a condition called Barrett’s Esophagus. Ask your doctor if you think your acid reflux has an underlying conditional cause or if you think it is causing more serious problems.","output":"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disorder (GERD) is a common condition affecting 25-35% of Americans, causing burning pain and potential tissue erosion in the esophagus due to stomach acid migration, with factors such as a loose lower esophageal sphincter, gravity, overeating, smoking, obesity, high sodium intake, low dietary fiber intake, limited exercise, certain medications, pregnancy, and hiatal hernia contributing to its occurrence, and potentially leading to more serious problems like Barrett's Esophagus."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Friction between the rubber of the balloon and the baby’s hair results in electrons from the hair \\"rubbing off\\" onto the balloon.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Liverpool, in North West England, is a major city and metropolitan borough with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015 within the City of Liverpool. Liverpool and its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region.  - TJ Morris Ltd comprises several businesses including Home Bargains , property ownership , and Far Eastern ventures .  - Home Bargains is a chain of discount stores offering home bargains, operating throughout the United Kingdom, founded by Tom Morris in Liverpool, approximately 40 years ago which was then called Home and Bargain. It is the trading name of TJ Morris Ltd. In late 2013, the company published a record-breaking turnover of £1 billion.    What is the relationship between 'tj morris' and 'liverpool'? Answer:","output":"TJ Morris and Liverpool share a significant relationship as both a geographical and historical connection. The link between the two can be described in the following ways: 1. Geographical connection: TJ Morris Ltd, which operates Home Bargains, is a company that was founded in Liverpool, a major city located in North West England. This city serves as the birthplace and origin of the company, and it was here that the first Home and Bargain store was opened approximately 40 years ago by its founder, Tom Morris. The establishment of the company in Liverpool, a prominent metropolitan area, enabled it to reach a considerable market, which contributed to its growth and development over the years. 2. Historical connection: Tom Morris, the founder of TJ Morris Ltd, started the company in Liverpool by opening a small store called Home and Bargain around 40 years ago. The initial success of this store led to the creation of the now well-known Home Bargains brand – the trading name of TJ Morris Ltd. As the company grew, it expanded its reach throughout the United Kingdom, but its roots and foundation remain tied to Liverpool. 3. Economic connection: The rise and expansion of TJ Morris Ltd and Home Bargains within Liverpool and beyond have contributed to the economic development of the city. By providing job opportunities, investment, and consumer savings through its discounted products, the company has played a notable role in the growth of Liverpool's economy over the past few decades. Moreover, the company's recorded turnover of £1 billion in late 2013 reflects the magnitude of its contributions to the local and national economy. 4. Influence on the wider area: The presence of TJ Morris Ltd in Liverpool has had a more extensive impact on the entire metropolitan area. With an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011, the Liverpool City Region has benefited from the company's growth and offerings through job creation and increased consumer choice for discounted products. This has solidified the relationship between TJ Morris Ltd and the surrounding areas in addition to Liverpool itself. In summary, the relationship between TJ Morris and Liverpool is a multifaceted one, largely characterized by their geographical, historical, economic, and broader regional connections. Liverpool is the origin, birthplace, and foundation of TJ Morris Ltd, with its influence extending beyond the city to impact the broader Liverpool City Region as well."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer a question about this article: At low frequencies (such as AM broadcast), arrays of vertical towers are used to achieve directionality  and they will occupy large areas of land. For reception, a long Beverage antenna can have significant directivity. For non directional portable use, a short vertical antenna or small loop antenna works well, with the main design challenge being that of impedance matching.

Write a title for this article: Nintendo’s share price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange has plummeted 17% in one day, apparently due to investors belatedly discovering that the company doesn’t actually make Pokémon Go, the latest mobile gaming phenomenon. The company is still buoyant, though: Since the game launched in mid-July, Nintendo’s share price has more than doubled. The cause of Monday’s decline was seemingly a statement put out by Nintendo after the close of trading on Friday, the day Pokémon Go was finally released in Japan. The statement pointed out that, despite the long-running association of Nintendo with Pokémon – an association which seems to have driven investors’ movements – it neither makes, nor owns, Pokémon Go. That fact was never hidden by any of the companies involved, and has been noted in some reports on Pokémon Go, but the fact seems to have taken investors by surprise. Nintendo’s statement clarified that Pokémon Go “is developed and distributed by Niantic, Inc”, an independent company spun off from Google in August 2015. Both Google and Nintendo hold stakes in Niantic. It added that Nintendo owns 32% of the voting power within the Pokémon Company, which itself will receive “a licensing fee and compensation for collaboration in development and operations”. Because of those facts, Nintendo concluded, “the income reflected on the company’s consolidated business results is limited”. It will make more direct income from Pokémon Go Plus, a peripheral due to be released this summer which will allow partial interaction with the game without the need to turn on the phone, but that income too is already reflected in the company’s predictions for the 2016–17 financial year. Taken as a whole, the statement is clear: Nintendo’s not getting rich from Pokémon Go anytime soon. But while the direct income streams are limited, there are still reasons for investor positivity in the company following Pokémon Go’s success. Nintendo has already released one smartphone game directly, Miitomo, but its longstanding refusal to allow its largest properties to leave its own hardware ecosystem has left shareholders concerned. The Wii U holds a distant third place in the home console market, and while the New 3DS is the leading portable console, it is dwarfed by the size of the mobile phone gaming market. Even if Nintendo doesn’t take much cash home from Pokémon Go, the game’s success could convince the company to put more efforts into its home-grown smartphone development. If it does, that could signal a longer term reversal in the company’s fortunes than any one game could ever provide. The company is already moving forward with another partnership, with Japanese mobile developer DeNA, which will provide it with a more direct income stream from mobile games. The first two games from that partnership will be based on the company’s b-tier franchises Animal Crossing and Fire Emblem.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: This isn't the best romantic comedy ever made, but it is certainly pretty nice and watchable. It's directed in an old-fashioned way and that works fine. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne isn't bad in her role as the woman who can't get over her husband's death. She has a sexy maturity. But I can't say much for Ryan O'Neal as Philip, because he is, at best, nondescript. He may be adequate in the role, but that's not good enough. However, I get the feeling that some of the characters, particularly Alex and Miranda, are not written with enough in-depth thought. We don't know anything else about them because minutes after they appear the story gets thick, and the writers don't tell us much beyond what happens. But that problem was salvaged because Mary Stuart Masterson has a fresh-as-a-daisy sweetness to brighten it up, and Robert Downey Jr. is so charming that he melts the screen. Even his smile is infectious. And it so happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenes.

He noticed that magma there formed rhyolite. He was so excited to an eruption that when next time Kilauea eruption started in Hawaii, he went to see that. He found that unlike Etna Kilauea eruption formed basalt.  Hint: Generally speaking, more mafic magmas, such as those that form basalt, are hotter and less viscous than more silica-rich magmas, such as those that form rhyolite. Low viscosity leads to gentler, less explosive eruptions. Answer:","output":"Etna would have a lower temperature than Kilauea. Step 1: Understand the hint The hint provided states that mafic magmas, which form basalt, are generally hotter and less viscous than silica-rich magmas, which form rhyolite.

When you're creating art and are interrupted constantly you will likely feel what? - relax - frustration - pleasure - controversy - park  The best answer is Answer:","output":"When you're creating art and are interrupted constantly, the best answer for what you will likely feel is frustration. Artistic endeavors require time, focus, and concentration for the artist to fully explore their creativity and manifest their vision onto the chosen medium. Interruptions can break the artist's flow, disrupt the creative process, and make it difficult to get back to the same headspace or mindset they were in before the interruption occurred. Feeling relaxed, pleasured, or experiencing controversy or park feelings are less likely, given the situation. Relaxation and pleasure are generally experienced when an individual is fully immersed in their creative zone, enjoying the process of unwinding themselves into the depths of their artistic talents. On the other hand, controversy and park (an irrelevant answer in this case) are not directly linked to the feeling of being interrupted while creating art. Frustration can arise not just from the interruption itself, but also from the knowledge that getting back into the creative zone might be challenging. The artist might feel like they are making less progress on their artwork than if they were allowed to work in an uninterrupted environment. Additionally, each interruption can lead to an increasing sense of frustration, making it even more difficult to concentrate on the artistic process once the disruptions have stopped. To overcome this frustration, artists should consider setting dedicated time and space for their creative work, away from distractions or interruptions. Communicating with the people around them about the need for uninterrupted time to focus on art can also help avoid any unnecessary disturbances. It is essential to recognize the importance of a calm and uninterrupted environment in nurturing an artist's creativity and allowing them to fully express themselves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Jeffery Deaver looks more like a brainy villain   in a James Bond movie than a \\"00\\" agent in Her Majesty's secret service.Best known for his thrillers starring criminalist   Lincoln Rhyme, Jeffery Deaver has a new mission: Bring Bond into the 21st century in a new 007 novel. The yet-to-be-named book is cryptically   referred to as \\"Project X\\" by Ian Fleming Publications Ltd., which owns the rights to Fleming's work.Most of the details surrounding Project X, to be published in May, are being kept under wraps, but under gentle coaxing   Deaver begins to spill his guts.\\"The novel,\\" he says, \\"is set in the present day, in 2011.Bond is a young agent for the British secret service.He's 29 or 30 years old, and he's an Afghan war vet.\\" That in itself is big news.After all, if Bond were aging in real time -- he first appeared on the screen in 1953 -- the now doddering   007 would be nearly 90. But first up: a new stand-alone Deaver novel, Edge (Simon & Schuster, 26.99), to be published Tuesday.It's about a federal agent who risks his life to protect a Washington police detective from a man hired to extract information from him using any means at his disposal  . Sipping coffee while seated on a leather chair in a sitting room decorated with portraits of his dogs and show ribbons, the mild-mannered author who writes about murderers and serial killers talks about his career and the solid fan base that has allowed him to pursue writing full time since 1990.\\"I may not sell as many books as John Grisham(although he has sold a cool 20 million), but I have a very loyal fan base,\\" says Deaver, 60, who wrote some of his novels while working as a Wall Street lawyer.Deaver's initiation into the Bond family -- more than 100 million 007 novels have sold worldwide -- could significantly raise his profile  . Other novelists have written Bond novels since Ian Fleming's death in 1964 -- including Kingsley Amis, John Gardner and, most recently, Sebastian Faulks -- but they all took place in the original era.Deaver is taking a new...

The choices provided are oxygen, light, insulin, and glucose. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options - Light: While some cells, like those in plants, rely on light for photosynthesis to produce energy, not all cells require light for energy production. - Insulin: Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate glucose levels in the body, but it is not an energy source for all cells. Step 3: Compare the remaining options - Oxygen: Oxygen plays a vital role in the process of cellular respiration, which converts glucose into energy. However, some cells, like anaerobic bacteria, can generate energy without using oxygen. - Glucose: Glucose is a sugar molecule that serves as the primary energy source for cells. Cellular respiration, whether it is aerobic (requires oxygen) or anaerobic (does not require oxygen), relies on glucose to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: What does Mulder discovers? Movie plot title: The X Files Movie plot: The film opens in prehistoric times in a wordless sequence. A Neanderthal man stumbles upon what appears to be a large, primal, vicious alien in a cave (although the camera work uses zooms and flash-edits to keep the creature from being visualized fully). The two fight, and the caveman wins, stabbing the alien to death. However, fans of the show will recognize the black oil as it bleeds from the alien's wounds and soaks into the Neanderthal. After a fade to modern-day small-town Texas, a little boy (Lucas Black) falls down a hole in his back yard, and finds a human skull. As he picks it up, black oil seeps out from the ground beneath his feet, and black slivers move up his legs until they reach his head - his eyes go black. Shortly afterward, a team of firemen descend to rescue him. They are presumably lost to the same fate as the boy.In the summer of 1998, at the end of the show's fifth season, the X-Files were shut down, and Fox Mulder and Dana Scully were assigned to other projects. They are first seen assisting Special Agent in Charge (SAC) Darius Michaud (Terry O'Quinn), and his FBI team investigating a bomb threat to a Federal building in Dallas, Texas. When Mulder separates from the team to scout out the building across the street, he discovers the bomb in a first-floor vending machine. While Michaud remains to disarm the bomb, Mulder and Scully are able to evacuate the building and prevent hundreds of casualties before it explodes. It becomes clear to the viewer, (but not the agents,) that Michaud is making no effort to disarm the bomb, which ultimately explodes.(Several media commentators noted parallels between this and the real-life 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing.)[1][2]Mulder and Scully return to Washington, D.C., but instead of commending their roles in preventing the deaths of hundreds, they are instead chastised because four victims were still in the building: three firemen, and one little boy.

Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958 – June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \\"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches.

In the future, searching for a way to solve overpopulation and global warming, Dr. Jørgen Asbjørnsen invents \\"downsizing\\", a process to shrink people to a height of five inches (12.7 cm); he and his wife Anne-Helene become part of the first human test subjects once the process is proven safe and demonstrate it to the world. Paul and Audrey Safranek, a married couple in Omaha with financial problems, meet Dave and Carol Johnson, who have downsized. While the inventors advocate that downsizing is environmentally friendly through the reduction of waste, Dave argues that its benefits extend far beyond that and improve one's life through the increase in value of their money. Exploring the possibilities of downsizing, Paul and Audrey agree to undergo the process and move to Leisureland, New Mexico, one of the most popular communities for small individuals. After undergoing downsizing, Paul receives a call from Audrey, saying that she was unable to go through with the procedure and, by opting out at the last minute, will be leaving him. One year later, Paul finalizes the divorce with Audrey, and settles in to his new apartment (a downsizing of its own from the mansion he was to originally share with Audrey). Although Paul had anticipated a life of relative ease, the divorce left him without Audrey's share of their assets. In addition, Paul's share of the asset shrank further still due to divorce settlement negotiations. Paul, whose occupational therapist license had lapsed and faced a re-certification process due to Leisureland being in another state, now works as a customer service representative for Lands' End.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  Washington, D.C. detective and forensic psychologist Alex Cross heads to Durham, North Carolina when his niece Naomi, a college student, is reported missing. He learns from police detective Nick Ruskin that Naomi is the latest in a series of young women who have vanished. Soon after his arrival, one of the missing women is found dead, bound to a tree, and a short time later, Kate McTiernan is kidnapped from her home. When she awakens from a drugged state, Kate discovers that she is being held by a masked man calling himself Casanova, and she is one of several prisoners trapped in his lair. She manages to escape and is severely injured when she jumps from a cliff into a river. After she recuperates, she joins forces with Cross to track down her captor, whom Cross concludes is a collector, not a killer, unless his victims fail to follow his rules. This means there is time to rescue the other imprisoned women, as long as they remain obedient. Clues lead them to Los Angeles, where a series of gruesome kidnappings and murders have been credited to Dr. William Rudolph, known as the Gentleman Caller. Cross's efforts to capture and question Rudolph are foiled when Rudolph escapes. In North Carolina, Cross traces Casanova up the river. Alerted by a gunshot, he discovers Casanova's underground hideout. Rudolph is revealed to be Casanova's partner. Casanova escapes, while Rudolph is shot by Cross. Cross rescues the kidnapped women, including Naomi.  answer the following question:  What is the nickname of the man that the Washington, D.C detective shoots?

Process: - An owl leaves his nest - The owl flys out into the night - The owl looks down at the ground - The owls keen eyesight allows him to see in the dark - The owls sensitive hearing allows him to locate hidden prey - The owl swoops down - The owl catches a mouse in his talons.  Question: suppose owls fly less happens, how will it affect owls look at the ground less.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less If owls were to fly less frequently, it would inherently lead to them looking at the ground less as well. Owls are nocturnal predators that rely on their exceptional eyesight and sensitive hearing to locate and capture prey, usually small mammals like mice, from the ground.  When owls fly, they do so silently, which allows them to remain undetected by their prey. While in flight, they actively search for their prey using their keen eyesight which allows them to see in the dark, and their hearing, which helps them pinpoint the location of prey hidden in vegetation or moving on the ground.  If the frequency of their flying decreases, it would mean that they're spending a lesser amount of time airborne and would consequently spend less time looking at the ground for potential prey. This could be due to various factors, such as changes in their habitat, reduced prey population, or a shift in their hunting behavior. A reduction in the frequency of owls flying and looking at the ground might lead to various consequences, which may either be positive or negative. A possible positive outcome could be the conservation of energy by the owl, which may lead to them focusing on other activities essential to their survival, such as resting, nesting, or protecting their territory. On the other hand, a negative consequence could be a decrease in the owl's hunting success, which might affect their health due to a lack of food. Furthermore, this reduction in predation could lead to an overpopulation of small mammals in certain areas, which might have cascading effects on the local ecosystem. In conclusion, if owls fly less, it would result in them looking at the ground less as well, potentially affecting their hunting habits and the overall ecosystem balance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I have a new situation: Barb and Jill practiced small scale farming. Jill farmed the conventional way, while barb used the no-tillage method.  But I can use this background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.  What is an answer for this question: Which farmer had soil which may delay planting to less ideal dates? The answer is:","output":"Based on the given background information, it is likely that Barb, who practiced no-tillage farming, may have experienced soil that could potentially delay planting to less ideal dates. This can be attributed to the fact that untilled soil in areas with rigorous winter conditions can take longer to warm and dry in the spring, leading to a possible delay in planting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Sydney Francis Barnes (19 April 1873 - 26 December 1967) was an English professional cricketer who is generally regarded as one of the greatest ever bowlers. He was right-handed and bowled at a pace that varied from medium to fast-medium with the ability to make the ball both swing and break from off or leg. He is the quickest bowler to achieve 150 Test wickets in history. Barnes was unusual in that, despite a very long career as a top-class player, he spent little more than two seasons in first-class cricket, representing Warwickshire and Lancashire. Barnes was 41 when the First World War broke out and so too old for military service. From 1915 to 1923, he played exclusively for Saltaire in the Bradford League, taking 904 wickets at an average of 5.26. He took a hundred wickets in a season five times, a rare feat in the Bradford League's history. From 1924 to 1930, he played for Castleton Moor and Rochdale in the Central Lancashire League. He was with Rawtenstall in the Lancashire League from 1931 to 1933. Then, aged 61, he returned to the Bradford League to play for Keighley in 1934, which was his final season in league cricket.  Barnes declined the opportunity to join the tour to Australia in 1920-21, when he was 47 years old. He had wanted to bring his family with him, but it became clear that he would have to pay their traveling expenses. He was not selected by England nor did he seek selection by the Players after the First World War. He did not play first-class cricket again until 1927 when he was 54 years old. From then until 1930, he made nine appearances for Wales.  Barnes took 49 wickets for Wales in 1928, including seven for 51 and five for 67 in an eight wicket win over the touring West Indians. He also made two first-class appearances for the Minor Counties in 1929 and took eight for 41 in a drawn game against the South Africans at Stoke-on-Trent. Barnes' final first-class appearance was for Wales against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's in 1930.  Barnes made 177 appearances for Staffordshire in the Minor Counties Championship between 1904 and 1935. This was in two parts: 1904 to 1914; and 1924 to 1935. His career record for Staffordshire was 1,432 wickets at an average of 8.03. Entity:","output":"Sydney Francis Barnes"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Kieran Chung practises his dribble in the back-garden ice rink his godfather had built for him. Kieran Chung longed to be an ace at ice hockey, but struggled to get to his local rink to practise. So his godfather decided to give the ten-year-old an early Christmas present – by building a private rink of his own. Robert Vickers spent £15,000 putting the 5m (16ft) by 11m (36ft) practice area in the garden of Kieran’s home. Mr Vickers, 61, a sales director of a plastics company, used a large gazebo to hide the construction work and told his godson they were building a garage. When it was ready they blindfolded Kieran before revealing the surprise. Mr Vickers said: ‘When we took it off, his face was a picture. He couldn’t grasp what he was seeing at first. He kept repeating, “I’ve got my own private ice rink, haven’t I”? 'There were tears in his eyes as he tried to take it all in. Until then, didn’t have a clue it was even possible. 'Now when he has friends over, they don’t spend time on the Xbox. They get out on the ice and have a skate on the rink, because you can walk straight out onto it from the house. 'Now the Christmas holidays have arrived, we will really be making the most of it.' Mr Vickers said he was inspired to build the rink by his own son who is bound to a wheelchair because of muscle dystrophy. 'Having a son in a wheelchair has made me realise that you have to do what you can for kids while you are here. 'Once today is gone, it will never come back. I simply get a buzz out of seeing kids and smiling while they are being so active. I’m happy if Kieran and his friends are happy,' he added. The all-weather rink is made of specially treated white plastic tiles and is '85 per cent' like skating on ice, the family said. And having a practice area at his home in Nuthall, Nottingham, has already paid off for Kieran, who plays for the Nottingham Tiger Cubs. His skating skills have improved so much he has been picked for several team trials. Ten-year-old Kieran and his friends have been making good use of the rink now that the school holidays have started, his godfather said. Kieran with his godfather Robert Vickers who said he was happy to gift him the ice rink for Christmas. Mr Vickers, who fears skating is becoming a lost skill as town centre rinks dwindle, said: ‘Now he can practise for hours after school, instead of travelling seven miles to the nearest municipal rink.’ Another mother keen for her children to master the art of skating built her children a rink in Southport. Emma Brain, a special needs teacher, unveiled the back-garden rink to her three children last week. The 43-year-old said: 'I drew the curtains back, and unveiled the rink. 'As you can imagine there was a lot of screaming. They couldn’t wait to get their skates on and get straight out onto the ice.’ Managing Director of Dundee-based company Home Ice Rink, which installs the small rinks in back gardens said the trend for home entertainment is growing. 'Household mini rinks are getting more popular each year, especially at Christmas time when parents want to give their kids something special. ‘Some of our customers have converted their basements, set up a mini hockey rink in their front gardens, or put just a few tiles on the decking in the yard. ‘They have all sorts of reasons for installing them – as unique gifts for children, somewhere to practice ice dancing, or just something fun for their kids to play on when friends pop over. When you have an ice rink at home, the door bell never stops ringing.’ What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article is about a godfather, Robert Vickers, who built a private ice rink in the garden of his 10-year-old godson, Kieran Chung, as a surprise Christmas gift.
