Captain James Cook  (7 November 1728 - 14 February 1779) was a British explorer, navigator, cartographer, and captain in the Royal Navy. Cook made detailed maps of Newfoundland prior to making three voyages to the Pacific Ocean, during which he achieved the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands, and the first recorded circumnavigation of New Zealand. Cook joined the British merchant navy as a teenager and joined the Royal Navy in 1755. He saw action in the Seven Years' War, and subsequently surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the Saint Lawrence River during the siege of Quebec. During the Seven Years' War, Cook served in North America as master aboard the fourth-rate Navy vessel HMS Pembroke. With others in Pembroke's crew, he took part in the major amphibious assault that captured the Fortress of Louisbourg from the French in 1758, and in the siege of Quebec City in 1759. Throughout his service he demonstrated a talent for surveying and cartography, and was responsible for mapping much of the entrance to the Saint Lawrence River during the siege, thus allowing General Wolfe to make his famous stealth attack during the 1759 Battle of the Plains of Abraham.  Cook's surveying ability was also put to use in mapping the jagged coast of Newfoundland in the 1760s, aboard HMS Grenville. He surveyed the north-west stretch in 1763 and 1764, the south coast between the Burin Peninsula and Cape Ray in 1765 and 1766, and the west coast in 1767. At this time Cook employed local pilots to point out the \\"rocks and hidden dangers\\" along the south and west coasts. During the 1765 season, four pilots were engaged at a daily pay of 4 shillings each: John Beck for the coast west of \\"Great St Lawrence\\", Morgan Snook for Fortune Bay, John Dawson for Connaigre and Hermitage Bay, and John Peck for the \\"Bay of Despair\\".  His five seasons in Newfoundland produced the first large-scale and accurate maps of the island's coasts and were the first scientific, large scale, hydrographic surveys to use precise triangulation to establish land outlines. They also gave Cook his mastery of practical surveying, achieved under often adverse conditions, and brought him to the attention of the Admiralty and Royal Society at a crucial moment both in his career and in the direction of British overseas discovery. Cook's map would be used into the 20th century--copies of it being referenced by those sailing Newfoundland's waters for 200 years.  Following on from his exertions in Newfoundland, it was at this time that Cook wrote that he intended to go not only \\"farther than any man has been before me, but as far as I think it is possible for a man to go\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he find newfoundland?","output":"Captain James Cook did not discover Newfoundland, but he did create detailed and accurate maps of the island's coasts.

Question: Article: A Battery's Nightmare Portable electronics that can be carried about easily are only as good as their batteries   and, let's face it, batteries aren't very good, especially when compared with, say, petrol, which packs 100 times a battery's energy into an equal space. That's why a large group of mechanical engineers (centered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but with partners at other universities and companies) are hard at work in an effort to replace batteries with a tiny engine that runs on fuel. Imagine a battery-free life! When the fuel runs out in your mobile phone, you just fill up and go. The engine---about the size of a ten-cent coin---starts with a combustion chamber   that burns hydrogen. Its tiny parts are etched   onto silicon wafers   in the same manner that computer parts are etched onto integrated circuits  . The first engine is made up of five wafers. And since these wafers could be produced in much the same way as computer chips, they could probably be produced quite cheaply. But the _ in all this nice detail is efficiency. Tiny engine parts don't always behave like the bigger parts of the first engine. Something between the parts can slow down the works, according to Columbia University Professor LucFrechette, one of the engine's designers. Extreme heat from the combustion chamber is also a problem, often leaking to other parts of the engine. The scientists' goal is to create an engine that will operate 10 times better than batteries operate. Frechette says that a complete system, with all parts in place and working, will be set up in the next couple of years, but commercial models aren't likely until at least the end of the next ten years. Question: According to the passage, the title suggests that   _   . Yes or no, is the answer \\"the time of batteries will be gone forever\\"?

However, it does not definitively claim that batteries will be gone forever. The commercial models of this engine are not expected for at least another ten years, and even then, it does not guarantee the complete disappearance of batteries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Established on May 26, 1948, just after the declaration of the state of Israel, the IDF was formed by consolidating existing paramilitary organizations such as the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi.  The main aim of the Israel Defense Forces is to protect Israel's sovereignty, maintain internal security, and deter potential adversaries. The IDF operates under the Israeli Ministry of Defense and is headed by the Chief of the General Staff, who is appointed by the Prime Minister. The IDF is known for its mandatory military conscription, which applies equally to men and women, making it one of the few countries in the world with mandatory military service for both genders. Men serve for a period of 32 months, whereas women serve for 24 months. However, certain exemptions do exist based on religious, medical, or other reasons. The IDF is structured into five main branches: 1. The Israeli Ground Forces - This branch is responsible for infantry units, armored corps, artillery, and combat engineering units. It is the largest branch of the IDF and plays a pivotal role in defending Israel against land-based threats. 2. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) - The IAF is responsible for aerial defense, air support, surveillance, and maintaining Israel's strategic and tactical airpower. They operate a wide range of advanced aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and missile systems. 3.

Text: Double jeopardy is a procedural defence that prevents an accused person from being tried again on the same (or similar) charges and on the same facts, following a valid acquittal or conviction. As described by the U.S. Supreme Court in its unanimous decision one of its earliest cases dealing with double jeopardy, \`\`the prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy; and the accused, whether convicted or acquitted, is equally put in jeopardy at the first trial.'' Question: can you go to court for the same thing twice?","output":"No, you cannot be tried in court for the same thing twice under the legal principle of double jeopardy. Double jeopardy is a procedural defense that safeguards an individual from facing trial again on the same or similar charges, as well as the same set of facts, after a valid acquittal or conviction. This protection is rooted in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states that no person shall \\"be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\\" Similar principles are upheld in other legal systems globally as well. The purpose behind the double jeopardy principle is to protect an individual from the possible abuse of power by the state, as well as to maintain the integrity of the judicial system. It ensures that a person cannot be prosecuted repeatedly, thereby increasing the chances of an unjust outcome, and preventing the state from utilizing its potentially unlimited resources to harass and oppress an individual. Moreover, double jeopardy allows for legal closure and fosters the finality of judgments. However, some exceptions to the double jeopardy prohibition exist. For instance, charges may be brought again if new and compelling evidence emerges. Additionally, if it is discovered that the previous trial had been plagued by errors or misconduct, a new trial may be valid. In such cases, the courts will examine the specific circumstances closely to determine whether trying the same individual for the same offense again would constitute double jeopardy. Furthermore, the double jeopardy protection does not extend to separate sovereigns. This means that if a person is acquitted or convicted at the state level, they may still be tried for the same offense at the federal level, or vice versa. Similarly, if a person is acquitted or convicted in one country, double jeopardy does not protect them from being tried for the same offense in another country. It is important to note that double jeopardy only applies to criminal proceedings. In civil cases, a person may be sued for the same incident by multiple parties. For example, if a driver is involved in an accident and harms several people, each person can file a civil lawsuit against that driver for damages. Additionally, a person may be tried in criminal court for an offense and then be sued in civil court for the same act, as is the case in wrongful death cases or other tort actions. In summary, under the principle of double jeopardy, you cannot be tried in court for the same thing twice, provided that the initial trial resulted in a valid acquittal or conviction. This protection exists to prevent state abuse, maintain the integrity of the judicial system, and ensure legal closure for those involved. Nonetheless, exceptions do exist, and double jeopardy does not extend to separate sovereigns or civil proceedings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The \\"penis-showing game\\" is the focus of the crew's entertainment -- a game which consists of the male workers showing each other their genitalia in various different shapes and forms. If the other player looks, he gets one or more kicks in the ass.

Q: What two layers is the skin made of?    Choices:  - respiration and dermis  - layers and dermis  - Blood and dermis  - epidermis and dermis  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"- epidermis and dermis The skin, which is the largest organ in the human body, is primarily composed of two main layers: the epidermis and the dermis. These two layers serve different functions and have unique structures. 1. Epidermis: The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin and serves as the body's first line of defense against the external environment. It consists mainly of keratinocytes, which are cells responsible for producing a protein called keratin. Keratin provides strength and protection to the skin. The epidermis can be further divided into five sub-layers, including:    a. Stratum basale: The deepest layer of the epidermis, where new cells are generated through cell division.    b. Stratum spinosum: A layer of cells responsible for producing keratin and providing strength to the epidermis.    c. Stratum granulosum: A layer of cells that produce lipids and proteins and help form a water-repellent barrier.    d. Stratum lucidum: A thin transparent layer found only in the thick skin of the palms and soles.    e. Stratum corneum: The outermost layer, consisting of dead, flattened cells filled with keratin, which continually slough off and are replaced by new cells. In addition to keratinocytes, the epidermis also contains melanocytes, which produce melanin (the pigment responsible for skin color), and Langerhans cells, which play a role in the immune response. 2. Dermis: The dermis is the layer of skin located beneath the epidermis. It is thicker than the epidermis and provides support and structure to the skin. The dermis consists of connective tissue, primarily composed of collagen and elastin fibers, which provide strength and elasticity. The dermis can be divided into two main sub-layers, including:    a. Papillary dermis: The upper layer, containing thin collagen fibers and numerous blood vessels, nerve endings, and sensory receptors. This layer also forms dermal papillae, which are finger-like projections that extend into the epidermis, increasing the surface area for enhanced nutrient exchange and mechanical support.    b. Reticular dermis: The deeper, thicker layer of the dermis, composed of dense connective tissue with larger collagen and elastin fibers, providing strength and resistance to force. The dermis houses various important structures such as hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and blood vessels. It also contains fibroblasts, which are responsible for producing and maintaining the extracellular matrix, and immune cells such as mast cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes. In summary, the skin is composed of two main layers, the epidermis and the dermis, which work together to protect the body, regulate temperature, provide sensation, and maintain hydration and flexibility."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Premise: \\"So I just thought I'd go out, said Red.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I thought I'd go outside, said Red.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"So I just thought I'd go out, said Red\\" is true, we can analyze whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I thought I'd go outside, said Red\\" by examining the components of each statement and their logical implications. The entailment should hold only if the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise's truth.  In the given premise, there are three main components: 1. The subject, \\"Red\\" 2. The action, \\"thought\\" 3. The intention, \\"I'd go out\\" In the hypothesis, we also have three main components: 1. The subject, \\"Red\\" 2. The action, \\"thought\\" 3. The intention, \\"I'd go outside\\" To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we should consider the differences between these components and explore the implications of these differences. The subject and action components are identical in both the premise and the hypothesis, so these do not create any logical divergence. The only distinction between the premise and the hypothesis lies in their intentions: \\"I'd go out\\" vs. \\"I'd go outside.\\" To better understand the relationship between these intentions, we should assess their meanings and the context in which they might be used. \\"I'd go out\\" could mean a variety of things depending on the context. It may refer to going outside, going to a social event, leaving the house, or simply being engaged in an activity away from home. It is a somewhat ambiguous expression, as it could encompass multiple interpretations, and the exact nature of the action might not be clear without additional information. \\"I'd go outside,\\" on the other hand, is more specific in its meaning. This phrase explicitly refers to the physical act of moving from an indoors area to an outdoors area. It does not have the same level of ambiguity as \\"I'd go out.\\" Given these differences in meaning, we can now determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise, \\"So I just thought I'd go out, said Red,\\" suggests that Red had a thought about going out, which could include several interpretations, such as going outside, attending an event, or going to another location. The truth of the premise does not require or specify any particular meaning for \\"going out.\\"  The hypothesis, \\"I thought I'd go outside, said Red,\\" narrows down the intention of \\"going out\\" to specifically mean \\"going outside.\\" While the hypothesis is not inconsistent with the premise, and it is actually one possible interpretation of it, the premise's truth does not necessitate the hypothesis's truth. The entailment does not hold in this case, as the hypothesis specifies a particular interpretation of \\"going out\\" that might not be the only interpretation of the phrase in the premise. In conclusion, even though the hypothesis \\"I thought I'd go outside, said Red\\" is a plausible interpretation of the premise \\"So I just thought I'd go out, said Red,\\" it is not entailed by the premise. The premise's truth does not necessarily imply the truth of the hypothesis due to the ambiguity of the phrase \\"I'd go out\\" and the more specific meaning of \\"I'd go outside\\" in the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council arrived in Saudi Arabia Monday for a meeting to discuss transforming their six nations into a union similar to the European Union. The idea of integrating the GCC nations into one entity -- and replacing what exists now as simply a cooperative -- was first floated by Saudi Arabia in December. Monday's meeting in Riyadh will lay out the timetable for it. The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. \\"The threats of all kinds require the hard works of the GCC countries to shift from a current formula of cooperation to a union formula acceptable to the six countries,\\" Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal said last month.

In this climate comes the GCC move to form a union, aimed at strengthening and solidifying the relationship between the member nations and better positioning them to confront various regional challenges. The push to unite under a single entity could create a strong regional bloc designed to address economic, political, and security concerns that have arisen due to ongoing tensions and rivalries in the area. Forming a union modeled after the European Union would instigate deeper integration among member nations, facilitating greater coordination and cooperation in various sectors, including trade, investment, energy, and foreign policy. This would create a more stable environment for promoting economic growth and prosperity for all, ensuring a level playing field for businesses and investors from across the region. The ambitious endeavor would also serve to enhance their combined military capabilities in confronting potential security threats, such as terrorism, cyber-attacks, and foreign aggression. This would enable the GCC states to pool resources in defense, intelligence, and crisis management, thereby ensuring greater security and stability for the region as a whole. Another advantage of a union would be the ability to present a united front in international relations, with a single voice and a unified strategy when it comes to dealing with other nations and regional organizations. This would increase the GCC's influence and leverage on the world stage, allowing them to better advocate for their interests and promote peace and stability in the Middle East. However, forming a union is not without challenges, as each member nation has its unique domestic political makeup, economic model, and priorities. A successful transition from cooperation to a full-fledged union will require finding common ground and establishing shared goals, while still respecting each nation's sovereignty and unique characteristics. Moreover, regional rivalries and tensions, notably with Iran or other non-GCC nations, may pose a hurdle to the process, potentially complicating efforts to achieve the desired level of unity. It will be crucial for the GCC countries to navigate these obstacles with caution and diplomacy, seeking ways to mitigate tensions and avoid exacerbating existing conflicts while pursuing their goal of a union. In conclusion, the GCC move to form a union represents a significant stride towards a more integrated, secure, and prosperous region.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Who meets at Starbucks?, using the article: Kenya McQueen is a successful, single African American woman who has sacrificed romance in order to pursue a career as a certified public accountant. Her obsessive compulsive desire for perfection and control has manifested itself in the bland, monochromatic decor of her new home and the rigid rules she follows in her personal life. Urged to loosen up by her friends, Kenya accepts a blind date with landscape architect Brian Kelly arranged by her co-worker Leah Cahan, who is in the process of planning the kind of wedding Kenya wants herself. The two meet at Starbucks, and she is surprised to discover Brian is white. She quickly excuses herself and leaves. The two unexpectedly meet again at a party at Leah's parents' home, where Brian landscaped the grounds. Impressed with his work, Kenya decides to hire him to renovate her unkempt backyard garden. As time passes, their employer-employee relationship evolves into a friendship and then love. Although Brian is helping her feel more comfortable about her living environment, Kenya finds it difficult to dismiss her reservations about their romance. The opinions of her girlfriends Cheryl, Nedra, and Suzette, her upper class parents Joyce and Edmond, and her womanizing younger brother Nelson begin to have a deleterious effect and Brian's unwillingness to discuss issues of color drives them apart., what would be the answer ?

Question: Article: There are many different kinds of parrots. Some are quite big. Others are small. Many people like them because they often have beautiful colours, and because they can \\"talk\\". No one knows why parrots can talk. Most birds cannot talk. Some people say that parrots can talk because they have big, thick   tongues  . But some other birds that can talk do not have big, thick tongues, and some birds that cannot talk have big, thick tongues. Parrots do not usually know what they are saying when they talk. They are only making sounds. However, they know when to say some words, such as \\"Hello\\" and \\"Goodbye\\", and they usually know and can say people's names. Most parrots come from hot countries, but they can live anywhere. Question: Can all the birds talk? Yes or no, is the answer \\"No, most birds can't talk.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"No, most birds can't talk.\\" While parrots are known for their ability to mimic speech, most birds are not capable of talking in the same way. In the article, it is mentioned that the reason why parrots can talk is not well-understood and cannot be solely attributed to their big, thick tongues. Furthermore, other birds with similar tongues cannot necessarily talk, and some that can talk do not have big, thick tongues. Parrots, when they talk, are only making sounds by mimicking the words and phrases they hear. They generally do not understand the meaning of the words they are saying. Despite this, they often know when to say certain words, like \\"Hello\\" and \\"Goodbye,\\" and they can recognize and say people's names. It's important to note that the ability to talk is not a common trait among birds. Most birds communicate through various sounds, such as songs and calls, which serve different purposes in their lives, such as attracting mates, defending territories, or warning others of potential threats. While parrots are known for their talking abilities and vibrant colors, they represent only a small portion of the diverse avian world. Therefore, the statement \\"No, most birds can't talk\\" holds true, as the majority of bird species do not possess the ability to mimic human speech."},{"instruction":"Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"What produces less heat when cooking?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints.

Given this review: \\"Not bad since it's still an old version\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend? Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? A:","output":"Based on the review, \\"Not bad since it's still an old version,\\" I would recommend the app to a friend with the response, \\"Maybe.\\" Here's a detailed explanation of my recommendation: 1. Noteworthy aspects of the review: The reviewer is implying that the app is not bad, despite being an older version. This indicates that the app has some value and use. However, the fact that it's an older version may also mean that it lacks features, updates, or improvements that can be found in newer versions or alternatives. 2. Context consideration: Before recommending the app, it's important to take into consideration the context in which your friend will be using the app and its relevance to their needs. If your friend is looking for basic functionality and is not concerned about having the latest features, then this app may suit their requirements. On the other hand, if they value a polished user experience and up-to-date features, it might be worth exploring newer alternatives. 3. Potential risks: Since the app is an older version, it may no longer receive updates or support from the developers. This could result in compatibility issues with newer devices or operating systems, as well as potential security concerns. These risks should be weighed against the benefits of using the app. 4. Comparison with alternatives: Before making a definite recommendation, it's important to consider other app options in the market. There may be newer and better apps available that offer more features, improved usability, or ongoing support. Researching and comparing alternatives can help determine if this older version is still worth recommending or if a newer competitor would be better suited. Overall, given the \\"not bad\\" assessment of the app and accounting for the positive and negative aspects mentioned above, it seems reasonable to recommend the app as a \\"Maybe\\" to a friend. This suggests that, while the app might be suitable for some users, it may not be the best choice for everyone, so it's essential to carefully assess its relevance and effectiveness for individual needs before deciding whether to use it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. After the end of the story, the author probably: Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. not enough information  B. doesn't try to accept criticism at work  C. tries to accept criticism at work  D. argues about criticism when given it at work A:","output":"C. tries to accept criticism at work The author recognizes the value of feedback and failure and outlines a guide for embracing it as a means for self-improvement and growth.

This suggests that they make an effort to accept criticism at their workplace, thus option C is the most accurate answer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) (Associated Press)      NEW YORK (AP) — \\"Dear Evan Hansen,\\" the touching, heartfelt musical about young outsiders, has won the biggest theater popularity contest — winning the best new musical trophy at the Tony Awards along with five other statuettes, including best score, book and top actor honors for Ben Platt.      The show came into the night as the second-leading Tony nominee but ended up on top, with a revival of \\"Hello, Dolly!\\" starring Bette Midler next with four Tonys. \\"Oslo,\\" a three-hour meditation on diplomacy, was named best play.      Midler took the best actress trophy and — to the amusement and cheers of the audience — refused to be played off, forcing the swelling orchestra into silence. \\"This has the ability to lift your spirits in these terrible, terrible times,\\" she said of her show.      \\"Dear Evan Hansen\\" came into the night behind \\"Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812\\" with 12 nominations, but that musical which dramatizes a 70-page slice of Leo Tolstoy's \\"War and Peace\\" stalled after winning just two technical awards earlier, for best set and lighting.      Instead, the night belonged to \\"Dear Evan Hansen,\\" a show that centers on a profoundly lonely 17-year-old who fabricates a prior friendship with a classmate who has just committed suicide.      Platt thanked his cast mates, crew and family, calling his parents his heroes. He had this inspiring message to young people out there: \\"The things that make you strange are the things that make you powerful.\\"      Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who recently won Oscars for the song \\"City of Stars\\" from the movie \\"La La Land,\\" added to a remarkable year by earning Tonys for best score for writing the songs for \\"Dear Evan Hansen.\\"      Moments later, the show's story writer, Steven Levenson, won the Tony for best book, and Alex Lacamoire earned one for best orchestations. Rachel Bay Jones won her first Tony for her work in the musical, capping a long career onstage with plenty of zigs and zags.      Cynthia Nixon won her second Tony, this time for her work in Lillian Hellman's \\"The Little Foxes.\\" Nixon, the \\"Sex and the City\\" star, struck a defiant political tone, saluting those who refuse to stand around and watch bad things happen in the world.      Kevin Kline won his third Tony Award playing an egomaniacal matinee idol in the midst of personal turmoil in the play \\"Present Laughter.\\" He thanked, among others, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Andy Blankenbuehler won his second choreography Tony in as many years — last year for \\"Hamilton\\" and this time for \\"Bandstand.\\"      Laurie Metcalf won her first Tony, winning best actress honors in \\"A Doll's House, Part 2.\\" She won three Emmy Awards for her role as Jackie Harris on \\"Roseanne\\" and thanked her children. Rebecca Taichman won best directing play honors for \\"Indecent.\\"      \\"Am I dreaming? Is this some kind of crazy dream?\\" she asked.      Kevin Spacey kicked off his first-ever Tony Award hosting gig with grace and self-deprecating wit, dancing, singing and joking his way through an opening number that linked all four best new musical nominees and doing his best Glenn Close impersonation.      Spacey, who was named Tony host after several other celebrities turned down the job, laughed at himself in the 10-minute opening song, in which he gradually grew comfortable with hosting duties despite what he fears will be nasty tweets crashing down.      The telecast opened on a mournful host dressed like the title character in \\"Dear Evan Hansen\\" — complete with arm cast — before he soon showed up in a bed to mock \\"Groundhog Day The Musical\\" with an assist with Stephen Colbert, and then donning a fake beard as if he was in \\"Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812.\\" He went on to do impersonations of former President Bill Clinton and Johnny Carson.      The show's comedy had zings for Democrats and Republicans alike, with Colbert mocking President Donald Trump as if he were a show from Washington with bad hair and makeup that will be \\"closing early\\" due to poor reviews. Spacey, as Clinton, joked about his wife's fake email accounts.      In an attempt to shake up the show, producers asked the Rockettes back on a Tony stage after 13 years and asked all four playwrights nominated for best play Tonys appear to present their works.      The Rockettes had their own number and got to dance with the cast of \\"Come From Away,\\" a feel-good Canadian musical set against the horror of 9/11. It earned Christopher Ashley the Tony for best direction of a musical. He dedicated it to 9/11 first responders and all those who were generous on that terrible day.      Spacey even had fun with rumors about his sexual orientation while singing the Andrew Lloyd Webber song \\"As If We Never Said Goodbye\\" from \\"Sunset Boulevard.\\" Spacey, dressed as Close, sang \\"I'm coming out...\\" and then paused, tantalizingly. \\"Of makeup...\\"      Then Spacey led a line of high-kicking, tap dancers in a top hat, a white tie, tuxedo and a cane. \\"I'm Broadway bound,\\" he sang. \\"Your next host is found.\\" After the hectic number, he requested that his cardiologist be nearby.      The year after \\"Hamilton\\" took many prizes, Spacey jokingly pointed out that the subjects on Broadway this season included infidelity, suicide, greed, 9/11 and economic upheaval. His Frank Underwood from \\"House of Cards\\" made a late appearance, striding onto the stage with his TV wife played by Robin Wright. Later, he and Patti LuPone closed the show with a lovely duet of \\"The Curtain Falls\\" by Bobby Darin, a role he played onscreen.      Other winners included August Wilson's \\"Jitney,\\" which drove away with the Tony for best play revival. Gavin Creel won his first Tony for featured actor in a musical in \\"Hello, Dolly!\\"      There were no technical or human snafus — other than Midler's elongated speech — that marred previous awards shows this year, including the wrong winner announced at the Oscars and sound issues at the Grammys. Spacey talked about the show's accountants and said: \\"You guys do not have to worry about them tonight, at all,\\" he said.      ___      Online: http://www.tonyawards.com      ___      Mark Kennedy can be reached at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits ||||| JUMP TO CATEGORY: Best Play Best Musical Best Revival of a Play Best Revival of a Musical Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Play Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Play Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Musical Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Role in a Play Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Role in a Play Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Role in a Musical Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Role in a Musical Best Book of a Musical Best Original Score (Music and/or Lyrics) Written for the Theatre Best Scenic Design of a Play Best Scenic Design of a Musical Best Costume Design of a Play Best Costume Design of a Musical Best Lighting Design of a Play Best Lighting Design of a Musical Best Sound Design of a Play Best Sound Design of a Musical Best Direction of a Play Best Direction of a Musical Best Choreography Best Orchestrations Special Tony AwardÂ® for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre Regional Theatre Tony Award Isabelle Stevenson Tony Award Special Tony Award Tony Honors for Excellence in the Theatre |||||Summary:","output":"\\"Dear Evan Hansen\\" is a musical about a lonely 17-year-old who pretends to be friends with a classmate who has just committed suicide.

Article: In spring, you may have seen white foam  on a green tree or other plants. As a matter of fact, the foam is where young spittlebugs  live. These insects are protected by the foam, and they usually don't do much harm to the plants. As we all know, in late summer, a mother spittlebug lays her eggs on the plant. The babies will hatch  in spring. After they come to the new world, they begin to eat juice from the plant. The babies eat more juice than their bodies need for food. The extra juice mixes with a special waste that the spittlebugs produce. When this fluid  is released, it mixes with the air, forming bubbly foam. What is so great about having a foam home? The space inside is so wet that it can keep the bugs' soft bodies from drying out. And the foam tastes bad, so it keeps away most animals that would eat the bugs. Some birds will reach their heads through the foam to find the bugs. Wasps and ants might eat them, too. But most of the bugs stay safe inside the foam. Once the bugs have grown into adults, they stop making foam. They leave their homes and jump from plant to plant in search of food. The adults look a little like tiny frogs. For this reason they are also called froghoppers. If you see some foam on a plant, you might want to take a careful look inside. Gently push some of the foam aside with a small stick. Deep inside you may see a few insects eating plant juice. They might also be making more foam. Be sure to push the foam back after a moment to cover the insects and keep them safe. Soon the spittlebugs will grow up and leave their foam home. They will join the other insects in the grassland. Question: After the spittlebugs grow into adults, they  _  .

I had no clue who she was, but I thought she was a year younger than me. That’s why I thought it was weird that she said my name. But the “nice sweatshirt” bit was what really got me. I wasn’t even wearing my sweatshirt. So. There was a substitute teacher in my literacy class, so my class was split. half of us did actual work, and the other half watched a documentary. Ben, Evan, Isabelle and myself were put together in the class watching the super boring documentary. We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don’t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine. This turned into everyone swapping sweatshirts for the next hour until school was out. At one point I was called to the office to deliver a message to a different classroom. I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name. “Hey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!” I smiled and thanked her like the nice human being I want people to think I am. Once she started down the stairs I looked down at my sweatshirt. Black and orange? Nike? But my sweatshirt’s gray and purple! Then I remembered our little game of “try not to get caught swapping sweatshirts and giggling”. I wasn’t wearing my sweatshirt. Someone else had it.

Translate to Romanian","output":"Analizând situația de la Geneva, nu pot decât să afirm că Conferința Organizației Mondiale a Comerțului nu și-a îndeplinit sarcina. În cadrul conferinței de la Geneva, reprezentanții Organizației Mondiale a Comerțului trebuiau să abordeze o serie de probleme și provocări cu care se confruntă comerțul internațional și economiile globale. Cu toate acestea, având în vedere rezultatele sub așteptări și lipsa de progres în discuții, se poate deduce că această conferință nu și-a îndeplinit misiunea. Unele dintre aspectele importante ce ar fi trebuit discutate în cadrul conferinței au inclus, printre altele: 1. Creșterea și susținerea liberului schimb: Acesta este unul dintre pilonii centrali ai organizației, iar conferința ar fi trebuit să se concentreze pe găsirea modalităților de a continua să încurajeze cooperarea comercială între țări. În schimb, s-au înregistrat numeroase tensiuni și dezbateri, fără a se ajunge la un consens clar. 2. Reducerea barierelor comerciale: De-a lungul anilor, Organizația Mondială a Comerțului a fost criticate pentru că nu a luat măsuri suficiente în reducerea barierelor comerciale, în special subvenții și taxe de import. Conferința ar fi trebuit să discute și să abordeze aceste probleme într-o manieră concretă. 3. Soluționarea disputelor comerciale: Un alt aspect-cheie al conferinței trebuia să implice identificarea de soluții eficiente pentru soluționarea conflictelor comerciale care pot apărea între țările membre ale organizației. Acest lucru ar fi trebuit să implice discuții privind îmbunătățirea mecanismelor existente și implementarea unor noi mecanisme, dacă este necesar. 4. Integrarea țărilor în curs de dezvoltare în sistemul comercial global: Creșterea incluzivă a economiilor emergente și a țărilor în curs de dezvoltare este esențială pentru un comerț global just și echilibrat. Conferința ar fi trebuit să se concentreze pe identificarea modalităților de a facilita acest proces și de a aborda problemele specifice cu care se confruntă aceste țări. 5. Progresul în negocierile comerțului multilateral: Progresul în această zonă a fost lent, iar Conferința de la Geneva ar fi trebuit să încerce să avanseze acest proces. Cu toate acestea, negocierile s-au dovedit a fi dificile și s-au înregistrat puține avansări notabile. În concluzie, deși conferința Organizației Mondiale a Comerțului de la Geneva a avut rolul de a adresa și rezolva problemele cu care se confruntă comerțul internațional și economiile globale, aceasta nu a reușit să atingă obiectivele propuse și să creeze un impact semnificativ în aceste domenii."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the parents care about their children whether they made many friends,what matters is that the child is comfortable and happy with his friends. Parents need to understand the steps children take in building friendships. First of all, be a friend to your child. Good friendships start at home. Children begin to develop the necessary ability to go out and meet others through getting with their parents. Greet the child warmly and let him know you are glad to see him. Children learn a lot from how their parents stay with them and other people. Teach children how to solve conflicts . Being able to work out conflicts is an important skill in getting along with others. If parents know the children have a conflict, let them work it out on their own. Only step in if it is really necessary, for example, an argument is getting physical. Give children chances to practice staying together. Have children play games that require team work and group problem solving skills. For example, races are fun and provide plenty of practice in teamwork. \\"In what ways didn't you work well together? What might you do differently next time?\\" For these ideas, see books such as Games Book by Terry Orlick, Energizers by Carol Apacki, and Team-Building Activities for Every Group by Alanna Jones.

Allan David Bloom (September 14, 1930 - October 7, 1992) was an American philosopher, classicist, and academician. He studied under David Grene, Leo Strauss, Richard McKeon, and Alexandre Kojeve. He subsequently taught at Cornell University, the University of Toronto, Yale University, Ecole Normale Superieure of Paris, and the University of Chicago. Bloom championed the idea of Great Books education and became famous for his criticism of contemporary American higher education, with his views being expressed in his bestselling 1987 book, The Closing of the American Mind. Allan Bloom was born in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1930 to second-generation Jewish parents who were both social workers. The couple had a daughter, Lucille, two years earlier. As a thirteen-year-old, Bloom read a Readers Digest article about the University of Chicago and told his parents he wanted to attend; his parents thought it was unreasonable and did not encourage his hopes. Yet, when his family moved to Chicago in 1944, his parents met a psychiatrist and family friend whose son was enrolled in the University of Chicago's humanities program for gifted students. In 1946, Bloom was accepted to the same program, starting his degree at the age of fifteen, and spending the next decade of his life enrolled at the University in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood. This began his lifelong passion for the 'idea' of the university.  In the preface to Giants and Dwarfs: Essays, 1960-1990, he stated that his education \\"began with Freud and ended with Plato\\". The theme of this education was self-knowledge, or self-discovery--an idea that Bloom would later write, seemed impossible to conceive of for a Midwestern American boy. He credits Leo Strauss as the teacher who made this endeavor possible for him.  Bloom graduated from the University of Chicago with his Bachelor's Degree at the age of 18. One of his college classmates was the classicist Seth Benardete. For post-graduate studies, he enrolled in the University of Chicago's Committee on Social Thought, where he was assigned Classicist David Grene as tutor, and went on to write his thesis on Isocrates. Grene recalled Bloom as an energetic and humorous student completely dedicated to studying classics, but with no definite career ambitions. The Committee was a unique interdisciplinary program that attracted a small number of students due to its rigorous academic requirements and lack of clear employment opportunities after graduation. Bloom earned his Ph.D. from the Committee on Social Thought in 1955. He subsequently studied under the influential Hegelian philosopher Alexandre Kojeve in Paris, whose lectures Bloom would later introduce to the English-speaking world. While teaching philosophy at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, he befriended Raymond Aron, amongst many other philosophers. Among the American expatriate community in Paris his friends included leftist writer Susan Sontag.

It is a lot easier to consume ginger than turmeric because the","output":"flavor profile of ginger is more palatable for most people. The process to incorporate ginger into different dishes or beverages is relatively straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you effortlessly use ginger in your daily life: Step 1: Choose fresh ginger Selecting high-quality, fresh ginger is crucial in maximizing its flavor and potential health benefits. Look for firm, smooth, and blemish-free skin, with a pleasant ginger aroma. Step 2: Store the ginger properly To preserve its freshness, store ginger in a cool, dark place, like the crisper drawer of your refrigerator. Place it in a resealable plastic bag or an airtight container to keep moisture away. Step 3: Prepare the ginger for use Before incorporating ginger into any recipe, carefully wash its exterior using cold water to remove dirt and debris. Then, peel off the skin using a spoon, vegetable peeler, or by simply scraping it off with the edge of a knife. Step 4: Grate or slice the ginger Depending on your preference and the specific dish, grate or finely mince the ginger to make it easier to incorporate into recipes. For beverages or recipes requiring larger pieces, slice the ginger into thin rounds or julienned strips. Step 5: Add ginger to recipes Ginger can be easily added to a variety of dishes, such as stir-fries, soups, and sauces. It pairs well with a range of flavors, from sweet to savory, and can be used in both cooked and raw recipes. It also lends itself well to being infused into beverages, like teas, smoothies, and cocktails. Step 6: Experiment with ginger's versatility Discover new and creative ways to use ginger by exploring its compatibility with different ingredients and cuisines, such as adding it to marinades, salad dressings, or even baking recipes. Ginger's versatility allows for endless possibilities in the kitchen. In contrast, turmeric has a more earthy and bitter taste, which may require a more careful balancing of flavors and a bit more effort to find the correct combinations.

To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 55. d = (-110) / 55 Step 3: Solve for d Now, divide -110 by 55. -110 / 55 = -2 So, the solution for d is -2. And the final equation is: d = -2"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Question: Two colleagues gave blood for an emergency. Ned got infected with HIV because they re-used a needle. His friend Nate was not infected.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which colleague had a virus that is transmitted by sexual contact?  Hint: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981. For further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) web site at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/ . Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the colleague who got infected with a virus that is transmitted by sexual contact is Ned. He got infected with HIV, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which is known to be transmitted not only through sexual contact but also through contact with infected bodily fluids like blood.

Limp Bizkit formed in 1995 in Jacksonville, Florida. The band has sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide. Can we draw the following conclusion? Limp Bizkit was formed more than 5,475 days ago.","output":"To determine if we can draw the conclusion that Limp Bizkit was formed more than 5,475 days ago, we can do the following calculations: 1. We know that Limp Bizkit formed in 1995, so let's find out the days passed between 1995 to today. 2. Obtain the current year, for example, if the current year is 2022, this means that 2022 - 1995 = 27 years have passed since the band was formed. 3. Calculate the number of days that have passed: - A year has, on average, 365.25 days (considering leap years), so:   27 years * 365.25 days/year ≈ 9,861.75 days 4. Compare the approximate days since Limp Bizkit was formed to the desired value (5,475 days): - 9,861.75 days > 5,475 days From this calculation, we can conclude that Limp Bizkit was formed more than 5,475 days ago."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While Veeck was growing up in Hinsdale, Illinois, his father, William Veeck Sr., became president of the Chicago Cubs. Veeck Sr. was a local sports writer who wrote several columns about how he would have run the Cubs differently, and the team's owner, William Wrigley Jr., took him up on it. While growing up, the younger Veeck worked as a popcorn vendor for the Cubs. Context: Veeck had been a fan of the Negro Leagues since his early teens. He had also admired Abe Saperstein's Harlem Globetrotters basketball team, which was based in Chicago. Saperstein saved Veeck from financial disaster early on in Milwaukee by giving him the right to promote the Globetrotters in the upper Midwest in the winter of 1941-42.  In the fall of 1942, Veeck met with Gerry Nugent, president of the Philadelphia Phillies, to discuss the possibility of buying the struggling National League team. He later wrote in his memoirs that he intended to buy the Phillies and stock the team's roster with stars from the Negro Leagues. Veeck quickly secured financing to buy the Phillies, and agreed in principle to buy the team from Nugent. While on his way to Philadelphia to close on the purchase, Veeck decided to alert MLB Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis of his intentions. Although Veeck knew Landis was an ardent segregationist, he did not believe Landis would dare say black players were unwelcome while blacks were fighting in World War II. By the time he arrived in Philadelphia, Veeck discovered the Phillies had been officially taken over by the National League and that a new owner was being sought (the Phillies were ultimately sold to lumber baron William D. Cox).  The authors of a controversial article in the 1998 issue of SABR's The National Pastime argued that Veeck invented the story of buying the Phillies and filling their roster with Negro leaguers, claiming Philadelphia's black press made no mention of a prospective sale to Veeck. Subsequently, the article was strongly challenged by the late historian Jules Tygiel, who refuted it point-by-point in an article in the 2006 issue of SABR's The Baseball Research Journal, and in an appendix, entitled \\"Did Bill Veeck Lie About His Plan to Purchase the '43 Phillies?\\", published in Paul Dickson's biography, Bill Veeck: Baseball's Greatest Maverick. Joseph Thomas Moore wrote in his biography of Doby, \\"Bill Veeck planned to buy the Philadelphia Phillies with the as yet unannounced intention of breaking that color line.\\" Question: What happened later with the Phillies?. Whats the answer?","output":"After Bill Veeck's attempt to purchase the Philadelphia Phillies fell through, the National League took over the team and eventually sold it to lumber baron William D. Cox in 1943. Cox's tenure as owner was short-lived, lasting only until November of that year, when he was banned from baseball for life by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis for betting on his own team. Following Cox's departure, the Phillies were sold to a partnership headed by Robert R.M. Carpenter Sr., a wealthy businessman and heir to the DuPont chemical fortune. It wasn't until 1947 that the color barrier was finally broken in Major League Baseball (MLB) by Jackie Robinson, who was signed by Branch Rickey for the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Phillies themselves did not integrate until 1957, when they signed John Irvin Kennedy as their first Black player. Under Carpenter's ownership, the Phillies enjoyed varying levels of success. The team clinched the National League pennant in 1950 but lost the World Series to the New York Yankees. The Phillies experienced a period of struggle between the mid-1950s and mid-1970s, with only occasional winning seasons, before finally winning their first World Series championship in 1980. Over the following decades, the Phillies experienced ups and downs, including a second World Series victory in 2008. Throughout their history, the Phillies have seen a number of talented players, both Black and white, wear their uniform and contribute to the team's legacy. In summary, after Bill Veeck's ambitious plan to purchase the Philadelphia Phillies and integrate the team with stars from the Negro Leagues failed to materialize, the Phillies went through multiple ownership and management changes. The team eventually integrated years after the color barrier was initially broken in MLB, and they have since experienced both triumphs and struggles on the field. Veeck's visionary plan, though never realized with the Phillies, remains an important moment in baseball history and an indicator of the eventual push for integration within the sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: WHO CONDUCTS ORCHESTRA FOR HIS FORMER STUDENTS? Title: Mr. Holland's Opus Movie plot: In 1965, Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a professional musician and composer who has been relatively successful in the exhausting life of a musician. However, in an attempt to enjoy more free time with his young wife, Iris (Glenne Headly), and to enable him to compose a piece of orchestral music, the 30-year-old Holland accepts a high school teaching position. Unfortunately for Holland, he is soon forced to realize that his position as a music teacher makes him a marginalized figure in the faculty's hierarchy. Many of his colleagues, and some in the school's administration, including the school's principal (Olympia Dukakis) and vice principal (William H. Macy), resent Holland and question the value and importance of music education given the school's strained budget. However, he quickly begins to win many of his colleagues over. In the classroom, Holland finds success utilizing rock and roll as a way to make classical music more accessible to his students. Gradually, stubbornly, he begins to see his students as individuals and begins finding ways to help them excel. When Iris becomes pregnant, Holland uses the money saved up to produce his orchestration in order to buy a house. Their son Cole is born during the summer following his first year as a teacher. When school resumes, Holland is put in charge of the school marching band. The school's football coach Bill (Jay Thomas) helps him in exchange for allowing an academically challenged football player/wrestler named Louis Russ (Terrence Howard) to play the drums for academic credit so he can keep his spot on the wrestling team. At home, Holland's lack of quality time with his wife creates tension. When their son Cole is diagnosed as deaf, Holland reacts with hostility to the news that he can never teach the joys of music to his own child.

Translate to Romanian Romanian:","output":"Domnule Președinte, doamnelor și domnilor, acest Mecanism European de Stabilitate este necesar pentru a oferi garanții juridice de durată și pentru a garanta solidaritatea cu țările care întâmpină probleme, dar și pentru a asigura euro, a garanta disciplina bugetară necesară și pentru a permite un răspuns comun la provocările creșterii economice. Permiteți-mi să vă prezint ce înseamnă Mecanismul European de Stabilitate și de ce este important pentru Uniunea Europeană și statele membre. Mecanismul European de Stabilitate (MES) a fost creat în 2012 ca o instituție financiară internațională și o componentă esențială a răspunsului Uniunii Europene la criza datoriilor suverane din zona euro. Scopul său principal este de a asigura stabilitatea financiară și de a ajuta țările membre care se confruntă cu dificultăți financiare, oferindu-le sprijin financiar sub formă de împrumuturi, liniile de credit sau achiziționarea directă de obligațiuni guvernamentale pe piețele primare și secundare. Acest mecanism este esențial pentru a se asigura că statele membre ale UE respectă regulile stricte în ceea ce privește gestionarea bugetelor publice și reducerea deficitelor și a datoriilor publice. În acest fel, Mecanismul European de Stabilitate contribuie în mod direct la consolidarea uniunii economice și monetare, la prevenirea și combaterea crizelor, precum și la realizarea obiectivelor de creștere economică durabilă și de coeziune socială în cadrul Uniunii Europene. Solidaritatea între statele membre este o valoare fundamentală a proiectului european, iar MES asigură acest lucru prin punerea la dispoziție a resurselor necesare pentru a sprijini țările afectate de dificultăți financiare. În același timp, prin condiționarea acestui sprijin de aplicarea strictă a reformelor structurale și a măsurilor de consolidare fiscală, mecanismul asigură și menținerea disciplinei bugetare și responsabilității fiscale la nivelul statelor membre. Abordarea integrată a Mecanismului European de Stabilitate în ceea ce privește stabilitatea financiară, solidaritatea și promovarea creșterii economice este expresia angajamentului comun al statelor membre UE de a-și consolida eforturile în vederea unei uniuni economice și monetare mai puternice, mai stabile și mai durabile.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as they convey different information about the respective islands. To understand this, let's analyze the two sentences more closely. Sentence 1 talks about three Greek islands (Lesvos, Chios, and Samos) and highlights how they still have many vestiges of the traditional rural lifestyle that made them rich and coveted during previous centuries. This statement refers to the cultural and historical aspects of these islands, focusing on the preservation of their rural heritage. On the other hand, Sentence 2 specifically discusses Samos and its modern lifestyle that incorporates technology. While the first sentence mentioned that Samos has vestiges of a traditional rural lifestyle, the second sentence introduces an aspect not addressed in the first sentence. It implies that the island has also adapted to modernity and has embraced technological advancements in addition to its historical heritage. Thus, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as they provide distinct insights into the Samos island's past and present living conditions, showing that it has managed to maintain its cultural heritage while also evolving and incorporating modern elements.

Step 3: Compare the remaining options Now we are left with three options – cupboard, linen closet, and behind the bathroom door. Let's compare these options to find the most suitable answer. - Cupboard: A cupboard is a storage area, typically in kitchens or living areas, which may sometimes store towels, but it is not the most likely place to find a bathroom towel. - Linen closet: A linen closet is a storage area specifically meant for storing linens, which includes bathroom towels. It is, therefore, a reasonable and relevant place to find a bathroom towel. - Behind the bathroom door: While bathroom towels are often hung behind the bathroom door to dry or for ease of access, they are not generally stored there when not in use.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you only hear from her when she needs help with her homework or a project, or she needs a ride somewhere, but she doesn't have time to talk to you or she's always too busy to hang out, she might be manipulating you and not truly interested in you. Relationships go two ways--one person should not always be giving or doing things for the other person and get nothing in return. While this means you two are close and she has genuine affection for you, it's unlikely she sees you as anything beyond a good friend. Saying you think of someone as a sibling is basically removing any romantic possibilities from the equation. Even if there's not a chance for romance, a girl who describes you this way definitely values your presence in her life. If you can hardly get a word in because she's talking about what she was doing last weekend, her plans for winter break, then gossiping about her friend, and she has yet to ask about your weekend, she's probably more into herself than she's into you.  If you know all the details of her life but she struggles to remember even the most basic things about you, she's likely not interested in you, but she's probably not a very good friend, either.

Does the answer correctly answer the question Select from:  +yes  +no","output":"+yes The Mayflower set sail from Southampton in 1620. The ship, which played an integral role in American history, transported a group of English settlers known as the Pilgrim Fathers to the New World. These individuals were seeking religious freedom and a fresh start away from persecution in England. The Mayflower embarked on its historic journey from Southampton, England, to the shores of Plymouth, Massachusetts, in present-day United States. Before setting off on this transatlantic voyage, the Pilgrims experienced a myriad of setbacks. Initially, their plan involved two ships: the Mayflower and the Speedwell. However, the Speedwell experienced leaks and required repairs, forcing the passengers to condense their numbers and resources onto the Mayflower. As a result, this caused delays in their departure schedule. In September 1620, the Mayflower finally embarked on its lengthy 66-day journey with approximately 102 passengers and 30 crew members on board. The passengers, nicknamed the Pilgrim Fathers or simply the Pilgrims, faced several issues during the voyage, including harsh storms, limited food and water supplies, and cramped living quarters. Upon arrival in Cape Cod on November 11, 1620, the Pilgrims signed a political agreement known as the Mayflower Compact, which established a system of self-governance for their new colony. Subsequently, they anchored at Plymouth Harbor in December 1620 and began establishing a settlement that would later become Plymouth Colony. The Mayflower's 1620 journey from Southampton to Plymouth marked the beginning of European settlement in North America, laying the foundation for the United States' rich history, traditions, and values."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere. Her hair, cut short and spiky, was dyed a magenta so bright it nearly glowed. She wore a tight black t-shirt, baggy olive drab shorts that hung on shapely hips, and heavy black boots with two inch thick soles. She had a faded black messenger bag slung across her chest, the strap pressing between her breasts. If Paul had to guess, she wasn't wearing a bra. She definitely wasn't your average Silicon Valley techie on an early lunch break, and certainly not a restaurant employee. Question: Who wanted revenge on his partners?

Here is the step-by-step process to wear a seatbelt properly: 1. First, locate the seatbelt buckle and the latch plate. The buckle is generally attached to the seat or the side panel of the car, while the latch plate is on the other side. 2. Grasp the latch plate, and firmly pull it across your body. 3. Position the lap portion of the seatbelt across your hips and thighs, ensuring that it is snug but comfortable. This position will allow the restraint system to protect the pelvic bones in case of an accident. 4.

Finally, securely insert the latch plate into the buckle. Listen for a \\"click\\" sound that indicates that the seatbelt is properly fastened. 6.

This further reinforces the negative sentiment expressed in the review. 3. Problem with Quality: The customer also mentions how they read about the product having \\"hit or miss quality,\\" suggesting that the product's consistency in manufacturing is unreliable. This indicates that the customer may have encountered quality control issues, which contributed to their negative experience and, therefore, a negative review. 4.

Answer: Option (III) No Explanation: To examine whether the hypothesis that dual-role transvestism is a disease holds true, we need to look at the context and understand the diagnostic categorization. The context refers to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which is a diagnostic tool for organizing and categorizing different medical conditions. The ICD-10 presents a classification system in which \\"dual-role transvestism\\" is included. However, the inclusion of this term in the ICD-10 does not necessarily mean that it is considered a \\"disease.\\" The ICD-10 itself is a tool for organizing and categorizing numerous health problems and conditions, not solely diseases. The term \\"disease\\" generally refers to a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of an organism and is not the result of any immediate external injury. Diseases can be caused by factors such as pathogens, genetic mutations, or other internal dysfunctions. In the case of dual-role transvestism, it is described as a formal diagnosis used by psychologists and physicians to characterize people exhibiting specific behaviors. It is important to note that while this condition may be considered a psychological or medical classification, it does not necessarily meet the criteria of being a disease. Key factors include that dual-role transvestism does not inherently cause harm or dysfunction to the individual and is not a consequence of a pathogen, genetic mutation, or other internal factors. Instead, it describes a behavioral pattern of wearing the opposite sex's clothes temporarily without a sexual motive or seeking gender reassignment surgery. As the context does not present dual-role transvestism as an abnormal condition leading to harm or functional impairment, we must conclude that the hypothesis \\"dual-role transvestism is a disease\\" is not accurate. Instead, as the context presents it, dual-role transvestism is a formal diagnosis and a classification under the ICD-10 system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article based on this summary: Sandwiches and salads are returning to the menus at a cash-strapped hospital trust after it found a new supplier.","output":"Title: Cash-Strapped Hospital Trust Finds New Supplier, Breathes Life Back Into Sandwiches and Salads Introduction In a welcome turn of events for a cash-strapped hospital trust, sandwiches and salads are making a return on the hospital menu after the trust was successful in securing a new supplier. This act not only brings back variety to the menu but also demonstrates the trust's commitment to providing healthy and nutritious meal options for patients, visitors, and staff. This article takes a closer look at this development and its impact on the hospital trust and the people it caters to. Background to the Situation The removal of sandwiches and salads from the hospital's menu was a result of the financial struggles the trust had to deal with. As funds became limited, the hospital trust had no choice but to cut back on certain aspects of its operations to stay afloat. One major casualty of this cost-cutting was the diversity of the food menu. With the hospital finding it difficult to source affordable, fresh, and healthy ingredients to make sandwiches and salads, these items gradually disappeared from the menu. The absence of salads and sandwiches on the menu led to widespread dissatisfaction amongst patients, visitors, and staff, given their popularity as light, healthy, and convenient meal options. Restrictions such as these can take a toll on the morale of everyone involved, and further exacerbate the financial challenges faced by the hospital trust. The New Supplier In light of the concerns and dissatisfaction, the hospital trust began searching for a new supplier that could meet their requirements at a more affordable price. After an extensive search, the trust finally found a supplier that fit the bill, allowing them to reintroduce sandwiches and salads to the hospital menu. The resumption of salads and sandwiches is significant for several reasons: 1. Nutritional Potential: Salads and sandwiches offer a wide range of nutritional benefits. They can incorporate various fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains, making them an ideal choice for a balanced and healthy diet. The return of salads and sandwiches ensures that patients, visitors and staff can enjoy meals that cater to their nutritional needs. 2. Meal Variety: The lack of sandwiches and salads had significantly limited the meal options available at the hospital. Hospital food can often be the subject of scrutiny and complaints, so providing variety in the menu is a simple way to bolster morale and satisfaction. The introduction of these items now ensures that there is greater variety available to everyone within the hospital premises. 3. Convenience: Sandwiches, in particular, are an ideal food choice for the hospital environment, as they can be quickly and easily consumed. Visitors and staff, often pressed for time, will undoubtedly appreciate the convenience of having sandwiches back on the menu. 4. Cost-Effectiveness: Having secured a new supplier, the hospital trust will now be able to serve sandwiches and salads at a reasonable price to their patients, visitors, and staff. This will help manage costs more efficiently while ensuring that quality and variety are maintained. Conclusion The hospital trust's efforts in securing a new supplier to reintroduce salads and sandwiches to the menu underscores their commitment to offering nutritious meals and enhanced meal choices to cater to the needs of their patients, visitors, and staff. It is evident that the availability of these meal options can have a tremendously positive impact on the morale of the hospital community. As the cash-strapped hospital trust moves forward and continues to navigate through its financial challenges, their focus on maintaining diversity and quality in their food offerings will go a long way in maintaining the satisfaction of all those who depend on them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a step-by-step guide to a detailed and lengthy method to prepare Jello from a box: 1. Gather supplies and ingredients:    - Jello powder (1 box, choose your desired flavor)    - Water (the box will specify the amount needed, typically 2 cups boiling water and 2 cups cold water)    - A mixing bowl    - A whisk or fork    - A measuring cup    - A heatproof container (for boiling water)    - A mold or serving dish (8-inch square pan, loaf pan, or individual cups) 2. Prepare the work surface:    - Clean your kitchen counter/work surface and get rid of any clutter.    - Gather all your tools and ingredients and place them within easy reach. 3. Boil water:    - Measure the boiling water amount (typically 2 cups) using the measuring cup.    - In a heatproof container, either using a water kettle, stovetop pot, or microwave-safe container, heat the water until it reaches a rolling boil. 4. Mix Jello powder and boiling water:    - Open the box and pour the Jello powder into the mixing bowl.    - Slowly pour the 2 cups of boiling water into the mixing bowl with the Jello powder.    - Gently whisk the mixture with your whisk or fork, stirring continuously until the Jello powder has dissolved completely. This usually takes about 2 minutes. 5. Add cold water and chill the Jello:    - Measure out the cold water amount (typically 2 cups) using a separate measuring cup.    - Slowly pour the cold water into the mixing bowl with the dissolved Jello, while continuously stirring.    - Mix the Jello and cold water thoroughly until well combined. 6. Transfer the Jello mixture to the mold or serving dish:    - Carefully pour the Jello mixture from the mixing bowl into your desired mold or serving dish.

Is the premise \\"Three workers unloading flowers from a large truck.\\" true if \\"The movers are loading furniture.\\"?","output":"The premise \\"Three workers unloading flowers from a large truck\\" cannot be considered true if \\"The movers are loading furniture,\\" since the actions and objects described in the two statements do not have any direct connection. To begin with, the first scenario focuses on three workers who are unloading flowers, which might suggest that the situation possibly involves a delivery to a florist, event, or some other location that requires flowers. They are also specified to be working with a large truck, which further implies that this could be a substantial shipment or a commercial transaction. In contrast, the second statement is about movers who are loading furniture. Here, we are introduced to a new set of characters – the movers – who are performing a different task from the workers in the first statement. Their primary objective involves furniture and not flowers. This task is typically linked to moving services and helping people with the relocation of their belongings during a residential or office move. Thus, since these two statements describe distinct actions and involve various items (i.e., flowers and furniture), it is impossible to conclude that the premise \\"Three workers unloading flowers from a large truck\\" is true based on the information provided in the sentence \\"The movers are loading furniture.\\" The situations remain separate and unrelated, making it inappropriate to determine the truth of one premise based on the other."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this \\"Pharmacies can provide new NHS support and care for people with minor illnesses as part of a plan to free up GPs' time.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The New Frontier of NHS Support: Pharmacies Expanding Care for Minor Illnesses Introduction The National Health Service (NHS) has long been the cornerstone of medical care in the UK, offering a wide range of services to millions of people annually. However, with increasing pressures on General Practitioners (GPs) and healthcare providers to meet the growing demand for consultations and treatment, the NHS is unveiling strategies to optimize its resources. One of these changes involves utilizing the expertise of local pharmacies to provide care and support for people with minor illnesses, thereby freeing up GPs' time for more pressing cases. Expanding Roles of Pharmacies in Healthcare Traditionally, pharmacies have been seen as a place to receive prescriptions or seek advice on medication-related issues. However, with the new NHS plan, the role of the pharmacist is set to evolve significantly. As front-line healthcare providers with extensive knowledge of common illnesses, pharmacists are ideally positioned to provide consultations and treatment recommendations for minor health complaints. These minor illnesses can include, but are not limited to, colds, coughs, sore throats, seasonal allergies, and mild skin conditions. By redirecting non-urgent patients to local pharmacies, GPs will be able to focus on more serious and complex cases that require their specialized knowledge and expertise. Benefits of the New Pharmacy Model for Patients The new initiative has many potential benefits for patients. Firstly, the ease of access to high-quality healthcare services is vital for the well-being of the community. Pharmacies are typically more widespread and have extended operating hours compared to GP surgeries, which means greater convenience for people who need assistance or advice after regular working hours. Secondly, one of the key factors contributing to long waiting times for GP appointments is the high volume of people seeking advice for minor ailments. By seeking consultation and treatment for these conditions at their local pharmacy, patients will receive prompt attention and faster access to the appropriate medications, where needed. Thirdly, many pharmacies are now offering additional services such as vaccination, advice on smoking cessation, and weight management. These services can support patients in managing their overall health and potentially minimize the need for GP intervention. Enhanced Training for Pharmacists To ensure the success of this new NHS plan and to provide the highest level of care, pharmacists must be well-prepared and educated about the latest healthcare developments. Many universities and institutions already offer advanced training programs for pharmacists, covering topics such as minor ailment consultations and non-prescription medication recommendations. Additionally, ongoing professional development will be crucial to ensure pharmacists remain up-to-date with ever-changing medical knowledge and guidelines. To this end, the NHS will likely need to invest in resources and training programs to ensure the efficient implementation of this new model. Potential Challenges While the new NHS plan represents an exciting opportunity for growth within the pharmacy sector, it is not without its challenges. Firstly, the cultural shift required for patients to accept pharmacists as primary caregivers for minor illnesses may take some time. Education and marketing campaigns will be needed to raise awareness of the capabilities and benefits of accessing pharmacy care for these conditions. Secondly, ensuring that all pharmacies are equipped to handle the increased workload and demand for services will be vital. This may involve investing in additional staff, technology, or other resources to ensure the seamless transition and provision of high-quality care. Conclusion Expanding the role of pharmacies in the care and support of patients with minor illnesses is an innovative approach to address the growing demands on the NHS and its healthcare providers. By empowering pharmacists to play a more significant role in primary care, the NHS can provide the faster and more comprehensive support that patients need while allowing GPs to focus their time on more complex cases. With the appropriate investments in education and infrastructure, this new model holds great promise for the future of healthcare in the UK."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: It could mean the potential merger between the company and the German steel producer, ThyssenKrupp is more likely to move forward. The Â£15bn British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) has been a significant barrier to any agreement. Tata has been in negotiations with pension regulators and trustees of the scheme. A deal was done between unions and the company that would see reduced benefits for current employees, but the decision would affect all members of the pension scheme including those already retired. Other similar pension agreements have seen the companies involved pay money into the fund as well as giving a stake in the ongoing business to the new pension providers. About 6,250 people are employed by Tata Steel across Wales, including 3,500 in Port Talbot. Tata Steel UK has offered to pay Â£550m into its now-closed pension scheme and give the fund a 33% stake in its UK business. It means Tata would no longer have any responsibility for the pension scheme. This pension arrangement is only available to companies that would not be able to continue trading without the change. Who are ThyssenKrupp? Nearly three quarters of union members backed the new pensions deal earlier this year. A Tata Steel spokesman said parties involved in pensions talks were in \\"positive discussions and we are hopeful of reaching a final agreement shortly\\". The pensions regulator refused to be drawn on any speculation. It said progress was being made and an official announcement would be made in due course. A spokesperson for the steel trade unions said: \\"If accurate, we welcome this development which will lead to certainty for scheme members following a year of unprecedented turmoil. \\"Our members will now expect the trustees to provide all the information necessary to enable them to make the right decision for them and their families.\\" Pensions expert Stuart Price, partner with Quantum Advisory, said a deal has been done with a new pension scheme being set up, with better benefits than a \\"worse case scenario\\" of members relying on the safety net of the pension protection fund (PPF). \\"Tata Steel will continue to sponsor the scheme and will stand behind it and pay in more money if needed to keep the scheme well funded,\\" he said. \\"Going forward, members will be worse off than if the British Steel pension scheme had stayed in place but it's better than the alternative with the PPF.\\"","output":"Tata Steel UK has reportedly offered to invest £550m (710m) into its now-closed pension scheme, the British Steel Pension Scheme, which covers 6,250 employees, and give the fund a 33% stake in its business.

What is the title of this article: The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.

Please answer the following question: Background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  Paragraph: When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team had a higher likelihood of their can exploding? Answer:","output":"Team A had a higher likelihood of their can exploding. This prediction is based on the principle of the kinetic-molecular theory mentioned in the background information. The theory explains that as the can heats up from the campfire, the air inside the rigid soup can acquires more kinetic energy. As a result, the air molecules start to move faster, colliding more frequently and with a stronger force against the interior walls of the can. This increase in kinetic activity builds up pressure inside the can. If the can is not vented, there are no means for this pressure to escape.  An additional element adding to this danger is the liquid soup inside the can. When heated, the soup begins to boil, turning into gas. This phase transition creates even more pressure within the confined space of the can. The added pressure from the boiling soup further boosts the internal pressure level.  The sum of these effects can easily result in a pressure that exceeds the structural capacity of the can to contain it. Eventually, this intense internal pressure might lead to the can exploding. If unvented, as in the case with Team A, the pressure has nowhere to go but to force its way out by rupturing the walls of the can.  On the other hand, Team B vented their can before heating it. This means they created an outlet for the pressure to escape, moderating the level of pressure that could build up inside the can. Consequently, the pressure never reaches the point where it would be likely to cause an explosion, since the kinetic energy of the heated air and steam generated from boiling soup can dissipate through the vent hole. Therefore, it's safe to conclude that Team A's unvented can of soup was more likely to explode when heated over a campfire compared to Team B's vented can."},{"instruction":"Q:You are given a new situation: Nicholas works in pest control, and needs to have a steady supply of nitrogen gas for his tools.

The critical words in this sentence are: 1. Different components: This phrase is the main subject of the sentence. It refers to the various ingredients or elements that are required to create the dish in question. By using \\"different,\\" the sentence emphasizes that there is a diverse range of elements, which adds complexity to the overall process of making the dish.  2. Need: The word \\"need\\" indicates a necessity or a requirement. In this context, it conveys that the components must be combined for the dish to be successful. Without this word, the sentence simply depicts a description of various components coming together, whereas \\"need\\" adds a sense of urgency, implying that the process is crucial for the dish's outcome. 3. Come together: This phrase describes the action that the different components must undergo. It means that the ingredients, or parts, must be combined or assembled in some way to create the final dish. This is an essential part of the sentence, as it explains what needs to be done with the components: they cannot remain separate if the dish is to be completed. 4. For this dish: These words provide context and specific reference to the recipe or meal in question. By stating \\"for this dish,\\" the sentence highlights that the need for the different components to come together is particularly relevant to the dish being discussed. Without this phrase, the sentence may be interpreted more broadly and could refer to any dish, diluting the statement's effectiveness. In summary, the most important words in the sentence are \\"different components,\\" \\"need,\\" \\"come together,\\" and \\"for this dish,\\" as they collectively explain the core message of the complexity and necessity of combining various elements to create a specific dish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The State of Alabama has experienced extensive drainage system due to expansion of farmlands. Their neighboring state Florida had similar system. But recently Florida had dismantled many of their drainage systems, mostly because of pressure from different environmental groups.  Would Alabama have stable or declining waterfowl species?  Hint: Ecologically, the expansion of drainage systems has had tremendous negative effects. Hundreds of thousands of wetland species experienced significant population declines as their habitat was increasingly fragmented and destroyed. Although market hunting within the Central Flyway was a contributing factor in the decline of many waterfowl species' numbers in the early decades of the twentieth century, loss of breeding habitat to agricultural expansion is certainly the most significant. Early maps of midwestern states depict many lakes and marshes that are either nonexistent or significantly reduced in area today. Channelization, a related process of concentrating and facilitating the flow of water from agricultural areas, also contributed to this degradation. Answer:","output":"Given the information provided and considering the ecological impact of drainage systems on wetland habitats, the state of Alabama would likely experience declining waterfowl species populations. The expansion of drainage systems, as a result of farmland expansion, has led to significant negative effects on wetland habitats. This, in turn, has caused population declines for numerous species dependent on these habitats, including waterfowl. The loss of breeding habitat due to agricultural expansion has been identified as the most significant factor contributing to the decline of waterfowl species numbers. Additionally, the process of channelization, which involves concentrating and facilitating the flow of water from agricultural areas, further contributes to the degradation of wetland habitats and reductions in waterfowl populations. While Florida has taken steps to dismantle many of their drainage systems in response to pressure from environmental groups, Alabama still has extensive drainage systems in place.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Sexual selection is a mode of natural selection where members of one biological sex choose mates of the other sex to mate with (intersexual selection), and compete with members of the same sex for access to members of the opposite sex (intrasexual selection). These two forms of selection mean that some individuals have better reproductive success than others within a population, either from being more attractive or preferring more attractive partners to produce offspring. For instance in the breeding season sexual selection in frogs occurs with the males first gathering at the water's edge and making their mating calls: croaking. The females then arrive and choose the males with the deepest croaks and best territories. Generalizing, males benefit from frequent mating and monopolizing access to a group of fertile females. Females have a limited number of offspring they can have and they maximize the return on the energy they invest in reproduction.  - Tamil Nadu (English pronunciation:  ; \\"\\"; : ; literally 'The Land of Tamils' or 'Tamil Country') is one of the 29 states of India. Its capital and largest city is Chennai (formerly known as Madras). Tamil Nadu lies in the southernmost part of the Indian Peninsula and is bordered by the union territory of Puducherry and the South Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. It is bounded by the Eastern Ghats on the north, by the Nilgiri, the Anamalai Hills, and Kerala on the west, by the Bay of Bengal in the east, by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait on the southeast, and by the Indian Ocean on the south. The state shares a maritime border with the nation of Sri Lanka.  - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.  - Flower chafers are a group of scarab beetles, comprising the subfamily Cetoniinae. Many species are diurnal and visit flowers for pollen and nectar, or to browse on the petals. Some species also feed on fruit. The group is also called fruit and flower chafers, flower beetles and flower scarabs. There are around 4,000 species, many of them still undescribed.  - Nectar is a sugar-rich liquid produced by plants in glands called nectaries, either within the flowers with which it attracts pollinating animals, or by extrafloral nectaries, which provide a nutrient source to animal mutualists, which in turn provide antiherbivore protection. Common nectar-consuming pollinators include mosquitoes, hoverflies, wasps, bees, butterflies and moths, hummingbirds, and bats. Nectar plays an important role in the foraging economics and overall evolution of nectar-eating species; for example, nectar and its properties are responsible for the differential evolution of the African honey bee, \\"A. m. scutellata\\" and the western honey bee.  - Western Ghats (also known as Sahyadri meaning \\"The Benevolent Mountains\\") is a mountain range that runs parallel to the western coast of the Indian peninsula, located entirely in India. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the eight \\"hottest hot-spots\\" of biological diversity in the world. It is sometimes called the Great Escarpment of India. The range runs north to south along the western edge of the Deccan Plateau, and separates the plateau from a narrow coastal plain, called Konkan, along the Arabian Sea. A total of thirty nine properties including national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and reserve forests were designated as world heritage sites - twenty in Kerala, ten in Karnataka, five in Tamil Nadu and four in Maharashtra.  - The Arabian Sea is a region of the northern Indian Ocean bounded on the north by Pakistan and Iran, on the west by northeastern Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula, and on the east by India. Historically the sea has been known by other names including the Erythraean Sea and the Persian Sea. Its total area is and its maximum depth is . The Gulf of Aden is in the southwest, connecting the Arabian Sea to the Red Sea through the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, and the Gulf of Oman is in the northwest, connecting it to the Persian Gulf.  - Maharashtra (Marathi:  pronunciation: , abbr. MH) is a state in the western region of India and is India's third-largest state by area and is also the world's second-most populous sub-national entity. It has over 112 million inhabitants and its capital, Mumbai, has a population of approximately 18 million. Nagpur is Maharashtra's second capital as well as its winter capital. Maharashtra's business opportunities along with its potential to offer a higher standard of living attract migrants from all over India.  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - Narycius opalus is a flower chafer beetle that is endemic to the Western Ghats of India . It is the sole species in the genus . The adult male has a prominent projection on the head , while the female has a much shorter horn . This structure is probably the result of sexual selection , as in similar beetles . The adult beetle is shiny iridescent rose ranging to green , with intermediates . Dupont originally described the females as a separate species , named Narycius olivaceus , and Westwood later named the green color form as Narycius ( Cyphonocephalus ) smaragdulus . This beetle is about 2 to 2.5 cm long and 1.3 cm wide . The distinctive cephalic horns may be nearly two - thirds the length of the thorax and abdomen combined . The surface is matt and the elytra are minutely pitted along lines . The prothorax and scutellum have pits that are irregularly placed . The upper edges of the cephalic horn are nearly straight and parallel and the expand towards the end and the tips are inwardly curving . The prothorax is convex above and is broadest at the middle . The female has a much shorter cephalic horn . The species has been noted from Coorg , Wynaad , the Nilgiris and Travancore .  - A population is the number of all the organisms of the same group or species, which live in a particular geographical area, and have the capability of interbreeding.  - The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) based in Paris. Its declared purpose is to contribute to peace and security by promoting international collaboration through educational, scientific, and cultural reforms in order to increase universal respect for justice, the rule of law, and human rights along with fundamental freedom proclaimed in the United Nations Charter. It is the heir of the League of Nations' International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation.  - Karnataka (IPA:) is a state in south western region of India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the States Reorganisation Act. Originally known as the State of Mysore, it was renamed \\"Karnataka\\" in 1973. The capital and largest city is Bangalore (Bengaluru). Karnataka is bordered by the Arabian Sea and the Laccadive Sea to the west, Goa to the northwest, Maharashtra to the north, Telangana to the northeast, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the southeast, and Kerala to the southwest. The state covers an area of , or 5.83 percent of the total geographical area of India. It is the seventh largest Indian state by area. With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the eighth largest state by population, comprising 30 districts. Kannada, one of the classical languages of India, is the most widely spoken and official language of the state.  - Kerala, historically known as Keralam, is an Indian state in South India on the Malabar coast. It was formed on 1 November 1956 following the States Reorganisation Act by combining Malayalam-speaking regions. Spread over , it is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west. With 33,387,677 inhabitants as per the 2011 Census, Kerala is the thirteenth-largest state by population and is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.  - Pollen is a fine to coarse powdery substance comprising pollen grains which are male microgametophytes of seed plants, which produce male gametes (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat made of sporopollenin that protects the gametophytes during the process of their movement from the stamens to the pistil of flowering plants or from the male cone to the female cone of coniferous plants. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it germinates, producing a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule containing the female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called palynology and is highly useful in paleoecology, paleontology, archaeology, and forensics.

Passage:Of those Phillies, 97 have had surnames beginning with the letter R. Two of those players have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame: pitcher Eppa Rixey, who was a Phillie for six seasons in two different stints (1912–1917, 1919); and Robin Roberts, who won 20 games during the 1950 season as the ace pitcher of the Whiz Kids. The Hall of Fame lists the Phillies as Roberts' primary team; during his career, the right-hander won 234 games and lost 199, the latter one of his three franchise records. During his 14 seasons with the team, he pitched 3,739  innings and completed 272 games, both records; he also held the major league record for most career home runs allowed until it was broken in 2010.

Let's break down each component before providing a detailed answer. Premise: The same kind of thing The premise states that there is a situation, object, or event that is of the same type or category as another. It implies similarities or shared characteristics between the two entities being compared. This premise alone, however, does not provide enough information to determine specific details or nuances that might be relevant to assessing the veracity of the hypothesis. Hypothesis: It is the same kind of thing, so you should be used to it. The hypothesis suggests that because the situation, object, or event is the same kind of thing, one should be accustomed or familiar with it. This implies that past experiences with similar entities should have prepared someone for dealing with the current one. Options: 1. Yes 2. It is not possible to tell 3. No To determine whether the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, let's consider each option: 1. Yes If the premise \\"the same kind of thing\\" is true, it would make sense that the hypothesis suggesting that one should be used to it might also be true. This is because past experiences and encounters with similar entities might have allowed someone to develop a familiarity or comfort level in dealing with them. However, there are still factors that could possibly affect this conclusion, such as the individual's personal experiences, memory retention, or the specific context of the situation. 2.

Please briefly summarize this news article: A Pre-Thanksgiving Ritual: Cocktails, Catch-Ups and Maybe a Kiss There was a short line outside the Stumble Inn on 76th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan on Wednesday night. Women decked out in what seemed to be matching puffy coats huddled together under the bar’s overhang. Men wore Uniqlo flannel. There was an excited energy in the air, but it was not holiday spirit. It was the hope, perhaps, that before the clock would strike 4 a.m. and the Prince Charmings and Cinderellas would have to retreat home in cabs for turkey and pumpkin pie, they might ring in the holiday season with a night of debauchery and unapologetic fun. And by the way, if you thought that the first snowstorm of the year would keep young 20-somethings away from the bars on what is infamously referred to as the most insane party night of the year, you thought wrong. So wrong. Inside, Justin Timberlake’s “Sexy Back” played loudly, and Shamar, the doorman, inspected IDs (but gave only his first name for privacy reasons). He has been working this job for three years, so he believes he is pretty good at judging the scene. The night before Thanksgiving usually turns out a similar size crowd as a regular Friday or Saturday, he said, but the energy is better. “Everyone just wants to be merry tonight,” he said of the crowd. Merry they were. Packets of friends monopolized dark brown leather booths, a group of eight guys threw back shots of tequila by the beer pong table, two girlfriends shrieked and embraced upon seeing each other for the first time in months. Tabs were opened and kept open. ’Twas the night before Thanksgiving. Once again, it was a big bar night around the country for the post-collegiate and barely legal set — traveling to their hometowns for the holiday. For some, it was about finding an hourslong romance in a crowded bar of strangers. For others, the lure was striding into that one place that used to deny them entry when they were underage and seeing everyone they grew up with and having, finally, a compelling answer to the questions of “What are you up to these days?” For all, it was about the possibility of a tipsy, consequence-free kiss. By Thursday, these same revelers would be kicking back with relatives, avoiding conversations about politics and religion, wondering if crazy Aunt Judy would again ask when they were going to finally settle down. (She’s not going to be around forever, you know, and she would like to see at least one of her nieces or nephews get married.) There would be food, family and football. But first would come flirting. Sitting at a corner of the mahogany bar were Wendy Dallis and Richie O’Mahoney. If you had only a minute to study them, you would think they were in a long-term relationship. Mr. O’Mahoney’s hand rested on Ms. Dallis’s leg. Now and again, she leaned in close to make a joke, then tilted her head back in wild laughter. They seemed blissfully unaware of any others. Turns out, they had only met two nights earlier. Ms. Dallis, a singer in the band Ferrari Truck, told the story of girl-meets-boy. Or in this case, bartender: Mr. O’Mahoney, 33, works at the Gael Pub, which is about 10 blocks from the Stumble Inn. She had wandered there last Monday night after having had a few drinks while singing downtown at the Mercury Lounge. “I told him I was hungry, and he gave me olives, and I told him he had to make sure I got home that night,” she said. “He texted me the next morning asking if I wanted to hang out.” Ms. Dallis told Mr. O’Mahoney she would meet him at the Stumble Inn on Wednesday night. From that perch, they discussed meeting up on Thanksgiving, too. As they focused on their new connection, a dozen or so fraternity brothers waxed about their old days at the University of Pennsylvania. Meeting up for Thanksgiving Eve drinks is their annual tradition, said Lionel Anderson, 32, of Philadelphia. He and a group of his Alpha Phi Alpha friends have dinner at Dallas BBQ on 73rd Street and Third Avenue, and walk a few blocks up to the Stumble Inn. Mr. Anderson, now the assistant director of academic research at Haverford College, said he is the only one of the brothers who doesn’t live in New York City. But this pre-Thanksgiving event is a priority for him: “I haven’t missed a Thanksgiving Eve night out since 2001.” He reminisced about the years when they were younger and a little more carefree, he said, adding that those nights were crazier. Now, he said, “it’s about catching up with old friends over a drink or two, and getting nostalgic for our college days.” By now, R. Kelly’s “Ignition (Remix)” had begun to play. The song is an anthem of sorts for anyone who was in high school or college in the early aughts (which, on Wednesday night was most everyone). One young woman stood on her chair and started dancing and singing along, every lyric memorized. The crowd whooped in delight. A bit farther south on Second Avenue, a different crowd congregated at Turtle Bay, a renowned party bar not far from the Queensboro Bridge, it’s a favorite spot for those traveling from Long Island and New Jersey in search of a night of big-city fun. The scene at Turtle Bay was younger and a little rowdier. A steady rain and snow mix fell as a line zigged outside the door. Sean Paul’s 2005 hit “Get Busy” could be heard thumping from inside. The cover charge was 5 for women and 10 for men. The doorman granted entry at his leisure. A soggy pile of umbrellas accumulated on the ground inside. Hanging out by the bar, trying to catch the attention of the blond bartender were two buddies — Charles Gehnrich, a senior at SUNY Geneseo, and Steven Davies, a senior at Towson University in Maryland. The two 21-year-olds, childhood friends originally from Syosset, N.Y., were home for the holiday and ventured into the city for their first official “legal night out” on Thanksgiving Eve. They had chosen Turtle Bay because a friend of theirs had won a free happy hour for a small group. “I’m a broke college student!” Mr. Davies said, never diverting his eyes from one of the seven TV screens showing the Knicks game. “I’m just trying to get drunk, that’s it.” Then he looked away from the game, for just a moment. “But there should be more girls here,” he said. Indeed, Turtle Bay was heavy on the cheap drinks, including neon-colored tubes of alcohol being sold for 5 by an aggressive saleswoman who ported them about, cigarette-girl style. But the guy-to-gal ratio did not favor gentlemen looking to hook up with women. And the women who were there, weren’t digging the vibe. “This is so not my scene,” Trisha Barry, 24, yelled over the music. Her friend Kelsey Demsky, who would turn 24 at midnight, nodded her head in annoyed agreement. The women said they had been invited to the bar by a colleague at T. J. Maxx, who had told them he wanted to ring in Ms. Demsky’s birthday “the right way,” Ms. Demsky said, “whatever that means.” What they really wanted to do was head home to Brooklyn to prep for their Thanksgiving, which they would be spending Thursday afternoon together in their apartment in Bensonhurst. They did not want to drink too much. “We have to cook tomorrow,” Ms. Barry said. Back uptown at the Stumble Inn, Mr. O’Mahoney and Ms. Dallis grabbed their coats and prepared to leave together into the rainy night. It was a successful second date, they both said, and then Ms. Dallis hinted it might not yet be over. “We already kissed,” she said, grabbing his hand. “And I’m still here.” A version of this article appears in print on November 30, 2014, on page ST1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Night for Hookups.

În plus, pot exista și bariere tehnice și administrative care pot face dificilă participarea întreprinderilor din UE pe piețele de achiziții publice ale țărilor terțe. UE urmărește să faciliteze accesul pe piețele de achiziții publice ale țărilor terțe prin negocieri comerciale bilaterale și multilaterale. Aceste negocieri pot duce la încheierea unor acorduri comerciale care liberalizează piețele de achiziții publice și permit întreprinderilor din UE să participe într-un mod mai ușor și mai transparent la licitațiile publice din țările respective. Un exemplu în acest sens este Acordul privind Achizițiile Publice (GPA), care face parte din Organizația Mondială a Comerțului (WTO).

Pentru a aborda aceste provocări și pentru a sprijini întreprinderile în procesul de licitație, autoritățile din UE pot oferi asistență și resurse care să ajute la depășirea barierelor existente.

Any non-living matter that living things need is called a nutrient. Carbon and nitrogen are examples of nutrients. Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. You can see how in Figure 3.11. Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms. The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots. The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants. The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers. When living things die, the cycle repeats.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What do living things need?\\" is \\"Non-living matter\\"?","output":"Based on the given paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What do living things need?\\" would be both \\"non-living matter\\" and \\"energy.\\" Living things need non-living matter, such as nutrients like carbon and nitrogen, to build their bodies and carry out life processes.

Fortunately, the Texans would get a field goal of their own, with kicker Kris Brown getting a 32-yard field goal before halftime.  In the third quarter, Houston fell behind, as Mare kicked a 29-yard field goal for Miami.

Mario Williams recorded his first career sack and added a half sack one play later. Afterwards, Houston would have to hold off a late rally by Miami.  Mare kicked a 22-yard field goal, and later got a touchdown, as QB Daunte Culpepper threw a 16-yard strike to WR Chris Chambers.

In justifying this, it is stated in the given context that the heliometer works like a pinhole camera, using a small hole in one of the minor domes of the cathedral. This hole projects an image of the sun onto the floor at solar noon. A pinhole camera works on the principle of light travelling in straight lines.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Outside Spending Shows How Few of the House Races Are Competitive How small is the field of competitive House races? So narrow that just 25 contests account for 80 percent of all reported outside spending in the general election. The Cook Political Report rates 38 seats either as tossups or leaning toward one party or the other, but among groups operating outside the district like super PACs, the concentration is even tighter: Half of all independent spending reported to the Federal Election Commission for general election races has gone to just a dozen seats, with two apiece in Arizona and Illinois. Arizona’s First District, where the Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick faces the Republican Andy Tobin, has drawn more than 10 million in outside spending, almost all of it for negative messages against the two candidates. (It is not the most outside money ever reported in a House race — that distinction goes to Michigan’s Seventh District in 2010, when 12.4 million was spent.) Close behind is California’s Seventh District, where a freshman Democrat, Ami Bera, faces a former Republican congressman, Doug Ose. That race, which attracted more than 8 million in independent expenditures in 2012, has topped 9.6 million this year. Arizona’s Second District, where Ron Barber, a Democratic incumbent, is facing Martha McSally, a Republican and retired Air Force colonel, has attracted 9.5 million. Those three races alone represent 15 percent of all reported outside spending in House general elections. The focus is even tighter for the two national party committees devoted to House races and for super PACs with close ties to House leaders. A full 88 percent of the 137 million in independent spending in the general election has gone to 25 races from those groups — the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC on the left, and the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund on the right. The bulk of House contests have seen virtually no outside spending this year, with 193 having less than 10,000 spent. You could form a slim majority with the 220 races that have had less than 25,000 in independent spending for the general election. As with Senate races, most of the outside money spent in House contests goes to television advertising, with smaller amounts on direct mail, online ads and polling. About 82 percent of the outside spending in House races is on negative messages, in line with previous election cycles. Summary:","output":"In the current House races, competitiveness appears to be quite limited as only 25 contests account for 80% of all reported outside spending in the general election. The Cook Political Report rates 38 seats as tossups or leaning towards one party, however, the spending concentration is even more focused with half of all independent spending being directed to just 12 seats. This significant outside spending is mostly invested in negative messages against candidates, with races in Arizona, California, and Illinois receiving the most attention.

And I cannot believe that the","output":"sentence ends with such a significant announcement being made, highlighting the commitment of China and the other members of the six-party talks to find a peaceful resolution to the escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula. The six-party talks, which involve China, the United States, Russia, Japan, South Korea, and North Korea, have been a crucial platform for dialogue and negotiation aimed at resolving security concerns and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Although these talks have faced numerous challenges and setbacks over the years, they have accomplished some positive results such as cooling down periods of heightened tension between North Korea and its neighbors. In this particular instance, Wu Dawei's statement reflects the urgency felt by China and its commitment to regional stability. By proposing emergency consultations, China recognizes the importance of maintaining open communication channels among the involved nations to address the critical issues and to gather a consensus on how to diffuse the current situation. The mention of the talks taking place in early December shows that China realizes the need for swift action, aiming to prevent any further escalation of hostilities on the Korean peninsula. Furthermore, by inviting the heads of delegation from each participating country, China ensures that key decision-makers will be present for these vital discussions, increasing the likelihood of tangible and effective outcomes. The commitment to \\"strengthening communication among the parties, advancing denuclearization on the peninsula and safeguarding peace and stability on the peninsula and in northeast Asia\\" demonstrates that the biggest priority for these emergency consultations is to identify a diplomatic and peaceful solution to the growing tensions.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person that named the river that had cleanup efforts begin in the 1930s get a American Heritage River?  By the early 20th century, major river-control projects had begun to take place. Levees were constructed along the river in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on Cascade Range tributaries of the Willamette. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40 percent of the basin. Most of them do not have fish ladders.With development in and near the river came increased pollution. By the late 1930s, efforts to stem the pollution led to formation of a state sanitary board to oversee modest cleanup efforts. In the 1960s, Oregon Governor Tom McCall led a push for stronger pollution controls on the Willamette. In this, he was encouraged by Robert (Bob) Straub—the state treasurer and future Oregon governor (1975)—who first proposed a Willamette Greenway program during his 1966 gubernatorial campaign against McCall. The Oregon State Legislature established the program in 1967. Through it, state and local governments cooperated in creating or improving a system of parks, trails, and wildlife refuges along the river. In 1998, the Willamette became one of 14 rivers designated an American Heritage River by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. By 2007 the Greenway had grown to include more than 170 separate land parcels, including 10 state parks. Public uses of the river and land along its shores include camping, swimming, fishing, boating, hiking, bicycling, and wildlife viewing.In 2008, government agencies and the non-profit Willamette Riverkeeper organization designated the full length of the river as the Willamette River Water Trail. Four years later, the National Park Service added the Willamette water trail—expanded to 217 miles (349 km) to include some of the major tributaries—to its list of national water trails. The water-trail system is meant to protect and restore waterways in the United States and to enhance recreation on and near them.A 1991 agreement between the City of...

Jane Jacobs  (born Jane Butzner; May 4, 1916 - April 25, 2006) was an American-Canadian journalist, author, and activist who influenced urban studies, sociology, and economics. Her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961) argued that urban renewal did not respect the needs of city-dwellers. It also introduced the sociological concepts \\"eyes on the street\\" and \\"social capital\\". Jacobs organized grassroots efforts to protect neighborhoods from \\"slum clearance\\", in particular Robert Moses' plans to overhaul her own Greenwich Village neighborhood. In 1935, during the Great Depression, she moved to New York City with her sister Betty. Jane Butzner took an immediate liking to Manhattan's Greenwich Village, which did not conform to the city's grid structure. The sisters soon moved there from Brooklyn.  During her early years in the city, Jacobs held a variety of jobs working as a stenographer and freelance writer, writing about working districts in the city. These experiences, she later said, \\"... gave me more of a notion of what was going on in the city and what business was like, what work was like.\\" Her first job was for a trade magazine as a secretary, then an editor. She sold articles to the Sunday Herald Tribune, Cue magazine, and Vogue.  She studied at Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years, taking courses in geology, zoology, law, political science, and economics. About the freedom to pursue study across her wide-ranging interests, she said:  For the first time I liked school and for the first time I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the property of Barnard College at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not what I wanted to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.

Yamaha's Bradley Smith finished second amid changing weather that saw most riders forced to make two pit-stops. Honda's Scott Redding claimed his first podium finish in third, despite sliding into the gravel early on. All three capitalised after Valentino Rossi blew his chances with tactical errors and Jorge Lorenzo crashed out. The last time two Britons shared a podium in a premier-class grand prix was in Venezuela 36 years ago when Barry Sheene won the race and Irishman Tom Herron came third. Early rain proved crucial on Sunday, with Honda rider Marquez switching to slick tyres just as the Misano circuit started to dry. Championship leader Rossi and his army of home fans were left frustrated after he led with seven laps to go but left the switch from wet tyres to slicks until too late, which handed the race to Marquez. Rossi eventually finished fifth but thanks to Lorenzo's crash the 36-year-old still extended his championship lead to 23 points over his Yamaha team-mate. Marquez, who sits in third spot 63 points behind Rossi with five races to go, explained that problems caused by the weather were made more difficult by the recently re-laid track surface. The Spaniard added: \\"The asphalt is new here and very dark, so it was hard to tell if it was dry or wet. It was really difficult out there but we made the right decision with the tyres.\\" Smith was delighted to claim the second podium finish of his career after sticking with slick tyres at the right time. The 24-year-old said: \\"I kept telling myself that luck favours the brave, went with my instincts and it turned out to be a good day.\\" Redding rode a remarkable race after sliding into the dirt, only to get back up and push his bike back on the track. The 22-year-old said: \\"When I went into the gravel, the marshalls tried to hold me back but I was fighting to get on the track. \\"It was an incredible race and the adrenaline was through the roof.

Answer the following question: Former President Barack Obama unveiled plans for his future presidential library and museum on the south side of Chicago where he raised his family and launched his political career. The designs show a complex of modern buildings, with a library, museum and event center, plus a community garden, a children's play area and possibly an athletic field. \\"What we want this to be is the world-premiere institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world,\\" he told the crowd that included Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, his one-time chief of staff.

The museum, the tallest of the three buildings, will hold exhibition space, public spaces, offices and education and meeting rooms, according to the Obama Foundation. The forum and library buildings are intended to be used for study and foundation programming. Obama said his foundation, which is overseeing the project, is also looking into the possibility of locating a Chicago Public Library branch on the site. Obama said he envisioned recording studios where musicians could help young people work on music, and space for movie directors who could take on community storytelling. The center will also have exhibits with campaign memorabilia and personal artifacts. \\"Let's face it, we want to see Michelle's dresses,\\" the former president joked. Obama also squashed any notion that the library was ever going to be elsewhere. Multiple locations in three states — Illinois, New York and Hawaii — had initially pitched proposals. \\"The best things that have happened to me in my life happened in this community,\\" he said. \\"Although we had a formal bidding process to determine where the presidential library was going to be, the fact of the matter was it had to be right here on the south side of Chicago.\\" How does Obama feel about the museum?

An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory.  and a hint : From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.  Please answer this question : Which tetrapod would have more offsprings in their lifetime, tetA or tetB?","output":"Based on Aristotle's theory, since tetA has a longer gestation period and is heavier than tetB, it is likely that tetA has a longer lifespan as well.

Born as Milo, he was named after Dr. Milo, a friend of his chimpanzee parents, Cornelius and Zira. Due to a series of events involving Armando, the circus owner, Caesar was raised in secret, and would eventually become instrumental in the story arcs of the subsequent films. Caesar's backstory adds significant depth to the entire Planet of the Apes universe. His unique upbringing as the offspring of talking chimpanzees that had traveled back in time creates a complex and intriguing character. Growing up among humans, he develops a perspective different from typical apes, and this makes his role even more pivotal in later films. In Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, Caesar, now an adult, is captured and sold as a pet, leading him to witness the cruel treatment of apes by humans first hand. This exposure to the harsh realities faced by his kind fuels his desire to lead the ape rebellion against human domination. In this film, Caesar emerges as a symbol of resistance and hope for the oppressed ape population. Moreover, in Battle for the Planet of the Apes, which takes place after the events of Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, Caesar tries to create a peaceful society involving both apes and humans. However, his efforts are met with resistance from certain factions, including the mutated humans and a rebellious gorilla general, which leads to a war that ultimately shapes the future of both species. In summary, we can conclude that Caesar is an integral character in the original Planet of the Apes movie series, with his unique origin story, growth, and eventual role in the ape revolution profoundly affecting the plot and the future of the Apes universe."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Question: Danny went camping and made a fire in the woods. he used large logs he fell a few months back. Bob was camping 300 yards away and he made a fire using small sticks, kindlings and sawdust he had left over. Bob's fire burned fast and bright.  Which person didn't make a fire that burned for a longer time?  Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. Answer:","output":"Bob didn't make a fire that burned for a longer time. This is because he used small sticks, kindlings, and sawdust which have a larger surface area as compared to the large logs used by Danny.

Paragraph: Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.

Body armour Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Gotham's Reckoning\\" Plot: In the dark, crime-ridden Gotham City, Batman (Bruce Wayne) encounters a new and ferocious adversary: Vincent Dent, the twin brother of the deceased and notorious Harvey Dent. Vincent seeks vengeance against Batman, blaming him for not only his brother's death but also the loss of his once-prominent family name. Using his power, influence, and knowledge of Gotham's underground network, Vincent Dent aims to launch a carefully coordinated operation to bring Gotham to its knees and overthrow Batman once and for all. The film opens as Batman struggles to handle the surge of crimes perpetrated by the people loyal to Vincent, who has donned the name 'Vindictive Dent'. In his desperation, Batman turns to his long-time butler, friend, and confidante, Alfred, for advice. Together, they delve deeper into the Dent family history and learn of a closely guarded secret: Harvey and Vincent were conjoined twins, separated at birth to protect the family's public image. This leads to a dark revelation; it wasn't Batman who caused Harvey's downfall but Vincent himself, who manipulated the tragic events that turned Harvey into the monstrous Two-Face. As Batman puzzles out the truth, Commissioner Gordon also starts investigating the mysterious circumstances surrounding Harvey's death. He uncovers damning evidence that Vincent was orchestrating both his brother's demise and the criminal wave sweeping the city. He confronts Vincent at his mansion, hoping to reason with him and halt his sinister plans. But Vincent is consumed by his anger for Batman and has no intention of stopping. Batman, now relying on his exceptional detective skills, designates a team of trusted allies to counter Vincent's moves and disrupt his network. Simultaneously, he works on developing a new suit of advanced body armor to help him withstand Vincent's relentless attacks. He knows that when they meet, it's going to be a fierce battle of survival. As the plot unfolds, the citizens of Gotham are caught in the crossfire between Batman's struggle against Vindictive Dent's followers, resulting in a high-stakes hostage situation in City Hall. Batman, now wearing his newly developed body armor, enters the fray, desperate to put an end to the violence that has plagued his city. The suit features cutting-edge technology, enabling Batman to absorb the impact of bullets, knives, and various forms of blunt force trauma. The climax of the movie sees Batman and Vincent facing off atop the burning ruins of City Hall, a casualty of the chaos and mayhem caused by Vincent's carefully executed plan. The rain beats down on them, adding further tension and drama to the final confrontation. With his life and the lives of Gotham's citizens on the line, Batman swiftly tackles Vincent, using his advanced body armor to absorb a potentially deadly blow from Vincent's powerful melee weapon. Simultaneously, Commissioner Gordon leads the police force in a valiant effort to free the hostages held captive in City Hall. As Batman and Vincent battle it out, the line between justice and vengeance becomes blurred, highlighting the destructive nature of vengeance and the heartaches both Batman and Vincent have undergone as a result of Harvey Dent's death. Ultimately, Batman emerges victorious, incapacitating Vincent and bringing him to justice. With his brother's actions exposed, Vincent is sent to Arkham Asylum, where he will face the consequences of his actions. Batman, having protected his city once more, reaffirms his commitment to saving Gotham from their enemies, both old and new. The film ends with a renewed sense of hope and determination as Gotham's citizens work to rebuild their broken city and heal their wounds. In \\"Gotham's Reckoning,\\" Batman's penchant for bravery and determination, coupled with Vincent's dark obsession with revenge, culminate in an action-packed, emotionally charged cinematic thriller that showcases the devastating consequences of seeking vengeance at the expense of justice."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The first major contacts between the two countries occurred after Thailand was made an apostolic vicariate by Pope Alexander VII on 22 August 1662. The mission was assigned to the newly formed Paris Foreign Missions Society to evangelize Asia, and Siam became the first country to receive these efforts, to be followed by new missions 40 years later in Cochinchina, Tonkin and parts of China, because Siam was highly tolerant of other religions and was indeed the only country in Southeast Asia where the Catholic Fathers could establish themselves safely. Monseigneur Pierre Lambert de la Motte, Bishop of Beirut, Vicar-Apostolic of Cochinchina, and member of the Missions Etrangères de Paris, accompanied by Fathers De Bourges and Deydier, left Marseille on 26 November 1660, and reached Mergui 18 months later.

It was formed officially on 3 April 2006 to support the Special Air Service, the Special Reconnaissance Regiment and the Special Boat Service on operations. The 1st Battalion Parachute Regiment (1 PARA), a company strength group of Royal Marines, and a contingent of RAF Regiment personnel form the UK's Special Forces Support Group (SFSG). The SFSG may provide extra firepower from land or air to fulfil their mission. Context_2 : The Army Public School Nahan (informally APS Nahan or Army School Nahan or ASN) is a co-educational day boarding school in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh, India. It was started in the month of May 1982 in old re-appropriated barracks of 1 PARA (SF) by the Army Welfare Education Society. The school's first principal was Mrs S Samadhar. The present principal is Mr R A Prabhakar, who has occupied the post since 2011 and is the ninth principal of the school. Context_3 : The political relationship between the United States and Myanmar worsened after the 1988 military coup and violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations. Subsequent repression, including the crackdown on peaceful protestors in September 2007, further strained the relationship. However, following signs of liberalization, the US government began the process of improving its links with Myanmar in 2011. With improving ties in 2012, the White House planned Ambassador nomination, the first since 1990. On June 29, 2012, the U.S. Senate confirmed Derek Mitchell as the United States Ambassador to Myanmar. Context_4 : Bloody Sunday – sometimes called the Bogside Massacre – was an incident on 30 January 1972 in the Bogside area of Derry, Northern Ireland, when British soldiers shot 28 unarmed civilians during a peaceful protest march against internment. Fourteen people died: thirteen were killed outright, while the death of another man four months later was attributed to his injuries. Many of the victims were shot while fleeing from the soldiers and some were shot while trying to help the wounded. Other protesters were injured by rubber bullets or batons, and two were run down by army vehicles. The march had been organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA). The soldiers involved were members of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, also known as \\"1 Para\\". Context_5 : In 2014, a series of protests, political demonstrations, and civil insurrection began in Venezuela due to the country's high levels of urban violence, inflation, and chronic shortages of basic goods attributed to economic policies such as strict price controls. While protests occurred in January 2014, after the murder of actress and former Miss Venezuela Mónica Spear, mass protesting began in earnest that February following the attempted rape of a student on a university campus in San Cristóbal. Subsequent arrests and killings of student protestors spurred their expansion to neighboring cities and the involvement of opposition leaders. The year's early months were characterized by large demonstrations and violent clashes between protestors and government forces that resulted in nearly 4,000 arrests and 43 deaths, including both supporters and opponents of the government. Toward the end of 2014, and into 2015, continued shortages and low oil prices caused renewed protesting. By 2016, protests occurred following the controversy surrounding the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary elections as well as the incidents surrounding the 2016 recall referendum. On 1 September 2016, the largest demonstration of the protests occurred, with over 1 million Venezuelans, or over 3% of the entire nation's population, gathered to demand a recall election against President Maduro, with the event being described as the \\"largest demonstration in the history of Venezuela\\". Following the suspension of the recall referendum by the government-leaning National Electoral Council (CNE) on 21 October 2016, the opposition organized another protest which was held on 26 October 2016, with over 1.2 million Venezuelans participating. After some of the largest protests occurred in a late-2016, Vatican-mediate dialogue between the opposition and government was attempted and ultimately failed in January 2017. Concentration on protests subsided in the first months of 2017 until the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis occurred when the pro-government Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela attempted to assume the opposition-led National Assembly and removed their immunity, though the move was reversed days later, demonstrations grew \\"into the most combative since a wave of unrest in 2014\\". The protests are considered to be the Mother of all Protests. Context_6 : During the early stages of the Libyan Civil War of 2011, the Gaddafi regime was still in power: but there was widespread withdrawal of support from that regime by influential persons and organisations within the country. Among those who no longer supported the regime, the main concern they expressed was what they regarded as its use of excessive force against peaceful protestors. There were many resignations by ministers of the governing council and other senior officials, diplomats posted abroad, and senior military officers. Islamic clerics, tribal leaders, and members of the former royal family expressed their opposition, while the two leading Libyan oil companies also withdrew support for the regime. Context_7 : Tom Reilly (born 1960) is an Irish author and former regional newspaper columnist (\\"Life of Reilly\\", \\"Drogheda Independent\\"), who has written books on Oliver Cromwell and religion, (\\"Hollow Be Thy Name\\") as well as a book based on his own newspaper columns among others.

Answer:","output":"Henry III was born on September 19, 1551, at the Château de Fontainebleau in France. He was the son of King Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici, a member of the House of Valois.  As a young man, Henry held various titles, including Duke of Anjou, Duke of Orléans, and Duke of Angoulême. He had a diverse and distinguished education as a prince, groomed for his future role as a king. In 1570, he was portrayed by the famous artist François Clouet, revealing his status as a prominent figure of the time.  On May 16, 1574, Henry III ascended the throne as the King of France and Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. His coronations took place in Reims on February 22, 1574, and Wawel on February 13, 1575. His reign was marked by various challenges, including religious tensions and political disputes. In 1575, Henry III married Louise of Lorraine, a member of the House of Lorraine. Despite their marriage, the couple did not have any children, leading to the succession crisis that would follow Henry's death. Throughout his reign, Henry III saw escalating conflicts between Catholics and Protestants in France, culminating in the French Wars of Religion. As a Roman Catholic himself, Henry attempted to navigate the complexities of the religious tensions within his kingdom. On August 2, 1589, Henry III was assassinated at the Château de Saint-Cloud in France, solidifying the end of the Valois dynasty. He was succeeded by Anna and Stephen Bathory in Poland, and by Henry IV in France. Henry III's legacy continues to be a subject of historical discussion and examination, particularly surrounding his reign and religious policies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What was the name of the report that made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the now government-funded collection? is inside the article: When Scranton agreed to take on Steamtown, U.S.A., it was estimated that the museum and excursion business would attract 200,000 to 400,000 visitors to the city every year.  In anticipation of this economic boon, the city and a private developer spent 13 million to renovate the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) station and transform it into a Hilton hotel, at a time when the unemployment rate in the city was 13 percent.  Only 60,000 visitors showed up at Steamtown in 1987, and the 1988 excursions were canceled. After only three years, it was 2.2 million in debt and facing bankruptcy. Part of the problem was the cost of restoration of the new property and the deteriorating equipment. In addition, while the tourists in Vermont had enjoyed the sights of cornfields, farms, covered bridges, a waterfall and a gorge on a Steamtown excursion, the Scranton trip to Moscow, Pennsylvania, cut through one of the nation's largest junkyards, an eyesore described by Ralph Nader as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\".In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, under the urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the spending of 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of 66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study.

An Arizona mother of seven will be back in court on Wednesday as a judge weighs whether she will go free or remain behind bars in Mexico, her family said. It's a situation Yanira Maldonado's family said she never imagined when she boarded a bus to head back to the United States last week after attending a family funeral. Now she's facing drug-smuggling charges after Mexican authorities said they found 12 pounds of marijuana under her bus seat. Her family vehemently denies the charges and accuses authorities of arresting her to get bribe money. A Mexican state official also told CNN it appears that Yanira Maldonado was framed. Anna Soto, Maldonado's daughter, said it was devastating to see her mom in jail over the weekend. \\"She's an honest woman. She's innocent. It's not a place for someone of her kind,\\" Soto told CNN's \\"Piers Morgan Live\\" on Tuesday night. \\"It hurts just to know that she's there, to have seen her there. It's not fair.\\" Soto said she knows her mother has nothing to do with drugs. \\"Never. No. She is not that kind of person. I don't think she's ever even tried a cigarette in her life or even drank a beer,\\" Soto said. \\"You know, she's one of those people that tries to stay away from those kinds of people or those kinds of things.\\" From a bus seat to a jail cell. Mexican authorities arrested Maldonado last Wednesday as she and her husband, Gary, were on their way back to Arizona. During a search of their bus at a military checkpoint in the northwestern Mexican state of Sonora, authorities asked everyone to get off. At first, authorities told Gary Maldonado that marijuana had been found under his seat and arrested him, his father, Larry Maldonado, told CNN. After the father contacted the U.S. Consulate in Hermosillo, Mexico, authorities said they were mistaken and released Gary. Then, they charged his wife. Gary Maldonado said he believes Mexican soldiers at the checkpoint wanted a bribe. \\"It's about getting money here,\\" he told CNN's \\"Starting Point\\" on Tuesday. A lengthy court hearing. Maldonado's court hearing had stretched for more than three hours on Tuesday afternoon, said Brandon Klippel, her brother-in-law. Military officers from the checkpoint were scheduled to testify on Wednesday, Klippel said after speaking with family members and a translator who were inside the Mexican courtroom on Tuesday. \\"Although we are disappointed to hear that she will not be released today,\\" he said, \\"we are very encouraged by the strong evidence and witnesses proving her innocence.\\" Gary Maldonado told CNN affiliate KTVK that he was feeling optimistic after Tuesday's hearing. \\"We're hoping for the best outcome. ... We don't think they have a case,\\" he said. The Mexican Embassy in Washington said in a statement that a preliminary decision from the judge was expected soon. Questions about arrest. A Sonora state official with extensive knowledge of the case told CNN there are questions about the arrest. \\"Can you imagine?\\" asked the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media and did not want to be named. \\"A passenger by himself or herself would have been unable to carry almost six kilos of marijuana onto a bus without being noticed. She must've been framed.\\" A regional office of Mexico's Defense Ministry said troops conducting a routine investigation stopped the bus Maldonado was riding in and and found 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) of a substance that appeared to be marijuana under her seat. Troops turned the case over to the Mexican attorney general's office, the defense ministry said. Maldonado is being housed in a women's prison in Nogales, Mexico, while authorities decide her fate. The Sonora state division of the attorney general's office said the investigation is ongoing and declined to provide additional information about the case against Maldonado. Her husband was told by authorities that regardless of his wife's guilt or innocence, he would have to pay 5,000 to secure her freedom, the family said. He was able to cobble together the money but then was told it was too late. His wife had been transferred to another jail. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake is monitoring the case, his office said. \\"Senator Flake is personally monitoring the situation, and he has had multiple conversations with the deputy Mexican ambassador this weekend,\\" Flake's office said Monday. 'Blind mules' unknowingly ferry drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border. Fear grips family. But growing political and media attention toward the case has not lessened the fears of Yanira Maldonado's family. Family members visiting her over the weekend were told they would have hours to talk, but when they arrived they were given only 10 minutes, Klippel said. \\"She was at a wire window with her fingertips up through the holes, touching her son's hand with one hand and touching her husband's hand with the other,\\" Klippel said. \\"She was just saying, 'I don't know how this happened to me. I've never done anything illegal in my life. Why has this happened?'\\" After Tuesday's hearing, sister-in-law Veronica Anaya said the family remained very scared and upset. \\"The family is very sad,\\" Anaya told Canal 7, a local TV station in Nogales. \\"They know she's innocent. She's the mother of seven children and a decent person. She's a Christian. This is an injustice.\\" Mormons reach out. While they anxiously await word from Mexico, family members say they've been turning to their church for strength. The Maldonados are members of a local Mormon ward in Goodyear, Arizona, Klippel said, adding that church leaders at the state and local level have offered spiritual and material support to the family. \\"I feel very blessed, and I feel how powerful this network is,\\" Klippel said. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the Mormon church is officially known, has long been active in Mexico and other parts of the world, and is famous for its tight and socially active circles. A Facebook page Klippel and his wife founded to support Yanira Maldonado had garnered more than 12,500 members as of Tuesday afternoon, many of whom are fellow Mormons. A number have offered to connect the Maldonados with Mormon leaders in Mexico or media in the United States. Some in the Facebook group said that they are refraining from eating and drinking for a day on the family's behalf. \\"To find out that hundreds if not thousands of people are fasting on behalf of my sister and praying to God that this is over soon is very humbling,\\" Klippel said.

NYPD suspends cop caught punching teen during arrest A cop caught on video punching a teen during an arrest on the Lower East Side has been suspended, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said Friday. The plain-clothes officer was seen on the video running up to and slugging one of three teens being cuffed for an assault on a 20-year-old man on Madison Street around 4 p.m., Monday. The victim had been struck with a cane before cops responded and made the arrest. A witness can be heard shouting in the video “I’m a lawyer,” and adding that she couldn’t believe the officer “did that to a 12-year-old.” The suspects were ages 16 and 17 and had an ongoing dispute with the victims, sources said. “An individual ended up hospitalized as a result of a beating that he may have received at the hands of three or four young men and during the effort to arrest one of the men thought to be involved in the incident an individual that we have identified as one of our plain clothed officers runs up and appears to strike the (teen) with a closed fist twice in the side of the body,” Bratton said. The two 16-year-old men were charged with gang assault, obstruction of justice, resisting arrest and weapon possession. The 17-year-old was charged with gang assault.

(Associated Press)      Flowers and candles are placed around stone lions near the department store Ahlens following a suspected terror attack in central Stockholm, Sweden, Saturday, April 8, 2017. Swedish prosecutor Hans Ihrman said a person has been formally identified as a suspect \\"of terrorist offences by murder\\" after... (Associated Press)      STOCKHOLM (AP) — Much like the flags on the Stockholm skyline — some still flying half-staff, others at their peak — people here were divided over their country's friendly immigration policies two days after an asylum-seeker from Uzbekistan allegedly killed four people in the city's deadliest extremist attack in years.      The Swedish capital was slowly, but resolutely, regaining its normal rhythm Sunday as details about the 39-year-old suspect emerged. Police said he had been ordered to leave Sweden in December after his request for a residence permit was rejected six months earlier.      Instead, he allegedly went underground, eluding authorities' attempts to track down and deport him until a hijacked beer truck raced down a pedestrian street and rammed into an upscale department store on Friday.      \\"It makes me frustrated,\\" Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven told Swedish news agency TT on Sunday.      The suspect, who has been detained on suspicion of terrorist offenses, was known known for having \\"been sympathetic to extremist organizations,\\" Jonas Hysing of Sweden's national police said.      A second person was arrested on the same potential charge Sunday, and four others were being held by police. None of them have been identified.      Security officials in neighboring Norway, where a 17-year-old asylum-seeker from Russia was detained early Sunday in connection with an explosive device found near a busy subway station, spoke of the alarming potential for a copycat effect.      Norwegian's security agency said it wasn't clear if the teen planned to carry out an attack with the primitive homemade device police defused without any injuries. Agency head Benedicte Bjornland said it was likely the youth had been inspired by recent attacks in Stockholm, France, Germany, Britain and Russia.      \\"The attacks demonstrate how easy such attacks can be carried out, and prove to others that it is possible to make something similar,\\" Bjornland said.      Sweden has long been known for its open-door policy toward migrants and refugees. But after the Scandinavian country of 10 million took in a record 163,000 refugees in 2015 — the highest per-capita rate in Europe — the government has tried to be more selective about which newcomers it allows to stay.      Swedish police said Sunday they had received roughly 12,500 referrals from the Swedish Migration Board of people who, like the suspect in the truck attack, had overstayed their welcome.      The suspect eluded authorities by giving police a wrong address after his residency request was rejected in June 2016, said Hysing, the operative head of the attack investigation.      \\"The efforts to locate (these people) is both time-consuming and resource-intensive,\\" he said.      National Coordinator Against Violent Extremism Anna Carlstedt, who used to lead the Red Cross in Sweden, said Friday's attack and the background of the suspect posed \\"difficult questions.\\"      \\"Do we somehow need a more repressive policy?\\" Carlstedt said. \\"I think it is very important now not to rush into something, to see how we can safeguard this open society and still be able to protect ourselves.\\"      The range of mixed emotions — fear and fraternity, anger and openness, — also surfaced at memorial services and rallies held in Stockholm on Sunday to honor the attack victims.      Lars Holm, a 73-year-old Stockholm resident was visibly upset, after attending a service at Stockholm Cathedral.      \\"If people who are here seeking asylum and treat us like this, it is not good,\\" Holm said. \\"So now we have to have more security in our society, but still we don't like to live in bunkers.\\"      Addressing tens of thousands of people rallying in bright sunshine on the downtown Sergelstorg square, organizer Rickard Sjoberg noted that many in the crowd probably were from out of town.      \\"But today, were all Stockholmers,\\" he said to huge applause.      The four victims killed included a British man, a Belgian woman and two Swedes, authorities in those countries said. Their identities were not released by Swedish officials.      The British government named the Briton as Chris Bevington, an executive at Swedish music-streaming service Spotify. In Brussels, the Belga news agency said the Belgian woman had been reported missing before she was identified by her identity papers and later by DNA testing.      As of Sunday, 10 of the 15 people wounded remained hospitalized, including one child.      Stockholm county spokesman Patrik Soderberg said four of the 10 were considered \\"seriously\\" injured and the remaining six, including the child, were slightly injured.      One of the wounded, an 83-year-old Romanian woman who was begging on the city's pedestrian Drottninggatan shopping street when the attack took place, said she was \\"surprised\\" that passers-by helped her.      \\"I thought everyone would run past me and save themselves,\\" Papusa Ciuraru, whose foot was crushed by a boulder displaced by the speeding truck, told the Expressen daily.      The lion-shaped boulders on Drottninggatan are meant as roadblocks and have been put up in several European capitals after a truck attack last year killed 12 people at a Christmas market in Berlin.      Police and Sweden's intelligence have questioned some 500 people as part of the investigation, a senior police officer said. Sweden's SAPO security police said it was working to find \\"any abettor or network involved in the attack.\\"      The department store that was rammed by the truck apologized Sunday for an announcement that it would reopen two days after the deadly attack to sell damaged goods at a \\"reduced price.\\"      The Ahlens store described it as \\"a bad decision\\" on its Facebook page, saying its motivation \\"was born out of the idea of standing up for transparency and not allowing evil forces take control of our lives.\\"      The store said it would reopen Monday \\"without any damaged goods.\\"      ___      Olsen reported from Copenhagen.

The official police Twitter account said one man has been arrested and Police Chief... (Associated Press)      COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A 17-year-old asylum-seeker from Russia was arrested Sunday in connection with an explosive device found near a busy subway station in Norway's capital that police defused before it detonated, authorities said.      The youth was detained on suspicion of handling explosives, but investigators do not know if he planned to carry out an attack with the homemade device, Signe Aaling, chief prosecutor for Norway's PST security service, said.      Aaling described the explosive as \\"a primitive improvised explosive device with limited damage potential.\\"      \\"PST is now working on finding his intentions and find out whether others are involved,\\" she said.      The youth was not identified, but security service head Benedicte Bjornland said Norwegian intelligence was aware of him. He is an asylum-seeker from Russia who arrived in Norway with his family in 2010, Bjornland said.      Bjornland also alleged that the youth was part of \\"extreme Islamism\\" circles in Norway. He was arrested based on a tip from the public, Bjornland said without elaborating.      \\"It is likely that that attacks in France, German, Great Britain, Russia and Sweden can create a copycat effect in Norway with people with Islamic sympathies,\\" Bjornland said, listing the locations of extremist attacks that have devastated Europe in the last year.      \\"The attacks demonstrate how easy such attacks can be carried out, and prove to others that it is possible to make something similar,\\" she added.      The teenage suspect's lawyer, Aase Karine Sigmond, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that her client denies wrongdoing and had distanced himself from the Islamic State group.      \\"We are talking about boyish stupidities,\\" Sigmond told NRK.      The teen, who lives in Oslo, is scheduled for a pre-trial custody hearing on Monday.      The discovery of the explosive Saturday night — found on the street just outside the Groenland subway station — prompted police to evacuate late bars and restaurants in the Norwegian capital.      The Oslo explosive was found less than a mile from the government buildings that were damaged in a deadly bomb attack carried out by right-wing extremist Anders Breivik in 2011.

All its life it had been asleep, but now it hardly got a chance for a nod, so swiftly did big events and crashing surprises come along in one another's wake: Friday morning, first glimpse of Real Nobility, also grand reception at Aunt Patsy Cooper's, also great robber raid; Friday evening, dramatic kicking of the heir of the chief citizen in presence of four hundred people; Saturday morning, emergence as practicing lawyer of the long-submerged Pudd'nhead Wilson; Saturday night, duel between chief citizen and titled stranger.  The people took more pride in the duel than in all the other events put together, perhaps.  It was a glory to their town to have such a thing happen there.

In the area of Las Californias the ruthless Spanish Governor, Don Rafael Montero, is about to be overthrown. In a last ditch effort to trap his nemesis, the masked swordsman Zorro (Anthony Hopkins), Montero prepares to execute three innocent townspeople. With assistance from two orphan brothers, Joaquin and Alejandro Murrieta, Zorro releases the prisoners. Zorro rewards the Murrieta brothers with a special medallion he wears, and escapes on his horse, Toronado, after cutting a \\"Z\\" into Montero's neck as a parting gift and warning. The same night, however, Montero confronts Zorro at his home, having deduced that Zorro is really Don Diego de la Vega, a Spanish nobleman married to Esperanza, the woman Montero had always loved. Attempting to arrest Diego, a fight ensues, during which Esperanza is killed while trying to protect Diego. Diego's house is burned and his infant daughter, Elena, is taken to Spain by Montero to be raised as his own while Diego is taken to prison. Twenty years later, Montero secretly returns to California, looking for Diego in the old prison. Although de La Vega is there, Montero does not recognize him, while several prisoners claim to be Zorro (taken from the famous scene of Spartacus). Diego later escapes, intent on killing Montero the following day at a public ceremony for Montero's return. However, Diego restrains himself when he sees Eléna (Catherine Zeta-Jones), now a beautiful young lady. Elena is presented with a bouquet of flowers - Romagnas, native to California - the scent of which she recognizes, although she incorrectly believes she has never been to California before. Diego soon meets an adult Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas), whom he recognizes by the medal he awarded Joaquin. Now a drunken, clumsy bandit, Alejandro is bitter over the recent capture of his mentor, bandit Three-Fingered Jack (L. Q. Jones), and the murder of Joaquin by the sadistic Texian Army Captain Harrison... Answer:","output":"De La Vega tells Elena the truth about her true parentage and that he is her real father.

Todd Sheets is still the director, but no longer the screenwriter, which isn't a negative or a positive, considering he's just as untalented as the guy who wrote this one.

When I asked her to show me the receipt we had signed, she could not produce it. It's very frustrating to order food, have it be wrong and then have someone tell you its your fault. Not only this but I believe the hostess or the kitchen staff should be reviewing the orders and signing the receipt, not the customer. I'm paying for the food, the staff should be the one guaranteeing the order is correct. It's too frustrating dealing with the staff and always having your order be wring, we will not be going back anytime soon.","output":"The given review is negative.

Information:  - Hans Asperger (18 February 1906  21 October 1980) was an Austrian pediatrician, medical theorist, and medical professor. He is best known for his early studies on mental disorders, especially in children. His work was largely unnoticed during his lifetime except for a few accolades in Vienna, and his studies on psychological disorders only acquired world renown posthumously. He wrote over 300 publications, mostly concerning a condition he termed \\"autistic psychopathy\\" (AP). There was a resurgence of interest in his work beginning in the 1980s, and due to his earlier work on autism spectrum disorders, Asperger syndrome (AS), was named after him. Both Asperger's original paediatric diagnosis of AP and the eponymous diagnosis of AS that was named after him several decades later have been controversial.  - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is used, or relied upon, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers together with alternatives such as the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). The DSM is now in its fifth edition, DSM-5, published on May 18, 2013. It evaluated the patient on five axes or dimensions rather than just one broad aspect of 'mental disorder'. These dimensions relate to biological, psychological, social and other aspects. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, although also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders.  - ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases.  - Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life. The exact cause of Asperger's is unknown. While it is probably partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\" (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the \\"International Classification of Diseases\\" (ICD-10) as of 2015. There is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured. In 2013, Asperger's was estimated to affect 31 million people globally. The syndrome is named...  - International Organization is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the entire field of international affairs.

A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.  - A social skill is any skill facilitating interaction and communication with others. Social rules and relations are created, communicated, and changed in verbal and nonverbal ways. The process of learning these skills is called socialization. For socialization, Interpersonal skills are essential to relate one another. Interpersonal skills are the interpersonal acts a person uses to interact with others which are related to dominance vs. submission, love vs. hate, affiliation vs. aggression, control vs. autonomy categories (Leary, 1957). Positive interpersonal skills include persuasion, active listening, delegation, and stewardship among others. Social psychology is the academic discipline that does research related to social skills, the discipline studies how skills are learned by an individual through changes in attitude, thinking, and behavior.  - High-functioning autism (HFA) is a term applied to people with autism who are deemed to be cognitively \\"higher functioning\\" (with an IQ of 70 or greater) than other people with autism. Individuals with HFA or Asperger syndrome may exhibit deficits in areas of communication, emotion recognition and expression, and social interaction. HFA is not a recognized diagnosis in the DSM-5 or the ICD-10.  - Developmental disorders is a group of psychiatric conditions originating in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. There are several ways of using this term. The most narrow concept is used in the category \\"Specific Disorders of Psychological Development\\" in the ICD-10. These disorders comprise language disorders, learning disorders, motor disorders and autism spectrum disorders. In broader definitions ADHD is included, and the term used is neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet others include antisocial behavior and schizophrenia that begins in childhood and continues through life. However, these two latter conditions are not as stable as the other developmental disorders, and there is not the same evidence of a shared genetic liability.  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three. Autism is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypotheses, which have since been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met. Early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder. Globally, autism is estimated to affect 21.7 million people as of 2013. As of 2010, the number of people affected is estimated at about 12 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children...  - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\", Fifth Edition (DSM-5\\") is the 2013 update to the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) classification and diagnostic tool. In the United States the DSM serves as a universal authority for psychiatric diagnoses. Treatment recommendations, as well as payment by health care providers, are often determined by DSM classifications, so the appearance of a new version has significant practical importance.  - Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, , or OPEP in several other languages) is an intergovernmental organization of 13 nations, founded in 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela), and headquartered since 1965 in Vienna. As of 2015, the 13 countries accounted for an estimated 42 percent of global oil production and 73 percent of the world's \\"proven\\" oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by American-dominated multinational oil companies.  - Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr.  - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  - The Czech Republic, also known by the short name Czechia, is a nation state in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the northeast. The Czech Republic covers an area of with mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate. It is a unitary parliamentary republic, has 10.5 million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague, with over 1.2 million residents. The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.

Question: what is a petition for a writ of certiorari?? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Define the term \\"petition\\" in the context of legal matters A petition is a formal, written request submitted to a court or any authoritative body, asking for a particular action or decision to be made. Step 2: Define the term \\"writ of certiorari\\" A writ of certiorari is an order issued by a higher court, such as the Supreme Court, to review the decision and proceedings of a lower court to determine any legal errors that may have occurred during the trial or appeal process. Step 3: Explain when and why a party files a petition for a writ of certiorari A party files a petition for a writ of certiorari when they believe that the lower court made an important legal error, resulting in a potentially incorrect decision or judgment. The petition asks the higher court to review the case and provide guidance on the correct legal principles to apply, ensuring a fair and just outcome. Step 4: Describe the process of filing a petition for a writ of certiorari To file a petition for a writ of certiorari, a party (the petitioner) must submit a written document to the higher court, arguing the importance of the case, identifying the legal issues in question, and explaining the reasons why the higher court's input and review are necessary. The other party (the respondent) may file a response to the petition, arguing against its grant. The higher court then decides whether to take the case based on the presented arguments and the legal importance of the case. Step 5: Explain the implications of a successful petition for a writ of certiorari If the higher court grants the petition for a writ of certiorari, it will review the lower court's decision, focusing on the legal questions raised by the petitioner, which could potentially lead to the overturning of the original verdict or legal guidance for lower courts on similar issues in the future. Based on the step by step analysis, the answer is: A petition for a writ of certiorari is a formal request submitted to a higher court, such as the Supreme Court, seeking a review of the decision and proceedings of a lower court to determine any legal errors that may have occurred. Parties file this petition when they believe that an important legal mistake was made in their case, and they hope by the higher court's guidance and review, the case can achieve a fair and just outcome."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Federal insurance program won’t add self-plus-one option until 2016 A self-plus-one coverage option won’t be available in the health insurance program for federal employees and retirees until 2016, according to the Office of Personnel Management. Currently, enrollees in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program may choose between self-only coverage and self and family coverage. Family coverage rates are substantially more expensive and don’t vary by how many additional persons are insured. A budget law passed in December approved making a self-plus-one option available to enrollees as soon as 2015. However, a spokesperson said that OPM “expects to implement the self plus one option for the 2016 plan year.” More than 250 insurance plans participate in the FEHBP, the large majority operating only in local areas. Rates and coverage terms are negotiated annually between the carriers and OPM, a process that starts in the spring and ends with an open season each fall for enrollment decisions for the following year. The OPM spokesperson said in an e-mail that adding the option will require the insurance carriers, federal payroll systems and the federal retirement system to revamp their processes. “Making this significant change across many systems would need to be completed well before the beginning of the 2015 open season to ensure user testing and quality assurance,” the spokesperson said. “FEHB carriers will need to submit rate and benefit proposals on the self plus one category. Adding self plus one will require precise actuarial evaluation for the new rates, and agencies will need sufficient time to make changes to their systems to accommodate payroll deductions,” the spokesperson added. The White House last spring proposed adding that option to the FEHBP program and Congress later approved it in part because the Congressional Budget Office determined it would be a money-saver for the government. The government pays about 70 percent of the total FEHBP premium cost for enrollees, whether they are in self-only or self and family plans. The CBO projected that premiums for a self-plus-one option would fall between the rates of the two other options and that retirees, especially, would be drawn to it. However, the CBO also predicted that once a self-plus-one option is added, the family coverage option “would become more costly than under current law because the average number of people covered by policies of that type would rise.” The idea of adding a self-plus-one option to the FEHBP had been in circulation for many years, advocated mainly by enrollees with only one eligible family member who contend that it is unfair for them to have to pay the same rates as those with multiple eligible family members. Self-plus-one coverage is available under the separate Federal Dental and Vision Insurance Program. In that program, the second person must be someone who would be eligible under family coverage rules. Domestic partners, for example, are excluded.","output":"The Office of Personnel Management has announced that a self-plus-one coverage option for health insurance for federal employees and retirees will not be available until 2016.

The government has announced a series of policies  to prevent the prices from rising further. Rising housing prices is still a big concern for the people, but since farm products are needed every day, the increase in their prices has made life very difficult for them. Many people may think the increase will help farmers. But have higher prices of farm products really benefited the farmers? Take the increase in vegetable prices in the first half of this year for example. Though natural disasters such as droughts and spring frost did not cause the prices of farm products to increase greatly--in fact, prices of some products did not increase at all--vegetables have become dearer by as much as 20 percent compared to that of last year. This means only a small part (or even none) of the extra money that city people have paid to buy farm products has gone to the farmers. The extra cost actually has gone to middlemen. As the fact shows, just increasing prices of farm products will have negative influence on the entire economy. On one hand, the price increase has created some abnormal phenomena, which hurts farmers' interests. On the other hand, resources will enter the agriculture because of the high price of farm products, which would finally create negative effect on the whole economy. In such a case, it would be better to leave the market to decide the prices instead of raising farm products' prices to protect the interests of farmers. Actually, such a way will be better for farmers in the long run. What is probably the author's attitude to raising the farm products' prices? A) Negative. B) Indifferent. C) Enthusiastic. D) Positive.","output":"The author's attitude towards raising the farm products' prices appears to be negative (A) based on their detailed observations and explanations. The author raises several concerns on the negative impacts of increased prices of agricultural products on both the consumers and the farmers themselves. Firstly, they highlight that despite the rising prices, only a small part or even none of the extra money is going to the farmers, with middlemen benefiting instead. This shows that the author is concerned about the well-being of the farmers and does not think that higher prices necessarily benefit them. Furthermore, they argue that increasing the prices of farm products may lead to abnormal phenomena that could ultimately harm the farmers' interests. They also point out that resources funneling into agriculture due to high prices may negatively affect the overall economy, suggesting that price intervention might not be the most sustainable solution. The author then proposes an alternative, market-driven approach to price determination, stating that leaving the market to decide the prices is better than artificially raising them. By presenting this alternative and their belief in its long-term benefits, the author shows their negative attitude towards raising farm product prices as a means of protecting farmers' interests. Instead, they emphasize the importance of considering the broader implications on both the farming community and the economy as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"These two sentences appear to be stating the same information about the replacement of the AMISOM commander, but they actually convey the opposite message in terms of who replaced whom. In the first sentence, it is stated that Major General Nathan Mugisha replaced Major General Francis Okello as commander of AMISOM on 7 July 2009. This indicates that Major General Nathan Mugisha took over the role from Major General Francis Okello.

To maintain the consistency of the information and to convey that Major General Nathan Mugisha replaced Major General Francis Okello as commander of AMISOM on 7 July 2009, the second sentence could be rephrased as follows: On 7 July 2009, Major General Francis Okello was replaced as Commander of AMISOM by Major General Nathan Mugisha.

(CNN) -- For many families, the school year just started, but for Karen Suffern, it's not too early to start planning for Christmas. The financially struggling single mother of fraternal twins recently asked her 8-year-olds to write down a list of things they would like from Santa. Suffern, who works part time as an administrative assistant for a home health care company, wanted to start budgeting for the holidays. She knew her twins, who just began third grade, were at the age where they would start asking for electronics and other expensive gifts. Her son, Ryan's, letter to Santa started off normally: \\"Every day when she goes to school, she says, '","output":"Mommy, can I have this?' But I have to tell her that I don't have the money for it. She knows we don't have a lot of money, but she still believes in Santa Claus. So today, I asked my children to write letters to Santa earlier than usual, so I'd have enough time to budget properly and try to get them the presents they really want,\\" said Suffern. Her son, Ryan's, letter to Santa started off normally: \\"Dear Santa, I hope you are having a good year. Here is my list of things I would like for Christmas,\\" he wrote. On the list were items like a new scooter, a Lego set, and a remote-control car. But as Ryan continued writing, his letter revealed a more selfless intention: \\"I also want to ask if you can do something special for my sister, Amber. She's been through a lot and she could use some extra love and happiness this holiday season. Could you please make sure she gets a new toy that she's been wanting or that art set that she's been talking about? And it would be amazing if she could have that Barbie Dreamhouse she's always telling me about when she plays with her friends. I think it would make her really happy, Santa. And if there's a way I could give up my presents so she can have everything she wants, I would be okay with that. Thank you, Santa.\\" Touched by her son's heartfelt letter, Karen Suffern shared it on social media where it quickly went viral, gaining national attention. In response to the outpouring of support, a crowdfunding campaign was started to help make Ryan and Amber's holiday wishes come true. As the campaign gained traction, it not only raised enough money for Karen to purchase toys for her children, but it also sparked a community effort where neighbors, friends, and strangers came together to provide support to this family. With the local community collecting donations, the Suffern family was able to receive additional assistance beyond just Christmas gifts, such as grocery store gift cards, clothes and school supplies for the children, and even financial assistance to cover the twins' after-school activities. The generosity shown by the community and beyond managed to turn a potentially simple and predictable Christmas for a small family into a life-changing event, and made the holiday season much brighter for the Suffern family. Karen Suffern expressed her deep gratitude for the overwhelming support from everyone who had pitched in to make her children's Christmas wishes come true. \\"I can't thank everyone enough for the kindness they've shown my family. We're so grateful and truly feel like it's been a Christmas miracle.\\" As for Ryan and Amber, they not only received the items on their Christmas lists, but they also learned valuable lessons in compassion, empathy, and the power of community support. The story of Ryan's selfless letter to Santa will remain a touching tale that serves as a reminder during the holiday season of the true spirit of giving."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On 6 August 1945, the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in the first nuclear attack in history. In a press release issued after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Truman warned Japan to surrender or \\"...expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.\\" Three days later, on 9 August, the U.S. dropped another atomic bomb on Nagasaki, the last nuclear attack in history. More than 140,000–240,000 people died as a direct result of these two bombings. The necessity of the atomic bombings has long been debated, with detractors claiming that a naval blockade and aerial bombing campaign had already made invasion, hence the atomic bomb, unnecessary. However, other scholars have argued that the bombings shocked the Japanese government into surrender, with Emperor finally indicating his wish to stop the war. Another argument in favor of the atomic bombs is that they helped avoid Operation Downfall, or a prolonged blockade and bombing campaign, any of which would have exacted much higher casualties among Japanese civilians. Historian Richard B. Frank wrote that a Soviet invasion of Japan was never likely because they had insufficient naval capability to mount an amphibious invasion of Hokkaidō.

Problem: the ratio of a to b is 4 to 5 , where a and b are positive . if x equals a increased by 25 percent of a , and m equals b decreased by 40 percent of b , what is the value of m / x ?","output":"Part #1: Identify the given ratio of a to b. Usage: The ratio of a to b is 4 to 5. This means that for every 4 units of a, there are 5 units of b. This can be written as a/b = 4/5. The ratio meets the criteria as it clearly defines the relationship between a and b. Part #2: Identify the increase in a by 25 percent. Usage: x equals a increased by 25 percent of a. In this case, x = a + 0.25*a = 1.25*a. This part meets the criteria as it shows the new value x after the 25 percent increase in a. Part #3: Identify the decrease in b by 40 percent. Usage: m equals b decreased by 40 percent of b. In this case, m = b - 0.40*b = 0.60*b. This part meets the criteria as it shows the new value m after the 40 percent decrease in b. Part #4: Find the value of m / x. Usage: To calculate the value of m / x, we simply divide the two equations from parts 2 and 3. m / x = (0.60*b) / (1.25*a). This part meets the criteria as it sets up the equation needed to solve the task and find the value of m / x."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In July 2012, the NCAA imposed a series of heavy penalties on Pennsylvania State University, one of the most successful and fiercely competitive schools in the United States. The sanctions came in response to the shocking revelation of a child sexual abuse scandal involving Jerry Sandusky, the former assistant football coach at Penn State. They included a huge 60 million fine, a four-year bowl ban, a significant reduction in the number of football scholarships, and the forfeiture of all the Nittany Lions' wins from 1998 to 2011. Penn State's exemplary football program suddenly became the epicenter of a devastating scandal, tainting its reputation and leaving it with a painful road for recovery. The Sandusky Scandal The Penn State penalties stemmed from a major child sexual abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach, Jerry Sandusky. In November 2011, Sandusky was arrested and charged with 52 counts of child sexual abuse. He was ultimately convicted on 45 charges in June 2012. The revelations of Sandusky's abuse led to the firing of head coach Joe Paterno, and university president Graham Spanier resigned. The Freeh report, conducted by former FBI director Louis Freeh, scrutinized the response of the university's administration and coaching staff to the allegations against Sandusky. The report harshly criticized the failures of the university leadership in addressing the allegations and ensuring the safety of children on campus. The NCAA Penalties Following the release of the Freeh report, the NCAA levied several punitive measures against Penn State. The penalties included: 1. A 60 million fine, effectively equal to one year's revenue from the football program. The money was to be used to establish an endowment aimed at preventing child sexual abuse and helping its victims. 2. A four-year ban from participating in postseason bowl games. This prohibited the football team from competing in prestigious games that often serve as a measure of success and a determinant of national ranking. 3. A reduction in the number of scholarships the football program could offer from 85 to 65 over a four-year period. This reduction significantly impacted the team's ability to recruit top-tier athletes and remain competitive at the highest level. 4. The vacation of 112 wins by the Nittany Lions, spanning from 1998 to 2011. This decision dealt a significant blow to the program’s historical record and legacy. Consequences and Repercussions The sanctions had wide-ranging effects on the Penn State community. The students were left grappling with the embarrassing revelations and disappointed by the limitations imposed on their beloved football team. The university faced enormous financial strain from the fine and lost revenue from the bowl ban, affecting a broad range of initiatives and programs. The athletic program faced significant challenges in recruiting and retaining highly talented players and coaches after the scandal. The loss of revenue and opportunities to participate in postseason games forced the university to reevaluate its priorities and investment in its athletic programs. Moving Forward Penn State was able to recover more quickly from the consequences of the Sandusky scandal than initially expected. The university made significant efforts to demonstrate transparency, accountability, and a renewed commitment to the core values of the institution. The Nittany Lions broke their bowl ban in 2014, and as of 2016, Penn State restored 112 vacated wins. Commendably, the football program has shown resilience and the ability to rebuild while maintaining competitive excellence on the field. The Penn State scandal illustrated the tragic risks of failing to diligently investigate and address allegations of child sexual abuse. The penalties imposed by the NCAA served as a stark reminder of the obligations and responsibilities that universities have in ensuring the safety of all members of their community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Three Norwegian scientists are in a snow cat are following a signal. They stop suddenly, and after a few moments, a crack in the snow/ice causes the snow cat to fall into a fissure in the ice and gets wedged. The lights from the snow cat are pointed down into the fissure and reveal a spaceship.Sander, a Norwegian scientist, visits an American Paleontologist, named Kate, and tells her that they have discovered a structure and an organism and convinces her to come to Antartica.Kate and her colleague, Adam, fly in a helicopter to the Norwegian camp in Antarctica piloted by Americans Carter and Jameson. They get to camp and meet the other Norwegians including Edvard who is in charge of the camp and Lars, a mechanic who is the only one that doesn't speak any English and has an Alaskan Malamute.Upon arrival, Kate and Adam and the Norwegians get into a snow cat and go to the site where we see a full view of the top of the ship in the ice. Some distance from the ship, they show Kate the strange-looking organism encased in ice. Back at camp they discuss the removal of the organism.The organism is removed and is in a wooden room back at the camp still encased in the ice block. Sander tells the team that he wants to take a tissue sample first, which Kate objects to as they need to do sterilization and take other precautionary measures. He tells her not to question him again in front of the others. They drill a hole into the ice and remove a frozen flesh sample from the organism and place it in a petri dish.Later, in the camp's rec room, the entire team is partying and realize the discovery they have made: aliens. Meanwhile, the ice block is beginning to melt. While everyone is partying, a shot cuts to the Alaskan malamute in its cage and it's barking and trying to get out. Jameson comes out of the bathroom and goes into the room with the ice block. Lars scares him by yelling 'boo' from behind and then Lars leaves.

They couldn't have been more different – Hunter, the top of his class, and Craig, the guy who was seemingly always on the edge of failing. Yet, fate had a funny way of bringing people together. Step 1: Introduce the characters and their contrasting personalities. As the semester began, Hunter dove straight into his studies, meticulously organizing his schedule and balancing his extracurricular activities. Craig, on the other hand, had an uncanny ability to procrastinate, cramming the night before exams and turning in assignments just before the deadline. Step 2: Elaborate on their different study habits and lifestyles. Despite their differences, they began to develop an unlikely friendship. As they spent more time together, Hunter started to discover Craig's hidden talents: he was a great musician, had a sharp wit, and was just as passionate about social issues as Hunter was about academics. Step 3: Develop their friendship through shared interests and qualities. Hunter realized that Craig's supposedly laissez-faire attitude towards his studies could actually be useful; it helped to alleviate the immense pressure he felt to always be at the top of his game. In turn, Craig admired Hunter's discipline and drive and began to take his academics more seriously, picking up study and organizational skills from his high-achieving roommate. Step 4: Show the characters learning from each other and growing as individuals. As the year progressed, they both recognized the value in maintaining a balanced lifestyle. Hunter encouraged Craig to join him in volunteering at a local food bank and tutoring underprivileged kids, while Craig managed to get Hunter to loosen up, taking him to concerts and teaching him how to play the guitar. Step 5: Highlight the positive impact of their friendship on each other's lives. By the end of the academic year, they had both changed for the better. Hunter had learned to appreciate life's non-academic pursuits, and his overall mental well-being had significantly improved. Craig's new-found focus and study habits started paying off, and he finished the year with the best grades he had ever managed. Step 6: Demonstrate the growth and progress the characters have achieved. What began as an unlikely pairing eventually turned into a life-changing friendship. Against all odds, Hunter and Craig became inseparable, proving that their differences were what made them the perfect pair. With their new bond and newfound balance, they were ready to face whatever challenges their next year of college would bring. Step 7: Conclude the story by reinforcing the importance of the friendship and their growth as individuals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Whether it's due to an accidental spill of coffee or a splash of mud, a stubborn stain can quickly put a damper on your day. This article aims to provide you with a step-by-step guide to treating stains further if needed and drying your garment carefully to prevent damage. With these essential techniques, your clothing will be stain-free and ready to wear in no time. Step 1: Identifying the Stain Identifying the stain is crucial, as it helps you understand the best approach for treatment. Different stains require different treatments, ranging from simple at-home remedies to professional cleaning. Take your time to figure out the source of the stain and its characteristics. Step 2: Pre-Treatment Before proceeding with further treatment, always ensure you have pre-treated the stain. This process typically involves blotting the area with an absorbent cloth to remove excess moisture, gently scraping off dried residue, and applying a stain removal solution as per the manufacturer's instructions. Pre-treatment helps to break down the stain and prepare it for more effective treatment. Step 3: Assessing the Garment's Fabric Different fabrics require different levels of care. Check the garment's care label for guidelines on its fabric type and washing instructions. Always follow these instructions to preserve the quality and durability of the fabric and ensure you do not inadvertently cause further damage during treatment. Step 4: Treating the Stain If the initial pre-treatment fails to remove the stain completely, further treatment may be necessary. It is essential to tailor the treatment to the specific type of stain and fabric. For example, enzyme-based cleaners work best for protein-based stains, while vinegar and water solutions are more effective against mildew stains. Apply the chosen treatment and let it work its magic. It may take some time, but avoid rushing the process as it might cause damage to the garment. Step 5: Laundering the Garment Wash the garment based on its care label instructions, being careful to use the right detergent and water temperature. For particularly stubborn stains, you may consider using a pre-soak or adding a laundry booster to the wash cycle to increase the chances of stain removal. Step 6: Inspecting the Garment Before drying, always inspect the garment to ensure the stain is completely removed. If traces of the stain remain, repeat the treatment and washing process to try again. It is crucial not to dry the garment until the stain is entirely gone, as the heat can set the stain permanently. Step 7: Drying the Garment Carefully Drying your garment carefully is essential to avoid any potential damage, shrinkage, or color fading. If possible, air dry the garment by laying it flat or hanging it vertically to maintain its shape. Avoid direct sunlight or heat sources as it may cause fading or unnecessary stress on the fabric. If you must use a dryer, select the lowest heat setting and consult the garment's care label for specific drying instructions. Conclusion Treating stubborn stains and drying garments properly are essential skills for any individual looking to maintain their clothing's quality and prolong its life span. Remember that patience and attention to detail are key in successfully removing stains, preserving the fabric, and keeping your garments looking their best. With practice and knowledge, you'll soon become an expert in tackling even the most challenging stains and drying your clothing just right."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Only those of the Arrallin Insurrection inner team knew he was no common 'beta furry'. His silken fur, which would be tawny golden and striped with jet black bands, was dyed perfectly to a pure black, and his mane trimmed and thinned as to be indistinguishable from the rest of his coat. His eyes had been treated and darkened to a rich purple to disguise the brilliant golden yellow color that would mark him as an Alpha Arrallin, and leader of his hive.

When her grandmother needs to go to a nursing home, Carrie has to move in with her father Hank, a rancher in Wyoming, whom she hasn't seen since she was a baby. Initially reluctant to adapt to country living, Carrie soon meets Flicka, a beautiful black Mustang that previously had belonged to Carrie's cousin Katy, who asked Hank to look after Flicka when her father sold their own ranch. Flicka is wild and dangerous and, according to the ranchers, longs for Katy. However, when Carrie is attacked by a rattlesnake, Flicka saves her and the two form a bond. Carrie also meets Jake, an attractive ranch hand hoping to become a country singer, and Amy Walker, the proud and arrogant daughter of a neighbour. Although Jake and Carrie take an immediate liking to each other, there is instant animosity between Carrie and Amy, mainly because Amy also likes Jake.

Vivekananda Degree College was established in 2006. We want to find out if it has been more than 10,000 days ago or not.  First, let's count how many days are in a year. There are 365 days in a year (but remember, sometimes there are 366 days because of leap years!). Now we need to figure out how many years have passed since 2006. Let's say it's 2021, so that makes it 2021 - 2006 = 15 years. Now we just have to count how many days are in 15 years. We start with 15 years * 365 days/year = 5,475 days. But, we also need to add the extra days from leap years. Since 2006, there have been 4 leap years (2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020). So we need to add 4 extra days. That gives us 5,475 + 4 = 5,479 days.

More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature).

Donald Trump supporters spits on Latino protester at rally This is the latest face of civility at a Donald Trump rally: A man caught on camera cursing out an immigration activist and spitting on him. A video of that encounter is just one show of the tensions that erupted as the blabbering billionaire businessman brought his GOP presidential campaign to Richmond, Va., Wednesday night. Shortly after Trump started his speech to 5,000 people at the Richmond International Raceway, about a dozen Latino student protesters heckled him, shouting “We’re here to stay” and “Dump Trump,” according to reports from the scene. Trump supporters nearby stole the protesters’ signs, shoved them and yelled, “Go back where you came from!” Then came one troublemaking Trump lover, who spat in the face of one protester and yelled “F--- you!” eight times in 11 seconds until fellow fans pulled him away, as seen in video from a reporter. The hothead hasn’t been identified. Henrico County Police took one incident report at the rally, which did not involve spitting, and made no arrests, spokesman Lt. Chris Eley told the Daily News. This is at least the second time a xenophobic nut let loose at a rally for Trump, who has roused his supporters against undocumented immigrants. Less than a month ago, Trump remained silent as a man at a New Hampshire rally told him Muslims are “a problem in this country” and insisted, incorrectly, that President Obama is one. After public uproar about Trump’s non-response — which had no effect on his continuing dominance of GOP polls — the candidate said he was not “morally obligated” to correct the man. Unsurprisingly, Trump himself was in fighting mode as well Wednesday night, saving most of the venom in his hour-long speech for Democratic contender Bernie Sanders, whom he called a “maniac.” Trump said the proudly socialist Vermont senator is a “socialist-slash-communist,” and accused Hillary Clinton of trying to copy Sanders' views during Tuesday’s first Democratic debate. “She’s got to give everything away ‘cause this maniac that was standing to her right is giving everything away, so she’s following,” Trump said. “We have to be careful.” His remarks came the same day Trump’s campaign dropped an anti-Sanders ad online, saying the senator isn’t tough enough to handle a “dangerous” world with Islamic extremists in it. It’s unclear if Trump knew about the ruckus at his Richmond rally. After it ended, he posted a crowd photo on Instagram and wrote: “Incredible crowd in Richmond, Virginia tonight! So much spirit and energy!” What was this article about?","output":"This article describes an incident that took place during a Donald Trump rally in Richmond, Virginia. It highlights the tensions and lack of civility that were on display during the event. The incident involved a man spitting on a Latino protester and hurling expletives at him. This occurred when a group of Latino student protesters heckled Trump during his speech, with supporters getting into confrontations with them. The article also discusses Trump's rhetoric during his speech, focusing primarily on Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, whom he criticized for their positions on various issues. Additionally, it mentions an anti-Sanders ad released by Trump's campaign, which questioned the senator's ability to handle a dangerous world with Islamic extremists. Overall, the article sheds light on the aggressive tone and confrontational atmosphere present during the rally, both among Trump's supporters and the candidate himself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Describe the surroundings In order to immerse the reader, I will add details about the setting, creating a vivid atmosphere around James as he enjoys his meal. The dining room was warmly lit, with golden rays coming through the windows, painting the walls and table with their honeyed hue. The sound of laughter and clinking cutlery echoed throughout the room, as the whole family gathered around the large wooden table filled with various mouth-watering dishes. Step 2: Introduce the main dish Since the story already mentions steaming food, I'll introduce a specific, inviting meal as a focus for the story. The main course was a succulent roasted turkey, its skin evenly browned, and the aroma of herbs and spices enticing those seated around the table. James knew all too well that his mouth would water before even taking a single bite. Step 3: Describe the side dishes For a well-rounded dinner, side dishes are important to mention, giving the reader a sense of the variety and flavors of the meal. Alongside the turkey, there was an array of colorful side dishes; creamy mashed potatoes, crisp roasted vegetables, and soft, buttery dinner rolls. A few sweet dishes, such as candied yams and cranberry sauce, provided a delightful contrast to the savory bounty. Step 4: Focus on character interaction Now that the food is well-described, I will bring attention back to James and allow the reader to see his interactions with his family, making the story more dynamic and engaging.

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? making networks with new websites","output":"To describe the sentiment of the tweet \\"making networks with new websites\\", we need to evaluate the tweet for any positive or negative connotations, emotional tone, and intent. In this case, we can consider the tweet to be neutral to slightly positive. 1. Neutral Sentiment: The tweet can be seen as neutral as it conveys a plain statement about an activity, which is creating networks with new websites. No overt positive or negative emotions are expressed in the text. It purely narrates an action, leaving the reader to place their own interpretation on the perception and feelings associated with the action. 2. Slightly Positive Sentiment: However, if we dig a bit deeper into the context of networking and establishing connections with new websites, we can interpret the tweet as having a slightly positive sentiment. It suggests that the person tweeting is actively engaged in expanding their online presence, fostering relationships, or collaborating with others. This could imply the person is open to new opportunities and embraces growth, which can be seen as an optimistic perspective. To elaborate further, in the digital era, networking is a crucial aspect of professional and personal development. Creating connections with new websites might indicate that the individual is keen on exploring new territories, discovering new resources, or tapping into innovative digital landscapes. They may be enthusiastic about leveraging these connections for mutual benefit or for broadening their knowledge base. However, it is important to note that the absence of adjectives, emoticons, or any other grammatical context to emphasize feelings or emotions allows for multiple interpretations. Depending on the background of the reader or their familiarity with the tweet's author, this tweet could be perceived with more emphasis on the neutral or positive sentiment as described earlier. Without more context or knowledge of the individual's usual tone and communication style, it is difficult to pin down the exact sentiment. In conclusion, the sentiment of the tweet \\"making networks with new websites\\" can be considered neutral to slightly positive. It states an action without explicit positive or negative emotions, but the context of networking may evoke a sense of growth and opportunity, leading to an optimistic interpretation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Finally, the data mentions the official language spoken in this region: Spanish. The Spanish language, also known as Castilian, is a Romance language that originated on the Iberian Peninsula. It is spoken as a first language by around 460 million people worldwide, making it the second most spoken native language. Despite having regional linguistic variations like Valencian and Catalan, Spanish remains the predominant language in the Valencian Community. In summary, the provided data offers a detailed insight into the cultural, political, and linguistic landscape surrounding the traditional Spanish dish, Arròs negre. The dish is deeply rooted in the culinary heritage of the Valencian Community, which is governed by regional leader Ximo Puig. Spain, in turn, is presided over by King Felipe VI and speaks the Spanish language as their primary means of communication."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

First question: Computer Architecture: Why is context switching expensive on intel x86 chips? Second question: Why did the x86 architecture become more popular than the MIPS architecture? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: Computer Architecture: Why is context switching expensive on intel x86 chips? Step 1: Identify the components of context switching Context switching involves saving the current context (state and registers) of a task and loading the context of another task to resume its execution. Step 2: Explain the context switching mechanism in x86 chips In x86 chips, context switching can be more expensive due to a few factors, such as: - The complex variable-length instruction set, which can lead to more unpredictable pipeline behavior and increase the time it takes to save and restore task context. - A relatively small number of general-purpose registers, which makes it more likely that memory accesses will be needed during context switches, leading to additional overhead. - The hardware support for segmentation and paging, which requires updating segment and page tables during context switches, adds additional steps and complexity. Step 3: Provide the answer Context switching is expensive on Intel x86 chips due to its complex instruction set, small number of general-purpose registers, and hardware support for segmentation and paging, all of which contribute to increased overhead when saving and restoring task context. Second question: Why did the x86 architecture become more popular than the MIPS architecture? Step 1: Outline key differences between x86 and MIPS architectures The x86 architecture is a CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture, whereas the MIPS architecture is a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture. The key differences between them are in the complexity of the instruction set and the overall design philosophy. Step 2: Explain the factors that contributed to the popularity of x86 The x86 architecture became more popular than the MIPS architecture for several reasons: - Backward compatibility: x86 provided strong backward compatibility, making it possible to run older software on newer hardware with little to no modifications. - Market dominance: Early success with IBM's choice of x86 processors for its personal computers helped establish x86 as the standard architecture for PCs, creating a larger market for x86-based systems and software. - Investment in technology and manufacturing: Intel, the primary company behind x86, invested heavily in manufacturing facilities and research, enabling it to produce and improve the high-performance, cost-effective chips that fueled the growth of the personal computer market. - Ecosystem and support: As x86 gained popularity, the software and hardware ecosystem that formed around it created a positive feedback loop, further cementing its market leadership. Step 3: Provide the answer The x86 architecture became more popular than the MIPS architecture due to its backward compatibility, early market dominance driven by IBM's adoption, Intel's investment in technology and manufacturing, and the robust ecosystem and support that developed around it. Are these two questions asking the same thing? No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is about the expense of context switching on Intel x86 chips, and the second question is about the reasons behind the popularity of the x86 architecture compared to the MIPS architecture."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set.

Randy put toilet paper back on the roll, while Kevin did not, so","output":"their household had a major disagreement over this seemingly small issue. Randy believed in the importance of maintaining a clean and presentable home, which to him, included things like hanging the toilet paper properly. He had grown up in a household where orderliness was highly valued, and this mindset was deeply ingrained in him. He had observed that in both his parents' and grandparents' homes, such simple acts of tidiness went a long way in contributing to a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. On the other hand, Kevin was more of a free spirit. He had grown up in a more laidback household, where keeping things tidy was not a top priority. For him, replacing the toilet paper on the roll was nothing more than a trivial act that had little bearing on the overall aura of the home. He believed that love and laughter were what made a house a home, not necessarily the adherence to a strict regimen of cleanliness. The difference in their backgrounds and habits led to a clash between the two roommates. Randy could not fathom how something so simple could be overlooked and would find himself getting frustrated, while Kevin was baffled by the focus on such a minor detail. As they spent more time living together, their disagreements over the toilet paper were merely the tip of the iceberg; they discovered that they had vastly different approaches to managing shared spaces, such as the kitchen and living room. This friction affected their ability to enjoy each other's company and eventually led to serious conversations about the future of their living arrangement. In order to avoid further conflicts and maintain their friendship, Randy and Kevin decided to sit down and discuss the matter openly. They acknowledged that their respective upbringings had a major influence on their views and behaviors, and they agreed that it was important for both of them to compromise in order to create a harmonious living environment. They decided to establish certain ground rules, highlighting areas where they could both make concessions. Randy agreed to loosen up a bit on his expectations and not become too upset over small infractions, recognizing that Kevin's relaxed nature was part of his personality and actually brought some balance to their lives. Meanwhile, Kevin promised to be more attentive to keeping shared areas tidy and following the basic household etiquette that Randy held dear, such as replacing the toilet paper on the roll. With these new agreements in place, the tension in their home began to dissolve. They grew to appreciate the differences they brought to the table, and their friendship blossomed as they learned to navigate their contrasting perspectives. The toilet paper issue became a reminder of the importance of open communication, compromise, and accepting one another's unique backgrounds and beliefs. As months went by, Randy and Kevin's household transformed into a blend of their individual styles. They no longer saw their differences as a source of conflict, but rather as an opportunity to learn from one another and create a home that reflected both of their personalities. And so, the seemingly inconsequential matter of toilet paper placement turned out to be a valuable lesson in understanding, growth, and friendship for Randy and Kevin. Who knew that such a small detail could lead to such profound insights and change their lives in ways they could not have imagined?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Hip-pop Dancing Hip-pop dancing is popular with many young people today. They like it because they can invent their own moves. They use this dance to show their love for life. It also shows that they feel good about life, that they just want to be themselves and enjoy life, and that they are not afraid of problems. Hip-hop dancing has a history of more than 30 years. It first began in the 1980s in the US. In early times, it was seen in New York and Los Angeles. At that time, many young black people often danced to music in the streets.

Given the question: Given the following context:  Although the publicity generated by Five Leaves Left was minor, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it.\\"In 1971,...  answer the following question:  What was the last name of Drake's mentor?

What is the answer to this question? who sang the original nights in white satin?","output":"The original \\"Nights in White Satin\\" was sung, composed, and written by Justin Hayward, the lead vocalist and guitarist of the English rock band The Moody Blues. The song was first released as a single in 1967 and later appeared on their album \\"Days of Future Passed\\" the same year. This album was a groundbreaking fusion of classical and rock music, as the band collaborated with The London Festival Orchestra conducted by Peter Knight. \\"Nights in White Satin\\" has since become one of The Moody Blues' most famous and enduring hits, with its haunting melodies and poetic lyrics resonating with fans across generations. The song continues to be covered by various artists through the years, though none have eclipsed the original's timeless quality. Justin Hayward has been quoted as saying that he wrote the song when he was only 19 years old, inspired by an emotion of love and passion. Interestingly, the song didn't become a major hit until 1972 when it was reissued to much greater success, reaching number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. This popularity encouraged The Moody Blues to incorporate it into their live performances, and it remains a staple of their concerts to this day. The song's title refers to the feeling of longing and desire that the lyrics explore, with \\"white satin\\" symbolizing the emotions that surround love and the elusiveness of happiness. The song has been interpreted by many to be about unrequited love or the complexity of romantic relationships, making it a poignant and touching ballad that still connects with audiences today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

John von Neumann Von Neumann was the first to establish a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics, known as the Dirac–von Neumann axioms, with his 1932 work Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics. After having completed the axiomatization of set theory, he began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics. He realized, in 1926, that a state of a quantum system could be represented by a point in a (complex) Hilbert space that, in general, could be infinite-dimensional even for a single particle. In this formalism of quantum mechanics, observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as linear operators acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system.

Q:Given the below context:  At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in...

When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures.

Answer:","output":"Samuel wanted to get a haircut, and Kevin offered to cut it. However, Samuel wanted someone with experience cutting hair. He didn't want to risk ending up with an uneven or unsatisfactory haircut, especially since he had an important job interview scheduled for the following week. Samuel knew that first impressions were crucial, and he wanted to ensure that his physical appearance would be on point for this significant event in his life. Knowing that Samuel was rather particular about his hair, Kevin suggested that they visit a professional hair stylist. Kevin had a friend who was a hairdresser, and he knew that she was experienced in working with all sorts of hair types. He believed that she would be able to provide Samuel with the haircut that he desired and help him make a great first impression at his job interview. Reluctantly, Samuel agreed, and together they went to the hair salon where Kevin's friend worked. Upon arrival, they were greeted warmly by the stylist, who quickly assessed Samuel's hair and discussed several haircut options that would suit his face shape and personal style. After some consultation, Samuel decided on a classic taper haircut with a slightly modern twist, as he believed it would be the perfect blend of professional and stylish. While waiting for his haircut, Samuel browsed through the various hair care products displayed in the salon, looking for shampoo and conditioner specifically designed for his hair type. He knew that maintaining the health and appearance of his hair were essential to creating a polished and put-together look. As the stylist began working on Samuel's haircut, Kevin watched intently, taking note of the techniques she was using and asking questions to understand the process better. He hoped to improve his own hair cutting skills to offer better assistance to Samuel and other friends in the future. Throughout the haircut, the stylist offered helpful tips for Samuel to maintain the style after leaving the salon. She also discussed the importance of regular trims to keep the ends of his hair healthy and encouraged him to invest in quality hair care products to prolong the life of his cut. Once the hairstylist finished, Samuel looked in the mirror and was amazed at the transformation. His hair was expertly crafted into the perfect style that conveyed confidence and professionalism. He thanked the hairstylist for her excellent work and left the salon feeling like a new man, ready to tackle his upcoming job interview with confidence. In the end, although initially apprehensive about relying on someone with more experience for his haircut, Samuel felt grateful for Kevin's advice and the skilled work of the hairstylist. Sometimes, it is necessary to recognize when to trust in the expertise of others to achieve the best results possible. And in Samuel's case, that meant choosing a professional to handle his hair rather than relying on well-meaning amateur help from his friend. This experience also motivated Kevin to learn more about hair cutting techniques to become better at helping his friends in the future. Both Samuel and Kevin grew from this experience, learning the value of expertise and communication."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: how could God who killed whole populations of cities known to be homosexual now contradict Himself.

Life in the pub trade with just me and my parents working also became more difficult because of a severe illness that nearly overtook my mum . With just me and my dad working busy weekends it really did get frantic at times . Why might it be hard for me to get another job outside of the pub ?","output":"There may be several factors that can make it challenging for you to find another job outside of the pub trade. Here is a detailed analysis of some primary reasons: 1. Limited work experience: Having worked mostly within your family's pub trade, employers in other sectors may see your work experience as limited to a specific field. This could make it harder for them to understand and appreciate the transferable skills you may have developed during your time in the pub industry. 2. Long-term employment in a single industry: Working in the pub trade for an extended period might lead potential employers to perceive you as someone who is less adaptable to new work environments and roles. This perception might make them hesitant to consider you for positions in sectors that are significantly different from your experience. 3. Overspecialization: Throughout your years working in the pub trade, you might have acquired a highly specialized skill set tailored to the industry. While these skills are valuable in the pub sector, they may not necessarily translate well to other industries, limiting the range of roles you can apply for and potentially making your job search more challenging. 4. Education and qualifications: Your years spent studying after school without obtaining specific qualifications or degrees might make it harder for you to compete with other candidates who have more focused academic qualifications or certifications in their fields. 5. Personal and family circumstances: Your parents' illness and the challenges involved in keeping the pub business running might have affected your availability to fully engage in a comprehensive job search. Finding a job in a new industry typically requires dedicated time and energy, which can be difficult when managing personal and family commitments. 6. Network limitations: The majority of job seekers find new opportunities through personal and professional networks. If your social and professional circles revolve around the pub trade, you may need to actively work on expanding your network and connecting with people in other industries to increase your chances of finding job offers. 7. Lack of confidence: The combination of uncertain career goals, personal struggles, and work-related challenges might have led to low self-confidence, which can impact your pursuit of job opportunities outside of the pub trade. Confidence in oneself and one's skills is essential for a successful job search. To overcome these obstacles, it is critical to focus on identifying and developing transferable skills, acquiring relevant qualifications, expanding your professional network, and bolstering self-confidence. With persistence and determination, you can eventually find a job that aligns with your interests and skillset outside of the pub trade."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was a lovely Saturday afternoon, and they had decided to invite a few friends over for dinner. Knowing their strengths and weaknesses, the two friends agreed that Carrie would be in charge of preparing the meal, while Rebecca would take care of setting the table and playing hostess. Step 1: Discuss the menu The first thing Carrie did was discuss the menu with Rebecca. To cater to everyone's taste, they decided on a simple, classic menu: a salad for appetizer, a pasta dish for the main course, and a fruit salad for dessert. Step 2: Make a shopping list After deciding on the menu, Carrie quickly made a shopping list. She outlined all the ingredients needed for each dish, making sure to consider any dietary restrictions their guests might have. Step 3: Shop for ingredients Carrie and Rebecca headed to the nearby supermarket and picked up all the ingredients on the shopping list. Carrie carefully checked the freshness and quality of the produce, while Rebecca made sure to find the best deals on the items they needed. Step 4: Begin food preparation Once they returned to the apartment, it was time for Carrie to start preparing the meal. She began by washing and chopping the vegetables for the salad, then prepared a simple dressing from olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Next, she moved on to the pasta dish. Carrie opted for a classic marinara sauce, simmering crushed tomatoes, garlic, onion, and fresh basil to create a rich, savory aroma that filled the apartment. Step 5: Enlist Rebecca's help with easy tasks Although Rebecca wasn't skilled in the kitchen, Carrie knew she could still help with some tasks. She had Rebecca toast some bread for the salad and grate parmesan cheese for the pasta. This made the cooking process faster, and it allowed them to bond while working together.

The nervous system controls the muscles and maintains balance.   Q: What helps control the muscles and maintain balance?   A: Answer:","output":"The nervous system plays a critical role in helping control the muscles and maintain balance when riding a scooter. This complex network in our body is composed of various structures, pathways, and mechanisms that work together to ensure that we can move, perform tasks, and remain stable while doing so.  When riding a scooter, the process begins with sensory inputs from the body's proprioceptive system, which is responsible for detecting changes in muscle length, tension, and joint position. This information is then constantly relayed to the central nervous system (CNS), comprising the brain and spinal cord. The CNS processes this data and evaluates the body's position, alignment, and balance in relation to the scooter. In addition to proprioceptive information, the CNS also integrates information from other sensory systems such as the vestibular system, which is located in the inner ear and responsible for detecting head movement, and the visual system, which processes visual cues from the surroundings. These inputs allow the brain to assess the body's position and whether or not it is in balance, enabling it to respond quickly and adjust accordingly to maintain stability. Once the CNS has evaluated this information, it sends signals through the peripheral nervous system (PNS) to the muscles that are responsible for maintaining balance while riding. These signals, known as motor commands or action potentials, are transmitted through nerve fibers called motor neurons. These motor neurons connect with muscle fibers in a specialized junction called the neuromuscular junction, where the release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine triggers muscle contraction. By controlling the level of muscle contraction, the nervous system helps maintain the ideal position and coordination required for balance during scooter riding. For instance, core muscles, which are crucial for stability, need to be engaged properly. Also, the muscles responsible for moving the scooter forward or turning it – mainly located in the legs and feet – need to work in harmony with the rest of the body. Additionally, rapid reflexes and adjustments are essential for maintaining balance, especially when encountering irregular terrain or sudden obstacles. These involuntary responses are facilitated by the body's reflex arcs, which help bypass the relatively slower CNS processing by instantly reacting to sensory signals and producing automatic motor responses. Examples of reflexes at play while riding a scooter include the stretch reflex, which helps maintain muscle tone, and the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which keeps the eyes stable and focused on the visual environment despite head movement. In summary, the nervous system helps control the muscles and maintain balance when riding a scooter by constantly gathering sensory information, processing it within the central nervous system, and issuing motor commands via the peripheral nervous system. This intricate collaboration between various sensory systems and muscle groups enables the rider to make essential adjustments to stay upright, maintain equilibrium, and demonstrate a skillful ride."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If I tell you that Rivers turn rocks into soil, and ask you the question \\"what do rivers do to rocks?\\", is the correct answer \\"storing water\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"what do rivers do to rocks?\\" is not \\"storing water.\\" Instead, rivers contribute to the process of weathering and erosion of rocks, gradually breaking them down into smaller particles and eventually helping to form soil. Rivers accomplish this through a combination of physical and chemical processes. As the river water flows, it generates friction and force, which can dislodge and carry away rock fragments. Over time, this process can wear the rocks down, rounding and smoothing their surfaces, and reducing them to smaller particles known as sediment. Additionally, dissolved substances in the river water can cause chemical reactions with the rocks, further breaking them down. As a result, rivers play an important role in shaping the landscape and contributing to the formation of soil. While rivers do store and transport water, this is not directly related to their action on rocks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, the context and specific circumstances in each case will affect the accessibility and public availability of these toilets.  - Bathroom: This is the most obvious place where you would find a toilet. However, there is a significant distinction between private and public bathrooms. A bathroom in a person's house is not accessible to everyone. However, a public bathroom in a shopping mall, airport, train station, or other public places are meant for anyone to use. - Apartment: An apartment is a private space, so although it's likely that there is a toilet in it, it's not accessible to anyone unless the residents permit them to do so. Hence, an apartment is not typically where anyone can freely use a toilet. - Stall: The term 'stall' might refer to a toilet stall, which is again found inside a bathroom. These are generally public and meant for anyone to use. If 'stall' refers to a vendor's stall or a stable, it does not usually have a toilet. - Hospital: Hospitals have both public and private toilets. Public toilets in the lobbies and waiting areas are generally accessible to anyone. But the toilets in patient rooms or certain wards may be reserved for patients or specific users. - Rest Area: Rest areas, often found on highways and interstates, commonly provide public toilet facilities. These are available for all travelers or commuters to use during their journey, making them a great place to find toilets that anyone can use.

Article: A group of foreign residents married to Japanese talked about their children's names. Nicole Despres Students services manager, 40 (American) We have no intention to live outside Japan so it made sense for the kids to take my Japanese husband's family name. However, we did want to have a Western name too, so all three of them now have both a Western and Japanese name. We agreed there would be no strange names, spelling or unusual kanji(Chinese characters in the Japanese language). All names had to be easy to say and familiar in both Japanese and English.

How does the sentence end? Accra, March 6 1957. Tens of thousands of rejoicing people flood the streets of the city center. Shouts of \\"freedom, freedom\\" fill the air as men, women and children sing and dance, celebrating the birth of a new state and the beginning of a new era: an independent Ghana. At midnight on that historic day, Britain's Union Jack was taken down above Parliament House in the capital, replaced by Ghana's new flag -- a black star at the heart of a red, gold and green tricolor. At that moment, to the cheering of an ecstatic crowd, Ghana became the first African country south of the Sahara to break the chains of colonialism. The event triggered a liberation movement that was destined to sweep the entire continent and eventually lead to the demise of colonial rule in Africa. The country is often described as \\" OPTIONS: - Accra for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Africa for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - African for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Britain for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Ghana for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Gold Coast for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Great Britain for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Nation for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Parliament House for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Sahara for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Union Jack for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife.","output":"\\"Africa for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: A tender woman, or an independent one, which one would you prefer? Arecent research shows that most people would choose the latter. This type of woman is called a nuhanzi (\\"tough woman\\"). Experts believe these characteristics have social and psychological roots among young femalesin China. Su Hao's friends all call her a tough woman, because she can finish tough tasks usually carried out by men. For example, she carries 10-litre water to her dormitory on the 5th floor. \\"I depend on no one but myself,\\" she says. According to a recent survey by China Youth Daily, tough women have become rather common in society. Of the 21,265 respondents, 78.5 percent said they are familiar with a tough woman. About 50 percent said they like women with tough characteristics, while less than 29 percent expressed the opposite view. Why are tough women gaining popularity? Shen Meng, a psychological consultant, believes the fierce competition in society is contributing to this trend. \\"Women are often in a disadvantaged position compared to men,\\" Shen says. \\"In order to survive, they have to be independent, strong and tough.\\" Liu Xiao lin, professor of psychology at Wuhan Mental Health Center, believes tough women are brought up this way. They are often on close relationship with their fathers, who teach their daughters to be brave and decisive,\\" he says. As a result, these women are more likely to be psychologically healthy and more tolerant to stress, according to Liu. Though Liu believes that this is a good trend, Hu Shenzhi, a psychologist at the Guangdong Sunflower Counseling Center, says the popularity of tough woman indicates an unclear line between gender identities, which can lead to relationship problems. \\"Some women with characteristics that differ from the traditional female image may have a difficult time finding Mr Right,\\" he says.\\"Even if they get married, their manly characteristics might cause family conflicts. Question: Which of the followings does NOT belong to the characteristics of a tough woman? Options: A: She is soft and tender to others. B: She is independent of others in daily life. C: She is more tolerant to stress. D: She can solve problems usually for men. Answer:","output":"A: She is soft and tender to others."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: You should continue to wash your tattoo 2-3 times a day with antibacterial soap and lukewarm water until it's fully healed. This can take anywhere from 2 to 6 weeks, depending on the size and location of the tattoo.  While moisturizing is important, be careful not to smother the tattoo in lotion or ointment—a thin layer is all you need. Continue using an unscented mild soap when washing. As it heals, your tattoo will start to scab over, which is normal. Let the scabs dry out and fall off by themselves, and don't speed up the process by picking or scratching at the scabs. This can cause the scabs to fall off too soon, which can leave holes or light spots on the tattoo.  Dry, scabbing or peeling skin can become very itchy, but scratching at your tattoo may also cause scabs to fall off. Keep using moisturizing ointment to combat itchiness if it is a problem. The harsh rays of the sun may cause your skin to blister and bleach some of the colors from your tattoo. For this reason, it is best to keep your tattoo covered and away from the sun for at least 3 to 4 weeks until the initial healing is complete. Once your tattoo is healed, you'll want to wear sunscreen to prevent the tattoo from fading. Until your tattoo is fully healed, don't swim in a pool or the ocean. Avoid soaking in the bathtub as well. Exposing your tattoo to lots of water can pull the ink out of your skin and do damage to the tattoo's appearance. The water may also be carrying dirt, bacteria, or other chemicals that can infect your tattoo. It will be safe to resume these activities once your tattoo is healed, but for now you should stick to rinsing your tattoo in the sink or shower. Try not to wear tight or restrictive clothing on the area with your new tattoo, especially at first. As your tattoo heals, it will seep plasma and excess ink, which may cause the clothing to stick to the tattoo. The clothing will then be painful to remove and may rip off any freshly formed scabs.  If your clothing does stick to your tattoo, do not pull! First wet the area with water, which should loosen the clothing to where it can be removed without damaging your tattoo. Tight clothing will prevent enough oxygen from getting to your tattoo, and oxygen is essential for the healing process. If the tattoo covers a large surface area or is near your joints (such as elbows and knees), it may take longer to heal if the skin is forced to move around too much during physical activity. The movement will cause the skin to crack and become irritated, prolonging the healing process. If you work in a job that involves physical activity, such as construction or dance, you may want to consider having your new tattoo done right before you have a day or 2 off so it has time to heal before you return to work. What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of a longer text. So, for this article, the summary would be: To take care of a new tattoo, wash it 2-3 times a day with special soap and water, and put a little bit of special lotion on it. Don't scratch it, and keep it away from too much sun and water for about a month. Also, don't wear tight clothes on the tattoo and be careful with moving a lot if the tattoo is near places like elbows or knees. Doing these things will help the tattoo heal and look nice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Tässä kattavassa raportissa käsitellään Latinalaisen Amerikan alueen nykytilannetta ja tulevaisuudennäkymiä, ja siinä tarkastellaan erityisesti Euroopan unionin ja Etelä-Amerikan maiden välisiä suhteita. Raportissa tunnustetaan, että yhteistyö ja vuoropuhelu näiden kahden alueen välillä ovat välttämättömiä kestävän kehityksen saavuttamiseksi ja maailmanlaajuisten haasteiden kuten ilmastonmuutoksen, köyhyyden ja eriarvoisuuden torjumiseksi.

Multi-choice question: What is the sentiment of the following tweet? Tweet: I just setup My Twi page  Pick from: A). negative B). positive","output":"Based on the given tweet, it would be accurate to select B). Positive as the sentiment of the tweet. To understand why, let's start by breaking down the tweet and providing a more detailed explanation. The tweet reads: \\"I just setup My Twi page.\\" First, it's important to identify that the term \\"Twi\\" is most likely an abbreviation for \\"Twitter.\\" Thus, the user is talking about setting up their Twitter page. Now let's analyze the possible emotions or feelings conveyed through this tweet. The tweet does not contain any explicitly negative words or phrases, such as complaints, dissatisfaction, anger, or sadness. Instead, it is merely stating that the individual has completed the action of setting up their Twitter page. In this context, they might be feeling a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction from finishing the process. Furthermore, people usually share their achievements or positive experiences on social media to elicit reactions from others, such as likes, comments, or shares. Intuitively, people are less inclined to post about negative experiences or events that evoke unpleasant emotions. Considering the content and context of the tweet, we can reasonably infer that it carries a positive sentiment. While the tweet's phrasing may not be overtly enthusiastic, it conveys a subtle sense of excitement or eagerness to share their new Twitter page with others. People often announce their presence on a new platform, expecting others to connect with them, follow their updates, and participate in their online community, which typically stem from a positive stance. Therefore, option B). Positive would be the most suitable choice for describing the sentiment expressed in the given tweet. To recap, based on the analysis of the tweet content and the context it is shared in, we can confidently determine that the sentiment of the tweet is positive, making option B) the correct choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: What are some Filipino traditions? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Answer to Question 1:  Filipino traditions and beliefs largely stem from a mix of indigenous, Spanish, and American influences, as well as their Malay roots. The island nation of Cyprus, on the other hand, boasts of traditions and beliefs influenced by a blend of Greek, Turkish, and Middle Eastern cultures. Comparing and contrasting the two cultures reveals certain similarities and differences.  Examples of Filipino traditions and beliefs include: 1. Bayanihan: This is the spirit of community and helping one another, especially in times of need. Whenever someone needs to move their house, for instance, their neighbors would readily help. 2. \\"Mano po\\" gesture: Younger individuals show respect to their elders by taking the elder's hand and pressing the back of it to their forehead. This gesture signifies honor and gratitude. 3. Pagmamano: This tradition is observed during times of celebration, such as on New Year's Day and Christmas, where children receive blessings from their elders in the form of small gifts or money.  4. Simbang Gabi: A nine-day series of religious masses leading up to Christmas that start in the early morning, symbolizing the preparation for the birth of Jesus Christ. 5. Superstitions: Filipinos are generally superstitious, with beliefs surrounding various aspects of life, from weddings and funerals to acquiring good luck or warding off evil spirits. Examples of Cypriot traditions and beliefs include: 1. Kourabiedes and Melomakarona: Traditional sweets prepared and served during the Christmas season. 2. Easter Celebrations: Greek Orthodox Easter is the most important religious event in Cyprus, featuring various religious processions and customs, such as the Good Saturday Rocket War and the tradition of coloring eggs. 3. Weddings: Traditional Cypriot weddings involve a series of events and rituals, like the bride's \\"stolisma\\" where the bride is dressed in her wedding gown, or the \\"koumparo\\" and \\"koumbara\\" roles, which are given to the couple's best man and maid of honor. 4. Name Days: Celebrated in place of birthdays, name days are observed on the feast day of the saint one was named after. 5. Evil Eye: Cypriots share a belief in the \\"evil eye,\\" where envy or malicious intent can bring bad luck or misfortune to the person receiving it. To ward off the evil eye, people hang protective charms and amulets in their homes and cars. While there are differences between Filipino and Cypriot traditions and beliefs, some similarities can be drawn, such as the strong emphasis on family, respect for elders, and the importance of religious celebrations. Answer to Question 2: Some Filipino traditions include: 1. Bayanihan: The act of coming together as a community and helping one another in times of need. 2. \\"Mano po\\" gesture: A sign of respect and gratitude performed by younger individuals towards their elders by taking the elder's hand and pressing it to their forehead. 3. Pagmamano: The tradition of children receiving blessings and small gifts from their elders during festive occasions like Christmas and New Year's Day. 4. Simbang Gabi: A nine-day series of religious masses held before dawn, leading up to Christmas, symbolizing the preparation for Jesus Christ's birth. 5. Fiestas: Vibrant and colorful celebrations held in honor of patron saints, marked by parades, processions, and feasting on various Filipino dishes. 6. Harana: A serenade tradition where a man expresses his love and affection by singing romantic songs to the woman he is courting, usually outside her window. 7. Debut: A coming-of-age celebration for young women turning 18, signifying their transition into womanhood. 8. Panlilimos: A practice of soliciting donations during special occasions, such as birthdays and funerals, to help offset the financial burden of the event.

Who is exposed to sounds that are more dangerous?  Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. Jeremy is frequently exposed to sounds with high decibel levels due to being around these machines so often. Jeremy's brother, Alexander, on the other hand works in a library. Unlike Jeremy, Alexander is frequently exposed to sounds with very low decibel levels during his work.  Hint: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. Answer:","output":"Jeremy is exposed to sounds that are more dangerous, as he works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine, which produce high decibel levels.

Question: WHERE DOES CARLITO LEAD A WEALTHY MEXICAN-AMERICAN CRIME? Movie title: Crank Movie plot: Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is a Los Angeles-based British hitman, working for a crime syndicate headed by Carlito (Carlos Sanz). Chelios is contracted by Carlito to kill mafia boss Don Kim (Keone Young) as members of the Triads have been encroaching on Carlito's business. Chelios goes to Don Kim and apparently murders him. However, Ricky Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo), an ambitious small-time criminal uses the opportunity to conspire with Carlito against Chelios; Verona will kill Chelios so the Triads do not retaliate, and then take Chelios's place as Carlito's new hired gun. The morning after Don Kim's death, while Chelios sleeps in his apartment, Verona, his brother Alex (Jay Xcala), and several henchmen break in and inject Chelios with a Chinese synthetic drug which inhibits the flow of adrenaline, slowing the heart and eventually killing the victim. Chelios wakes to find a recording left by Verona showing what he has done. In anger, Chelios smashes his TV and heads out. Chelios phones Mafia surgeon Doc Miles (Dwight Yoakam), who informs Chelios that in order to survive he must keep his adrenaline pumping through constant excitement and danger, and he is unsure if the antidote exists. Chelios keeps his adrenaline up through reckless and dangerous acts like picking fights with other gangsters, taking illegal drugs and synthetic epinephrine, fighting with police, stealing a police officer's motorcycle, having public sex with his girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart), and driving his car through a shopping mall. Chelios visits Carlito at his penthouse and asks him to help find an antidote, as well as to find and kill Verona and his crew. Carlito says there is no antidote and only confirms that Carlito and Verona are working together. Carlito tells Chelios how he will use his death as a scapegoat against the Chinese. An angered Chelios leaves Carlito's penthouse to find Verona. Through Chelios' street contact, a transvestite named Kaylo (Efren Ramirez), he finds Alex at a restaurant and unsuccessfully interrogates him... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Crank,\\" Carlito leads a wealthy Mexican-American crime syndicate in Los Angeles. As the head of this powerful criminal organization, Carlito is responsible for various illegal activities and operations in the area. He contracts Chev Chelios, a British hitman, to take down Mafia boss Don Kim, as the Triads have started to threaten the syndicate's business interests. Carlito's crime syndicate is deeply involved in organized criminal activities, including but not limited to, drug trafficking, contract killings, extortion, and racketeering. While he is focused on maintaining control over his criminal empire, he becomes vulnerable to the ambitions of a small-time criminal named Ricky Verona, who conspires with Carlito to eliminate Chelios and take his place as the syndicate's primary hired gun. Throughout the movie, Chelios fights to stay alive and seeks revenge against those who have betrayed him. As the story unfolds, it becomes evident that Carlito is not to be trusted, and Chelios' relentless pursuit of adrenaline-fueled activities brings him closer and closer to his ultimate goal: exacting revenge upon his enemies and uncovering the truth. Ultimately, from an investment perspective, the film's proposal presents a high-octane, action-packed narrative with a strong cast including Jason Statham, Amy Smart, and Carlos Sanz. Whether or not to invest depends on several factors, such as the expected production budget, the potential audience, and comparables from similar film genres. If the movie aligns with your investment goals and preferences, it can turn out to be an exciting opportunity. In conclusion, Carlito leads a wealthy Mexican-American crime syndicate in Los Angeles, and the constant twists and turns of \\"Crank\\" offer a thrilling experience for viewers. Investing in the film proposal could prove to be a rewarding endeavor, provided the other factors mentioned above are taken into account."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Solve this instance: Background Paragraph: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).  Story: Robert and his brother Dale are both dairy farmers that primarily produce milk products. Both Robert and Dale have farms that approximately the same size. Dale prefers to produce milk conventionally, as he likes the way that conventional milk tastes. Robert, on the other hand, decided to switch to organic milk production after reading an article online about it.  Question: Whose farm, Robert's or Dale's, will produce lower emissions of methane?

Q:Bill is setting his cup on a table.

Water marks, also known as \\"coaster marks,\\" \\"condensation rings,\\" or \\"water rings,\\" are the marks left on surfaces, typically wooden ones, by the condensation from cold beverages or hot items such as cups or mugs. These marks are created when moisture from the cup or mug interacts with the table's finish, causing it to become cloudy, discolored, or even slightly raised. By using a napkin as a barrier between the cup and the table, Bill is protecting the table from any potential damage caused by the moisture and keeping the surface looking clean and unblemished. The other options provided do not accurately describe the purpose of placing a napkin under a cup on a table: - Noise: While placing a napkin under a cup might marginally reduce the noise made when setting the cup down, this is not the primary reason for doing so. - Knocking over: A napkin does not provide any significant stabilization to a cup, and will not prevent it from being knocked over if accidentally bumped or pushed. - Put down: This phrase does not make sense in the context of placing a napkin under a cup. \\"Put down\\" could refer to setting something down in general, but it does not specifically indicate the reason for placing a napkin underneath the cup. - Doesn: This option seems to be an incomplete or incorrect word, and does not provide any meaningful answer to the question. In conclusion, the best answer to the question of why Bill is putting a napkin under his cup on the table is to prevent the formation of a water mark on the table's surface, which can be both unsightly and potentially damaging to the table's finish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Speaking two languages can actually help offset  some effects of aging on the brain, a new study has found. Researchers tested how long it took participants to switch from one cognitive  task to another, something that's known to take longer for older adults, said lead researcher, Brian Gold, a neuroscientist at the University of Kentucky. Gold's team compared task-switching speeds for younger and older adults, knowing they would find slower speeds in the older population because of previous studies. However, they found that older adults who spoke two languages were able to switch mental activities faster than those didn't . The study only looked at life-long bilinguals, defined in study as people who had spoken a second language daily since they were at least 10 years old. Gold and his team asked 30 people, either bilingual or monolingual  , to have a series of tests. They found that bilingual people were not only able to switch tasks faster, they had different brain activity than their monolingual peers. Kristina called bilingualism \\"a beautiful natural experiment\\", because people grow up speaking two languages,and studies have shown that they get certain cognitive benefits from switching between languages and determining which to respond with based on what's going on around them. Gold said he grew up in Montreal, where he spoke French at school and English at home, prompting relatives to question whether his French language immersion would somehow hinder his ability to learn English. \\"Until very recently, learning a second language in childhood was thought of as dangerous,\\" he said. \\"Actually, it's beneficial. \\" Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Children of Men Movie plot: In 2027, after 18 years of global human infertility, civilization is on the brink of collapse as humanity faces extinction. The United Kingdom, one of the very few stable nations with a functioning government, is deluged by asylum seekers fleeing the chaos and war which have taken hold around the world. In response, the UK has become a militarized police state as British government forces round up and detain immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrants' rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son Dylan's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car, and they bury Julian in the forest as Theo breaks down crying over her death, as the group ditches their car for another to escape to a Fishes safe house. Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, as Julian had told her to trust only Theo. Julian had intended to hand Kee to the \\"Human Project\\", a supposed scientific group in the Azores dedicated to curing infertility; however, Luke persuades Kee to stay, and he is later voted as the new leader of the Fishes. Later that night, Theo eavesdrops on a meeting of Luke and other Fishes. He discovers that Julian's death was orchestrated by the Fishes so Luke could take over as leader, that they intend to kill Theo in the morning, and that they intend to use the baby as a political tool to support the coming revolution.

When an ally of the Ü-Tsang ruler threatened destruction of the Gelugpas again, the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso pleaded for help from the Mongol prince Güshi Khan (1582–1655), leader of the Khoshut (Qoshot) tribe of the Oirat Mongols, who was then on a pilgrimage to Lhasa. Güshi Khan accepted his role as protector, and from 1637–1640 he not only defeated the Gelugpas' enemies in the Amdo and Kham regions, but also resettled his entire tribe into Amdo. Sonam Chöpel urged Güshi Khan to assault the Ü-Tsang king's homebase of Shigatse, which Güshi Khan agreed upon, enlisting the aid of Gelug monks and supporters. In 1642, after a year's siege of Shigatse, the Ü-Tsang forces surrendered. Güshi Khan then captured and summarily executed Karma Tenkyong, the ruler of Ü-Tsang, King of Tibet.Soon after the victory in Ü-Tsang, Güshi Khan organized a welcoming ceremony for Lozang Gyatso once he arrived a day's ride from Shigatse, presenting his conquest of Tibet as a gift to the Dalai Lama. In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, Güshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Chöpel. Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \\"supreme authority\\" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign.

She must have liked Warner Brothers or Jack Warner catered to her more than the other studio bosses because she also used this studio to publicize her Hollywood Hotel radio program back in the day.

Write highlights for this article: When Sam Sheppard's boyfriend Ryan proposed to her it was, she says, more like 'being asked out for pizza'. So disappointing was this pivotal life moment that Sam decided to ensure no other women were ever let down in such a way again. So the 34-year-old from Gilwen, Monmouthshire, made it her mission to train men in the art of popping the question, founding The Proposal Expert, Wales' first bespoke wedding proposal planning service. On bended knee: Sam Sheppard, 34, right, launched her proposal expert company after her boyfriend Ryan, left, offered her such a disappointing one. Catering for clients with any budget - from £10 to £10,000 - Sam has already helped couples all over the UK get engaged, and boasts a 100 per cent success rate. She said: 'The idea came from my own disappointing experience - my boyfriend, Ryan Galeozzi, proposed to me during an argument in the same way you might ask someone if they'd like to go for a pizza. 'When he proposed I didn't even realise what he was asking. He said he spent too long looking and planning and in the end he just blurted it out. 'At the time I thought it was because. he didn't care enough to put any effort into it, but once he explained I. realised I was being silly. He said he wants to have another go, so now I'm just waiting.' You have got to be kidding: Sam doesn't want other women to be as let down as she was when their boyfriend's finally pop the question. She said: 'I want to help other people not to feel how I felt. Initially, I felt like he couldn't really care about me to have asked that way, though of course I know that's not true at all.' Sam spends up to three weeks planning the perfect way for the prospective groom - or bride - to propose. The client can choose from a number. of packages, ranging from an bespoke ideas consultation costing under. £100, to a full proposal planning service, where Sam organises every. aspect of the proposal, including negotiating a discount with venues and. vendors and handling payments. Sam added: 'I ask key questions to put together the pieces of the puzzle - what makes their partner laugh, how they spend their Saturday mornings - those little things build up a picture. 'Once we've got the idea, the proposer can then have as much or as little input as they like.' Be mine? Ryan and Sam have been together for four years, but Ryan says he is planning to propose all over again because Sam was so disappointed by his first attempt. Clients can even choose to have their proposal recorded or photographed with a paparazzi-style lens. Sam said: 'A lot of guys use Google for ideas and end up with something generic. They can become overwhelmed and a little bit paralysed with it. 'A good proposal can be lasting talking point, but a bad one can end up on YouTube for the whole world to see. 'I haven't heard any really wacky ideas yet - unless your partner is really wacky too those are best avoided.' Say cheese! Sam caters for clients with any budget, from £10 to £10,000, and says she builds up a picture of the couple and their relationship before putting together their 'proposal package' Sam's research has shown that most women prefer to be asked while their partner is on bended knee, and that a treasure hunt proposal is the most fail-safe option - just so long as it has been personalised to the couple. Sam, whose background is in marketing and teaching English, believes her creative flair and organisation have helped her to become The Proposal Expert. She said: 'A lot of my friends are male which has helped me to know how they think and what makes them tick. 'I know that they need help with this sort of thing and I'm here to give it to them. I can give them a female's perspective and they don't have to worry about being judged by their friends - or their girlfriend finding out. I offer absolute discretion. Meet the expert: 'This is a huge industry in America and the guys there are proud to have used a proposal planner. Their fiances usually love that they've used one too' Sam admits that most men she has helped choose not to tell the bride-to-be that they've used her services, but she believes that will change. 'This is a huge industry in America and the guys there are proud to have used a proposal planner,' she said. 'Their fiances usually love that they've used one too.

Build a movie plot around this: How old was Alan Parrish? 14 Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Jumanji Paradox\\" The movie opens with a 14-year-old boy, Alan Parrish, a vivacious and curious character always hungry for an adventure. Life in his peaceful town in New Hampshire is routine and monotonous until one day Alan stumbles upon a mysterious board game, Jumanji, while exploring an abandoned factory near his home. A key element here is Alan's inquisitive nature which leads him to discover the game, setting the movie plot in motion. For the next step, while playing the game at home with his best friend, Sarah, Alan gets sucked into the game, disappearing from the real world. His sudden disappearance shocks and confuses everyone in the town, setting in a feeling of mystery and unease. This step heightens the plot tension and introduces the central conflict of the story. To further build the plot, we transition to a 26-year later jump when siblings, Judy and Peter, move into the old Parrish home. They discover the game and start playing it, unleashing Alan who has aged in the game but is still mentally a 14-year-old. This time jump brings a twist in the plot, deepening the intrigue and mystery. Alan's return creates a flurry of mixed reactions from the town people: shock, fear, curiosity, and relief. Despite his physical appearance, his mental maturity is still that of a 14-year-old which leads to him having a hard time adjusting to the changes. This part of the plot exposes Alan's internal conflict and his struggle for acceptance, adding emotional depth to the story. The plot thickens as Alan realizes that the only way to restore peace, revert to his actual age and free others trapped in the game is to complete Jumanji. Alan, Judy, Peter, and a now-adult Sarah embark on a mission to finish the game despite the harrowing experiences Jumanji has to offer. This is the main turning point of the plot, showcasing our characters' bravery and determination. The climax features the group successfully finishing the game after overcoming numerous challenges, forcing everything caused by the game to revert, turning Alan and Sarah back into their 14-year-old selves.  Finally, the plot concludes with Alan and Sarah, having the memory of what happened. They toss the game into a river, ensuring it doesn't wreak any more havoc. As they grow, they hold onto their shared secret, bringing their friendship closer. This brings a satisfactory resolution and close to the movie, ending on a note of friendship, bravery, and maturity. Each step taken in the plot is laid out strategically to maintain the suspense, build-up towards the climax, and finally, give a fitting end to the story. It explores themes of adventure, friendship, and growth while revolving around the central question of Alan Parrish's age and the Jumanji game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Believing that Ray's soul still inhabits the doll, Tiffany crudely stitches it back together and reenacts the voodoo ritual which instilled Ray inside the doll ten years ago. The incantations seemingly fail to produce results, but Chucky suddenly springs to life and kills Tiffany's Goth admirer Damien while Tiffany looks on with excitement. Later, Tiffany and Chucky have an argument because Tiffany believed that Chucky wanted to marry her. Upon learning he had no intention of doing so, Tiffany locks Chucky in a playpen, and gives him another doll in a wedding dress to make fun of him. Chucky escapes the play pen and kills Tiffany by electrocuting her. He then uses the same voodoo ritual to transfer her soul into the bride doll so she could feel what he went through as a living doll.

Select from the following. [-] like she's gaining new experiences [-] bored and worthless [-] bored and stupid Answer:","output":"Bailey would most likely feel like she's gaining new experiences. A jungle safari is a unique and exciting adventure that offers the opportunity to witness wildlife in their natural habitat. Observing monkeys in the wild is a rare experience that not many people get to have, so this would likely be fascinating and enriching for Bailey. In addition to the excitement of seeing wild animals like monkeys up close, going on a jungle safari often includes other activities such as trekking through dense forests, learning about the native flora and fauna, and visiting remote villages and local communities. These activities further contribute to the sense of gaining new experiences, as Bailey would be exposed to different aspects of the culture, environment, and wildlife that might be unfamiliar to her. It is less likely that Bailey would feel bored and worthless or bored and stupid, as a jungle safari presents an opportunity for adventure, learning, and personal growth. These experiences would generally generate feelings of satisfaction, wonder, and fulfillment, rather than boredom or worthlessness. Additionally, engaging with new and exciting experiences often leaves people feeling more knowledgeable and well-rounded, rather than feeling stupid.

Public relations representatives from Wendy's corporate office issue a formal apology, acknowledging the mistake and emphasizing the company's commitment to ensuring customer safety. Amy Seiber, now unemployed due to her actions, realizes the gravity of her mistake and decides to seek help for her substance abuse problem.

Movie title: Balls of Fury Context: this first appeared on www.realmoviereview.com Ben Garant joined with fellow Reno 911!er, Thomas Lennon to write this comedy, before getting behind the lens for his first feature film, while Lennon took the supporting role of German champion Karl Wolfschtagg. However, the star here is Dan Fogler, in a Jack Black kind of role as a Ping Pong protégé turned has-been, Randy Daytona. The acting is fine, and its always great to see Christopher Walken back on screen. The story is pretty much a by-the-numbers spoof of Bruce Lees Enter the Dragon, with some James Bond, Scarface and every clichéd martial arts film ever made. The script, the bread and butter of every comedy, is only passable, with more smiles and chuckles than laughs.Randy Daytona loses the 1988 Olympic Gold medal for ping-pong, and his father on the same day, and becomes a has-been haunted by his line, Im going to Disneyland. Daytona gets another chance when he is approached by FBI agent, Ernie Rodriguez (played by George Lopez), to go undercover at an underground ping-pong tournament run by the evil criminal emperor, Feng (Walken).

But does it feel like your parents are stressing you out with their love? Do you often fight with them?   Hu Muqing, 16, of Shenyang, complains that his parents only care about his grades and not his other needs. He and his parents fight the most about the time he spends watching TV and on the Internet. \\"They think because I'm in high school I should concentrate on my work,\\" the Shenyang teenager said. \\"However, I need to be able to relax. Most of my friends can watch TV and surf the Web a lot. There are times when it's hard to talk to them.\\" After some talks, Hu has been allowed to watch TV for 15 to 20 minutes every night, but has been told to keep away from the computer.  Since she feels she's grown up now, Shen Ying, 17, wants more respect from her parents. \\"My father shouts at me when he's in a bad mood  . He doesn't listen to me, but instead acts like, 'I'm the boss'!\\" said the teenager from Mianyang, Sichuan province. \\"I'd like my parents to treat me like a friend and understand that respect is a two-way street.\\"     \\"It's the age when teenagers are becoming more independent  . But their parents are very concerned   about their kids' futures,\\" said Sun Yunxiao, a senior researcher at the China Youth and Children Research Center. Sun suggests that teenagers should learn to communicate with their parents effectively  .   \\"Find the right time for a talk. On Mother's Day or Father's Day, say 'Thank you' to your parents or give them a small gift with a letter so they can get inside your head a little,\\" he advised. Sun also believes that teenagers have to work to earn trust and respect from their parents.  \\"You need to make sure they know that you're not going to screw up your exams or let them down. Let them know that you want to do well, and that you will do well,\\" he said. Question: The reason why teenagers always fight with their parents is that_.

Critics say that is not nearly enough compared with other prescribers, such as M.D. psychiatrists or nurse practitioners who have at least six years' medical education and clinical experience. Neither Davison nor most other RxP opponents doubt the efficacy of medications. Their greatest objection is to the notion of turning psychology into a prescribing profession. In a field that has struggled long and hard to prove that mind, mood and behavior can be studied empirically, the past decade, Davison says, has seen \\"exciting developments\\" that demonstrate the validity of various psychotherapeutic interventions and the psychosocial-behavioral models on which they are based. \\"The timing is peculiar to abandon psychological science or to convert it to a medical science,\\" explains Elaine M. Heiby of the University of Hawaii, who chairs a committee of the 1,000-member American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology that is concerned about the medicalization of psychology. \\"Making sure that practicing psychologists are giving patients interventions based on the best available psychological science should be the APA's priority,\\" argues Emory University's Scott Lilienfeld, president of the Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology (SSCP). More than any philosophical betrayal of psychology, RxP opponents fear that the movement will undermine the science they love. They believe that if prescriptive authority becomes the norm, biomedical requirements will inevitably seep into the psychology curriculum, at the expense of traditional psychological science and methodology. Lilienfeld feels that many clinical psychologists already receive inadequate training in fundamentals such as research design and evaluation. RxP opponents charge the APA with pushing its prescription-privileges agenda without adequately assessing support for it in the field. The 300-member SSCP is the only group within the APA to have taken a formal stance against prescription privileges. The APA has scheduled 30 minutes at its meeting in August for an RxP debate, but its leadership believes it already has an accurate sense of support for its RxP policy. \\"Except for this small vocal minority, we have just not gotten a lot of groundswell against this from members,\\" says APA president Philip G. Zimbardo of Stanford University. With prescription privileges now a reality in one state, some RxP opponents concede that it may be too late. This year four states besides New Mexico -- Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois and Tennessee -- have pending legislation for psychologist prescription privileges. Over the past decade, 14 state legislatures have considered such laws. Between 1991 and 1997, a U.S. Department of Defense psychopharmacology demonstration project involving two to four years' training produced 10 military psychologists who can write prescriptions.

Look at the face of the person you're talking to. Notice how light affects the shadows and the shape of their features. Pay special attention to how light looks on certain textures like clothing and skin.  Noticing these things will help you gain a better understanding of how real objects look with different types of light hitting them. As a fun exercise, try to describe objects without using their names to help you visualize and capture shapes. For example, if you’re looking at a tree, you might describe the trunk as a sloping cylinder and the leaves as tiny lemon shapes. When you're looking at something, notice any color variations and how that causes your eyes to want to linger or move to another area. Note the subtle hues within a certain color (like all the different shades of red on an apple). For instance, if you're looking at a brightly colored tulip, note how the hot pink petals contrast with the soft green hue of the stem and how your eyes are drawn to the lighter tips of the petals. Take time to squint your eyes at a particular thing, landscape, or scene. Squinting minimizes your eyes ability to see color and detail and blurs the distinctions between things. This is especially helpful if you want to paint a mass of individual things that are far away like a landscape or a forest full of trees. Squinting will also help you distinguish between shadows and light. When you're looking at a particular object or scene, notice the background space (like a wall, table, or backdrop). Allowing negative space in your paintings will give it a sense of balance or tension depending on the scene and overall esthetic. For example, take note of the colors, shadows, and textures of objects behind the central objects you'd like to paint. For instance, a burnt orange wall with a diagonal shadow can make the candles and flowers in the foreground stand out more. Notice how certain objects are put together to create shapes or lines. The geometry of a particular scene or collection of objects draws the spectator’s in a particular pattern. For example, imagine a still scene of a bookstore. The aisle on the left creates a line that moves the eye vertically, a string twinkle lights between shelves might move the eye across the top, and another shelf encourages the eye to move up or down. The vertical eye movements on each side of the painting might act as a sort of frame for the still-life piece. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, the article discusses the importance of observing the color, shape, texture, and size of objects in our everyday surroundings to gain a better understanding of how light affects their appearance. It provides tips and exercises, such as describing objects without naming them and squinting to better distinguish shadows and light. The article emphasizes the significance of negative space, noting the background and how objects create shapes or lines within a scene.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The hellish exoplanet that you will never want to visit, even if you could An international team of scientists has used a ground-breaking technique to study the atmosphere of an Earth-sized exoplanet for the first time, revealing an utterly inhospitable but equally fascinating world. Lead by scientists from University College London in the UK, the group were able to observe the surprisingly dense atmosphere of exoplanet 55 Cancri e using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and a swathe of new analysis techniques. The team’s research, soon to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, indicated that the atmosphere of 55 Cancri e comprised largely of hydrogen and helium, but the absence of water vapour suggested that finding life on this far-flung world was highly unlikely. “This is a very exciting result because it’s the first time that we have been able to find the spectral fingerprints that show the gases present in the atmosphere of a super-Earth” said Angelos Tsiaras, a PhD student who helped develop the techniques used to analyse the atmosphere of 55 Cancri e. “The observations of 55 Cancri e’s atmosphere suggest that the planet has managed to cling on to a significant amount of hydrogen and helium from the nebula from which it originally formed.” While 55 Cancri e is described as a ‘super-Earth’ due to its close approximation in size, that is where the comparisons end. A year on 55 Cancri e is just 18 hours long. (ESA/Hubble, M. Kommesser) Artists impressions of the distant planet, which orbits a different sun-like star to Earth, reveal an incredibly dangerous and hellish landscape, where a year is just eighteen hours long and where temperatures soar to over 2000 degress celcius – hot enough to melt titanium. Apart from hydrogen and helium, the data also revealed hints of hydrogen cyanide in the atmosphere, an extremely toxic and explosive compound that can kill humans within minutes. The scientists were able to make the observations by sweeping the Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) quickly across the parent star to reveal the spectrum of its starlight. The data was then analysed by software to reveal the spectrum of 55 Cancri e, illuminated by the light of the star it orbits. Little was previously known about 55 Cancri e before these close observations, only that it had a mass approximately eight times that of Earth, and that it was roughly 40 light years from Earth. The planet has made headlines in previous years after research determined that its interior is carbon-rich, leading to the nickname “the diamond planet”.","output":"An international team of scientists, including researchers from University College London, have used the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to study the atmosphere of Earth-sized exoplanet 55 Cancri e for the first time.

Gordon Banks  (born 30 December 1937) is a former England international football goalkeeper. He made 628 appearances during a 15-year career in the Football League, and won 73 caps for his country. Regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, the IFFHS named Banks the second-best goalkeeper of the 20th century - after Lev Yashin (1st) and ahead of Dino Zoff (3rd). He was named FWA Footballer of the Year in 1972, and was named FIFA Goalkeeper of the Year on six occasions. Banks was born in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and brought up in the working-class area of Tinsley. The family later moved to the village of Catcliffe after his father set up a (then-illegal) betting shop. This brought greater prosperity but also misery; one day Banks's disabled brother was mugged for the shop's daily takings, and died of his injuries some weeks later. Banks left school in December 1952 and took up employment as a bagger with a local coal merchant, which helped to build up his upper body strength. He spent a season playing for amateur side Millspaugh F.C. after their regular goalkeeper failed to turn up for a match; the club's trainer spotted Banks amongst the spectators and invited him to play in goal as he was aware that Banks had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys. His performances there earned him a game in the Yorkshire League for Rawmarsh Welfare, however a 12-2 defeat to Stocksbridge Works on his debut was followed by a 3-1 home defeat, and he was dropped by Rawmarsh and returned to Millspaugh. Still aged 15, he then switched jobs to become a hod carrier.  He was scouted by Chesterfield whilst playing for Millspaugh, and offered a six-game trial in the youth team in March 1953. He impressed enough in these games to be offered a part-time PS3-a-week contract by manager Teddy Davison in July 1953. The reserve team were placed in the Central League on account of a powerful club director rather than on merit, and Banks conceded 122 goals in the 1954-55 season as the \\"Spireites\\" finished in last place with only three victories. Banks was posted to Germany with the Royal Signals on national service, and won the Rhine Cup with his regimental team. He recovered from a fractured elbow to help the Chesterfield youth team to the 1956 final of the FA Youth Cup. There they were beaten 4-3 on aggregate by Manchester United's famous \\"Busby Babes\\" - a team that included both Wilf McGuinness and Bobby Charlton.  Banks was given his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, at the expense of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2-2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the following match; by the end of the 1958-59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for PS7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to PS15 a week.","output":"This text is about Gordon Banks, a former England international football goalkeeper."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1906, Edith G. Willcock and Frederick Hopkins showed that the amino acid tryptophan aids the well-being of mice but it did not assure their growth. In the middle of twelve years of attempts to isolate them, Hopkins said in a 1906 lecture that \\"unsuspected dietetic factors,\\" other than calories, protein, and minerals, are needed to prevent deficiency diseases. In 1907, Stephen M. Babcock and Edwin B. Hart conducted the single-grain experiment, which took nearly four years to complete. The answer is:","output":"Frederick Hopkins did not measure caloric count in animals. While Carl von Voit and Max Rubner independently measured caloric energy expenditure in different species of animals, Frederick Hopkins, along with Edith G. Willcock, focused on the role of the amino acid tryptophan in the well-being of mice and the importance of other \\"unsuspected dietetic factors\\" in preventing deficiency diseases."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lastly, the adverb \\"so\\" is used here as an intensifier to emphasize the degree or extent to which someone or something is heartwarmingly motivating. It suggests that not only is the motivation present, but it is also exceptionally powerful and emotionally resonant. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"They so heartwarmingly motivate\\" is positive.

Elliot Hopper is a workaholic widower who is about to land the deal of a lifetime at work, which he hopes will win him a promotion and a company car. After he forgets his daughter Diane's birthday, he attempts to make it up to her by promising her she can have his car when he secures the deal at work on the coming Thursday. After being persuaded to give the car to his daughter early, Elliot must hail a taxi from work, which is driven by Satanist Curtis Burch, who drives erratically and is of control.

Sentenced: Devon Jenkins, 16, has been sentenced to probation and community service after acting as a lookout while his friend's grandmother was killed last year. A 16-year-old boy who acted as a lookout while his friend's grandmother was ambushed, strangled and stabbed in her Minnesota home was today sentenced to probation and community service. Devon James Jenkins must complete a. youth correctional program, perform 100 hours of community service and. serve probation until age 21 over the murder of 79-year-old Lila Warwick. 'I go to bed every night thinking about the awful things I did,' Jenkins told Kandiyohi County Court about the July 2013 incident. Jenkins, who had smoked marijuana on the night of the murder, told the court he's been in chemical dependency treatment since October and wants to get his high school diploma, work with his dad in the drywall business and go to Ridgewater College to get his general classes, according to The Global Dispatch. As Jenkins apologized in court for his actions, Warwick's daughter Cheri Ekbom said she did not hate her mother's attackers. She did not comment on the sentence. 'Maybe it seemed like such an innocent thing to get in that car that night,' she said, according to Star Tribune. 'As a result of that choice, the life of a human being - my mother - was violently taken from us. It will also cost you five years of your life. 'To hate you would bring dishonor to my mom and only allow the darkness...to continue.' Jenkins was the youngest of three defendants charged over Warwick's tragic death. Prosecutors said the church volunteer's own grandson, 18-year-old Robert Warwick, masterminded the deadly plan that led 19-year-old Brok Junkermeier to choke and stab the woman. Junkermeier was charged with intentional second-degree murder, without premeditation, and his trial is in March. Warwick's trial has not been scheduled. Victim: Lila Warwick, 79, was found strangled and stabbed to death in her Minnesota home last year. Crime scene: Lila Warwick was found dead in the basement of her Willmar, Minnesota, home last year. According to the charging documents, Warwick believed that his grandmother had more than 40,000 in a safe. The trio had reportedly been planning to kill Warwick and steal her money for some time. Warwick's body was found after she. failed to show up at a meeting at Redeemer Lutheran Church, where she. was a volunteer. ‘Upon. entering into the garage and home, deputies found evidence of homicidal. violence and found the body of Ms. Warwick who was deceased,’ one of the. juvenile petitions said. Preliminary autopsy results showed she died from complex homicidal violence involving multiple stab wounds and strangulation. After the murder, witnesses told authorities they heard Junkermeier talk previously about killing Warwick and stealing her money, but both thought he was joking. One of the witnesses said that the day after the killing, Junkermeier came to him and talked about the burglary and attack. Charged: Prosecutors say Warwick's own grandson Robert Warwick, 18 (right) masterminded the attack while Brok Junkermeier, 19 (left) choked and stabbed the woman. According to the charges, Junkermeier told his friend that he and another teen drove to Warwick's house in the 3000 block of U.S. Highway 12 East at around 4am on July 29 and lay in ambush. The 19-year-old had previously obtained a key to get into Warwick's garage, and went inside wearing a mask and gloves while Jenkins stayed in the car as a lookout. Junkermeier waited two hours for Warwick to enter the garage, then ambushed her and slashed her hand with a 20-inch knife. The suspect told his friend that while the elderly woman was bleeding heavily, he forced her to access her bank account online and write him a check for 1,500. Prosecutors say Junkermeier later deposited that money into his account. Callous: Charges state that after the murder, Junkermeier and Jenkins (pictured) went to a McDonald's for a snack before heading home. Junkermeier told his confidant he then began to strangle Warwick, and when he saw she was not dead, he stabbed her multiple times before dumping her in the basement, the charges said. The charges state that soon after Warwick’s gristly murder, Junkermeier and Jenkins went to a nearby McDonald’s for a snack and then headed home, The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. At around 2pm that day, Junkermeier and Robert Warwick returned to Lila Warwick's house and took a safe. The duo stopped by the house again at around 5pm and saw police officers on the scene. The charges said Junkermeier confessed to the killing when he was arrested and told police where to find the bloody knife. Pillar of community: Lila Warwick, right, pictured with her daughter, Cheri Ekbom, was a grandmother to eight children, great-grandmother to two others and volunteered at Redeemer Lutheran Church in Willmar. Bloody gym shoes, a safe and 30 1,000 savings bonds in Warwick's name were found at Junkermeier's house, the complaint said. At the time of the incident, Cheri Ekbom said her nephew was a drug addict who hated his grandmother and wanted her dead. Junkermeier, a 2012 graduate of Willmar High School, has had some previous run-ins with the law involving theft-related charges and was on probation at the time of Warwick's death. Former classmates described Junkermeier to Echo Press as a big sports enthusiast who did not have many friends in school and was often picked on. Graham Dahl, 19, called Junkermeier a stone-faced 'weird kid' who had little respect for his teachers and would sometimes get ejected from class for acting out. Warwick had eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. She and her husband, who died in 1976, had lived in Willmar since 1969.","output":"The 16-year-old boy, Devon James Jenkins, who acted as a lookout whilst his friend's grandmother was stolen from her home and subsequently killed, has been given a sentence of probation and is expected to complete over 100 hours of community service. In addition to this, the defendant will be required to participate in a youth correctional program. Jenkins was one of the youngest of the defendants who were charged concerning the murder of 79-year-old Lila Warwick. He allegedly acted as a lookout while the crime was committed by two other individuals - 18-year-old Robert Warwick, grandson to the victim, and 19-year-old Brok Junkermeier. Robert, accused of masterminding the crime, believed that his grandmother was in possession of more than 40,000 in a safe, and the trio had been allegedly planning to kill Warwick and steal her money for some time. Junkermeier, the main executor of the crime, is charged with intentional second-degree murder, without premeditation. His trial is scheduled for March and Robert Warwick's trial is not yet scheduled. The physical violence inflicted on Warwick involved multiple stab wounds and strangulation, as revealed by preliminary autopsy results. Post the murder, witnesses have reported hearing Junkermeier admitting to the crime, divulging about the burglary, the attack, and also how he coerced the bleeding Warwick to give him access to her online bank account and made her write a check for 1,500, which he later deposited into his account. Revealing the gruesome details of the crime, Jenkins reported how Junkermeier, despite two hours of waiting and initial slashing, needed to strangle and stab Warwick repeatedly until she died. Following her murder, their alleged nonchalance was demonstrated by their trip to McDonald's before heading home. Later the same day, Junkermeier and Robert returned to Warwick's house to retrieve the safe. They paid another visit around 5 PM only to find police officers on the scene. Junkermeier was arrested shortly after, where he confessed to the crime and also disclosed the location of the murder weapon. Evidence found in Junkermeier's house include bloody gym shoes, a safe, and 30 1,000 savings bonds in Warwick's name. Former classmates and teachers from Willmar High School remember Junkermeier as a disrespectful 'weird kid' with a stone face. The deceased, Lila Warwick, was a church volunteer at the Redeemer Lutheran Church, a pillar of her community, and a grandmother to eight and a great-grandmother to two. Despite the brutal loss of her mother, Warwick's daughter Cheri Ekbom, stated that she did not harbor hatred towards the attackers, asserting that hatred would bring dishonor to her mother.

First, we need to simplify the equation by combining the terms with j on the right side. The equation is: 151j = 709j - 3j - 12765 Step 2: Simplify the right side of the equation. Combine the j terms on the right side: 151j = (709 - 3)j - 12765 151j = 706j - 12765 Step 3: Subtract 706j from both sides of the equation to isolate the j terms on one side: 151j - 706j = 706j - 706j - 12765 This can be simplified to: -555j = -12765 Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by -555 to solve for j: (-555j) / (-555) = (-12765) / (-555) This simplifies to: j = 23 So, the solution for j is 23."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:Margaret Gleeson, 70, died two days after a routine hernia operation at Wigan's Royal Albert Edward Infirmary. Valerie Taylor told Bolton Coroner's Court she had \\"no excuse\\" for the failure in October 2015. It led to an artificially low rating of Mrs Gleeson's health risk, the inquest heard. Valerie Taylor was one of several medics questioned about omissions from patient notes during the second day of the inquest. She turned to Mrs Gleeson's family while giving evidence and apologised, saying: \\"I didn't score a urine output and I've no excuse for that. I can only apologise wholeheartedly.\\" Staff nurse Sian Parkinson, who was in charge of the nursing staff on the ward, told the inquest she had not been overly concerned about Mrs Gleeson's condition. Asked about missing details from the records, she said: \\"Sometimes you're that busy you don't have time to record.\\" Mrs Gleeson's daughter, Julie Barnes, had earlier told the inquest that when the family visited the hospital the afternoon after the operation her mother was pale, waxy, vomiting repeatedly and in pain. The inquest has heard internal tissue was torn during the procedure but there was a delay running blood tests and medics did not realise she was seriously ill until the early hours of the Sunday morning. A leading surgeon at the hospital, Dr Marius Paraoan, told the inquest she may have survived if she had been treated sooner. Dr Paraoan, one of the authors of an internal hospital report into Mrs Gleeson's death, said mistakes were made and that \\"the sooner the operation is done, the lower the mortality rate.\\" But he disagreed with claims that delays spotting the \\"very rare\\" complications and treating her were the result of weekend staffing levels. On the first day of the inquest, the surgeon who oversaw the operation said weekend staffing levels affect the care patients receive at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary.

Question: Bobby and Will were two friends attending a genetics course.  Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals. Will studied a large, healthy population of the same species.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person didn't observe any loss in genetic diversity?  Hint: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led... Answer:","output":"Will did not observe any loss in genetic diversity. The explanation for this lies in the differences between the populations Bobby and Will studied, as well as the potential consequences of reduced population size on genetic diversity. Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals, whereas Will studied a large, healthy population of the same species. One of the significant issues faced by smaller and isolated populations is the decline in genetic diversity due to declines in population size. An observable consequence of decreasing genetic diversity is the Allee effect, which refers to the reduced fitness of a species resulting from a decline in population size and reduced gene pool. This decrease in fitness is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Some examples of the risks associated with smaller populations include genetic drift, inbreeding depression, and fixation of deleterious alleles. A smaller gene pool has a higher chance of a stochastic event in which harmful alleles become fixed through genetic drift. Furthermore, natural selection is less likely to remove mildly deleterious alleles that act later in life in smaller populations than in larger ones. As a result, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost through random chance in smaller populations. On the other hand, larger populations exhibit more genetic diversity, diminishing the likelihood of genetic drift, inbreeding depression, and fixation of deleterious alleles. In Will's case, since he was studying a large, healthy population of the same species, he was more likely to observe greater genetic diversity and a relatively reduced effect of the aforementioned factors. This would have led to a more robust representation of the species' gene pool and potentially improved overall fitness. An example that highlights the importance of maintaining genetic diversity is the case of the Florida panther. This endangered species experienced a genetic bottleneck due to a reduced population size, leading to defects like lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, and other physical abnormalities. A genetic rescue plan involving the introduction of female pumas from Texas into the Florida population ultimately improved genetic diversity and the species' overall fitness. In summary, while Bobby likely observed a loss in genetic diversity in the small, isolated population he studied, Will did not observe any such loss due to the larger, healthier population he investigated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: If I tell you that Wind can lead to a deterioration of soil quality, and ask you the question \\"what can lead to a deteroriation in soil quality?\\", is the correct answer \\"rain\\"? Available choices: [a]. Yes; [b]. No; A:","output":"[b]. No; Although your initial statement mentions that wind can lead to a deterioration of soil quality, when asked \\"what can lead to a deterioration in soil quality?\\", the correct answer should not be limited to \\"rain\\" because there are numerous factors that can negatively impact soil quality. The deterioration of soil quality can occur due to several reasons, including: 1. Wind erosion: As mentioned in the given statement, wind can transport soil particles and erode the topsoil, making it less fertile and nutrient-rich. This can further lead to the loss of organic matter and contribute to desertification in some areas. 2. Water erosion: Rain, or more specifically, water runoff, can lead to soil erosion and the removal of nutrient-rich topsoil. Heavy rainfall causes water to flow over the soil surface, taking away valuable nutrients and minerals, reducing fertility, and exposing the soil to further erosion. 3. Soil compaction: This occurs when the soil is compressed due to the heavy weight of machinery, livestock, or human activity. Compaction reduces pore space between soil particles, limiting the flow of water, air, and nutrients. This can result in poor root development, reduced plant growth, and an overall decline in soil quality. 4. Loss of soil organic matter: Soil organic matter (SOM) is crucial for maintaining soil fertility, water retention, and nutrient cycling. Agricultural practices, such as intensive tillage and monoculture, can lead to the depletion of SOM, negatively impacting soil quality. 5. Chemical contamination: Overuse of fertilizers, pesticides, and other agrochemicals can cause contamination, leading to an imbalance of nutrients, soil acidification, and the death of beneficial microorganisms in the soil. This can ultimately deteriorate the quality of the soil. 6. Salinization: In areas where there is poor water drainage or high evaporation rates, salts can accumulate in the soil, reducing its fertility and productivity. Salinization can be exacerbated by irrigation practices that involve using water with high salt content. In conclusion, while rain (or more specifically, water erosion) is one factor contributing to the deterioration of soil quality, it is not the only factor, and the correct answer should not be limited to rain alone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The  Choose from: a. debris is soft.. b. broom is soft..","output":"The broom James bought from the store could not sweep the debris in the yard. The broom is soft. The broom's soft bristles may be the main contributing factor to its inability to sweep the debris in the yard effectively. Brooms are typically designed for various types of surfaces and messes, which means that finding the right broom for a specific task is essential. Soft-bristled brooms might be great for cleaning indoor surfaces and collecting fine particles such as dust and pet hair but may not be suitable for picking up the more substantial debris found outdoors. Outdoor sweeping tasks often require a sturdy broom with stiff bristles, as the debris encountered can range from substantial materials like leaves, sticks, dirt, and gravel to more minor particles like dirt and sand. Stiff-bristled brooms are specifically designed to handle this variety of debris, with bristles that can penetrate cracks and crevices more effectively and withstand rougher handling and contact with the ground. When James bought the soft-bristled broom, he may not have considered the specific type of cleaning for which he would be using the broom. A few factors could have contributed to this oversight. For instance, he could have been unfamiliar with the difference between types of brooms, or he may have been swayed by a cheaper price or an attractive appearance. Ultimately, this soft-bristled broom may not be suitable for the task at hand. James may have few other options than to purchase a new, stiff-bristled broom designed for outdoor cleaning. For future purchases, James could benefit from spending some time researching the type of broom required for his specific cleaning needs, including the kinds of bristles necessary and the intended use of the broom. In conclusion, the sentence ends with \\"broom is soft\\" because a soft-bristled broom is less effective in sweeping debris in the yard, making it an inadequate tool for the task at hand. James would benefit from investing in a stiff-bristled broom designed for outdoor use so that he can effectively clean his yard and sweep away the debris as needed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Do give Russians a room with high ceilings -- they are tall, it says. And anticipate everything a Japanese visitor needs. But never call a Canadian tourist \\"American\\" Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Navigating Cultural Sensitivities: Tourism Body Issues Guide for Hospitality Industry Introduction As the tourism industry experiences a steady growth globally, hotel accommodations have become increasingly diverse in terms of nationalities and cultures. Keeping this in mind, a renowned tourism body has recently issued a comprehensive list of do's and don'ts to help hoteliers and their staff better interact with foreign guests, while respecting their cultural differences and ensuring their satisfaction. Below are some interesting highlights and practices that have been suggested. The Russian Guests: Appreciating their Height Russians are generally known for being taller than the average person. To cater to this unique physical characteristic and ensure their comfort, the tourism body recommends providing Russian guests with rooms that have high ceilings. This small yet considerate effort can definitely leave a lasting positive impression and show respect for their needs. Japanese Guests: Anticipate their Requirements Japanese visitors typically possess a quiet, reserved nature and prefer not to impose their needs on others. To make their stay more pleasant and hassle-free, it's essential for hotel staff to maintain a proactive approach. Anticipating and fulfilling their requirements even before their request not only demonstrates keen attention to detail but also enhances their overall experience. This level of attentiveness reflects hospitality excellence and can go a long way in establishing strong bonds with guests from Japan. Canadian Guests: Respecting their Identity Understanding and respecting one's nationality is crucial in a multicultural environment like the hospitality industry. The tourism body stresses the importance of distinguishing between Canadian and American visitors. To some, this may seem like a minor detail, but for Canadians, it holds great significance. Using the correct terminology helps hotel staff establish an immediate connection with their Canadian guests and express genuine warmth and respect. Inadvertently calling a Canadian tourist \\"American\\" can be seen as a faux-pas and leave a less than favorable impression. General Considerations for Foreign Guests 1. Language barriers: Providing simple translated materials, such as menus or brochures, can make a significant difference in how foreign guests perceive their stay. Additionally, ensuring that staff members are familiar with basic phrases in commonly spoken languages, or have access to translation tools, goes a long way in making guests from diverse backgrounds feel welcomed. 2. Special dietary requirements: Being aware of and accommodating various dietary restrictions due to culture, religion, or personal preferences helps create a more inclusive environment. This may involve offering vegetarian, halal, or kosher meals, and also considering allergies when preparing dishes for specific guests. 3. Cultural etiquette: Understanding and adapting to essential etiquette norms, such as whether or not to maintain eye contact or customary greetings in different cultures, can create a more harmonious atmosphere. Training staff to be aware of potential differences promotes respectful interactions with guests from various backgrounds. Conclusion The increasingly multicultural nature of the global tourism industry calls for hoteliers and their staff to pay attention to cultural sensitivities, preferences, and needs. By following the tourism body's list of do's and don'ts, hotel establishments can create a truly hospitable environment that fosters respect, understanding, and satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that wherever possible I use organic bodycare products, and that I simply adore the organic brand Botanicals. A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!  I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

What is the best social media monitoring tool and why?","output":"While at first glance these questions might seem similar because they both involve social media management tools, they are actually asking about potentially different aspects of social media management and are not exactly the same. 1. \\"What is the best free social media and email management tool?\\" This question is specifically asking for a tool that manages both social media and email. It's possible that the person asking this question is looking for a way to coordinate their social media and email marketing strategies, streamline their workflow, or manage these tasks for multiple clients. Here, the person is also asking for a free tool, which is another important distinction because many tools may require a monthly or yearly subscription or may be free initially but require payment for more advanced features. In this case, characteristics like budget, integrated management of different communication channels, and cost-efficiency would be the criteria to answer this question. 2. \\"What is the best social media monitoring tool and why?\\" This question is more specific about the functionality of the tool. The person is asking about a social media monitoring tool, which tracks mentions of certain keywords or phrases on social media platforms. These tools essentially \\"listen\\" to what's being said about a brand, industry, or competitors on social media, and can be a crucial part of a brand's online reputation management strategy. Here, the person is also asking for a justification of whatever tool is recommended (\\"and why\\"), means the answer needs to take into account the specific factors and unique characteristics that make the recommended tool the \\"best\\". This could be the coverage of different social media platforms, real-time alert features, sentiment analysis, integration with other tools, or various other factors. Overall, while both questions delve into social media management tools, the first is broader and also incorporates email management and is specifically asking for a free tool. The second question is more about social media monitoring (a subset of management) and is asking for an explanation about why a particular tool is considered the best. Thus, these two questions have different implications and would likely yield different answers.

Paragraph :  With a higher the concentration of hydrogen ions, a solution is more acidic and has a lower pH.  Question:   If Jim wants to raise the pH of his solution he should do what to the concentration of hydrogen ions inside of it decrease or increase? A:","output":"If Jim wants to raise the pH of his solution, he should decrease the concentration of hydrogen ions inside of it. As mentioned in the paragraph, a higher concentration of hydrogen ions corresponds to a more acidic solution and a lower pH. Conversely, a lower concentration of hydrogen ions will result in a less acidic solution and a higher pH.  To give some context, the pH scale ranges from 0-14, with values below 7 being considered acidic, 7 being neutral, and values above 7 being considered basic or alkaline. The pH scale measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) present in a solution. A high concentration of hydrogen ions results in a low pH value, indicating acidic conditions. Meanwhile, a low concentration of hydrogen ions results in a high pH value, indicating basic or alkaline conditions.  By decreasing the concentration of hydrogen ions in his solution, Jim will be effectively raising its pH and making it less acidic. This can be done through several methods, such as adding a base or alkaline substance to the solution. Common examples of alkaline substances include sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and calcium hydroxide (lime). These substances can react with hydrogen ions in the solution, reducing their concentration and, as a result, increasing the pH."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: What is a nickname for the courtesans? Movie title: Flowers of Shanghai Movie plot: In four elegant brothels, called \\"Flower Houses\\", in fin-de-siÃ¨cle 19th-century Shanghai (Qing dynasty), several affairs are described. Events presumably take place in 1884, a year named in one of the scenes. The action involves four men who live for pleasure, and takes place mostly in the light of oil lamps, giving the film a claustrophobic feel. Preparation and consumption of opium and tea occur more than once, and dishes of food are served and hot towels prepared in several scenes. We are introduced to the main characters, mainly the courtesans known as Crimson, Pearl, Emerald, Jasmine and Jade. Crimson belongs to Huifang Enclave (èè³é) brothel; Pearl and Jade to Gongyang Enclave (å¬é½é) brothel; Emerald lives at Shangren Enclave (å°ä»é) brothel; and Jasmine works at East Hexing Enclave (æ±åèé) brothel. The relationship between the wealthy patrons and the courtesans are semi-monogamous, frequently lasting many years. The courtesans are purchased at an early age by the owners of the brothels, otherwise known as \\"Aunties\\". In spite of the trappings of luxury and the wealth surrounding them, the graceful, well-bred courtesans live lives of slavery. Although there are only a few references to the courtesans being beaten, we are led to understand that there are frequent beatings for the girls and women with harsher Aunties and that beatings for perceived misbehaviour are common. Because of the oppressing social conventions, the best that the courtesans, known as \\"flower girls\\", can hope for is to pay off their debts some day (possible through a wealthy patron) or marry into a better social status. The silent Master Wang leaves the courtesan Crimson in favor of Jasmine, with whom he fell madly in love in only 10 days, after (allegedly) 2Â½ years with Crimson. He offers to settle Crimson's debts. Wang sees himself with multiple ties and between hardening fronts. The dependencies turn out to be reciprocal. Crimson has only Master Wang as a customer, and must sustain herself from his money to...

Article: In Germany, English expressions are used in conversations and increasingly in written form. Advertisements are often expressed completely in English. When I go to the gym, there are \\"aerobic-classes  \\". We \\"warm up\\". We go \\"jogging.\\" In business, we attend a \\"meeting\\" and we have \\"good connections.\\" Other nations, like France, have taken action to protect their language from the influence of \\"Americanization\\". In Germany, however, there is concern that those rules could be connected with Hitler's Third Reich  , when the language had to be pure. If the government curbed the use of English words now, this could be considered by some as a return to that terrible past. Some German citizens are now trying to stop the use of English vocabulary in German. However, I think generally it is not a big deal to use some common English expressions as they often describe things more directly. But we should know that it is important to use English correctly. All too often, bad English is spoken or even written instead of good German. The proper use of the German language would be the better choice. However, there are some fields that require the use of English words, for example, in the high-tech communication and the Internet fields, there is no alternative to English. Also, I think sometimes I have to speak English when I introduce some scenic places to tourists. I think you have to find a balance and decide when it is better to use good German in place of bad English or when the use of correct English words is more suitable. Languages have always changed naturally, and I disagree with a restriction by law. Some nice expressions borrowed from other languages can make a conversation more vivid.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the modern name of the photograph by the commercial photographer that inspired an 1888 oil painting?  Farsari and other 19th-century commercial photographers generally concentrated on two types of subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the \\"manners and customs\\" of its inhabitants. Such subjects, and the ways in which they were literally and figuratively framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; and the reason for this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, had much to do with economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō \\"per head\\", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting \\"manners and customs\\".In 1885, Charles J. S. Makin used some of Farsari's views to illustrate his travel account Land of the Rising Sun, Being a Short Account of Japan and the Japanese. As photomechanical printing was still in its infancy, it was common for artists and illustrators to create works derived from photographs. For example, Charles Wirgman's numerous engravings for the Illustrated London News were made from views by Wirgman's friend and sometime partner Felice Beato. Occasionally the link between a work of art and its photographic source material was less overt: Louis-Jules Dumoulin's 1888 oil painting Boys' Festival from the Bluff, Yokohama [sic] (now called Carp Banners in Kyoto) draws heavily from Farsari's photograph Gionmachi, Kioto (now often called View of Shijō-dōri, Kyoto); although the painted image strongly resembles the photographic source, the location of the subject has been changed in the title.

(May 2015) A man is discovered breaking into his own jewellery shop in the dead of night. Questioned closely, it is discovered that his wife is being held hostage at their home by Steve, a brutal extortionist who demands the diamonds in the shop's safe in exchange for the woman's life. After Steve kills the family maid, FBI agent Warren Stantin (Sidney Poitier) hands over the diamonds, but Steve kills the jeweller's wife anyway, and escapes. Feeling that he has failed, Stantin becomes obsessed with finding Steve, and he chases Steve into the rugged forests of the state of Washington, where Steve joins up with a group of sportsmen who plan to trek into the wilderness on a fishing trip. Steve's plan is to kill them and force their guide, Sarah (Kirstie Alley), to lead him through the wilderness to the CanadaâUS border. Stantin must team up with Sarah's mountain-man boyfriend Jonathan Knox (Tom Berenger) to pursue Steve. Jonathan does not believe city slicker Stantin can keep up on a tough cross-country hike that includes some rock climbing, and Stantin is determined to prove himself. They pursue Steve and Sarah into the wilderness and eventually to the streets of Vancouver. The movie also featured a chase scene aboard the BC Ferries Queen of Vancouver. After a long chase, Stantin manages to shoot Steve in an underwater struggle. The killer's identity is not revealed until midway through the film. He attempts to evade detection by killing a member of a hiking expedition and taking his place. To keep the audience guessing as to the true identity of the villain, some of the hikers were played by actors known for playing bad guys: notably Clancy Brown (Highlander), Frederick Coffin (Mother's Day), Andrew Robinson (Dirty Harry) and Richard Masur (the vicious drug dealer in Who'll Stop the Rain).

Write some highlights for the following article: When Glynis Barnett shows friends her new yellow diamond nestling in its jewellery box, they never fail to be impressed. ‘People always say how sparkly it is and compliment me on the fabulous colour,’ says Glynis, 63, a retired PA from Kent. ‘They’re so surprised when I tell them the diamond used to be my husband John. ‘I paid £5,000 to have a laboratory turn his ashes into the gem as a way to keep him close to me after he died.’ Scroll down for video. Glynis Barnett, 63, a retired PA from Kent, shows off the yellow diamond made from the ashes of her late husband John. It may sound like something from a sci-fi film, but these so-called ‘cremorials’ — tributes made from cremated ashes — are becoming ever more common. For £3,000, you can have your ashes pressed into vinyl records, or mixed with paint and painted into a favourite scene. Ashes can also be shot into space, floated out to sea in a model ship or even encased in concrete and turned into part of a man-made reef off the Dorset coast — a scheme created by Dorset Council for families to encase their loved ones’ ashes in concrete ‘bereavement balls’ and added to the reef, providing a home for marine wildlife. When John died in 2011, aged 64, following a long battle with throat and liver cancer, Glynis spent months wondering what to do with his ashes. ‘Although we had been married for 42 years, we never discussed in detail what we wanted if either of us should die,’ she says. ‘His ashes sat by the side of my bed for 18 months, while I struggled with my grief. Glynis with husband John. Despite beiing married for 42 years she says they never discussed in detail what they would do if one of them died. ‘I eventually decided to scatter them under the willow tree in our garden, but then I remembered a friend of mine who’d told me she planned to have her husband’s ashes turned into a diamond if anything happened to him. ‘I liked the idea I could take a little piece of John with me wherever I went. After months of research, I contacted Phoenix Memorial Diamonds in Manchester and ordered a .75 carat canary yellow gem. All I needed to do was send off 100g of John’s ashes by recorded post, and pay a deposit of £2,500.’ Turning ashes into a diamond is fairly straightforward, as both are comprised of the same substance: the element carbon (the human body is 18 per cent carbon, and the rest is mostly water). Natural diamonds are formed underground when carbon is put exposed to huge amounts of heat and pressure. Laboratory-grown diamonds are made by creating the same forces artificially. Glynis says her friends always admire the £5,000 yellow diamond she had made out of John's ashes. First, the ashes are heated to 1,300c until they become molten, then they are compressed at 10,000 tons per square inch for several weeks until they form a diamond crystal, which is chemically indistinguishable from a natural stone. Because the chemical make-up of each person’s ashes is unique, so is the size, clarity and precise colour of the stone that emerges. However, the natural colour of diamonds made from human ash is broadly canary yellow due to the nitrogen content in the ashes. These yellow laboratory diamonds sell for about £6,500 per carat — around 40 per cent less than the equivalent natural diamond, which costs more because it takes thousands of years to form, is scarce and has to be mined. Once the diamond crystal has been formed, it is cut and polished in the same way as a natural diamond would be. Glynis waited 12 weeks for her diamond to be delivered. ‘My youngest son Robert, 29, who works in finance, was incredibly suspicious of the whole process and insisted on being there when the diamond was delivered,’ she says. ‘He drove the courier to our local jeweller to have the gem tested before he’d let me pay the balance.’ Glynis is now hoping to get her diamond set into a ring, and plans to leave it to her daughter Lucie, 31, in her will. ‘John would have laughed at my extravagance, as I am pretty frugal by nature, but I feel it’s an important, lasting and very personal tribute to my beloved husband.’ Cremation expert Richard Martin says that memorialising a loved one — whether that means having some of their ashes made into a paperweight or even decanted into cartridges and fired from a shotgun — can be incredibly cathartic. ‘All that matters is that you feel you have chosen a fitting resolution for that person, your family and friends,’ he says. Sue White in her garden with the £645 sculpture that contains her late husband Bruce's ashes. Not all ‘cremorials’ are as subtle as Glynis’s diamond. When visitors step into Sue White’s manicured garden, the first thing they comment on is the striking modern sculpture, in the shape of a closed flower bud, rising from her rockery. ‘Of course, they’re a little taken aback when I tell them: “That’s Bruce — my late husband”,’ says Sue, 60, a company director from Ascot, Berkshire. Bruce, who ran a successful record label, was 68 when he died peacefully at home in November 2011 from lung cancer with Sue, son Julian, now 44, and daughter Natalie, 40, by his side. Once his funeral was over, Sue was at a loss as to what to do with his remains. ‘It was just too difficult to talk about once he became ill,’ says Sue. ‘The ashes were handed over to us a few days afterwards in an ugly plastic jar. I found it so painful to look at, I hid it in the garage for more than a year.’ A year on, Sue and Natalie decided to scatter some of the ashes in the garden of the family’s holiday home in Spain. ‘We thought about scattering the rest around our garden in England, but I quickly realised that if I ever moved house, it would mean leaving Bruce behind for good,’ says Sue. ‘After searching online, we decided on a memorial ornament instead — something that would be a tangible reminder of Bruce but portable, too. We bought it online from a specialist company called Scattering Ashes for £645 and had a small plaque made for it with Bruce’s name on. ‘It has an internal sphere that Natalie and I carefully opened and decanted the ashes into at the kitchen table. ‘I thought I would find that hard to do, but it was actually very cathartic. Now, every time I pop out to snip a few herbs for my cooking, I see the sculpture and feel connected to Bruce. ‘I sometimes wonder if he would be happy with what I’ve done — but I love the sculpture, and I’m sure he would be glad about that.’ Heidi Lewis, 42, with mum Pat whose last wish was that her family would have a party celebrating her life and send her ashes up in fireworks. Increasingly, people are leaving instructions in their wills about how they would like their ashes used. Heidi Lewis’s mother, Patricia Mitchell, 73, a retired market researcher, was very clear about what she wanted before she passed away from long-standing health problems on April 25. ‘Mum told me in no uncertain terms that she did not want a religious funeral, nor should anyone attend the crematorium,’ says Heidi, a 42-year-old student nurse and mother to Henry, 19, Stanley, 12, and Arney, nine, from Woking in Surrey. Heidi says she couldn't think of a better send off for her late mother. ‘Instead, she left £6,000 from a funeral savings plan for us to throw a big party to celebrate her life. ‘She said she wanted to have her ashes sent up in a firework display over Eel Pie Island, in the middle of the Thames at Twickenham. It’s the site of a famous jazz club that she used to love going to in the Sixties. ‘My sisters Lyndsay, Madeleine and I desperately wanted to hold the wake on her birthday, May 9,’ says Heidi. ‘It was all a bit of a rush, but we managed to courier some of Mum’s ashes to Heavenly Stars fireworks in Colchester, Essex. ‘They transferred around an egg cup-full into a large firework — a complete display in one package — at a cost of £249. ‘We organised a big group of family and friends to meet in a local pub, and then walk, accompanied by a New Orleans-style jazz band, to the Twickenham rowing club. ‘There were eulogies and poetry readings then, as it started to get dark, my eldest son lit the fuse on the firework display. ‘There were two minutes of spectacular flashes, bangs and colours as the fireworks scattered Mum’s ashes over the island she loved. ‘As the fireworks came to an end everyone cheered, clapped, whistled and yes, shed a few tears. ‘What better send-off could anyone ask for?’","output":"A lady named Glynis had a yellow diamond made from her husband's ashes after he passed away.

Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from last week's loss to the Buccaneers, the Bengals  prepared for a showdown with the Panthers. This game saw the return of 3rd down running back Chris Perry and safety Dexter Jackson.  In the first quarter, Bengal defense allowed a 7-yard TD pass from quarterback Jake Delhomme to tight end Kris Mangum for the quarter's only score.  In the second quarter, the Bengals when quarterback Carson Palmer completed a 16-yard TD pass to tight end Reggie Kelly. Delhomme countered with a 20-yard TD pass to running back Nick Goings. After halftime, Cincinnati's offense found its stride. Kicker Shayne Graham nailed a 23-yard field goal in the third quarter, and Carson Palmer completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh. The drive was kept alive by a 4th and 1 play action pass, where Palmer tossed a high arcing pass down the sideline to a sprinting Chad Johnson, who caught it for a 32-yard gain. The Panthers' last scoring opportunity ended when Delhomme threw his first career interception to  Kevin Kaesviharn. The Bengals improved to 4-2, and tied the Ravens for the lead in the AFC North. After being relatively silent for most of the season, Chad Johnson spoke out boastfully before the Atlanta game predicting he would score multiple touchdowns and jeopardize the job security of rival defensive back, DeAngelo Hall, who entered the game with four interceptions. Chad stated he was using this opportunity for the offense to regain some of its confidence and swagger.

Here's a more detailed and comprehensive answer to the question: The envoys in question were sent to the Ming court of China, which was ruled by the Hongwu Emperor during the early period of the Ming Dynasty. This exchange of envoys took place as a diplomatic interaction between the Hongwu Emperor and Sagya Gyaincain, an influential Tibetan leader during the time. The historical event can be traced back to a primary source, \\"Records of the Founding Emperor.\\" The Hongwu Emperor sought to establish a relationship with the Tibetan leader by bestowing upon him the title of \\"Initiation State Master,\\" a prestigious designation that reflected Sagya Gyaincain's status and influence. In response to the honor of receiving this title, Sagya Gyaincain dispatched envoys to the Ming court as a diplomatic gesture of gratitude and acknowledgement. These envoys were entrusted with the responsibility of delivering Sagya Gyaincain's jade seal of authority, which symbolized his acceptance of the Hongwu Emperor's recognition. In addition to the jade seal, the envoys also carried other precious items as tribute, reflecting the importance of this diplomatic exchange and demonstrating respect for the Ming court. These items included colorful silk and satin fabrics, statues of the Buddha, Buddhist scriptures, and sarira—precious relics believed to be the remains of enlightened Buddhist masters. In summary, while the original answer contains pertinent information, a more focused and specific reply to the question \\"Where were the envoys sent?\\" would be:  The envoys were sent to the Ming court of China during the reign of the Hongwu Emperor, as a diplomatic gesture from Sagya Gyaincain, an influential Tibetan leader."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"If people decide not to reproduce, there will be a decreased human population over time. This would likely lead to less carbon dioxide and methane production in several ways. Firstly, a smaller population would require fewer resources, leading to reduced demand for energy generation, transportation, and industrial processes, all of which contribute to carbon dioxide production. With fewer people breathing, there would also be a slight decrease in carbon dioxide exhaled. Secondly, the decreased human population would produce less waste. With less waste decomposing, methane production would reduce. Additionally, large-scale agricultural practices such as livestock farming, which contribute to methane emissions, may become less necessary due to a reduced demand for food. Water evaporation would still occur, but there would likely be a decrease in water vapor produced by human activities, such as power generation, manufacturing industries, and residential water use. As a consequence, the decrease in human population would have a direct and indirect effect on the levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere. However, other factors such as remaining agricultural practices, natural processes, and other sources of greenhouse gas emissions would still contribute and may even dominate the emissions scenario, depending on the scale of the population decrease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Astonishment at realisation a flashlight app extracts location information. Angry Birds game named among the worst offenders on mobile phones. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Beware of Privacy Intrusions: Popular Apps Extract Your Location Information Introduction: In recent times, privacy concerns have become an essential factor in our growing reliance on technology. A shocking discovery reveals that even innocuous apps such as the flashlight app might be extracting and sharing your location information. To make matters worse, the ever-popular Angry Birds game is listed among the worst offenders compromising users' privacy on mobile phones. In this article, we aim to create awareness about the potential privacy risks that come with the use of such apps. Step 1: Expose the extent of the issue. Firstly, it is important to provide a clear overview of the privacy intrusion issue. An alarming number of mobile apps request access to user data, such as location information, even though the app functionality does not have a legitimate need for it. Users should be made aware of this potential threat to their privacy and be vigilant when granting permission to apps to access their data. Step 2: Spotlight on the flashlight app. The flashlight app, meant for providing light to the user in times of need, has been found to extract the user's location information covertly. This discovery is concerning since there is no justifiable reason for a flashlight app to require location details. Moreover, users may be unaware of this intrusion as they usually perceive the app as harmless. It's crucial to create awareness around such revelations to empower users to make informed decisions about the apps they install on their devices. Step 3: Expose Angry Birds as a primary offender. In addition to the flashlight app, the popular mobile game Angry Birds has been recognized as one of the top privacy offenders in the app world. The game has amassed millions of dedicated users worldwide, and with it being identified as a privacy violator, it poses a significant threat to user data. This issue should not go unnoticed, and the game's developers should be held accountable for addressing and rectifying these concerns. Step 4: Discuss the consequences of location data extraction. To emphasize the severity of the issue, it is necessary to discuss the consequences that users may face when their location data is extracted and shared. Location information can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as stalking, identity theft, and targeted advertising, to name a few. By becoming aware of these dangers, users will be more cautious when downloading apps and providing permissions. Step 5: Provide tips for maintaining privacy and data protection. To conclude the article and leave the readers with tangible guidance, it's crucial to offer tips and best practices that users can follow to maintain privacy and protect their data while using apps. Some examples include: 1. Be cautious when granting app permissions – Only grant access to data that is necessary for the app to function correctly. 2. Regularly review and update app permissions – Check the settings on your device to ensure your apps have appropriate permissions. 3. Avoid downloading apps from unknown sources – Stick to trusted app stores and research app developers before downloading their products. 4. Use privacy tools, such as VPNs or location masking applications, to safeguard your location information. Conclusion: Privacy concerns are increasingly becoming important in the digital age. Apps like the flashlight app and Angry Birds game continue to emphasize the need for vigilance when it comes to protecting one's privacy and location data. By staying informed and practicing good data hygiene, users can better protect their information and enjoy a safer experience in the world of mobile applications."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The pair, whose radio shows are the first and second most popular in the US, are being taken off air by Cumulus Media which is the second-biggest broadcaster in the nation. The decision means that Limbaugh and Hannity will lose a significant chunk of their listeners - and could make NPR’s Morning Edition the most listened to radio show. However, Limbaugh is already making moves to get back on the radio in cities where he would be blacked out. Scroll down for video. Rush Limbaugh had advertisers leave in droves after he referred to a female law student as a 'slut' and a 'prostitute' for advocating free birth control. Conservative talk show host Sean Hannity, whose radio show is the second-most popular in the country, is also on the verge of being booted from thousands of local radio stations. The New York Daily News reports that in New York, Limbaugh - likely with Hannity along with him - is probably going to move from Cumulus' WABC station to WOR - an AM radio stationed owned by rival Clear Channel. The move is being hailed as a ‘major shakeup for the radio industry’ and even though it is reportedly over money, there is speculation that Limbaugh may be the real reason. The. root of the row does seem to be Limbaugh’s comments about Fluke, who in. February last year gave evidence before the House Democratic Steering. and Policy Committee on the need for affordable birth control. On. his radio show Limbaugh said in response that she ‘essentially says. that she must be paid to have sex - what does that make her?' He. went on: ‘It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She. wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford. the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to. have sex.’ His comments. sparked and firestorm on social media and an advertising boycott from. the likes of AOL, Sears, Netflix, Autozone, Capital One, J.C. Penney and. the Cleveland Cavaliers. Controversy: Sandra Fluke became a national celebrity when Limbaugh called her named after she was denied an appearance before a House hearing about birth control. Cumulus. chief executive Lew Dickey is said to have blamed him for the 2.4m. first quarter slump in advertising revenue after he called Fluke, the. pro-choice Georgetown University law student, a ‘slut’ and a. ‘prostitute’ live on air last spring. According to Politico, Cumulus has now said it will not renew either Limbaugh or Hannity’s contract, which expire at the end of the year. Negotiations. are also said to have broken down between Cumulus and Premiere. Networks, the division of Clear Channel which distributes the shows for. both men, because they could not agree on payments for distribution. rights. Both sides are reportedly tough negotiators and have apparently chosen to walk away rather than agree an unsatisfactory deal. Cumulus. has already begun working on how it will fill the slots vacated by. Limbaugh and Hannity and are looking at moving hosts like former. Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee and conservative. commentator Mark Levin into one of their slots. Executives have also begun asking radio talent agencies and regional stations to put forward potential hosts. Jason Easley, a left-wing commentator with PoliticusUSA, said: ‘The boycotters did it. ‘They got Cumulus to dump not only Limbaugh, but also Hannity. NPR's Morning Edition could become the top radio show in the country if the two conservative talk shows are dropped from Cumulus Radio. ‘Without the public pressure, bad publicity, and shame that the boycott brought on to his advertisers, Rush Limbaugh and Cumulus would probably still have a happy marriage.’ Limbaugh and Hannity’s shows are the first and second most popular in the US with 14 million and 13.25 million listeners each week respectively. Being dropped by Cumulus does not mean they will be going off air completely as Clear Channel, the largest radio distributor in the US, will continue to carry them. But a surprising effect could be making publicly-funded National Public Radio's Morning Edition the no.1 show in the country. It is currently in third with 12.3 million listeners, followed by All Things Considered, also on NPR, with 11.8 million listeners. In a statement Cumulus said: ‘Cumulus is not in a position to comment about negotiations with talent under contract, no matter what the rumor of the day might be’. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity are popular radio show hosts in the US. Some people didn't like the things they said on their shows about a woman named Sandra Fluke. Because of this, a big company called Cumulus Media decided to remove their shows from 40 radio stations. This means that they will lose many listeners, and another radio show from NPR called Morning Edition might become the most popular instead.

Sadly, the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain-addled. The film begins with Ingrid Bergman coming to work for the Stoddard family. Everything is so very peachy and swell--the family adores Bergman and things couldn't be more perfect. Well, that is until the mother (Fay Wray) dies, the stock market crashes in 1907 (wiping out the family's fortune) and Bergman is forced to go back home to France. This portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet, but not bad. Later, after the family's fortunes have improved, Bergman returns. The four boys are now all grown and there isn't really a conceivable reason why they'd hire her once again as a governess. But, briefly, everything is swell once again. But, when WWI occurs, the four all go to war--gosh! In the midst of this, one of the sons (David) brings home his new wife (Susan Hayward). Miss Hayward's character is as black and white as the others, though while they are all good and swell, she's obviously a horny she-devil. To make things worse, she comes to live in the family home while David is at war. Now here is where the movie gets really, really dumb--brain-achingly dumb. Hayward begins an affair with one of David's brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers, Bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her, not Hayward with Jack! WHY?! Why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman? This was exactly the sort of excuse Bergman needed to get rid of the gutter-snipe once and for all! This is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad...and most likely did the same to the audiences back in 1941. The rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for Hayward's evilness to be exposed. This just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess. As expected, however, the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once again---happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut, Hayward. The film suffers because of poor writing. Hayward's affair made no sense--at least in how it was handled. And, having characters who are so gosh-darn good or evil (with nothing in between) sinks this movie to the level of a second-rate soap. The only thing that saves it at all is the acting---they tried as best they could with a turgid script. Suffice to say that the Columbia Pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken! What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer is disappointed with the movie and believes it suffers from poor writing and unbelievable characters. They also think that the plot is not well-handled, making the movie feel like a second-rate soap.

Help as much as you can. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What year did the composer in a creative struggle perform a concert? ?  With the outbreak of World War I on 28 July 1914, The Oceanides languished. Wartime politics being what they were, Sibelius's music was seldom played outside the Nordic countries and the United States: in Germany, there was little demand for the music of an \\"enemy national\\", while in Russia, Finns were viewed as being \\"less than loyal subjects of the Tsar\\". In any case, many of Sibelius's works had been printed by German publishing houses, a detail that harmed Sibelius's reputation not only in Russia, but also Britain and the United States. According to Tawaststjerna, the war plunged Sibelius into a state of melancholy and creative struggle (the Fifth and Sixth symphonies were in the process of simultaneous gestation at this time). His response was to retreat into near solitude: he abstained from attending and giving concerts and neglected his circle of friends, and he imagined himself \\"forgotten and ignored, a lonely beacon of light in a deepening winter darkness\\".Sibelius was not easily stirred from his exile; friend and fellow composer Wilhelm Stenhammar, then Artistic Director and chief conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, wrote to Sibelius repeatedly to persuade him to conduct a concert of his works in Gothenburg. Believing himself duty-bound to premiere a \\"major work\\" in Sweden, such as a symphony, Sibelius—to Stenhammar's chagrin—delayed each scheduled trip. He withdrew from planned concerts for March 1914, writing to Stenhammar, \\"My conscience forces me to this. But when I have some new works ready next year, as I hope, it would give me great joy to perform them in Gothenburg\\". New arrangements were made for February 1915, but these, too, Sibelius canceled in December 1914. In the end, the indefatigable Stenhammar prevailed and new concerts were set for March 1915 (\\"I see yet again your great sympathy for my music. I shall come\\".).Stenhammar's efforts were rewarded with the European premiere of The Oceanides. For Sibelius, it was an opportunity to once again be an \\"artist on tour\\", feeding...

Plot title: Sense and Sensibility Movie plot: On his deathbed, Mr. Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) tells his son from his first marriage, John (James Fleet), to take care of his second wife (Gemma Jones) and three daughters, Elinor (Emma Thompson), Marianne (Kate Winslet) and Margaret (Emilie FranÃ§ois), since they will inherit nothing. John's greedy and snobbish wife Fanny (Harriet Walter) convinces him to give his half sisters practically nothing financially and they immediately install themselves in the large house, forcing the Dashwood ladies to look for a new home. Fanny invites her brother Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant) to stay with them. Elinor and Edward soon form a close friendship, but Fanny haughtily tells Mrs. Dashwood that Edward would be disinherited if he married someone of no importance with no money. Mrs. Dashwood understands her meaning completely. Sir John Middleton (Robert Hardy), a cousin of the widowed Mrs. Dashwood, offers her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in Devonshire. She and her daughters move in, and are frequent guests at Barton Park. The Dashwoods meet the older Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman), who falls in love with Marianne at first sight. However, Marianne barely acknowledges him although he is carried in the highest regard and shows only kindness towards her and her family. One afternoon, Marianne takes a walk with Margaret and slips and falls in the rain. She is carried home by the dashing John Willoughby (Greg Wise), with whom Marianne falls in love. They spend a great deal of time together and clearly fall in love to the point that he snips a lock of her hair to carry with him.

Given the question: Happened to me while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. Who was angry as the bus rode on? - The man who offered his seat to the woman who had to move - not enough information - The woman who had to move - The wife of the man who offered his seat The answer is:","output":"The woman who had to move was the one who was angry as the bus rode on. This situation highlights the complexities and tensions that can arise in public spaces, where individuals with different needs, backgrounds, and perspectives come into contact with one another. It is important to recognize the various factors that contributed to this particular incident, including questions of race, age, entitlement, and societal expectations. The elderly woman, who was at least 75 years old and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus, was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped individuals. She clearly felt that she had earned her right to claim that seat and was unwilling to vacate it, despite the bus driver's insistence that the seat needed to be folded up in order to accommodate the young couple's pram on the wheelchair apparatus. Her reluctance to move may have been influenced by a perception of being singled out or unfairly treated, particularly in the context of racial dynamics and the neighborhood's recent gentrification. Furthermore, her advanced age may have also contributed to her sense of entitlement to the seat. The young couple with the baby in the pram faced a difficult situation of trying to secure their pram in a crowded bus. This must have been a frustrating experience for them, but they managed to resolve the issue after the man and his wife offered their seats to the elderly woman. The man who offered his seat to the elderly woman was not explicitly mentioned to be angry in the given context. He merely provided a solution in a compassionate manner to diffuse the tense situation on the bus. The man's wife, who also offered her seat and stood for the rest of the trip, was not necessarily portrayed as angry either, but rather annoyed over having to move. However, it is essential to appreciate the empathy exhibited by the couple who offered their seats to resolve the situation. In this given scenario, it was the elderly woman who was angry as the bus rode on. She vented her frustration by asking the middle-aged white man what he would do in a situation like that, to which he responded by suggesting offering it up to God. This anecdote serves as an important reminder of the challenges that can arise in shared public spaces and the importance of empathy, understanding, and sometimes personal sacrifice in navigating these situations."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: Background: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline.  Paragraph: Pat has 2 acres of land next to Tim's property. Tim's land is of similar size. The clay soil on Tim's property is very alkaline, so he had to amend it with aluminum salts to make it more acidic in order to grow crops. The soil on Pat's parcel has a good structure and high infiltration capacity. Pat gets twice as much food of his land every year.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which soil from these two parcels has a poor structure?

Available choices: i. no ii. yes","output":"First answer: When you want to bring a 100gm gold coin from the USA to India, the tax you need to pay is called customs duty. The Indian government charges a customs duty of 10% on gold (for example, on a gold coin). So if you bring a 100gm gold coin, you would need to pay a 10% tax on its price. Imagine if the gold coin costs about 100 chocolates, you would need to give 10 chocolates as a tax to customs.  Second answer: Bringing a gold biscuit from abroad to India and selling it in India can make sense if you can sell it for a higher price in India than you bought it for, even after paying the customs duty. If you can sell the gold biscuit at a good price in India that covers the cost of the biscuit, the customs tax, and leaves you with extra chocolates (money), then it makes sense.

Context: Based on experience with German strategic bombing during World War I against the United Kingdom, the British government estimated after the war that 50 casualties— with about one third killed— would result for every tonne of bombs dropped on London. The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.

UPDATED:. 09:12 EST, 3 December 2013. Douglas Hewitt has put up the same Christmas tree for the 84th time this year after his father first bought it in 1929. A great-grandfather has put up his Christmas tree for the 84th time this year after his father first bought it from a toy shop in 1929. Douglas Hewitt, 84, has celebrated every Christmas with the artificial tree since he was born and he and his wife Mavis, 82, have once again put it up this year. Mr Hewitt's father bought the tree from Redgates toy shop, in Sheffield, just months after Douglas was born. The 4ft tree has been kept in its original red stand throughout the years and remains the centrepoint of the Hewitt family household during every festive season. Mr Hewitt, of South Anston, South Yorkshire, said: 'It reminds us of my childhood, our children's childhood and our grandchildren and great-grandchildren's after that. 'They all come and look at it and smile, it's become part of the furniture. 'If we didn't put that Christmas tree up, it wouldn't feel like Christmas. It would be different.' The tree was passed down to Mr Hewitt when he married Mavis in 1951. Mrs Hewitt said: 'Douglas was born in 1929 and they went into Redgates and asked for a Christmas tree and they didn't have any. 'The only one that was left was in the widow so his father said, \\"right, we will have that\\". 'Year after year we have just carried on using that one. You have to be a bit more careful with it now as it's a little fragile.' Sadly, it may be the last year that the tree makes an appearance in the Hewitt household, as it stands on its last legs. Scroll down for video. Mr Hewitt and his wife Mavis (pictured in 1980) have once again put the artificial tree up, 84 years after it was first bought. Mr Hewitt has said the tree used to have more branches on it and had 'seen better days' but it is once again standing pride of place in the Hewitt family home. Their daughter June Murphy also has fond memories of the Christmas tree. Mrs Murphy, 60, said: 'It was in my grandparents' home and then it was given to us. 'The lights that are on there now have been there since we went to a three-pin plug. 'It's looking a little thin now as each time you get it out something else falls off.

The rationale to choose \\"queue\\" as the answer is that when a printer experiences a paper jam, it usually stops the printing process and subsequently disrupts the order of print jobs within the printer's queue. The printer queue is a list of documents or files that are awaiting their turn to be printed.  After the paper jam is resolved and the printer starts functioning normally, the specific print job that caused the jam may need to be removed from the queue to prevent the printer from attempting to print the same problematic document again. Additionally, other print jobs may have continued to be added to the queue during the paper jam, causing a backlog of documents awaiting printing. Clearing the queue ensures that any issues with the print jobs are resolved, and the printer can continue to properly process and print new documents.  The other choices are not relevant to the situation described: - Ink - while ink may be involved in the printing process, it does not directly relate to the paper jam issue described. - Noise - paper jams and unjamming the printer do not specifically require clearing any noise. - Use paper - this term is not relevant in the context of addressing the aftermath of a paper jam. - Hard copy - a hard copy is a physical printout of a document, which does not directly relate to what James would need to clear after resolving the paper jam."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

France borders the country on three sides while the other side borders the Mediterranean Sea. Monaco has an area of 2.02 km (0.78 sq mi) and a population of about 38,400, according to the last census of 2016. With 19,009 inhabitants per km2, it is the second-smallest and most densely populated sovereign state in the world. Monaco has a land border of 5.47 km (3.40 mi), a coastline of 3.83 km (2.38 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (1,859 and 382 yd). The highest point in the country is a narrow pathway named Chemin des Révoires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les Révoires Ward, which is 161 metres (528 feet) above sea level. Monaco's most populous Quartier is Monte Carlo and the most populous Ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins.

Officially known as the Principality of Monaco, it is considered a sovereign city-state, country, and microstate located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. While it lies within the geographical boundaries of the continent and is bordered by France on three sides and the Mediterranean Sea on the fourth, it maintains its sovereignty. This means that Monaco maintains supreme power or authority over its affairs and is not governed by any other state or country. Its sovereignty is further reinforced by present international recognition and its active participation as a full member of international organizations. It is globally recognized as an independent nation with its own government, constitution, and royal family. Its government can hold diplomatic relationships with other countries, make its own laws, and impose taxes, among other things. Monaco is also noted for its unique characteristics that set it apart from most countries in the world. It is notably the second-smallest and most densely populated sovereign state globally, and it boasts a high concentration of wealth, as evidenced by the proportion of millionaires within its population. Lastly, Monaco's active land reclamation, which leads to its territorial expansion, is an assertion of its sovereignty and independence. By undertaking such a significant and ambitious engineering project, Monaco demonstrates its autonomy and thus further distinguishes itself as a country in its own right."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result.

UPDATE 2-Beauty buys to brighten Unilever as markets lack shine * Q2 underlying sales up 2.9 pct; beat analysts' estimates * Sees consumer demand remaining weak across markets * Stands by full-year outlook even as beauty business grows (Adds details on beauty business, CEO comments) LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Unilever expects a recent series of beauty deals to give its performance extra lustre while consumer demand remains weak for staple products from soup to soap. The Anglo-Dutch maker of Knorr soup, Lipton tea and Ben & Jerry's ice cream has been on a quest for the last few years to move away from food toward personal care, where margins and growth prospects are better. The wisdom of the transition was evident on Thursday when Unilever reported better-than-expected second-quarter sales, fueled by gains of 3.3 percent and 5.9 percent for its personal care and home care businesses, respectively. That compares with flat sales for the foods business which has recently divested brands including Slim-Fast and Ragu pasta sauces. Some analysts believe Unilever may also sell its margarines, after creating a stand-alone unit for the struggling business this month. Unilever executives repeated their expectation that full-year sales growth would probably come in at the upper end of a previously stated goal of 2 to 4 percent. That reflects the current low-key nature of its main markets. \\"Emerging markets continue to be subdued whilst in Europe and North America growth is negligible,\\" Unilever said in a statement. Its shares were up 1.7 percent in London by 1430 GMT. This year's acquisitions of four beauty brands -- REN Skincare, Kate Somerville Skincare, Dermalogica and Murad, which together have some 400 million euros in turnover -- should add to sales, margins and profits immediately. Even though they are small, they will give Unilever what Chief Executive Paul Polman called \\"critical mass\\" in a market for prestige beauty products, worth about 70 billion and growing amid increased interest in personal grooming and anti-aging. He stressed that Unilever was not rushing into the business, which is highly competitive, concentrated in developed markets such as the United States and Japan, and somewhat subject to the whims of fashion. \\"We are learning our way into this in a very mindful way,\\" Polman said, adding that he would look at further acquisitions as they arise, but for now has \\"enough on our plate to integrate these brands and make them work for us\\". Unilever is not the only food maker looking to plump its performance with skin creams and wrinkle treatments. Nestle last year set up a Skin Health division, after taking over a joint venture it had with L'Oreal. In general, makers of packaged food and drinks have seen a sales slowdown, due largely to economic weakness, but also because of a growing health consciousness that doesn't hurt sales of other household goods. \\"There's a limit to how much food, alcohol and tobacco smoke you can push inside a human body without having quite dire consequences, but there's no limit to the number of home and personal care products somebody can have,\\" said Whitman Howard analyst Chris Wickham. And whereas food must always be catered to local tastes, soaps, deodorants and creams can often be sold across markets. On average, shares of personal and household products companies like Colgate-Palmolive and Beiersdorf are trading at around 22 times forward earnings, versus 20 times for food companies. Unilever was recently reclassified as a personal care company instead of a food company by various stock market groupings, reflecting the fact that personal care is now its biggest business, accounting for 37 percent of turnover. The new beauty business will be run in a separate \\"Prestige\\" division headed by Vasiliki Petrou, who joined Unilever in 2012 after more than 16 years at Procter & Gamble, where she most recently ran Max Factor cosmetics. Max Factor is part of the business P&G is selling to Coty , conceding failure in its own move upmarket, selling designer perfumes and salon hair products alongside prosaic goods like detergent and diapers. Whereas mass market products such as Unilever's Dove soap and Axe deodorant are sold at supermarkets and drugstores, prestige beauty brands are sold at salons, department stores, specialty shops like LVMH's Sephora and Ulta, duty free shops or online. Analysts said Unilever would do a better job keeping up luxury brands' needed mystique, given that it already manages the high-end Maille mustard brand and T2 tea shops. \\"I think it's great that they absolutely recognize that they need to deal with it slightly differently to the rest of their personal care business,\\" said Bernstein analyst Helena Strettle. \\"We're quite confident in them.\\" Unilever's previous personal care acquisitions include TIGI hair care in 2009, Sara Lee's personal care brands in 2010 and its biggest, Alberto Culver, in 2011. Since paying 3.7 billion for the haircare company, sales from its TRESemme brand have more than doubled to over 700 million euros.

Right now, they want to sell more things like skincare and beauty products because they can make more money from them. They bought four smaller companies that make beauty products, which will help them grow in this area. People are buying more beauty products, but they're not buying as much food and drinks as before, so Unilever wants to change what they focus on.

Big win: OPTIONS: - Big Spring had entered the 50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1 - Chapa had entered the 50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1 - Daily Mail Online had entered the 50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1 - Daniel Pish had entered the 50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1 - Danny Pish had entered the 50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1 - Houston had entered the 50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1 - Peta had entered the 50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1 - Pish had entered the 50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1 - Quiet Acceleration had entered the 50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1 - Roman Chapa had entered the 50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1 - Sam Houston Race Park had entered the 50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1 - Texas had entered the 50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1","output":"- Quiet Acceleration had entered the 50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1 The correct answer is that Quiet Acceleration, the six-year-old gelding mentioned in the passage, had entered the 50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1. The other answers are incorrect for the following reasons: - Big Spring, Daily Mail Online, Peta, and Texas: These options are unrelated to the subject of the passage and have no connection to the racehorse or the race. - Chapa, Roman Chapa: Roman Chapa is the jockey, not the horse, so he himself did not enter the race. - Daniel Pish, Danny Pish, and Pish: These options all refer to the trainer, not the horse itself. The trainer does not directly enter the race. - Houston and Sam Houston Race Park: These refer to the location and venue of the race, not the horse that entered the race."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: Article: Expressing emotions is important rather than hiding them or keeping them inside. Everyone feels negative emotions such as anger and needs to deal with them. But there are healthy ways to express anger and ways to control it. Shouting bad words at someone will hurt the other person or make them angry too. If you feel angry, it is best to think before you speak. Some people in the UK use the expression \\"take a deep breath and count to 10\\", meaning take a pause, breathe deeply and let yourself calm down instead of getting angry. Another expression people use to say they are controlling their anger is \\"biting their lip\\". This means not letting the bad words come out of their mouth. If you cannot think of anything but bad words, it is probably best to \\"bite your lip.\\" But sometimes letting all your anger out can be cathartic , as long as you do it at the right place and time. If you have just had a bad day, you could go into a room by yourself and scream or yell very loudly. Or if you want to hit someone or smash something, you could hit a pillow instead. Then after you let your frustration out this way, you'll be able to deal with your problems more calmly. If you do lose your temper with someone and swear at them, though, you need to apologize. One way to do this is to say \\"pardon my French\\". This expression has been used for many years as an apology for bad language. Then you can calmly explain what made you upset. Question: How does this passage view expressing emotions? Yes or no, is the answer \\"They need to be expressed but in a way that hurts no one.\\"? The answer is:","output":"Yes, \\"They need to be expressed but in a way that hurts no one.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question: Where would you find a shark that is not alive?  Here are possible answers to this question: - great barrier reef - deep ocean - maritime museum - ocean - pool hall  I believe the correct choice is \\"maritime museum\\", here's why: A:","output":"You are correct that the best choice among the given options is a \\"maritime museum.\\" Here's why: 1. Great Barrier Reef - While the Great Barrier Reef is a natural habitat where living sharks are commonly found, it is not the place where you would go to find a shark that is no longer alive. 2. Deep Ocean - Similar to the Great Barrier Reef, the deep ocean is the natural habitat for many living shark species. Dead sharks may sink to the ocean floor and decompose, but it is not a specific location where you would purposely find them for display or educational purposes. 3. Maritime Museum - This is the correct choice for finding a shark that is not alive. Museums often display preserved or replica specimens of marine life, including sharks, for educational purposes. You may find stuffed, mounted, or replica sharks as exhibits in a maritime museum, which offer the opportunity to study the species in detail and learn more about their biology, habitats, and behaviors. 4. Ocean - Like the Great Barrier Reef and the deep ocean, the ocean in general is a habitat for living sharks. It is not a place where you would intentionally find a shark that is not alive for any specific purpose. 5. Pool Hall - A pool hall is a place where people play pool or billiards, and it has nothing to do with marine life or sharks. In conclusion, the most suitable option to find a shark that is not alive would be a maritime museum since they display preserved or replica specimens for educational purposes. The other options mainly refer to natural habitats where living sharks thrive, and a pool hall is unrelated to marine life."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],q={key:0},R={key:1};function G(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
