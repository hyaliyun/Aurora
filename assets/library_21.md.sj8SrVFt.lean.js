Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Definition: In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Input: Although 65% of people with cancer want to die at home, only about 30% are successful in doing so.1,2 A government committed to choice for patients must improve this figure.3 Developing palliative care services in primary care is essential for realising the expectations of dying people. Such services could also offer important opportunities for extending supportive humane care at an earlier stage, and to people not only with cancer but with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, motor neurone disease, and cardiac failure, for example, who also often have palliative care needs.     Primary care professionals have the potential and ability to provide end of life care for most patients, given adequate training, resources, and, when needed, specialist advice.4,5 They share common values with palliative care specialists—holistic, patient centred care, delivered in the context of families and friends.6 However, until recently, apart from Macmillan general practitioners and nurse facilitators, few comprehensive workforce initiatives have been undertaken in primary care that focus on end of life care.     Many cancer patients and their carers experience existential distress long before they die.7 Recognising and alleviating such suffering is important, but it often goes unrecognised or is overlooked by services focusing on the terminal phase of illnesses. Primary care teams may know patients over long periods of time. They can readily identify patients from cancer and chronic disease registers who might benefit from an early palliative care approach. Such patients could be identified by clinicians asking one simple question of themselves: “Would I be surprised if my patient were to die in the next 12 months?”8 By identifying such patients proactively we could deliver, simultaneously, active treatment and patient centred supportive care, through a team with whom many patients have a valued long term relationship.     Palliative care services need to be extended to patients with non-malignant conditions who have comparable concerns to and in some cases even greater unmet needs than cancer patients.9 Progress by palliative medicine specialists is hampered by issues such as uncertainty about the most effective models of care, lack of non-cancer expertise, and concerns about pressure on specialist services. General practitioners and community nurses can lead the way in providing a palliative care approach for patients with terminal organ failure illness. The first step in such an approach is for the goals of care to be discussed and agreed. Management plans are adjusted accordingly. Effective control of symptoms and maintaining quality of life are prioritised.     In the light of these important opportunities it is regrettable that the new general medical services contract has not prioritised palliative care. By day, other developments to achieve the quality indicators are taking precedence. By night and at weekends, the new unscheduled care services (which are responsible for providing care for 75% of the hours in the week) are even less well configured than previous out of hours provision to facilitate dying at home. Such services specialise in dealing with acute emergencies and, as such, often struggle to meet the medical, nursing, and social care needs of dying people and their families. These changes will greatly affect care for dying people and may increase the number of hospital admissions.     However, one important initiative is gaining momentum within primary care. The Gold Standards Framework is a resource for organising proactive palliative care in the community and is supported by funding from the Cancer Services Collaborative, Macmillan Cancer Relief, and the National Lottery.10 The framework provides a detailed guide to providing holistic, patient centred care and thereby facilitates effective care in the community. Other recently initiated mechanisms for developing primary palliative care include the training of general practitioners with a special interest in palliative care and the new end of life initiative in England to improve palliative care provision by generalists and to share examples of good practice.     To support such developments it is essential that primary palliative care is supported by an adequate academic base.11 This is admittedly a challenging arena in which to undertake research, but progress has been made in recent years in developing conceptual models and research architectures for studying end of life issues. Now we need to build on this work to ensure that the understanding and insights gleaned can be translated into effective interventions.     Every person with a progressive illness has a right to palliative care.12 Patients desire a reassuring professional presence in the face of death. General practitioners and community nurses are trusted by patients and are in a position to provide effective, equitable, and accessible palliative care. This will happen only if they have adequate time and resources and work in a system that encourages such care. Patients who receive holistic support in the community may be less likely to require expensive admission to hospital and often futile treatments at the end of their lives.

Stephen Gregory Yzerman (; born May 9, 1965) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey player who spent his entire NHL playing career with the Detroit Red Wings and is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. He is currently the general manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning. In 2017, Yzerman was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history. Yzerman was born in Cranbrook, British Columbia, but grew up in Nepean, Ontario, (a suburb of Ottawa, now a district in that city) where he attended Bell High School and played for his hometown Nepean Raiders Junior A hockey team. After one season with the Raiders, the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) drafted him, and he played centre for the Petes from 1981 to 1983.  The 1983 NHL Entry Draft was the first for Mike and Marian Ilitch, who had purchased the Detroit Red Wings in the summer of 1982. Jim Devellano, the Red Wings' then-general manager, wanted to draft Pat LaFontaine, who had grown up outside Detroit and played his junior hockey in the area. However, when the New York Islanders selected LaFontaine third overall, Devellano \\"settled\\" on Yzerman, drafting him fourth.  The Red Wings were prepared to send Yzerman back to Peterborough for one more year, but \\"after one (training camp) season, you knew he was a tremendous hockey player,\\" said Ken Holland, the current Red Wings general manager who was then a minor league goaltender for the Wings during Yzerman's rookie training camp. Yzerman tallied 39 goals and 87 points in his rookie season and finished second in Calder Memorial Trophy (rookie of the year) voting. That season, Yzerman also became the first 18-year-old to play in an NHL All-Star Game (18 years, 267 days) since the current format was adopted in 1969. This stood as an NHL record for 27 years until Jeff Skinner broke it by eight days.

In the late 1950s his family performed publicly where his father, Stuart, played saxophone, his mother, Voi, on piano and his older brother, Todd Hunter (born 1951), on guitar with Marc providing drums. He also grew up with two younger brothers, Ross and Brett. Hunter remembered, \\"We got guitars for Christmas one year, I broke mine but Todd played his. In August 1982 Dragon reformed with the line-up of Marc, Todd, Hewson, Jacobsen and Robert Taylor on guitar (ex-Mammal) for a national Class Reunion tour. McFarlane noted that it was \\"Ostensibly run to pay off outstanding debts, the tour proved so successful that the band re-formed on a permanent basis.\\" Their single, \\"Rain\\", was issued in July 1983, which peaked at No. 2. It was co-written by Marc, Todd and the latter's then-girlfriend, Johanna Pigott; and had Mansfield producing. Soon after Mansfield joined Dragon on keyboards and as a songwriter.  In June 1984 the group's next album, Body and the Beat, which was produced by Mansfield and Carey Taylor, was released and peaked at No. 5. The group provided \\"a much fuller, more rock-oriented sound... [it] was a polished, contemporary sounding Adult Oriented Rock rock album.\\" After a tour in support of the album, Hewson left to return to New Zealand, he died of a heroin overdose in January 1985.  While on a break between Dragon tours Hunter joined the Party Boys, a \\"good-time rock'n'roll band\\" with a floating ensemble, for their Great Bars of Australia tour. The line-up of Hunter, Borich, Paul Christie on bass guitar (ex-Mondo Rock), Richard Harvey on drums (ex-Divinyls) and Joe Walsh on guitar and lead vocals (of the Eagles), recorded that group's fourth live album, You Need Professional Help (1985), during the tour.  Hunter issued his third solo album, Communication, in September 1985 with various session musicians used: Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter, Kirk Lorange, Mark Punch and Peter Walker on guitars, Todd Hunter and Phil Scorgie on bass guitar, Allan Mansfield and Don Walker on keyboards, and Mark Kennedy and Ricky Fataar on drums. Mansfield produced the album, which McFarlane described as \\"a polished set of Adult Oriented Rock (AOR) songs.\\" Its title track had been released as a single in 1984.

Given those answer options, answer the question: As someone diagnosed with bpd this question kinda tugged at my heart, for a few reasons. From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process. But, to avoid hurting anyone you love, you should definitely talk to a counselor if you are looking for another person to help you :) For family members/lovers/caregivers, it's stressful and often results in a lot of resentment in the relationship!

Sarah was able to get a car payment reduction without a refinanced loan unlike Kayla because  OPTIONS: A). Sarah had a worse credit score.; B). Kayla had a worse credit score.;","output":"To determine the appropriate ending for the sentence, let's first analyze the context. The sentence mentions that Sarah was able to get a car payment reduction without refinancing her loan, unlike Kayla, which implies that there must be a difference between Sarah and Kayla's situations that allowed for this outcome. Now, let's evaluate the two options: A) Sarah had a worse credit score. B) Kayla had a worse credit score. Credit score typically plays a role in determining whether or not someone is eligible for car payment reductions. A higher credit score generally implies a better financial standing and a lower risk for lenders, making them more likely to approve reductions. On the other hand, a lower credit score signifies a greater risk for lenders, making it less likely for them to approve reductions. Given this context, option B seems to be the most appropriate ending for the sentence, as it highlights the difference in their situations and explains why Sarah was able to get a car payment reduction without refinancing her loan, unlike Kayla.

Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.  Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1]  Now, I have a new situation: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is studying the effect of insect species on environment. For his study he chose four locations, location A, location B, location C and the entire globe, which he denoted as location D. He noticed location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary , but location B's loss is permanent. Location C's loss of biodiversity yet to be determined.  Answer this question please: Which location most probably suffered land loss or similar processes, location A or location B? A:","output":"Location B most probably suffered land loss or similar processes. This is because the loss of biodiversity in location A is temporary, which suggests that the environmental degradation in this area is reversible through ecological restoration or ecological resilience. In contrast, the loss of biodiversity in location B is permanent, implying that the environmental degradation in this area is effectively permanent and might be due to land loss or other irreversible processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In which place plant roots would play greater role in soil development, Kenya or Tanzania?  Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Answer:","output":"In Kenya, plant roots would play a greater role in soil development compared to Tanzania. Although both grasslands and forests contribute organic matter to the soil, the deep and fibrous grass root systems in Kenya's grasslands contribute significantly to soil development. The frequent fires also stimulate even greater contributions from the grass roots. In contrast, Tanzania's forests have a thinner A-horizon, with the majority of organic matter coming from the fallen leaves on the forest floor (O horizon). The increased acidity in forests also inhibits certain soil organisms, preventing them from mixing the surface litter into the mineral soil, which contributes to less participation of plant roots in soil development compared to grasslands."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Choose your answer from: --Use apple juice as a marinade. --Use pickle juice as a marinade....I think the answer is","output":"\\"Use pickle juice as a marinade.\\" Pickles are known for their tangy flavor because they are soaked in vinegar or another kind of sour (aka tangy) liquid. When you marinate meat in pickle juice, it helps the meat to soak up that yummy tangy flavor. On the other hand, apple juice is more sweet than tangy. If you marinated meat in apple juice, it would make the meat taste a bit sweet, not tangy.

The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the quality of the rabbet bit in various aspects. Firstly, the title \\"You get what you pay for\\" implies that the product was inexpensive, and, as a consequence, the quality was compromised. The phrase is often used for situations where purchasing a less expensive or cheaper item results in poor quality or performance. The reviewer elaborates on this by describing the rabbet bit as \\"low quality,\\" indicating that the overall performance, durability, and potentially even the appearance of the bit did not meet their expectations. They also note that it \\"might suffice for a one-time job,\\" which suggests that the product is not suitable for consistent or professional use due to its inferior quality. Furthermore, the reviewer mentions that they have \\"already discarded it at this point,\\" which implies that they have chosen not to continue using the product due to the issues they have encountered. Discarding the bit could be a result of frustration, disappointment, or an inability to complete their project with the provided tool. Lastly, the reviewer provides a specific concern they had with the product: \\"the bit I received did not measure to an exact 3/8\\" rabbet.\\" This statement indicates that not only were there general issues with the quality of the rabbet bit, but that there was also a specific problem with its size or accuracy, making it unsuitable or unusable for the purpose it was intended for.

To answer the question, we need to specify the gland responsible for the surge in hormones during puberty. The gland involved in this process is the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is a small, pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain. It is often referred to as the \\"master gland\\" because it controls the function of other glands in the endocrine system and plays a critical role in regulating growth, metabolism, reproduction, and other essential physiological processes. During puberty, the pituitary gland secretes several hormones that stimulate the gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females) to produce sex hormones, such as testosterone in males and estrogen in females. The pituitary gland does so by releasing two primary hormones: luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). These hormones act on the gonads to stimulate the production of sex hormones, which in turn cause the development of secondary sexual characteristics and the onset of the reproductive capacity in both males and females. In summary, the pituitary gland is the gland responsible for secreting a surge of hormonal agents into the bloodstream during puberty. This surge in hormones triggers a series of physical changes and the development of secondary sexual characteristics in both males and females."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is therefore deeply involved in issues of e-Government . It was created by Prime Minister Tony Blair in September 2004 , replacing the Office of the e-Envoy . Its first head was Ian Watmore , who was succeeded in January 2006 by Andrew Stott . The eGU website was closed down in 2007 .  - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.  - E-government (short for electronic government) is the use of electronic communications devices, computers and the Internet to provide public services to citizens and other persons in a country or region. According to Jeong, 2007 the term consists of the digital interactions between a citizen and his or her government (C2G), between governments and other government agencies (G2G), between government and citizens (G2C), between government and employees (G2E), and between government and businesses/commerces (G2B). E-government delivery models can be broken down into the following categories: This interaction consists of citizens communicating with all levels of government (city, state/province, national, and international), facilitating citizen involvement in governance using information and communication technology (ICT) (such as computers and websites) and business process re-engineering (BPR).  - Whitehall is a road in the City of Westminster, Central London, which forms the first part of the A3212 road from Trafalgar Square to Chelsea.

În opinia sa, declaraţia de independenţă a albanezilor kosovari nu va avea consecinţe asupra relaţiilor economice dintre Serbia şi Kosovo. Translate to English","output":"In your opinion, the declaration of independence of the Kosovar Albanians will not have consequences on the economic relations between Serbia and Kosovo. The independence of Kosovo, which was declared by its Albanian majority in 2008, has been a contentious issue, especially with Serbia not recognizing the new state. However, it is possible to argue that the declaration of independence has not significantly impacted economic relations between the two sides in the long run. Firstly, the international community has played a crucial role in maintaining stability and fostering economic cooperation in the region. The European Union (EU) and other international organizations have worked to facilitate dialogue and encourage the establishment of favorable economic policies, thereby reducing the adverse effects of Kosovo's independence on economic relations. Secondly, the normalization process has led to gradual improvements in economic ties between Serbia and Kosovo. Since the declaration of independence, both countries have signed several agreements, which have addressed some of the obstacles to economic cooperation. For example, there have been agreements on trade, energy, and telecommunications that have aided the expansion of economic ties between the two sides. Additionally, trade between Kosovo and Serbia has grown over the years, demonstrating an increasing level of economic interdependence. Despite political tensions, businesses on both sides have continued to engage in transactions, driven mainly by economic pragmatism. It is essential to note that Serbia remains one of Kosovo's main trading partners and a key source of imports. Moreover, regional economic integration has pushed Serbia and Kosovo to work together on various occasions. Since both countries aim to join the European Union, they have been asked to pursue economic and political reforms in line with EU standards. This process of integration has, to some extent, necessitated working together on economic matters, irrespective of their political differences. It is important to note that while the declaration of independence has created some obstacles to the development of economic relations between Kosovo and Serbia, both sides have shown a willingness to overcome these challenges. However, acknowledging the ongoing tensions and disputes, it is necessary to continue fostering dialogue and cooperation between Serbia and Kosovo, both bilaterally and with the support of international organizations such as the EU. In conclusion, although the declaration of Kosovo's independence has caused tensions and disagreements between the two countries, their economic relations have not suffered severely due to international support, the normalization process, increasing trade, and regional integration. With ongoing dialogue and cooperation, it is possible to maintain and further develop these economic ties between Serbia and Kosovo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer to this question? who plays dr. hahn in grey's anatomy?","output":"Dr. Erica Hahn is a fictional character in the popular TV series \\"Grey's Anatomy,\\" which premiered on ABC in 2005 and continues to air new episodes. She is a cardiothoracic surgeon who works at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, originally called Seattle Grace Hospital. Dr. Hahn is portrayed by American actress Brooke Smith, who was born on May 22, 1967, in New York City.

Question: Which country did the French pick on because they were upset about a breach of contract after declaring war on Great Britain? Context: When revolutionary France declared war on Great Britain in 1793, the United States sought to remain neutral, but the Jay Treaty, which was favorable to Great Britain, angered the French government, which viewed it as a violation of the 1778 Treaty of Alliance. French privateers began to seize U.S. vessels, which led to an undeclared \\"Quasi-War\\" between the two nations. Fought at sea from 1798 to 1800, the United States won a string of victories in the Caribbean. George Washington was called out of retirement to head a \\"provisional army\\" in case of invasion by France, but President John Adams managed to negotiate a truce, in which France agreed to terminate the prior alliance and cease its attacks.

Should I validate this answer? Pick from: [+] No. [+] Yes. Answer:","output":"Yes, the suggested answer is correct, but let's provide more details and context to the response. The process of Tennessee becoming a state began in the latter half of the 18th century, when settlers from various European backgrounds started to move into the area now known as Tennessee. These settlers, primarily forming frontier communities, organized themselves under the Watauga Association agreements and later under the Cumberland Compact, which provided local governance and established a framework for civil management. In 1784, the western part of North Carolina, including lands that later comprised Tennessee, was ceded to the U.S. federal government by North Carolina. This cession was due to the state's inability to provide resources and protection for the western settlers. The following year, in 1785, these lands were organized into the short-lived State of Franklin. However, the State of Franklin eventually disbanded in 1789 following widespread internal discord and financial difficulties. The territory was reorganized as the Southwest Territory in 1790 after the U.S. Congress passed the Southwest Territory Act, and North Carolina's cession was finalized. At this stage, William Blount was appointed as the territorial governor. Throughout the early 1790s, the population in the Southwest Territory steadily grew, paving the way for statehood. In February 1796, Congress approved Tennessee's proposed state constitution, which required one last step—ratification by the residents of the territory. The constitution was indeed ratified, and on June 1, 1796, Tennessee was officially admitted to the Union as the nation's 16th state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There's my name, Alexander Spencer, typed on the front. I throw it under the bed. The piles of envelopes are growing. The envelopes were applications to all the colleges I was supposed to attend. I did open the first envelope. Then I saw the application, all those blank spaces I was supposed to fill with my own writing, spaces for my name and birth date and grade average and ... statement of purpose. I looked at them for a long time. I could write for hours and not fill all those spaces. So I put the application back in the envelope. I would fill it out the next day, when I had time. But another envelope arrived. And then the pile began. The pile scares me -- it is really like a monster. All the while, I feel the weight of a million envelopes raining down on my head until my grandmother calls me and wants to know how I am. \\"I am overcome by too many tasks,\\" I say. \\"Honey, you just take it bit by bit,\\" she says, and she reminds me about the green beans.

It was a mountain of green beans. I couldn't do it. My grandma came to me and asked if I could eat one green bean. \\"But Grandma, I have to eat ten!\\" She said all I had to do was to eat one green bean. One tiny little green bean. So I ate one. It was bad, but not as bad as I'd thought it would be. Then she asked me again if I could eat one. So I ate one green bean nine more times. My grandma doesn't know about the envelopes, but she tells me anyone can do one thing every day. Back in my room, I lay down on the bed.

Second question: We know that love fades for many reasons. But for people who are left, do we have the right to blame those who walk away from love? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from: 1. no. 2. yes.","output":"1. The point of love, even if one day the other person may stop loving you back and walk away, is that love encompasses a range of emotional and mental states that bring about feelings of happiness, security, and well-being. In a more philosophical context, love is considered an essential human emotion and experience that can contribute to personal growth, understanding, and overall quality of life. The reality in relationships is that sometimes, feelings change, and people grow apart. While it is true that the possibility of the other person walking away exists, that does not necessarily mean you should avoid love altogether. Love leads to many positive experiences and memories that can shape and define your life. In addition, experiencing love and heartbreak can actually provide valuable lessons that make you stronger, more self-aware, and better equipped to forge healthier and stronger relationships in the future. Part of love is taking the risk, knowing that there is a chance it may not work out, but also understanding that the experience and strength that come from love are worthwhile. People change and grow throughout their lives, and it's important to cherish the moments and memories of love while recognizing that relationships will have their ebbs and flows. 2. When people walk away from love, sadly, it leaves others feeling hurt and in pain. It is normal for those left behind to feel a mix of emotions and, in certain situations, to seek for someone to blame. However, it is essential to consider the reasons and circumstances when someone walks away from a relationship before assigning blame. Situations and feelings may change with time, and people may outgrow each other. It might become necessary for individuals to love themselves and prioritize their personal growth and well-being, which might mean ending an unhealthy or unfulfilling relationship. In these cases, it may not be fair to place blame on the person who chose to walk away, as these decisions are often difficult and come after much contemplation and inner struggle. However, there are instances in which someone leaves a relationship because they acted irresponsibly or without much thought for their partner's feelings. In these cases, it's more understandable to feel wronged and to a certain extent, blame the person for their lack of accountability and sensitivity. Ultimately, understanding the complexities of why love fades is crucial in the healing process. Assigning blame might provide temporary relief, but it is important to seek understanding, self-reflection, and acceptance of the situation to move past those feelings. Engaging in an internal dialogue and talking through your emotions with friends, family, or even a therapist can help offer clarity during this transitional and emotional time. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same. The first question focuses on the purpose of love even when it might be lost, while the second question emphasizes the implications of assigning blame when someone walks away from love. Both questions, however, allow for meaningful contemplation on the fragile, complex, and ever-evolving connections made through love and relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Whether you've been married for two years or twenty years, it can easily feel like you and your partner have fallen into a rut. Routines form because they are convenient and they make it easier to navigate your day-to-day life, but falling into ruts and routines in your relationship can slowly kill the romance without you even realizing it.  If you usually eat in most nights, try going out for a date night. If you typically make your own separate meals, try cooking a meal for your partner and eating together. Do something exciting together that you and your spouse wouldn't normally do. It doesn't have to be anything crazy, but it should push you both to have fun and get excited together. Take a romantic vacation together, or just plan a fun and exciting day together - even if it just means going to a carnival or an amusement park. When you and your spouse were dating, you probably flirted with one another all the time. So why did you stop? Most couples get comfortable with one another, which is obviously a good thing. But the downside of getting comfortable is forgetting how to turn on the charm, often because you haven't had to in several months (or even years).  Make eye contact. Smile at your partner and act giggly. Use romantic body language, and mimic your partner's body language.  Stand facing one another, avoid crossing your arms, and lean in towards one another when you speak. Physical contact is an important component of intimacy. Physical contact makes you feel desired, and it can make you feel comfortable and closer with your partner. If you're already very intimate and have a lot of physical contact, then keep doing it. If you've lost that part of your relationship, make an effort to bring it back.  Physical contact doesn't just mean sex (although many people do consider sex a healthy part of marriage). It can mean holding hands, snuggling, embracing, kissing, or any other kind of affectionate contact. Your partner probably wants physical contact as much as you do, but may be too shy or worried that you don't also want it. Don't stress over physical contact, just initiate it. Your partner will appreciate it, and it will help you both feel closer to one another. Remember that feelings often follow actions. If you put forth the effort and try to make a romantic evening for one another, the romantic feelings will follow. If you've been married for a while, you probably both feel overwhelmed from time to time with trying to balance your work life and your home life. This can be even more daunting if you have kids. But making time for intimacy without any distractions (kids, work calls/emails, etc.) can do wonders to bring back the spark in your relationship, especially if you make it a consistent priority week after week.  Spending time with one another, especially with physical contact, often sets the stage for sex and will make you both feel closer to one another. If you have to, schedule time for intimacy and/or sex. Experts advise that even setting aside 30 minutes for some intimate time alone can do wonders for your relationship. Drop your kids off at a babysitter's, or if they're old enough to be out alone you can give them money to go see a movie or shop at the mall. That will buy you some alone time with your spouse. Turn off your cellphones when you're being intimate together. Nothing kills the mood like your partner getting dragged into a long work-related phone call. Intimacy isn't just a one-time thing. You'll need to work hard to make time for it every week, or several times a week, or however often you and your partner need it. This relates to being honest and open in your communication with one another. Some people are afraid to convey their desires to others, even to a spouse. However, your preferences are nothing to feel embarrassed or ashamed of. Talk to your partner about what your sexual preferences or fantasies are, and ask your partner about his or her preferences. And no matter what you or your partner want, be mutually respectful of one another's needs.  Feeling like your sexual preferences aren't being met can make sex unfulfilling, which over time can feel almost like a chore. The best way to mutually enjoy sex is to communicate to your partner what you like or don't like, and ask your spouse to do the same. Be willing to explore new things together in the bedroom so that you and your partner are both having your needs met. Plus, trying new things in general can lend a spark to your relationship, and you might find you both enjoy your new routine. Being respectful of your partner's needs doesn't mean putting yourself in an uncomfortable situation. It's okay to have boundaries and to expect your partner to respect those boundaries. Some people have the impression that couple's therapy is only for people who are on the verge of divorce. However, that is simply not true. Couple's therapy can help you and your spouse work on communication skills, find ways to feel more intimate, and work through any difficulties that arise in your marriage.  There's no shame or stigma in seeing a therapist. Couple's therapy can help you and your partner at any stage of your relationship. If you or your partner experience little to no sex drive after previously having a sex drive, your therapist may refer you to your primary physician to see if there are any medical explanations. Sometimes certain medications can reduce sexual urges or the ability to perform sexually. Other times there may be an emotional reason why a person's sex drive decreases. Be honest and open with your therapist and with your doctor to address any intimacy issues you're experiencing. Summary:","output":"When a husband and wife are together for a long time, sometimes they forget to have fun and be romantic. This can happen because they get too comfortable and are busy with work, kids, and other things. To help bring back romance, they can: 1. Try new and fun things together, like going on dates or vacations. 2. Flirt, smile, and use romantic body language. 3. Show affection with physical touch, like holding hands or hugging. 4. Make time for intimacy, like turning off phones and focusing on each other. 5. Talk about what they like and don't like in the bedroom, and respect each other's boundaries. 6. Consider couple's therapy to help improve communication and work on any problems. Doing these activities can help bring back the spark in a relationship, as well as make both partners feel closer and happier."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An unemployed military veteran who raised no funds and put up no campaign website shocked South Carolina's Democratic Party leadership by capturing the nomination Tuesday to face Republican U.S. Sen.

With nearly all precincts reporting, Alvin Greene, 32, commanded 59 percent of the vote against 41 percent for former four-term state lawmaker Vic Rawl, 64, who had raised about 186,000 and had to abruptly scrap a late-week fundraiser for the fall.

Greene insists that he paid the 10,400 filing fee and all other campaign expenses from his own personal funds. \\"It was 100 percent out of my pocket. I’m self-managed. It’s hard work, and just getting my message to supporters. I funded my campaign 100 percent out of my pocket and self-managed,\\" said Greene, who sounded anxious and unprepared to speak to the public. But despite his lack of election funds, Greene claims to have criss-crossed the state during his campaign—though he declined to specify any of the towns or places he visited or say how much money he spent while on the road.      \\"It wasn’t much, I mean, just, it was—it wasn’t much. Not much, I mean, it wasn’t much,\\" he said, when asked how much of his own money he spent in the primary. Greene frequently spoke in rapid-fire, fragmentary sentences, repeating certain phrases or interrupting himself multiple times during the same sentence while he searched for the right words. But he was emphatic about certain aspects of his candidacy, insisting that details about his campaign organization, for instance, weren't relevant. \\"I'm not concentrating on how I was elected—it's history. I’m the Democratic nominee—we need to get talking about America back to work, what's going on, in America.\\"      The oddity of Greene’s candidacy has already prompted speculation from local media about whether he might be a Republican plant. But Greene denies that Republicans or anyone else had approached him about running. \\"No, no—no one approached me. This is my decision,\\" he said. A 13-year military veteran, he says he had originally gotten the idea in 2008 when he was serving in Korea. \\"I just saw the country was in bad shape two years ago…the country was declining,\\" he says. \\"I wanted to make sure we continue to go up on the right track.\\" But when asked whether there was a specific person or circumstance that precipitated his decision to jump into politics, Greene simply replied: \\"nothing in particular...it's just, uh, nothing in particular.\\" South Carolina Democratic Party Chairwoman Carol Fowler speculated that Greene won because his name appeared first on the ballot, and voters unfamiliar with both candidates chose alphabetically. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"In South Carolina, a military veteran named Alvin Greene, who had no job, no money raised, and no campaign website, surprisingly won the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat.

Step 1: Combine like terms -610 = -47*y - 14*y The two terms with the variable y are -47*y and -14*y. To combine these terms, we must add their coefficients: -47 + (-14) = -61 So, -610 = -61*y. Step 2: Isolate y Now, we need to get y by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of y, which is -61: -610 = -61*y -610 / (-61) = (-61*y) / (-61) Simplifying the equation, we get: 10 = y So the solution to the equation -610 = -47*y - 14*y is: y = 10"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He had allegedly disappeared while canoeing in the North Sea, but the story that unfolded was far from expected. It was later revealed to be an elaborate plot by John himself and his wife, Anne Darwin, to deceitfully claim £500,000 in life insurance. The pair meticulously planned and pulled off this scam, subsequently fleeing to the Central American country of Panama. However, in an unexpected twist, John Darwin reappeared in Britain five years later in 2007, claiming to have no memory of any events following his supposed death, leading to a diagnosis of amnesia. This eventually led investigators on his trail, and the truth was soon brought to light.  Subheading: The trial and imprisonment Following their deceitful plot, John and Anne Darwin both faced significant consequences for their actions. They were arrested in 2007 and in 2008, they were tried and jailed for this scam. They had committed a grievous act of fraud that not only deceived insurance firms but also shocked friends and family who had mourned John's supposed death. It's worth noting that despite the fact that they collectively planned and executed the scam, the couple's relationship deteriorated while incarcerated. It is reported that they have had no contact for the last four years, symbolizing a complete breakdown in their relationship. Subheading: Life after the fraud In an intriguing development, John Darwin is reported to have rebuilt his life after being released from prison. Today, he allegedly has a new girlfriend, who is significantly younger than him at 32 years old. It seems there is another chapter to unfold yet in this extraordinary tale. Adding to the mystique, Darwin reportedly claimed that he is expecting to receive a new passport this coming March. This development, naturally, raises a myriad of questions about his future plans. After serving time for his crimes, will he choose to stay on the right side of the law or does the infamous Darwin have something else planned? In conclusion, the tale of John Darwin and his wife Anne strikingly demonstrates the lengths to which some people will go for financial gain. Their audacious plot and its subsequent unraveling is a true crime story that continues to capture public interest well over a decade later."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The virus is a variant of the virus malaria created by three scientists. They discovered and manufactured the virus with the intent of turning it into a biological weapon. Their goal was to produce soldiers who could continue fighting, even while mortally wounded. The virus is transmitted through bodily fluids. The infected have superhuman abilities, sprinting and leaping beyond human capabilities. The zombies become very durable, and a particular zombie survives despite being thrown into a plane's engine. The 747 jumbo jet encounters massive thunderstorms, and the turbulence releases one of the scientists from the cargo hold.

Zimbabwe's central bank is introducing a 500 million note -- the highest current denomination -- as the once-prosperous southern African nation battles against spiraling hyperinflation. Zimbabwe's new 500 million note. Finance Minister Samuel Mumbengegwi made the announcement about the new note in a government gazette set for release Friday. On the back, the purple cotton bill will feature pictures of dairy cows being milked mechanically and a miner drilling underground, he said. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) last week introduced a new set of denominations, including a 100 million note, but that has not helped to clear long lines for cash at banks. Some people sleep outside banks after failing to get cash. The RBZ said a 200 million note would be in circulation Friday, together with the 500 million note. The 500 million note is worth about 8 U.S. dollars and enough to buy just eight loaves of bread. Thursday, the greenback was trading around ZW60 million and is expected to shoot up in light of the new note's introduction. Prices change on an almost daily basis as businesses now peg their prices against the U.S. dollar. Zimbabwe has had higher denominations than the 500 million note in the past. But over the past two years, the country has slashed zeros from the amount of its worthless currency -- the latest being 10 zeros in August. Once one of Africa's most promising economies, Zimbabwe is reeling under its worst humanitarian and economic crisis. A cholera outbreak has killed nearly 800 Zimbabweans, forcing hundreds to cross the border into South Africa and Botswana to seek treatment. The situation has been exacerbated by the closure of government hospitals for more than a month as health personnel demand the government review their salaries and equip the hospitals with medicines and modern machinery. In addition, 5 million people are in need of food aid, the United Nations says, in a nation that once exported food to its neighbors. There has been a spate of protests -- including two by soldiers -- over the past four weeks as people voice their displeasure over President Robert Mugabe's policies.

NEW YORK, Aug. 5 (UPI) -- A diet high in refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, white rice and many junk foods, may increase the risk of depression in postmenopausal women, according to a new study.      While carbohydrates typically increase the amount of sugar in the blood, more highly refined carbohydrates trigger a hormonal response in the body to lower blood sugar that may also have an effect on mood, fatigue or other symptoms of depression, according to a press release.      James Gangwisch, PhD, and colleagues in the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center reviewed data collected between 1994 and 1998 as part of the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, considering medical data for 87,618 women initially involved in the study and the 69,954 who participated in a 3-year follow-up interview.      Glycemic index, a measure of sugar in the blood, that was progressively higher increased the chance of developing depression by about 22 percent, and higher amounts of dietary added sugars increased the chance by about 23 percent.      The study also showed that increased consumption of dietary fiber, whole grains, vegetables, and non-juice fruits was associated with decreased risk of depression.      While further study is needed to understand the link between depression and junk food, the researchers said the results of the study suggest that dietary changes could help prevent depression.

Abstract      Background: The consumption of sweetened beverages, refined foods, and pastries has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of depression in longitudinal studies. However, any influence that refined carbohydrates has on mood could be commensurate with their proportion in the overall diet; studies are therefore needed that measure overall intakes of carbohydrate and sugar, glycemic index (GI), and glycemic load.      Objective: We hypothesized that higher dietary GI and glycemic load would be associated with greater odds of the prevalence and incidence of depression.      Design: This was a prospective cohort study to investigate the relations between dietary GI, glycemic load, and other carbohydrate measures (added sugars, total sugars, glucose, sucrose, lactose, fructose, starch, carbohydrate) and depression in postmenopausal women who participated in the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study at baseline between 1994 and 1998 (n = 87,618) and at the 3-y follow-up (n = 69,954).      Results: We found a progressively higher dietary GI to be associated with increasing odds of incident depression in fully adjusted models (OR for the fifth vs. first quintile: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.37), with the trend being statistically significant (P = 0.0032). Progressively higher consumption of dietary added sugars was also associated with increasing odds of incident depression (OR for the fifth vs. first quintile: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.41; P-trend = 0.0029). Higher consumption of lactose, fiber, nonjuice fruit, and vegetables was significantly associated with lower odds of incident depression, and nonwhole/refined grain consumption was associated with increased odds of depression.      Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that high-GI diets could be a risk factor for depression in postmenopausal women. Randomized trials should be undertaken to examine the question of whether diets rich in low-GI foods could serve as treatments and primary preventive measures for depression in postmenopausal women. The Women’s Health Initiative is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00000611. ||||| NEW YORK, NY, August 5, 2015 - A diet high in refined carbohydrates may lead to an increased risk for new-onset depression in postmenopausal women, according to a study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.      The study by James Gangwisch, PhD and colleagues in the department of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) looked at the dietary glycemic index, glycemic load, types of carbohydrates consumed, and depression in data from more than 70,000 postmenopausal women who participated in the National Institutes of Health's Women's Health Initiative Observational Study between 1994 and 1998.      Consumption of carbohydrates increases blood sugar levels to varying degrees, depending on the type of food ingested. The more highly refined the carbohydrate, the higher its score on the glycemic index (GI) scale. The GI scale, which goes from 0-100, measures the amount of sugar found in the blood after eating. Refined foods such as white bread, white rice, and soda trigger a hormonal response in the body to reduce blood sugar levels. This response may also cause or exacerbate mood changes, fatigue and other symptoms of depression.      The investigators found that progressively higher dietary GI scores and consumption of added sugars and refined grains were associated with increased risk of new-onset depression in post-menopausal women. Greater consumption of dietary fiber, whole grains, vegetables and non-juice fruits was associated with decreased risk. This suggests that dietary interventions could serve as treatments and preventive measures for depression. Further study is needed to examine the potential of this novel option for treatment and prevention, and to see if similar results are found in the broader population.      #      Video is available at the CUMC website:      Short video: https:/ / www. youtube. com/ watch?v= 0pC8xbZOl40      Full video: https:/ / youtu. be/ jVU9N2lrlmI      The paper is \\"High Glycemic Index Diet as a Risk Factor for Depression: Analyses from the Women's Health Initiative.\\" The authors are James E.

Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Sea of Marmara, also known as the Sea of Marmora or the Marmara Sea, and in the context of classical antiquity as the Propontis, is the inland sea, entirely within the borders of Turkey, that connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, thus separating Turkey's Asian and European parts. The Bosphorus strait connects it to the Black Sea and the Dardanelles strait to the Aegean Sea. The former also separates Istanbul into its Asian and European sides. The sea has an area of 11,350 km² (280 km x 80 km) with the greatest depth reaching .  - Thrace (Modern , \\"Thráke\\" \\"Trakiya\\") is a historical and geographic area in southeast Europe, centered on the modern borders of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. In antiquity, it was also referred to as Europe, prior to the extension of the term to describe the whole continent. As a geographical concept, Thrace designates a region bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north, Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south, and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east. The areas it comprises are southeastern Bulgaria (Northern Thrace), northeastern Greece (Western Thrace), and the European part of Turkey (Eastern Thrace). The biggest part of Thrace is part of present-day Bulgaria. In Turkey, it is also called Rumeli. The name comes from the Thracians, an ancient Indo-European people inhabiting Southeastern Europe.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents.

Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - Anatolia (from Greek , '  \\"east\\" or \\"(sun)rise\\"; in modern ), in geography known as Asia Minor (from '  \\"small Asia\\"; in modern ), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland.  - The Aegean Sea  is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea located between the Greek and Anatolian peninsulas, i.e., between the mainlands of Greece and Turkey. In the north, it is connected to the Marmara Sea and Black Sea by the Dardanelles and Bosphorus. The Aegean Islands are within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including Crete and Rhodes.  - The Dardanelles, also known in Classical Antiquity as the Hellespont (\\"Hellespontos\\", literally \\"Sea of Helle\\"), is a narrow, natural strait and internationally-significant waterway in northwestern Turkey that forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey. One of the world's narrowest straits used for international navigation, the Dardanelles connects the Sea of Marmara with the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, while also allowing passage to the Black Sea by extension via the Bosphorus.  - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago.  - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.  - Kazakhstan ( \\"Qazaqstan\\",  \\"Kazakhstan\\"), officially the Republic of Kazakhstan (\\"Qazaqstan Respwblïkas\\" \\"Respublika Kazakhstan\\"), is a transcontinental country in northern Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the ninth largest in the world, with an area of . Kazakhstan is the dominant nation of Central Asia economically, generating 60% of the region's GDP, primarily through its oil/gas industry. It also has vast mineral resources.  - The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed inland body of water on Earth by area, variously classed as the world's largest lake or a full-fledged sea. It is in an endorheic basin (it has no outflows) located between Europe and Asia. It is bound by Kazakhstan to the northeast, Russia to the northwest, Azerbaijan to the west, Iran to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southeast.  - Honshu had a population of 103 million , mostly concentrated in the coastal lowlands, notably in the Kant plain where 25% of the total population resides in the Greater Tokyo Area. As the historical center of Japanese culture and political power, the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including Kyoto, Nara, and Kamakura. Much of the island's southern shore forms part of the Taiheiy Belt, a megalopolis that spans several of the Japanese islands.  - Salamanders are a group of amphibians typically characterized by a lizard-like appearance, with slender bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs projecting at right angles to the body, and the presence of a tail in both larvae and adults. All present-day salamander families are grouped together under the scientific name Urodela. Salamander diversity is most abundant in the Northern Hemisphere and most species are found in the Holarctic ecozone, with some species present in the Neotropical zone.  - Triturus is a genus of newts comprising the crested and the marbled newts , which are found from Great Britain through most of continental Europe to westernmost Siberia , Anatolia , and the Caspian Sea region . Their English names refer to their appearance : marbled newts have a green -- black colour pattern , while the males of crested newts , which are dark brown with a yellow or orange underside , develop a conspicuous jagged seam on their back and tail during their breeding phase . Crested and marbled newts live and breed in vegetation - rich ponds or similar aquatic habitats for two to six months and usually spend the rest of the year in shady , protection - rich land habitats close to their breeding sites . Males court females with a ritualised display , ending in the deposition of a spermatophore that is picked up by the female . After fertilisation , a female lays 200 -- 400 eggs , folding them individually into leaves of water plants . Larvae develop over two to four months before metamorphosing into land - dwelling juveniles . Historically , most European newts were included in the genus , but taxonomists have split off the alpine newt ( Ichthyosaura ) , the small - bodied newts ( Lissotriton ) and the banded newts ( Ommatotriton ) as separate genera . The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts ( Calotriton ) . Two species of marbled newts and six species of crested newts , formerly considered subspecies , are accepted , with one additional crested newt species suspected . Their ranges are largely contiguous but where they do overlap , hybridisation may take place . Although not immediately threatened , crested and marbled newts suffer from population declines , caused mainly by habitat loss and fragmentation . Both their aquatic breeding sites and the cover - rich , natural landscapes upon which they depend during their terrestrial phase are affected . All species are legally protected in Europe , and some of their habitats have been designated as special reserves .  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - A newt is a salamander in the subfamily Pleurodelinae, also called eft during its terrestrial juvenile phase. Unlike other members of the family Salamandridae, newts are semiaquatic, alternating between aquatic and terrestrial habitats over the year, sometimes even staying in the water full-time. Not all aquatic salamanders are considered newts, however. The more than 100 known species of newts are found in North America, Europe, North Africa and Asia. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental life stages: aquatic larva, terrestrial juvenile (eft), and adult. Adult newts have lizard-like bodies and return to the water every year to breed, otherwise living in humid, cover-rich land habitats.  - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.  - In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law.  - The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about .  - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes  they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.  - A larva (plural \\"larvae\\" ) is a distinct juvenile form many animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle.  - Siberia is an extensive geographical region, and by the broadest definition is also known as North Asia. Siberia has historically been a part of Russia since the 17th century.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - North Asia or Northern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of Siberia, and Russian Far East in the Asian portion of Russia  the area east of the Ural Mountains. A large part of the region is also known as Asian Russia.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

Options: 1). negative; 2). positive; Answer:","output":"2). positive; Though there are criticisms mentioned in the review such as the higher prices and the need to actively gain the staff's attention, they do not seem to significantly diminish the reviewer's overall positive impression of the restaurant. They identify the good service—the employees understand both English and Korean—and express satisfaction with the food, calling it good. Additionally, they seem content with the restaurant's convenient location, being only a 15 mins walk from Cosmo, and its availability for late-night or early morning meals. Most notably, the reviewer illustrates their positive sentiment by stating, ‘but I would pay anything to get my cravings met.’ This statement reflects their willingness to overlook the higher prices because of the satisfaction they get from the food.  Also, the author has awarded the restaurant 4 stars, an indicator of a rather positive experience. Lastly, the statement 'lack of competition for this restaurant' can be viewed as a positive remark, suggesting that this restaurant is unique in its offerings and hard to compete with in terms of late-night availability and Korean cuisine.

Cadbury said it would \\"help educate people\\" on nutrition, healthy eating and exercise. But critics said chocolate should not be associated with healthy lifestyles. The scheme is an extension to a community programme called Health for Life, which works with 60,000 children to encourage them to be healthy. New sessions will be added from the start of the 2017/18 season when Cadbury becomes a partner of the league. National Obesity Forum spokesman, Tam Fry, said: \\"If the sponsorship meant that a host of kids would be encouraged to exercise and kick footballs to kingdom come, but didn't come near a bar of chocolate, the forum might regard it as money well spent. \\"But since the Premier League is rich enough to do this on its own anyway, and Cadbury could be looking at a downturn in the confectionery market, we regard this as little more than a marketing ploy.\\" The pairing has also drawn criticism from Action on Sugar. Nutritionist and campaign manager for the group Jennifer Rosborough said: \\"Whilst we fully support initiatives geared to promoting healthy lifestyles for children, chocolate, which is laden with sugar, should be an occasional treat and not associated with healthy living. \\"Companies should choose their partnerships more responsibly.\\" Cadbury was also criticised when it became one of the sponsors for the London 2012 Olympics. The confectioner said the partnership with the league would \\"inspire school pupils about healthy lifestyles\\". A spokeswoman said: \\"We know we have a responsibility, along with the rest of the food industry, to help address public health concerns. That's why we are planning significant community activity to help educate people on the role of nutrition, healthy eating and exercise. \\"While we have already seen great success from the Health for Life scheme, we feel that through this partnership with the Premier League we will be able to make a bigger impact together.\\" The BBC contacted the Premier League for a response but has not received a statement.

Q: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on...

Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.

Did you know that plants need our help to grow big and strong, just like we need care from our mommies and daddies? Today, we are going to learn about six easy tips to make our garden plants happy and healthy. Are you ready? Let's go! 1. Help water go away from the soil: Sometimes, soil is like a wet sponge that holds too much water. We need to help the water go away by adding drainage. Drainage is like a road for water to travel through the soil. This way the plants' roots won't be soaked in water, and they can breathe easily! 2. Give plants their own space: Plants are like us - they need their personal space, too. When plants are too close together, they can't stretch out their leaves and it's harder for them to catch sunlight. So, make sure to move plants that are too close, so they can grow and spread their leaves happily! 3. Don't give plants too much \\"blanket\\": Mulch is like a blanket we put on the soil to keep it warm. But if we put too much mulch, it can be too warm and the plants might feel too hot. It is a great idea to use just enough mulch to keep the soil cozy, but not too much. 4. Remove sad parts of the plants: Sometimes, plants might have some dead or sick parts, like leaves or branches. We need to cut these parts off so that they don't make the rest of the plant sad, too. It's like getting a haircut to help our hair grow better! 5. Don't give them too much water: We all need water to drink, but drinking too much water isn't good for us either. The same goes for plants. Make sure to give the plants the right amount of water. Over-watering can make it hard for their roots to breathe. So, we should be careful not to give them too much water! 6. Don't plant them too deep: When we plant our little plants, we need to make sure they are not too deep in the ground. If they are, it will be hard for them to come out and play with the sun. So, always remember to plant your plants just deep enough to stay safe, but not too deep where they can't reach the sunlight. Wow! You are now an expert on taking care of plants. Next time you go to the garden, remember these six tips to make your plants happy and healthy. Happy gardening!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Estimate an ideal boot shaft height.\\"","output":"Title: How to Determine Your Ideal Boot Shaft Height Introduction Finding the perfect pair of boots that fit comfortably and look stylish can be challenging. One of the most crucial factors to consider when boot shopping is the shaft height. The shaft height of a boot is the vertical distance from the top of the foot to the top of the boot, usually measured at the back. A well-suited boot shaft height ensures a comfortable fit and eliminates the chances of any unwanted discomfort or restraint while walking. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to measure and estimate an ideal boot shaft height. Step 1: Sit with your foot flat Finding the right boot shaft height starts with proper foot positioning. Sit comfortably on a chair or bench with your feet flat on the ground. This position allows your foot and leg muscles to relax, helping you achieve a more accurate measurement. Straighten your legs but avoid locking your knees, as this could also affect the measurement. Step 2: Measure up the back of your leg Begin measuring the back of your leg using a flexible measuring tape. Place the tape where the top of your shoe would normally touch the back of your heel, and extend it up the leg to the desired boot shaft height. It could be knee-high, mid-calf, or ankle level, based on your preference. It is essential to measure both legs, as most individuals have slight variations between their left and right legs. The larger or higher of the two measured distances should be considered when choosing the boot shaft height. Step 3: Measure around your calf In addition to the vertical shaft height, it is necessary to measure the circumference of your calf. This measurement will help in determining whether the boot will fit comfortably around your leg. Wrap the measuring tape around the widest part of your calf, with a gentle snug, and note down the measurement. Like the previous step, measure both calves and use the larger measurement as a reference. Step 4: Estimate an ideal boot shaft height Now that you have the measurements for both the vertical height and the circumference of your calf, it is time to estimate an ideal boot shaft height. Keep in mind that personal preferences and the type of boots you are looking for play a significant role in choosing the right shaft height. For instance, if you want tall boots for cold weather, choose a knee-high shaft height, while for a more versatile boot that pairs well with different outfits and seasons, a mid-calf or ankle-height boot would be more appropriate. A few aspects to consider while looking for an ideal boot shaft height are foot proportions, calf width, and leg length. People with a shorter leg length may prefer lower shaft heights, while taller individuals have more flexibility. Additionally, boots with wider shafts are more suitable for people with wider calves, while a slimmer shaft conforms better to a narrower calf. Conclusion Achieving the perfect fit is crucial for both comfort and style when it comes to selecting the ideal pair of boots. By following these simple steps to measure and estimate your boot shaft height based on your unique measurements, you are well on your way to finding the perfect pair. Beyond the shaft height, also look into the materials, style, and brand that resonate with your lifestyle and preference.

Two satellites, one Russian and one American, have collided some 800 kilometers (500 miles) above Siberia, the Russian and U.S. space agencies, said Thursday. Debris from the collision poses no threat to the International Space Station. The collision on Tuesday produced two large debris clouds, NASA said. The satellites collided at 10 kilometers (6 miles) per second, producing 500-600 new pieces of space debris, the U.S. Strategic Command said. That debris is not believed to pose a threat to the International Space Station as long as the clouds continue moving in a lower orbit, according to NASA and the Russian federal space agency, Roscosmos. \\"There is some elevated risk, but it is considered to be very small to the ISS and to the other satellites that NASA has in orbit,\\" NASA spokeswoman Beth Dickey told CNN. She said experts were still assessing the effects of the debris. Mikhail Martirosov, from Russian mission control center, told Interfax news agency that the real threat from the debris will become obvious next week, once experts can calculate the trajectory of the fragments' descent. \\"We have not received a warning of the possible danger to the ISS. The fragments may descend to the ISS orbit in several years, although I do not rule out that some fragments may go down within several days,\\" Martirosov said. The Russian satellite was launched in 1993 and had been out of service at the time of the collision, Roscosmos said. The U.S. satellite was part of the Iridium global mobile communications system and is owned by a consortium headed by Motorola, the space agency said. It was launched in 1997. Iridium said in a statement Wednesday it \\"expects to implement a network solution by Friday,\\" and will \\"move one of its in-orbit spare satellites into the network constellation to permanently replace the lost satellite\\" within the next 30 days. CNN is \\"one of the larger non-government users\\" of Iridium, said Arnie Christianson, operations manager for CNN Satellites and Transmission. \\"We do rely on it for communication in high-risk areas like Iraq, Afghanistan, and other remote locations,\\" he said. \\"Because of this collision, there may be a slightly longer hole in the coverage from one satellite to the next, but only in a very small area and for a very small amount of time. This is a collision, not an internal failure of the satellite or the system.\\" The satellite crash may result in \\"brief, occasional outages\\" that may slightly disrupt service, Iridium said in the statement, adding \\"this event is not the result of a failure on the part of Iridium or its technology.\\" Christianson questioned how U.S. government, which tracks all space junk larger than a football, didn't see this coming. But he said the system will continue to work without any noticeable problems. A representative of Iridium could not immediately be reached for comment. NASA's Dickey said a collision like this one is very rare. \\"This is the first impact between two intact satellites traveling at hypervelocity,\\" she said. \\"There have been some other occasions when things have accidentally collided in space, but they have been parts of rockets or parts of satellites and (produced) a very small cloud.\\" Major Regina Winchester, of the U.S. Strategic Command, said: \\"Space is getting pretty crowded. The fact that this hasn't happened before -- maybe we were getting a little bit lucky.\\" Winchester said Strategic Command tracks more than 18,000 pieces of manmade objects in space every day. \\"Any time there's an event that creates more debris, it's a concern,\\" she said. \\"All countries who have assets in space are going to be concerned simply because when there's more debris, there's a higher chance it's going to hit something.\\" CNN's Yuri Pushkin in Moscow and Melissa Gray in London contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"On Tuesday, a Russian and an American satellite collided 800 kilometers above Siberia, with both the Russian and U.S. space agencies confirming the event. The collision resulted in two large debris clouds; however, they pose no threat to the International Space Station (ISS) as long as they remain in a lower orbit. The Russian satellite had been out of service since its launch in 1993, while the American satellite was part of the Iridium global mobile communications system, launched in 1997. Despite the satellites colliding at a speed of 10 kilometers per second and producing 500-600 new pieces of space debris, experts assess the risk to the ISS and other NASA satellites in orbit as minimal. Collisions like this are very rare, though space is becoming increasingly crowded, raising concerns of increasing debris potentially affecting assets in space."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize the following: Making sure your body is in top physical condition before labor begins can reduce the likelihood of a prolonged labor. Preparing your body for what's to come can make labor easier and quicker when your baby arrives. Walk or swim regularly, and incorporate a few specialized exercises.  Kegels, small internal contractions of the pelvic muscles, can help your body with the pushing stage of labor and also reduce the risk of hemorrhoids in the weeks after childbirth. You can do kegels virtually anywhere. Simply contract the muscles around your vagina, as you would when holding in urine, then hold for four seconds and release. Repeat this 10 times. Three or four sets, done about three times a day, is ideal.  The pelvic tilt, also known as the angry cat, can strengthen abdominal muscles and reduce back pain during pregnancy. Get on your hands and knees, keeping your arms straight without locking your elbows. Tighten your abdominal muscles when breathing in and move your buttocks below your back. Relax your back when you breathe out and repeat at your own pace. Move in time to the rhythm of your breath.  Squatting helps open your pelvis, important for labor. Stand with a chair facing your back and, using the chair for support, contract abdominal muscles, lift your chest, and relax your shoulders. Lower your tailbone to the floor, as if you were going to sit down on the chair, and then rise again to the standing position. Making sure your body is healthy before delivery is vital to a smooth labor. Nutrition is just as important as exercise. Each woman's body is different, so there's no one-size-fits-all guideline to how much weight you should gain.  The adage that you're eating for two is false as your caloric intake does not double. However, you should increase the amount of calories you're eating as your pregnancy progresses. In general, a woman with a BMI between 18.5 and 25.9 should gain between 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy. A woman with a BMI higher than this should only gain 15 to 25 pounds. Discuss how much weight you should gain with your doctor and know how much you should increase your caloric intake to achieve this goal. If you are pregnant with twins or multiples, you will probably need to gain more weight; discuss this with your doctor. Be sure you get plenty of fresh fruits and veggies. Focus on whole grains, such as oatmeal, whole wheat breads and pastas, brown rice, and barley. Incorporating dairy will give you plenty of potassium and calcium for you and your baby.  Be careful with fats. Stick to heart-healthy fats found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil.  Fruits and veggies high in vitamin C, vitamin A, iron, and folate are especially good for pregnant women. Try apples, oranges, green beans, spinach, sweet potatoes, pineapple, mangoes, and squash. Zinc is particularly important during pregnancy as its vital in cell development. Chicken, turkey, ham, shrimp, dairy products, beans, and peanut butter are all great sources of zinc. Eating fish can also be a great source of protein, but you should avoid fish that may have high mercury levels, such as swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish, and shark. When your contractions begin, stay calm so you're able to relax in between. This saves up energy for the later and more trying stages of labor.  There will be continual breaks between contractions throughout labor. Take advantage of such respites, especially during early labor when contractions themselves are gentler.  If possible, sleep between contractions. Practice deep breathing and other relaxation techniques. Have reading and viewing material on-hand so there's something present to distract you and help you relax during the process. Summary:","output":"Maintaining physical fitness before labor can ease the process and reduce the chances of complications. Engage in exercises such as walking, swimming, kegels, pelvic tilt, and squatting to prepare your body for labor. Nutrition is equally important, with individualized weight gain recommendations based on BMI. Focus on a balanced diet including whole grains, dairy, healthy fats, and vitamin-rich fruits and vegetables. Zinc and fish can be beneficial, but avoid high-mercury fish. During contractions, stay calm, take advantage of breaks, practice deep breathing, and use distractions to relax."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Farrah Fawcett Tribute: Golden Girl's Iconic Journey, Barbara Walters EXCLUSIVE Promotional portrait of, from left, American actresses Farrah Fawcett, Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith as they pose with palms together for the television program \\"Charlie's Angels,\\" mid 1977. Growing up in Texas, that so-called \\"curse\\" always lingered. In 1969, as a college beauty queen, Fawcett's looks earned her a ticket to Hollywood where she was discovered by a talent scout. At first, she was one more model and actress surviving on guest parts and commercials, selling everything from shampoo to toothpaste. In 1973, she married actor Lee Majors, who was starring in \\"The Six Million Dollar Man.\\" Three years later, everything changed when posters of Fawcett in her red one-piece bathing suit flew off store shelves and she entered the world of television with a starring role on \\"Charlie's Angels.\\" \\"She wasn't a great actress then, but she was learning,\\" said Leonard Goldberg, who created the hit, along with partner, producer Aaron Spelling. \\"She just had that way about her. When she would turn and look at you, you were mesmerized.\\" Fawcett played one of three undercover, underclothed crime fighters and \\"Charlie's Angels\\" became an enormous hit and cultural phenomenon, working to redefine gender roles. \\"What we had for the first time were women operating in what was heretofore a man's world,\\" Goldberg said. But after only one year, Fawcett walked away from the show at the height of her fame to explore a career in film -- a move, the star told Walters, she did not regret. \\"I would do it over again ... I felt that I needed to grow,\\" Fawcett said in 1980. \\"I find that, for me, personally -- and this is in everyday life -- if I'm not growing, if I can't be stimulated in a conversation, then I am bored. And I'm not good when I'm bored.\\" Jaclyn Smith, one of Fawcett's \\"Angels\\" co-stars, told Walters, \\"I was sad because it was not an actress leaving, it was my friend,\\" but says her friend didn't make a mistake. \\"When Farrah makes up her mind to do something, uh, it's well thought out, it's well ordered and planned, and it's right for her.\\" Her career faltered, but Fawcett was determined to take charge of her life. Firing her manager, her publicist and separating from Majors, the sweet blond from Texas revealed to Walters that she was no more. \\"I think that when you're kind of just shoved out there and you have to be tough and you're facing tough people and people are saying bad things about you, that all of a sudden, you have to become a little less sweet. ... And with this surge in strength, you lose a little of the softness, I guess,\\" she said. Tired of being the sex symbol, Fawcett wanted to be taken seriously, so she dove into an unrecognizable role, playing an abused wife, Francine Hughes, driven to kill her husband in the 1984 movie \\"The Burning Bed.\\" \\"I knew that if I wanted to stay in the business, I had to change. I mean, I wanted to change,\\" she told Walters in a later interview. The TV movie became one of the most highly-rated in history and earned the actress the first of three Emmy nominations. But if her acting career was finally the triumph she always knew it could be, her personal life wasn't. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Farrah Fawcett, a famous actress from Texas.

Google Sued in Spain Over Data Collecting MADRID — A judge in Spain opened an investigation into whether Google unlawfully collected data from unsecured wireless networks while gathering photographs for Google’s photo-mapping service Street View. The judge, Raquel Fernandino, has ordered a representative from Google to appear before her in early October over a lawsuit filed by a Spanish association of Internet users. The summons was issued last month, but made public only this week. Street View has also caused regulatory and legal problems for Google in other European countries with strict privacy laws, including Germany and Switzerland, where opponents of the Street View photo archive have been particularly outspoken. In May, a judge in Hamburg opened a criminal investigation of Google over its collection of data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks in Germany. Google has described the collection of the data as accidental and has apologized for what it called a programming error. A spokeswoman for Google Spain, Marisa Toro, said on Tuesday that the company planned to cooperate fully with the judge and other Spanish authorities to resolve the privacy concerns. “We are dedicating a lot of our time to finding a solution so that users can be at ease,” Ms. Toro said. Google introduced Street View in Spain three years ago, and Ms. Toro said that it had proved “very popular.” Plans to expand the coverage in Spain have been delayed pending an outcome in the data collection dispute. The Spanish association of Internet users, whose acronym is Apedanica, contends that Google violated an article in Spain’s criminal code that forbids the unauthorized interception and collection of such communications data. Breaching that law can lead to prison sentences of up to four years. The judge’s investigation is the most serious threat to date in Spain for Google and its mapping service. But Street View had already raised concerns among local regulators. In June, Artemi Rallo, director of the official Spanish data protection agency, Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, said in an interview that Google should hand over the original hard drives containing the actual Wi-Fi payload data — including e-mail text fragments and unencrypted passwords. Under pressure from German privacy regulators, Google acknowledged in May that it had inadvertently collected 600 gigabytes of data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks around the world as it assembled its Street View archive. The company has already agreed to destroy the data collected in Ireland, Denmark and Austria at the request of officials in those countries. Valentín Playá, the lawyer representing the Spanish association that filed the complaint against Google, said on Tuesday that “recognizing the mistake and the excuses presented by Google are not reasons to prevent the investigation, nor a criminal condemnation, if it is judged that the actions amounted to a crime and that there has been a degree of responsibility from Google.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1.

Street View has also faced regulatory and legal issues in other European countries with strict privacy laws, including Germany and Switzerland. 4. Google has described the data collection as accidental and attributes it to a programming error, while apologizing for the mistake. 5. Google Spain's spokesperson, Marisa Toro, said the company planned to cooperate fully with the judge and other Spanish authorities to resolve the privacy concerns. 6. The company has already agreed to destroy the collected data in Ireland, Denmark, and Austria at the request of officials in those countries. 7. Valentín Playá, the lawyer representing the Spanish association that filed the complaint against Google, stated that acknowledging the mistake and offering apologies are not reasons to prevent the investigation nor a possible criminal condemnation if Google is found to be responsible."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:Olly Woodburn's score inside 70 seconds put Exeter ahead, but tries from Will Hurrell, Jason Woodward and Gavin Henson helped Bristol go 14 points up. Geoff Parling and Ian Whitten tries for Exeter helped restore parity. Waldrom grabbed his brace either side of Mitch Eadie's effort, which ensured two crucial bonus points for Bristol. If not for Waldrom's ninth try of the season three minutes from the end, Bristol would have moved to within five points of second-from-bottom Worcester.

Movie plot title: Howl's Moving Castle Movie plot: Sophie, a young hatter, encounters a wizard named Howl on her way to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a ninety-year-old woman. Seeking to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the country. She encounters Howl's moving castle, where she meets Howl's young apprentice, Markl, and the fire-demon Calcifer, who is the source of the castle's energy and magic. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that Calcifer has hired her as a cleaning lady for the house. Meanwhile, Sophie's country is caught up in a war with a neighboring country. The King summons Howl to fight in the war; however, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King under the pretense of being his mother, to tell the king that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives to Sophie a charmed ring that connects her to Calcifer. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's advisor, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power, causing her to regress into a harmless old woman. Suliman says that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight; Sophie protests passionately in his defense, allowing Suliman to see Sophie's true form, and to realize that she has feelings for Howl. Howl arrives to rescue Sophie; Suliman tries to trap him, but with Sophie's help, they escape along with the former witch. Sophie learns that Howl has been transforming into a bird-like creature in order to interfere with the plans of both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Sophie's mother â under Suliman's control â arrives and leaves behind a \\"peeping bug.\\" The former witch promptly destroys the bug by tossing it into Calcifer, who then becomes sick and weak and unable to protect the castle. A few hours later the city is bombed by enemy aircraft. Suliman's henchmen invade the group's abode.

Old Occitan generally includes Early and Old Occitan. Middle Occitan is sometimes included in Old Occitan, sometimes in Modern Occitan. As the term \\"occitanus\\" appeared around the year 1300, Old Occitan is referred to as \\"Romance\\" (Occitan: \\"romans\\") or \\"Provençal\\" (Occitan: \\"proensals\\") in medieval texts.  - The trobairises (singular: trobairitz) were Occitan female troubadours of the 12th and 13th centuries, active from around 1170 to approximately 1260. The word \\"trobairitz\\" was first used in the 13th-century romance \\"Flamenca\\". It comes from the Provençal word \\"trobar\\", the literal meaning of which is \\"to find\\", and the technical meaning of which is \\"to compose\\". The word \\"trobairitz\\" is used very rarely in medieval Occitan, as it does not occur in lyrical poetry, grammatical treatises, or in the biographies of the \\"trobairitz\\" or troubadours. \\"Trobairitz\\" composed, wrote verses, and performed for the Occitan noble courts. They are exceptional in musical history as the first known female composers of Western secular music; all earlier known female composers wrote sacred music. The \\"trobairitz\\" were part of courtly society, as opposed to their lower class counterparts the \\"joglaressas\\". Although troubadours sometimes came from humble originsBernart de Ventadorn may have been the son of a castle's bakerthe \\"trobairitz\\" were nobly born. The most important \\"trobairitz\\" are Alamanda de Castelnau, Azalais de Porcairagues, Maria de Ventadorn, Tibors, Castelloza, Garsenda de Proença, Gormonda de Monpeslier, and the Comtessa de Diá.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits. The city is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France.  - Aude is a department in south-central France named after the river Aude. The local council also calls the department \\"Cathar Country\\". Aude is also a frequent feminine French given name in Francophone countries, deriving initially from Aude or Oda, a wife of Bertrand, Duke of Aquitaine, and mother of Saint Hubertus's brother Eudo. Aude was the name of Roland's fiancée in the chansons de geste.  - A troubadour was a composer and performer of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages (11001350). Since the word \\"troubadour\\" is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a trobairitz.  - Lyric poetry is a formal type of poetry which expresses personal emotions or feelings, typically spoken in the first person. The term derives from a form of Ancient Greek literature, the lyric, which was defined by its musical accompaniment, usually on a stringed instrument known as a lyre. The term owes its importance in literary theory to the division developed by Aristotle between three broad categories of poetry: lyrical, dramatic and epic.  - Narbonne (Occitan: \\"Narbona\\") is a commune in southern France in the Occitanie region. It lies from Paris in the Aude department, of which it is a sub-prefecture. Once a prosperous port, and a major city in Roman times, it is now located about from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. It is marginally the largest commune in Aude, although the prefecture is the slightly smaller commune of Carcassonne.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - A minstrel was a medieval European entertainer. Originally describing any type of entertainer such as a musician, juggler, acrobat, singer or fool, the term later, from the sixteenth century, came to mean a specialist entertainer who sang songs and played musical instruments.  - Peire Rogier ( born c. 1145 ) was a twelfth - century Auvergnat troubadour ( fl . 1160 -- 1180 ) and cathedral canon from Clermont . He left his cathedral to become a travelling minstrel before settling down for a time in Narbonne at the court of the Viscountess Ermengard . His life and career are known because his late thirteenth - century vida survives , as well as some of his works . The reliability of his vida , upon which all the details of his goings and comings are known , however , is not complete . According to it , he left the religious life to become a jongleur . He fell in love with his hostess and patron and wrote many songs in her honour , giving Ermengard the nickname Tort - n'avetz ( \`\` You are wrong '' ) , but for what reasons is unknown . Eventually the people of the Narbonnaise believed that he was in a sexual relationship with the viscountess and so she asked him to leave . He moved on to the court of Raimbaut d'Aurenga , where he also remained for a long time . From Raimbaut 's court he moved on to sojourn at that of Alfonso VIII of Castile , then that of Alfonso II of Aragon , and finally that of Raymond V of Toulouse , where he arrived circa 1170 . According to his vida , he became much esteemed as a troubadour through his travels , but there is no evidence otherwise for any movements in Spain , except perhaps the assembly of troubadours at the court of Aragon mentioned in a work of Peire d'Alvernhe ( which need not have taken place ) . He entered the Order of Grandmont before his death . Peire Rogier 's style of courtly love poetry is of the extremely reverent variety , in which the man submits completely to his lady and she is a paragon of virtue and courtliness ( though the word cortezia is absent from his surviving works ) . She can by mere words convert a boorish man into a courtly one . Love need not be physical to be enjoyed and suffering on behalf of one 's lady is considered pleasure .

Q:What is the name of the group that had plotted to park \\"a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer\\"?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  McVeigh later said that he had contemplated assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he said that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.A resident of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story government building in Little Rock, Arkansas, because of the presence of a florist's shop on the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh's target: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The Murrah building had been previously targeted in October 1983 by white supremacist group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, including founder James Ellison and Richard Snell. The group had plotted to park \\"a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer.\\" After Snell's appeal for murdering two people in unrelated cases was denied, he was executed the same day as the Murrah bombing.The nine-story building, built in 1977, was named for a federal judge and housed fourteen federal agencies, including the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps.

The Stooges operate a local drugstore whose landlord, the cantankerous Amos Flint, informs them their lease is about to expire. Larry protests that the trio have had their establishment for a decade, and do not want to leave. As the four bicker, Flint's elderly wife Cerina enters the store, only to be berated by Flint for being an old hag. \\"25 years is enough,\\" he coldly confirms. After he storms off, the boys take to the frail Cerina, who begins to weep that ever since she lost her beauty, Amos had threatened to leave. Both saddened and incensed, the Stooges offer Cerina their spare room in the back. Shemp, seeing this, hatches a plan to invent a \\"Fountain of Youth\\" to restore Cerina to her stunning beauty. Deeming the idea \\"tremendous, colossal and putrid,\\" the Stooges flee to their pharmaceutical lab and mix together a powerful serum. After several false tries, the trio give Cerina a taste of their Fountain of Youth, and she transforms into a fetching beauty right before their eyes. Several days later, Amos comes storming into the Stooges' drug store only to see the youthful Cerina flaunting her newfound beauty. Amos quickly reneges on his threat to evict the Stooges and even gives them the deed to their store in exchange for a dose of the serum himself. The Stooges proceed to mix a new batch on the spot, resulting in Amos becoming a baby. The following day, Cerina celebrates her return to youth by preparing a Marshmallow Jumbo layer cake.

Option A: 0.184  Option B: 0.16  Option C: 0.18  Option D: 0.147  Option E: 0.148","output":"Let's break down the task: 1. We have a 10-sided die with three red sides. 2. Kumar rolls the die 3 times. 3. We want to find the probability of the die landing red for the first time on the third roll. We will use probability concepts to solve this problem. We first need to identify the probability of getting a red side on one roll and the probability of getting a non-red side on one roll.  Probability of rolling a red side (R) = Number of red sides / Total sides = 3/10 Probability of rolling a non-red side (N) = Non-red sides / Total sides = 7/10 (since there are 10 - 3 = 7 non-red sides) Now, we want the die to land red for the first time on the third roll. This means the sequence of rolls should be: Non-Red, Non-Red, Red (N-N-R). Probability of this sequence: P(N-N-R) = P(N) * P(N) * P(R) = (7/10) * (7/10) * (3/10) Now, multiply the fractions: P(N-N-R) = (7 * 7 * 3) / (10 * 10 * 10) = 147 / 1000 = 0.147 So the probability of Kumar rolling a red side for the first time on the third roll is 0.147.

Laura corrected Lindsey's recitation of a Catholic prayer, because","output":"Laura corrected Lindsey's recitation of a Catholic prayer, because Lindsey had inadvertently omitted a few essential lines. Laura, being a devoted Catholic and an active member of their local parish, felt it was important to ensure that Lindsey understood and recited the prayers accurately. This would not only help Lindsey in achieving a stronger connection with her faith but also maintain the sanctity of the prayer itself. Step 1: Listen to Lindsey's recitation and note down the errors or omissions Laura listened attentively as Lindsey recited the prayer. While doing so, she carefully noted down the parts where Lindsey had faltered or skipped any lines. This would help her address the specific issues in Lindsey's recitation later. Step 2: Understand the reason behind Lindsey's mistakes In order to better assist Lindsey, Laura asked her about her experiences with Catholic prayers and whether she encountered any difficulties in understanding or remembering the lines. Gaining insight into Lindsey's background with prayers would help Laura tailor her approach to suit Lindsey's needs and make the learning process more effective. Step 3: Clarify the purpose and significance of each part of the prayer Before correcting the actual recitation, Laura explained the purpose and significance of each section of the prayer to Lindsey. This would provide Lindsey with a deeper understanding of the prayer, thereby making it easier for her to remember and internalize the correct lines. Step 4: Address the errors or omissions in Lindsey's recitation With a clear understanding of the prayer's meaning and Lindsey's experiences in mind, Laura went on to address the specific errors and omissions that she had noted earlier. She recited the correct lines alongside Lindsey and encouraged her to follow suit. Laura made sure to let Lindsey know that it was completely normal to make mistakes and that practice would only make her better. Step 5: Encourage Lindsey to practice reciting the prayer with the correct lines Once the corrections had been made, Laura asked Lindsey to practice the prayer several times on her own with the newly learned lines in place. Laura emphasized the importance of repetition in grasping the structure and flow of the prayer, and how it would eventually become second nature to Lindsey. Step 6: Offer support and reassurance Throughout the process, Laura made it a point to be supportive and reassuring. She reminded Lindsey that even seasoned Catholics can make errors when reciting prayers, and that the key to improvement is perseverance and patience. By going through this step-by-step process, Laura ensured that Lindsey would not only learn the correct version of the prayer, but also develop a deeper understanding of its significance and purpose in her religious journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is nonmetallic and tetravalentmaking four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. Three isotopes occur naturally, C and C being stable, while C is a radioactive isotope, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.  - The Eocene Epoch, lasting from , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope C. The end is set at a major extinction event called the \\"Grande Coupure\\" (the \\"Great Break\\" in continuity) or the EoceneOligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain.  - The Phanerozoic Eon (British English Phanærozoic) is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale, and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed. It covers million years to the present, and began with the Cambrian Period when diverse hard-shelled animals first appeared. Its name was derived from the Ancient Greek words (phanerós) and (z), meaning \\"visible life\\", since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon. The time before the Phanerozoic, called the \\"Precambrian\\" supereon, is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons.  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number. All isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons in each atom. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots isos ( \\"equal\\") and topos ( \\"place\\"), meaning \\"the same place\\"; thus, the meaning behind the name is that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table.  - The Miocene is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about (Ma). The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell. Its name comes from the Greek words (', less) and (', new) and means \\"less recent\\" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene. The Miocene follows the Oligocene Epoch and is followed by the Pliocene Epoch.  - An extinction event (also known as a mass extinction or biotic crisis) is a widespread and rapid decrease in the biodiversity on Earth. Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of multicellular organisms. It occurs when the rate of extinction increases with respect to the rate of speciation. Because the majority of diversity and biomass on Earth is microbial, and thus difficult to measure, recorded extinction events affect the easily observed, biologically complex component of the biosphere rather than the total diversity and abundance of life.  - Sir Charles Lyell, 1st Baronet, (14 November 1797  22 February 1875) was a British lawyer and the foremost geologist of his day. He is best known as the author of \\"Principles of Geology\\", which popularized James Hutton's concepts of uniformitarianismthe idea that the Earth was shaped by the same processes still in operation today. \\"Principles of Geology\\" also challenged theories popularized by Georges Cuvier, which were the most accepted and circulated ideas about geology in England at the time.  - A bolide (French via Latin from the Greek  \\"bolís\\", \\"missile\\") is an extremely bright meteor, especially one that explodes in the atmosphere. In astronomy, it refers to a fireball about as bright as the full moon, and it is generally considered a synonym of a fireball. In geology, a bolide is a very large impactor.  - The Paleocene or Palaeocene, the \\"old recent\\", is a geologic epoch that lasted from about . It is the first epoch of the Paleogene Period in the modern Cenozoic Era. As with many geologic periods, the strata that define the epoch's beginning and end are well identified, but the exact ages remain uncertain.  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - The Pliocene (also Pleiocene) Epoch is the epoch in the geologic timescale that extends from 5.333 million to 2.58 million years BP. It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch. Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage, which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago, and is now included in the Pleistocene.  - An era is a span of time marked by character, events, changes on earth, etc. When used in science, for example geology, an \\"era\\" denotes a clearly defined period of time of arbitrary but well-defined length, such as for example the Mesozoic Era frozen m 252 Ma66 Ma, delimited by a start event and an end event. When used in social history, eras may for example denote a period of some monarch's reign. In colloquial language, eras denote longer spans of time, before and after which the practices or fashions change to a significant degree. When era is extended to a calendar system, it is known as a calendar era. In Sanskrit or Indian culture eras are known as yugas.  - The transition between the end of the Eocene and the beginning of the Oligocene is marked by large-scale extinction and floral and faunal turnover (although minor in comparison to the largest mass extinctions). Most of the affected organisms were marine or aquatic in nature. They included the last of the ancient cetaceans, the Archaeoceti.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms.  - The Oligocene / losin / ( symbol OG ) is a geologic epoch of the Paleogene Period and extends from about 33.9 million to 23 million years before the present ( 33.9 ± 0.1 to 23.03 ± 0.05 Ma ) . As with other older geologic periods , the rock beds that define the epoch are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain . The name Oligocene comes from the Greek  ( oligos , few ) and  ( kainos , new ) , and refers to the sparsity of extant forms of molluscs . The Oligocene is preceded by the Eocene Epoch and is followed by the Miocene Epoch . The Oligocene is the third and final epoch of the Paleogene Period . The Oligocene is often considered an important time of transition , a link between the archaic world of the tropical Eocene and the more modern ecosystems of the Miocene . Major changes during the Oligocene included a global expansion of grasslands , and a regression of tropical broad leaf forests to the equatorial belt . The start of the Oligocene is marked by a notable extinction event called the Grande Coupure ; it featured the replacement of European fauna with Asian fauna , except for the endemic rodent and marsupial families . By contrast , the Oligocene -- Miocene boundary is not set at an easily identified worldwide event but rather at regional boundaries between the warmer late Oligocene and the relatively cooler Miocene .  - Tertiary is the former term for the geologic period from 66 million to 2.58 million years ago, a time span that lies between the superseded Secondary period and the Quaternary. The Tertiary is no longer recognized as a formal unit by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, but the word is still widely used. The traditional span of the Tertiary has been divided between the Paleogene and Neogene Periods and extends to the first stage of the Pleistocene Epoch, the Gelasian age.  The period began with the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs in the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event, at the start of the Cenozoic Era, and extended to the beginning of the Quaternary glaciation at the end of the Pliocene Epoch.  - The Cenozoic Era (also Cænozoic, Caenozoic or Cainozoic ; meaning \\"new life\\", from Greek \\"kainos\\" \\"new\\", and \\"zoe\\" \\"life\\") is the current and most recent of the three Phanerozoic geological eras, following the Mesozoic Era and covering the period from 66 million years ago to present day.  - The Neogene is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene.

Plot title: The Core Movie plot: Geophysicist Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) and scientists Serge Leveque (TchÃ©ky Karyo) and Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci) become aware of an instability of Earth's magnetic field after a series of incidents across the globe. They determine that the Earth's molten core, which generates this field, has stopped rotating, and within a year the field will collapse exposing the planet's surface directly to devastating solar radiation. Backed by the U.S. Government, Keyes, Leveque, and Zimsky create a plan to bore down to the core and set off several nuclear explosions to restart the rotation. They gain help of rogue scientist Ed \\"Braz\\" Brazzelton (Delroy Lindo) who has devised a vessel made of \\"Unobtainium\\" that can withstand the heat and pressure within the Earth's crust and convert it to energy, as well as a laser-driven boring system that will allow them to quickly pass through the crust. Construction starts immediately on the Virgil, a multi-compartment vessel to be helmed by Space Shuttle pilots Commander Robert Iverson (Bruce Greenwood) and Major Rebecca \\"Beck\\" Childs (Hilary Swank) who will join Keyes and the others. To prevent a worldwide panic, Keyes enlists computer hacker Theodore Donald \\"Rat\\" Finch (DJ Qualls) to scour the Internet and eliminate all traces of the pending disaster or their plan. Virgil is launched through the Marianas Trench from an offshore platform. The team accidentally drills through a gigantic empty geode structure, damaging the lasers when it lands at its base and cracking the geode's structure and causing magma to flow in. The crew repair and restart the laser array in time, but Iverson is killed by a falling crystal shard that hits him in the helmet, while returning to the ship.

The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town. A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson.

Here is a question: How much did a knight 's armor weigh ? Would the answer to this question be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","output":"The answer to the question \\"How much did a knight's armor weigh?\\" would be a numeric value.  Typically, the weight of a knight's armor varied based upon the period, geographical location and the specific type of armor being used. However, on average, a full suit of medieval knight's armor would average around 20-25 kg (45-55 lbs). Knight's armor was not evenly distributed throughout the body. Most of the weight was taken by the lower body, because the chest plate, back plate, and tassets (thigh armor) were some of the heaviest parts in the armor.  The weight was also dependent on the material of the armor. Earlier armors, such as chainmail, were lighter than later full-plate armors. However, even though later full-plate armors were heavier, they offered better protection and distributed the weight more evenly over the body, enabling knights to retain their mobility. The armor had to be maneuverable enough to allow the knight to move freely on the battlefield, ride a horse, and engage the enemy effectively. For example, in the high medieval period (11-13th centuries), a suit of mail, including hauberk (mail shirt), coif (mail hood), and chausses (mail leggings), would weigh around 10-15 kg (22-33 lbs). In the late medieval period (14-15th centuries), when full plate armor became common, the total weight could increase up to 25-30 kg (55-66 lbs). During the Renaissance period (16-17th centuries), the full plate armor continued to be used, but there was a greater focus on the aesthetic look of the armor, adding more decorative features and sometimes sacrificing some aspects of practicality. The weight in this era was roughly the same as late medieval full-plate armor, although some particularly ornate armors designed for parades and ceremonies might have been heavier. To sum up, the exact weight of a knight's armor would depend on many variables, but as a general rule, a complete set of knight's armor would weigh around 20-25 kg (45-55 lbs)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Gymnophobia is the fear of nudity or being naked in the presence of others. It is derived from the Greek word \\"gymnos,\\" which means naked, and \\"phobia,\\" which means fear or aversion. Individuals experiencing gymnophobia are often exceptionally worried, uncomfortable, or anxious about the thought of being seen without clothes, or even seeing others in a naked state. Gymnophobia can arise from various causes, such as cultural influences, personal experiences, or upbringing. It may also be related to issues concerning body image, self-esteem, vulnerability, or privacy. In some cases, gymnophobia might be linked to traumatic incidents in the past, such as sexual abuse or an embarrassing situation involving nudity.  Symptoms of gymnophobia can vary widely among individuals but commonly include: 1. Intense anxiety or panic when faced with the prospect of being naked, or seeing others naked, even in situations where it is considered normal or acceptable (e.g., locker rooms, medical examinations, or intimate relationships). 2. Avoidance of situations where nudity might be involved or expected (e.g., public swimming pools, beaches, gym facilities, or romantic relationships). 3. Feelings of shame, guilt, or embarrassment when thinking about the possibility of being seen naked. 4. Physical symptoms such as sweating, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, shaking, or nausea when exposed to nudity or the idea of nudity. 5. Intrusive thoughts or excessive rumination about nudity, which can lead to sleep disturbances and difficulties concentrating. Treatment options for gymnophobia can include various therapeutic approaches that aim to address the root causes of the fear and help the individual develop healthier ways of thinking and coping with their phobia. Some common treatments include: 1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): This form of therapy focuses on identifying and challenging unhealthy thought patterns related to nudity and teaching individuals new strategies to cope with their fears. 2. Exposure therapy: This involves confronting the fear of nudity by gradually exposing individuals to various levels of nudity in a controlled, safe, and supportive environment. 3. Psychotherapy: Various forms of talk therapy can help individuals explore the underlying causes of their phobia, such as cultural, traumatic or psychological influences that lead to the development of the fear. 4. Medications: In some instances, medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms of anxiety and stress related to gymnophobia. These may include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or beta-blockers. 5. Relaxation techniques: Practices such as mindfulness, meditation, or deep-breathing exercises can help individuals manage anxiety and stress more effectively. The efficacy of each treatment may vary depending on the individual's severity of gymnophobia, their specific triggers, and their willingness to engage in therapy. Success and recovery will depend on the extent to which an individual can identify and address the root causes of their fear and develop effective coping strategies to manage the anxiety related to nudity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The two sentences convey different meanings and assign blame to different individuals. Let's analyze them and provide an accurate paraphrase: 1. Sentence 1: \\"Hollande blamed the 2017 social unrest in French Guiana on President Fillon's policies, which he said had failed.\\" In this sentence, Hollande is blaming President Fillon and his policies for the social unrest in French Guiana that took place in 2017. Hollande asserts that Fillon's policies have failed. 2. Sentence 2: \\"Fillon blamed the social unrest in 2017 in French-Guiana on the policies of President Hollande, which, he said, had failed.\\" In this sentence, the roles are reversed. Fillon is blaming Hollande, mentioning that Hollande's policies have failed, leading to the social unrest in French Guiana in 2017. Both sentences suggest that one individual blames the other for the unrest, but the blame is assigned to different individuals in each sentence. To create an accurate paraphrase for each sentence, we should maintain the same meaning and blame assignment: Accurate paraphrase for Sentence 1: \\"Hollande held President Fillon and his unsuccessful policies responsible for the social turmoil in French Guiana in 2017.\\" Accurate paraphrase for Sentence 2: \\"Fillon attributed the 2017 French Guiana social unrest to President Hollande's failed policies.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The province has a saltwater coastline bordering Hudson Bay and more than 110,000 lakes, covering approximately 15.6 percent or 101,593 square kilometres (39,225 sq mi) of its surface area. Manitoba's major lakes are Lake Manitoba, Lake Winnipegosis, and Lake Winnipeg, the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. Some traditional Native lands and boreal forest on Lake Winnipeg's east side are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site.Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. This basin's rivers reach far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the Red, Assiniboine, Nelson, Winnipeg, Hayes, Whiteshell and Churchill rivers. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This region, particularly the Red River Valley, is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.Baldy Mountain is the province's highest point at 832 metres (2,730 ft) above sea level, and the Hudson Bay coast is the lowest at sea level. Riding Mountain, the Pembina Hills, Sandilands Provincial Forest, and the Canadian Shield are also upland regions. Much of the province's sparsely inhabited north and east lie on the irregular granite Canadian Shield, including Whiteshell, Atikaki, and Nopiming Provincial Parks.Extensive agriculture is found only in the province's southern areas, although there is grain farming in the Carrot Valley Region (near The Pas). The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%). Around 12 percent of Canada's farmland is in Manitoba.

Below are the steps I would use for a basic sentiment analysis on the provided sentence: The sentence for analysis is: \\"of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with.\\" Step 1: Break down the sentence;  The key elements here include \\"wasn't,\\" which is a contraction of \\"was not\\", \\"all\\", \\"that\\", and \\"great\\". The phrase \\"wasn't all that great\\" stands out as containing sentiment meaning. Step 2: Analyze each component; \\"Wasn't\\" indicates a negative as it's negating what follows. \\"All\\" and \\"that\\" together in this context are used to intensify the sentiment of the adjective that follows, which is \\"great.\\" So, overall, \\"wasn't all that great\\" is a phrase used to express strong negativity or dissatisfaction. Step 3: Combine the sentiment meanings; Since there are no conflicting sentiments in the sentence, we can conclude that the sentence carries a negative sentiment. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with\\" is negative.

He says that \\"thirst is used to make an animal realize that it needs to replenish its bodily water by the body\\" and \\"humans are animals too\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"what uses thirst to realize it needs to replenish bodily water?\\" is humans and animals in general.  Thirst is a basic physiological response experienced by various living organisms, particularly humans and animals, as a way to regulate their water intake. Professor's hint that \\"thirst is used to make an animal realize that it needs to replenish its bodily water by the body\\" and \\"humans are animals too\\" indicates that the response of thirst is not exclusive to any specific species, but rather a shared attribute amongst animals, including humans. Water is essential for all living organisms, as it plays vital roles in numerous physiological processes such as maintaining body temperature, transporting nutrients, waste elimination, and ensuring the proper functioning of cells. Consequently, maintaining an adequate balance of water within the body is crucial for survival. When the body experiences a decrease in water levels, the hypothalamus, a region in the brain, sends signals that trigger the sensation of thirst. This response prompts individuals to consume water to replenish their bodies, restoring the balance and ensuring proper physiological functioning. In conclusion, both humans and animals use the sensation of thirst to realize that it is necessary to replenish their bodily water. This fundamental biological response is vital for maintaining water homeostasis and allows organisms to maintain a proper balance of water to support their overall well-being and various physiological processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars.

Six years earlier, while on the mob's payroll, Denton attacked district attorney Phil Coakley, earning him the enmity of the police and the nickname \\"slash cop\\". After finding his ex-wife has left the city with their children, he moves in with his elderly parents. Denton researches his ex-wife on the internet, eventually digging up a phone number. After briefly talking to one of his daughters, his ex-wife takes the phone and threatens to press charges if he ever contacts them again. Denton passes a bar on his way back home.

After Denton is questioned by the police, Coakley admits the evidence backs up his story and reluctantly asks if Denton wants to press charges. Denton declines, saying he wants to leave his history in the past, to the disgust of Coakley and Lieutenant Pleasant, who calls him a disgrace. Pleasant, revealed to also be corrupt, demands Denton kill mob boss Manny Vassey, who has found religion on his deathbed.

Premise: \\"and always thought you know that being raised in the midwest you really didn't see any crimes really any more heinous than uh shoplifting\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"I thought that being raised in the midwest you'd see more heinous crimes since there isn't anything else to do to keep people out of trouble.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise that \\"being raised in the Midwest you really didn't see any crimes really any more heinous than shoplifting,\\" it would appear that the hypothesis \\"I thought that being raised in the Midwest you'd see more heinous crimes since there isn't anything else to do to keep people out of trouble\\" is not true. The premise and the hypothesis contradict each other, and here is a detailed explanation of this contradiction. 1. Crime rates in different regions: The original premise suggests that the Midwest's crime rates, or at least the severity of those crimes, are relatively low. According to this statement, the person has not witnessed any crimes more severe than shoplifting in their upbringing within the Midwest. This implies that the author believes that the Midwest has a lower crime rate or lower severity of criminal actions than other regions, potentially due to its geography, culture, or community aspects. The hypothesis, however, suggests the complete opposite: that being raised in the Midwest might lead to higher rates of heinous crimes, as there are not many other options for entertainment or activities to keep people occupied. This argument might stem from a belief that boredom or lack of engagement in recreational activities could lead to an increase in criminal activity. 2. The nature of heinous crimes: Heinous crimes refer to exceptionally severe criminal offenses, such as murder, rape, or other acts of significant harm or violence. The premise's assertion that the person has not observed or experienced crimes of this nature in the Midwest contradicts the hypothesis that such crimes should be more prevalent in the same region. 3. Historical and statistical data: To determine if either the premise or the hypothesis is true, it would be helpful to look at statistics regarding crime rates and the types of criminal activities prevalent in different regions. FBI crime data suggests that, overall, the Midwestern states have relatively low crime rates compared to other U.S. regions. Specific cities within the Midwest might show higher crime rates than others, but on a broader scale, the general picture does not seem to support the hypothesis mentioned. 4. Factors affecting criminal activities: In order to claim that boredom or lack of entertainment/activity options would lead to an increase in heinous crimes, one must assume a direct correlation between these factors and criminal behavior. While it is true that socioeconomic factors, educational opportunities, and other aspects might influence criminal activity, it is important to remember that crime rates and types of crimes vary widely across different areas and communities. In conclusion, the initial premise that \\"being raised in the Midwest, you really didn't see any crimes really any more heinous than shoplifting\\" directly conflicts with the hypothesis suggesting that growing up in the Midwest exposes individuals to a higher occurrence of heinous crimes. Looking at historical crime data and considering various factors affecting criminal activities, logic supports the premise and contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore, based on the given information and data available, the hypothesis is deemed not true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What company was founded by Julius Kahn in Detroit, Michigan?","output":"The Trussed Concrete Steel Company was founded by Julius Kahn in Detroit, Michigan, in 1903. Julius Kahn was a prominent structural engineer, inventor, and entrepreneur known for his innovations in reinforced concrete construction. Born in 1874 in Germany, Kahn immigrated to the United States with his family when he was a child. He later studied at the University of Michigan and obtained his civil engineering degree in 1897. After graduating, Julius worked alongside his brother Albert Kahn, who was a well-known architect, developing various types of buildings. It was during this time that Julius recognized the limitations of traditional wood and masonry construction methods, particularly for larger buildings that required greater strength and fire resistance. This led him to experiment with new materials and construction methods, focusing specifically on reinforced concrete. In 1902, Julius Kahn applied for a patent on what he called the \\"Kahn Bar,\\" a uniquely designed T- or Y-shaped reinforcing steel bar that could be embedded within concrete beams and slabs to create a stronger construction material. The advantage of the Kahn Bar was that it provided increased tensile strength in the concrete, allowing for longer and larger building spans, as well as improved fire resistance. With the invention of the Kahn Bar, Julius Kahn saw the potential for this new technology and founded the Trussed Concrete Steel Company in 1903 in Detroit, Michigan. Julius took the role of chief engineer at the company, while Albert assisted as the architect to design buildings that utilized the company's innovations. The company later became known as the Kahn System of Reinforced Concrete. The Trussed Concrete Steel Company quickly grew in size and reputation, as reinforced concrete became increasingly popular in the construction of commercial and industrial buildings, bridges, and other large-scale projects. The company was involved in the construction of numerous iconic buildings and structures during its existence, including the Packard Automotive Plant in Detroit, Michigan, the Ford River Rouge Complex in Dearborn, Michigan, and several structures outside the US, such as the Kremlin Palace of Congresses in Moscow, Russia. In 1932, the company changed its name to the Kahn Structural Steel Company, reflecting the shift of emphasis from concrete reinforcement to steel construction. Despite the challenges faced during the Great Depression, the company continued to grow and remained active for several decades. The company was eventually acquired by another organization but Julius Kahn's innovative contributions to the field of construction continued to have a lasting impact on the industry. He is now considered one of the pioneers in the field of reinforced concrete construction, forever changing the landscape of modern architecture and engineering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond.

I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy.

Following the British capture of Ticonderoga, it and the surrounding defenses were garrisoned by 700 British and Hessian troops under the command of Brigadier General Henry Watson Powell.  Most of these forces were on Mount Independence, with only 100 each at Fort Ticonderoga and a blockhouse they were constructing on top of Mount Defiance.  George Washington sent General Benjamin Lincoln into Vermont to \\"divide and distract the enemy\\".  Aware that the British were housing American prisoners in the area, Lincoln decided to test the British defenses.  On September 13, he sent 500 men to Skenesboro, which they found the British had abandoned, and 500 each against the defenses on either side of the lake at Ticonderoga.  Colonel John Brown led the troops on the west side, with instructions to release prisoners if possible, and attack the fort if it seemed feasible. Early on September 18, Brown's troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing, while a detachment of his troops sneaked up Mount Defiance, and captured most of the sleeping construction crew.  Brown and his men then moved down the portage trail toward the fort, surprising more troops and releasing prisoners along the way.  The fort's occupants were unaware of the action until Brown's men and British troops occupying the old French lines skirmished.  At this point Brown's men dragged two captured six-pound guns up to the lines, and began firing on the fort.  The men who had captured Mount Defiance began firing a twelve-pounder from that site.  The column that was to attack Mount Independence was delayed, and its numerous defenders were alerted to the action at the fort below before the attack on their position began.  Their musket fire, as well as grapeshot fired from ships anchored nearby, intimidated the Americans sufficiently that they never launched an assault on the defensive positions on Mount Independence. A stalemate persisted, with regular exchanges of cannon fire, until September 21, when 100...

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the state that saw its only historical decline in population over a twenty-year period ending in 1950?  Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.On May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding. A:","output":"The name of the state that saw its only historical decline in population over a twenty-year period ending in 1950 is Oklahoma. The decline was due to impoverished families migrating out of the state after the Dust Bowl."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Complete the following sentence. The man chose to take the plane instead of the bus because it would be slower if he took the","output":"bus, as it would have to navigate through potentially congested roads, deal with multiple stops, and wait in traffic at certain times of the day, all of which could significantly lengthen the duration of the journey and consequently reduce the time he would have available to spend at his destination. Additionally, the man might have been motivated by a number of factors that made the plane the more logical and advantageous mode of transportation for his trip, such as: 1. Greater time efficiency: Generally speaking, airplanes travel at much faster speeds than buses, covering long distances in considerably shorter time frames. This advantage was likely a key factor in the man's decision, as it would enable him to reach his destination more quickly and make better use of his limited time. 2. Fewer stops: Unlike buses, airplanes typically operate on a non-stop or one-stop basis, meaning that passengers aboard the plane would not have to endure frequent pauses in the journey due to scheduled stops or unscheduled delays. This streamlined approach to travel would have been particularly appealing to the man, who likely valued a seamless and uninterrupted journey. 3. Comfort and amenities: Airplanes tend to offer a higher standard of comfort and a wider array of amenities than buses, with features such as reclining seats, in-flight entertainment systems, and food service options. These factors would have likely contributed to the man's choice to fly, as he may have felt that the enhanced comfort and facilities would make for a more enjoyable and restful trip. 4. Punctuality: Air travel tends to be more punctual than bus travel because it is less susceptible to disruptions that typically affect ground transportation, such as traffic jams, road closures, and inclement weather. Therefore, the man may have prioritized the increased likelihood of an on-time arrival that traveling by plane offers, as he might have business meetings, appointments, or other commitments at his destination that he cannot afford to miss or be late for. 5. Frequent flyer programs and loyalty benefits: The man might be a member of a frequent flyer program or enjoy special loyalty benefits through an airline, which could have made the cost of flying relatively inexpensive or even \\"free\\" in terms of reward points used. In this case, the potential cost savings and added value afforded by flying might have outweighed the alternative of traveling by bus. 6. International travel: In cases where the man's destination would be in another country, flying would be a more practical and efficient option when compared to taking a bus, as it would not only minimize the amount of time spent in transit, but also allow the man to bypass the potential complications and added time constraints that could arise from traveling by bus across international borders. In conclusion, the man chose to take the plane instead of the bus because it would be slower if he took the bus, due to factors such as lengthy transit times, multiple stops, and potential schedule disruptions that are far less likely to impact air travel. Furthermore, the man's decision to fly might have been influenced by additional considerations, including the comfort and amenities offered by airplanes, the superior punctuality of air travel, potential frequent flyer program benefits, and, in certain cases, the need to travel internationally."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The village symbol is the Briarcliff Rose, a more brightly colored offshoot of the American Beauty rose. Since 2006, the Briarcliff Rose has been used on village street signs. The Briarcliff Manor Garden Club, which also uses the Briarcliff rose as their symbol, was established in 1956. One of its primary functions is in planting, maintaining, and improving public gardens and grounds.Briarcliff Manor has groups in several Scouting organizations, including Cub Scout Pack 6 and Boy Scout Troop 18. Pack 6 became the first Cub Scout pack in the village at its establishment in 1968; by 2002 it had over 70 cubs in 12 dens. The village's first Boy Scout troop was Troop 1 Briarcliff, founded before 1919. Sources cite Bill Buffman as the first Scoutmaster and John Hersey as the troop's first Eagle Scout. The first Girl Scout troop in the village was founded in 1917 by Louise Miller and Mrs. Alfred Jones, and the first Brownie troop was founded in 1929.The Briarcliff Manor Community Bonfire is a winter holiday event at Law Park, hosted by the village and the Briarcliff Friends of the Arts, involving live music (primarily seasonal and holiday songs), refreshments, and craft projects for children. Another annual community event is the Memorial Day parade, a tradition in Briarcliff Manor for more than fifty years. Before the parade begins, the Municipal Building's bell is rung to commemorate firefighters who have died in the previous year; the parade ends at the village's war memorial in Law Park, where wreaths are laid on the monument. The holiday has been celebrated in the village since the early 1900s, though initially involving large family picnics, with parades reserved for the Fourth of July. The answer is:","output":"The village in question is Briarcliff Manor, located in Westchester County, New York. The first Boy Scout troop in this village was Troop 1 Briarcliff, founded before 1919. The village, known for its symbol, the Briarcliff Rose, has a rich history of community-based organizations, including the Briarcliff Manor Garden Club and Scouting organizations like Cub Scout Pack 6, Boy Scout Troop 18, and Girl Scout and Brownie troops.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy. I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person. Hypothesis: The tax cut plan is designed to benefit lower-income persons the most.","output":"Based on the given paragraph, the hypothesis that the tax cut plan is designed to benefit lower-income persons the most appears to be false. This determination arises from several elements within the paragraph, which suggest that the tax cut plan disproportionately benefits the wealthiest individuals rather than those with lower incomes. Firstly, the author asserts that the tax cut plan is \\"so large\\" that it would generate significant deficits. This implies that the focus of the plan may not necessarily be geared towards benefitting the lower-income groups, as such extensive cuts may disproportionately impact various socioeconomic demographics. If the tax cut plan were aimed at exclusively or primarily helping lower-income persons, it would be expected that the cuts would be more targeted and less likely to cause substantial deficits that could indirectly hurt this population. Secondly, the author states that nearly half of the plan's benefits would be allocated to \\"the wealthiest of the wealthy.\\" This statement directly refutes the hypothesis that the tax cut plan is primarily designed to benefit lower-income individuals. If a tax plan was indeed intended to support such persons, it would not apportion such an overwhelming proportion of its benefits to the opposite end of the socioeconomic spectrum. Lastly, the author illustrates that explaining the tax cut plan in a way that makes sense to the average person would be challenging. This challenges the hypothesis that the plan was designed with lower-income individuals in mind, as it suggests that the plan's structure may not be readily understandable or relatable to a broad audience. A tax plan specifically tailored for lower-income persons would, in all likelihood, be easier to describe clearly and concisely to the average individual, without having to go through convoluted explanations that try to reconcile the plan's purported intentions with its actual effects on different income groups. In conclusion, based on the evidence in the paragraph, it is unlikely that the hypothesis is true. The tax cut plan described does not seem designed to benefit lower-income persons the most, as it creates significant deficits, allocates a large portion of benefits to the wealthiest citizens, and is difficult to explain in a comprehensible way to the average person."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up - The rocks slowly break down. A:","output":"The first step of the process seems to involve exposing the rocks to changing temperatures. This step initiates the process of weathering due to temperature fluctuations, which will eventually lead to the formation of cracks in the rocks. Thus, the missing first step could be:  A: The rocks are exposed to variation in temperatures. Justification: The steps provided suggest a process known as mechanical weathering, specifically freeze-thaw and thermal expansion weathering. In freeze-thaw weathering, rocks are exposed to water, which seeps into cracks, freezes (expands), and then thaws, causing the rock to crack further. In thermal expansion weathering, rocks are exposed to direct sunlight or heat, causing them to expand and crack.

(Associated Press)      Pope Francis, left, flanked by director of the Holy See press Office Federico Lombardi, speaks to journalists aboard the flight to the Greek island of Lesbos where he will meet refugees and migrants. (Filippo Monteforte/Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press)      MYTILENE, Greece (AP) — The Latest on Pope Francis' visit to the Greek island of Lesbos (all times local):      3:20 p.m.      The Vatican has confirmed that 12 Syrian refugees, all of them Muslim, are traveling with the pope back to Italy from Greece.      The three families, including six children, met with Francis on the tarmac on the island of Lesbos and boarded the plane.      In a statement, the Vatican said Francis wanted to \\"make a gesture of welcome\\" to the refugees, who were in camps on the Greek island before the agreement between the EU and Turkey to return migrants came into effect on March 20.      The Vatican will take responsibility for supporting the families. But the Catholic Sant'Egidio community will take care of getting them settled initially.      ___      3:00 p.m.      Some 200 protesters have been stopped about 100 meters (109 yards) from where the heads of the Catholic and Orthodox churches were holding a prayer ceremony at the Mytilene port on the Greek island of Lesbos.      The protesters were chanting \\"No Borders, No Nation. Stop Deportation\\" as Pope Francis, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I and Archbishop of Athens Ieronymos II held a prayer ceremony and tossed floral wreaths into the sea in memory of the refugees and migrants who died trying to reach Europe.      Moments earlier, police detained a woman attempting to display a banner inside the enclosure of the crowd gathered to watch the ceremony. As she was being led away, the woman said she was a volunteer working in Lesbos on the refugee issue.      ___      2:50 p.m.      A person on the Greek island of Lesbos says Pope Francis is bringing a dozen refugees with him on his flight back to Italy.      The person, who is involved in the pope's trip to Lesbos, refused to be identified further because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media.      He confirmed a report on Greek television which first revealed the plan Saturday morning.      It wasn't immediately clear which legal process was at play, but the Catholic Sant'Egidio Community has begun a program to bring deserving refugees to Italy with humanitarian visas issued by the Italian government.      —By Elena Becatoros in Athens and Nicole Winfield in Rome      ___      2:40 p.m.      The pope and the leaders of the world's Orthodox Christians and the Church of Greece have conducted a prayer ceremony for refugees at the Lesbos port of Mytilene.      Francis, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I and Archbishop Ieronymos II prayed for the many men, women and children who lost their lives in the Aegean Sea as they attempted the short but dangerous journey from Turkey in overloaded and unseaworthy boats.      The three led a minute of silence in front of a crowd of hundreds of people at the port, before tossing a floral wreath each into the sea in memory of those who perished.      Hundreds of thousands of migrants have passed through Mytilene on their perilous journeys from Turkey toward Europe.      ___      2:30 p.m.      Pope Francis says he understands European concerns about the influx of refugees but says the world must remember that refugees are human beings with faces, names and stories and deserve to have their basic human rights respected.      In a ceremony at the port in Lesbos on Saturday, Francis thanked the residents of Greece for welcoming in thousands of refugees and for showing solidarity and humanity toward the world's most desperate.      He said \\"God will repay this generosity and that of other surrounding nations who from the beginning have welcomed with great openness the large number of people forced to migrate.\\"      He said the world needs bridges, not barriers or walls. He said \\"Barriers create divisions instead of promoting the true progress of peoples, and divisions sooner or later lead to confrontations.\\"      ___      1:45 p.m.      The pope and the leaders of the world's Orthodox Christians and the Church of Greece have signed a joint declaration calling on the international community to make the protection of human lives a priority and to extend temporary asylum to those in need.      Francis, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I and Archbishop Ieronymos II signed the joint declaration Saturday during an emotional and highly political visit to the Moria migrant detention center on the Greek island of Lesbos.      The declaration also called on political leaders \\"to employ every means to ensure that individuals and communities, including Christians, remain in their homelands and enjoy the fundamental right to live in peace and security.\\"      It said the three religious leaders' meeting was \\"meant to help bring courage and hope to those seeking refuge and to all those who welcome and assist them.\\"      Lesbos has seen hundreds of thousands of people reach its shores trying to get to Europe.      ___      1:10 p.m.      The spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians has told migrants in a detention center on the Greek island of Lesbos that the world will be judged by how it has treated them.      Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I also condemned the \\"hard-heartedness\\" that saw borders closed to the migrants.      Bartholomew, Pope Francis and the head of the Church of Greece are in Lesbos on a historic visit to highlight the plight of refugees. It comes after a controversial European Union-Turkey agreement under which those arriving on Greek islands after March 20 must be detained and returned to Turkey unless they successfully apply for asylum.      \\"We have traveled here to tell you that we care. We have traveled here because the world has not forgotten you,\\" Bartholomew said, adding that \\"we have wept as we watched the Mediterranean Sea becoming a burial ground for your loved ones.\\"      He praised the \\"sympathy and sensitivity\\" of Greek island residents who welcomed the refugees, but stressed migration isn't an issue for \\"the Middle East and Northern Africa, for Europe and Greece. It is an issue for the world.\\"      \\"The world will be judged by the way it has treated you. And we will all be accountable for the way we respond to the crisis and conflict in the regions that you come from,\\" he said.      ___      1:00 p.m.      Pope Francis is imploring European leaders to respond to the continent's migrant crisis \\"in a way that is worthy of our common humanity\\" and to come to the aid of refugees in a spirit of fraternity and solidarity.      Francis was speaking to migrants at the Moria refugee center on the Greek island of Lesbos on Saturday. The center has been turned into a detention center for refugees slated for deportation under the European Union's controversial deal to send them back to Turkey.      In his remarks, Francis said he wanted the refugees to know they're not alone and to not lose hope. He said he wanted to visit them to hear their stories and to bring the world's attention to their plight.      He said: \\"We hope that the world will heed these scenes of tragic and indeed desperate need, and respond in a way worthy of our common humanity.\\"      ___      12:55 p.m.      The head of the Church of Greece says the religious leaders of Catholicism and Orthodoxy are uniting their voices to condemn the uprooting of people that turns them into refugees, and the \\"depreciation\\" of them as human beings.      The Archbishop of Athens Ieronymos II spoke Saturday during a visit to a migrant detention center on the Greek island of Lesbos along with Pope Francis and the spiritual head of the world's Orthodox Christians, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.      \\"Unfortunately it is not the first time we denounce the politics that have brought these people to this impasse,\\" Ieronymos said. \\"We will act however, until the aberration and depreciation of the human person has stopped.\\"      Ieronymos was clear in his criticism of the European response to the refugee crisis, which has resulted in a deal with Turkey whereby new arrivals to Greek islands are sent back to Turkey.      \\"Only those who see the eyes of those small children that we met at the refugee camps will be able to immediately recognize, in its entirety, the 'bankruptcy' of humanity and solidarity that Europe has shown these last few years to these, and not only these, people,\\" he said.      He closed his speech by calling on the United Nations to address \\"this tragic situation that we are living.\\"      ___      12:00 p.m.      Some migrants were weeping as they met with Pope Francis during an emotional visit to the Moria detention center on the Greek island of Lesbos.      One man wept uncontrollably and wailed as he knelt down before Francis on Saturday and said: \\"Thank you, God. Thank you! Please Father, bless me!\\"      Children offered Francis drawings and the pope praised one little girl for her artwork, saying \\"Bravo. Bravo.\\" Then as he handed it off to his staff he stressed: \\"Don't fold it. I want it on my desk.\\"      As he walked by them, shaking hands with the men and bowing to the women, the refugees shouted out their homelands: \\"Afghanistan.\\" ''Syria.\\"      One little boy ducked his head through a fence to kiss Francis' ring.      ___      11:45 a.m.      A group of unaccompanied minors has greeted Pope Francis and the leaders of the world's Orthodox Christians and the Church of Greece as they arrived at the Moria migrant detention center on the Greek island of Lesbos.      The teenage boys who have made the perilous journeys from their homelands to Greece alone were lined up at the entrance, shaking the religious leaders' hands. Some of them were holding a Syrian flag.      The three leaders then moved on to greet women and young children who stood behind a low metal barrier. The pope, patriarch and archbishop shook their hands and patted some of the children on the cheek, while some of the gathered refugees snapped pictures of the pontiff on mobile phones.      The religious leaders' visit to the island, which has seen the majority of the arrivals of migrants heading into Europe, is a highly symbolic one. It comes shortly after the European Union began deporting new arrivals back to Turkey under a controversial deal meant to stem the refugee flow.      ___      11:25 a.m.      Dozens of refugees who won't be among the lucky ones selected to meet Pope Francis on the Greek island Lesbos have gathered holding makeshift banners, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pontiff.      Francis and the leaders of the world's Orthodox Christians and the Church of Greece were heading Saturday to a refugee center on the island which has been converted into a detention center as part of a controversial European Union-Turkey deal. There they will meet with refugees and lunch with some of them.      Those who were not part of the selected group gathered peacefully in the camp, holding aloft signs with slogans such as \\"Pope you are our hope,\\" ''please save Yazidi people,\\" ''we are also human,\\" and \\"Welcome Pope Francis\\".      ___      11:20 a.m.      Greek state television ERT reports Pope Francis has apparently offered to take 10 refugees back to Italy with him when he departs the Greek island of Lesbos after a historic visit.      ERT says it appears eight Syrians and two Afghans will be offered passage Saturday. The inclusion of the latter would be a highly symbolic move at a time when Europe has stopped automatically considering Afghans to be refugees and doesn't include them among the nationalities whose asylum applications are approved.      The state television channel didn't cite a source for the information. Asked about the report, the Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi told The Associated Press: \\"I have nothing to say at this time.\\"      Asked if he would have an update later, Lombardi said: \\"Each moment has its significance.\\"      ___      10:50 a.m.      Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras says Pope Francis' visit to the Greek island of Lesbos is a historic event and an important opportunity to highlight the need to find a legal route into Europe for those fleeing conflict.      Tsipras says he is proud of the Greek people for welcoming refugees and other migrants at a time when they are suffering under austerity measures imposed on Greece by the country's international lenders.      \\"I am proud of this, particularly at a time when some of our partners — even in the name of Christian Europe — were erecting walls and fences to prevent defenseless people from seeking a better life. That is why I consider that your visit is historic and important,\\" Tsipras told Francis shortly after his arrival at the airport Saturday.      He said the pope's visit \\"is a very important opportunity to show the need to stop the war, the taking advantage of people and to give the possibility of a legal route for these people who leave their homes and search for a better future in Europe.\\"      ___      10:30 a.m.      Pope Francis has been greeted on the Greek island of Lesbos by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and the leaders of the world's Orthodox Christians and the Church of Greece.      Tsipras greeted Francis as he descended the stairs from the plane Saturday. He was followed by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I and the Archbishop of Athens and all Greece Ieronymos, who both greeted the pope with a kiss on each cheek before the Greek and Italian national anthems were played. The head of Lesbos' tiny Catholic community was also present.      The religious leaders' visit to the island, which has seen the majority of the arrivals of migrants heading into Europe, is a highly symbolic one. It comes shortly after the European Union began deporting new arrivals back to Turkey under a controversial deal meant to stem the refugee flow.      ___      10:10 a.m.      Pope Francis has arrived in Greece for a provocative visit to meet with refugees at a detention center as the European Union implements a controversial plan to deport them back to Turkey.      Francis' Alitalia charter touched down at the airport in Mytilene shortly after 10 a.m., some 20 minutes ahead of time.      Francis and the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians will spend nearly an hour Saturday greeting some 250 refugees stuck on the Greek island of Lesbos. They will lunch with eight of them to hear their stories of fleeing war, conflict and poverty and their hopes for a better life in Europe. And then they will pray together, tossing a floral wreath into the sea in memory of those who didn't make it.      The visit is meant to highlight the plight of refugees, thank the Greek people who have welcomed them in, and to show a united Christian response to the humanitarian crisis unfolding.      ___      10:00 a.m.      Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is meeting with the leaders of the Church of Greece and the world's Orthodox Christians at the airport on the island of Lesbos shortly before the arrival of Pope Francis for a visit that will highlight the plight of refugees.      Tsipras says Greece is currently hosting more than 50,000 refugees and migrants and is trying to provide them with good living conditions despite the difficulties. Most of those who have entered Greece from Turkey have done so through Lesbos, which has seen hundreds of thousands of people arrive on its shores in the past year.      Francis and the two Orthodox leaders are to visit refugees and migrants being held in a detention center pending deportation and to throw floral wreaths into the sea in memory of those who died making the journey.      Under a controversial European Union-Turkey deal meant to reduce the flow of refugees into Europe, those arriving on Greek islands after March 20 are returned to Turkey unless they successfully apply for asylum in Greece.      ___      09:50 a.m.      Municipal crews are scrubbing walls in the capital and main port of the island of Lesbos after graffiti was sprayed overnight in places where Pope Francis will speak.      The crews removed the words \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" sprayed in black at several points on the seafront in Mytilene.      Francis will visit refugees in Lesbos Saturday to highlight their plight. He will be joined by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, and Archbishop of Athens and All Greece Ieronymos II, head of the Church of Greece.      The joint trip comes shortly after the start of a controversial European Union-Turkey deal under which any migrant arriving on Greek islands after March 20 will be detained and returned to Turkey unless they successfully apply for asylum in Greece.      ___      09:35 a.m.      The European border patrol agency Frontex has intercepted a dinghy carrying 41 Syrians and Iraqis off the coast of the Greek island of Lesbos, three hours before Pope Francis was to land on the island for a visit highlighting the plight of refugees.      The refugees were detained and brought to shore Saturday in the port of Mytilene. Later in the day, the pope, along with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, and Archbishop of Athens and All Greece Ieronymos II, head of the Church of Greece, will toss floral wreaths into the sea nearby in memory of migrants who have died making the same journey.      Under a controversial European Union-Turkey deal that came into effect March 20, all those arriving on Greek islands from that date on are detained and deported back to Turkey unless they successfully apply for asylum in Greece. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Premise: \\"well March is the the month for high winds\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The winds are calm in MArch.\\" true?","output":"Based on the premise given, \\"March is the month for high winds,\\" the hypothesis \\"The winds are calm in March\\" would not be considered true. The premise directly contradicts the hypothesis, suggesting that March is known for strong, rather than calm, winds. To understand the reasoning behind this discrepancy, it's helpful to have some background information on why March is generally associated with high winds. There are several meteorological factors contributing to this weather phenomenon. Here are some of the prominent factors that lead to higher winds in certain regions during March: 1. Jet stream: The jet stream is a strong, high-altitude air current that separates cold, dense air from warm, lighter air, and strongly influences weather patterns. During the transition from winter to spring, the jet stream begins to shift northward. This movement creates an increased temperature gradient, leading to more vigorous storms and stronger winds in certain regions. 2. Temperature differences: As the Earth moves through its orbit, the tilt of its axis causes seasonal changes in the amount of sunlight received by each hemisphere. As the Northern Hemisphere warms up during the transition from winter to spring, there is a larger temperature difference between polar and equatorial regions. This temperature difference amplifies the pressure gradient between high and low-pressure systems, leading to increased wind speeds. 3. Seasonal storm systems: During March, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, the atmosphere becomes more dynamic, with stronger, more potent storm systems developing. This increased storm activity results in more frequent and stronger wind events. These systems are fueled by the temperature contrast between the cold, retreating winter air and the increasingly warm, advancing spring air. Taking these factors into consideration, it can be said that the premise \\"March is the month for high winds\\" is supported by meteorological evidence and weather patterns. Therefore, the hypothesis \\"The winds are calm in March\\" would not be considered true based on the premise provided. It is important to note, though, that weather patterns can vary between geographical locations and from year to year, so there may be instances where March is relatively calm in some places. However, in general, March tends to see heightened wind activity, making the hypothesis unlikely to be considered true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Translate to Finnish","output":"Nykyisin Portugali maksaa 4,8 % enemmän, Irlanti maksaa 5,9 % enemmän ja Kreikka maksaa 8,25 % enemmän. Tässä on yksityiskohtaisempi selitys asiasta suomeksi: Nykytilanteessa näiden kolmen maan, Portugalin, Irlannin ja Kreikan, maksamat hinnat tai maksut ovat korkeammat verrattuna muihin maihin tai usein vertailukohtiin näiden prosenttiosuuksien mukaisesti. Portugalin osalta on huomattava, että sillä on 4,8 % suuremmat maksut tai hinnat verrattuna muihin maihin tai vertailukohtiin. Tämä tarkoittaa, että Portugalin on maksettava enemmän rahaa kuin esimerkiksi sen naapurimaiden, mikä voi johtua erilaisista syistä, kuten maan taloudellisesta tilanteesta, markkinoiden paineista tai muiden maiden kanssa solmituista sopimuksista. Irlannin osalta maksut ovat 5,9 % suuremmat. Tässä tapauksessa Irlannin tilannetta voidaan verrata muihin Euroopan unionin maihin, ja tämä ero voi johtua maan talouden perustekijöistä, kuten BKT:sta, inflaatiosta tai työllisyystilanteesta sekä irlantilaisten yritysten kilpailukyvystä kansainvälisillä markkinoilla. Kreikka on kolmas esimerkki, ja siinä maksut ovat huomattavan paljon korkeammat: 8,25 % verrattuna muihin maihin. Kreikan tilanne on ollut paljon puhuttu viime vuosina, erityisesti sen talouskriisi, velkasuhde ja siihen liittyvät kansainväliset sopimukset. Nämä tekijät ovat osaltaan vaikuttaneet Kreikan maksujen ja hintojen nousuun, joka on selvästi suurempi kuin kahdessa muussa esimerkissä. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että vaikka nämä kolme maata, Portugali, Irlanti ja Kreikka, maksavat enemmän kuin monet muut maat, yksityiskohtaisempi analyysi auttaa ymmärtämään syitä tähän tilanteeseen ja voi mahdollistaa paremmin kohdennetut toimenpiteet talouskehityksen tukemiseksi ja maksujen ja hintojen alentamiseksi."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You might recall that Jennifer Lopez used to be an “international music and movie sensation/fashion icon/business mogul,” writes Ben Barna in BlackBook. Somehow, she went from that … to “Paula Abdul’s replacement. Ouch.” How did this happen? “The easy and obvious answer is box-office bombs,” he writes. Although she appeared poised for success thanks to early hits (Selena, in particular), she exercised very, very poor judgment by agreeing to do “the obvious and schmaltzy romantic drama Angel Eyes,” the trainwreck Gigli, and more. Her relationship with Ben Affleck, splashed all over the tabloids as it was, didn’t help her image much, and her “bland-but-catchy dance pop” quickly went stale. Will her Idol gig kill what’s left of her career? Click here for more on that. Expand this summary.","output":"Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler have been officially announced as the newest judges for the popular reality show American Idol, bringing with them a wealth of experience and fan following. However, before we celebrate their addition to the panel, let's take a closer look at Jennifer Lopez's journey to this point. Once an \\"international music and movie sensation, fashion icon, and business mogul,\\" as Ben Barna describes her in BlackBook, Jennifer Lopez has now assumed a role previously held by Paula Abdul. The question that arises is - how did she go from being a global superstar to a talent show judge? The answer, as Barna suggests, lies primarily in her box-office failures. Lopez saw early success with films like Selena, which showcased her acting and singing talents and placed her firmly on the path to stardom. However, her career trajectory took a nosedive when she started making poor decisions related to the projects she chose. Movies like the \\"obvious and schmaltzy romantic drama\\" Angel Eyes and the critically panned Gigli contributed to the decline of her once-promising acting career. Moreover, her high-profile relationship with Ben Affleck, which was a constant subject of tabloid attention, did not do much to help her image. Over time, her once-celebrated music career also started to wane, with her \\"bland-but-catchy dance pop\\" gradually losing its appeal among audiences. Now, as Jennifer Lopez joins American Idol as a judge, fans and critics are left wondering whether her involvement with the show will further diminish her career or perhaps help reinvent it. Only time will tell whether her stint on American Idol will serve as a platform for resurgence or stand as a testament to the decline of a once-great superstar. Regardless of the outcome, her addition to the show alongside Steven Tyler brings an interesting dynamic and will likely pique the curiosity of viewers who have followed their careers over the years. With American Idol's track record of producing successful artists and reinvigorating careers, it remains to be seen if the show will have a positive impact on the professional fortunes of Jennifer Lopez, or if it will ultimately serve as another turning point in her storied career."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Paragraph: Two brothers loved geology. Bob studied sedimentary rocks while Dan studied about earthquakes and their location.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which brother studied less about rocks breaking as a result of stress buildup? The answer to this question is:","output":"Bob studied less about rocks breaking as a result of stress buildup.  In the given paragraph, Bob is described as studying sedimentary rocks, while Dan is studying earthquakes and their location. Sedimentary rocks, although they may undergo some deformation and fracturing over time, are primarily formed through the accumulation and cementation of mineral and organic particles in various depositional environments. The study of sedimentary rocks would primarily focus on understanding processes such as erosion, transportation, deposition, and lithification of sediments. On the other hand, Dan's study of earthquakes and their location is more directly related to the process of rocks breaking as a result of stress buildup. Earthquakes occur due to the sudden release of energy following the breaking or movement of rocks along faults, which often takes place at tectonic plate boundaries. As the plates move and interact, stress accumulates within the rocks, and when this stress exceeds the strength of the rocks, they break and generate earthquakes. Studying earthquakes entails understanding the processes and mechanisms of stress buildup, fault movement, and seismic wave generation and propagation. Given this information, it is clear that, between the two brothers, Bob studied less about rocks breaking as a result of stress buildup. While both fields are relevant to the broader field of geology, Dan's focus on earthquakes is more closely associated with the topic of rocks breaking under stress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I was really, really disappointed with this movie. it started really well, and built up some great atmosphere and suspense, but when it finally got round to revealing the \\"monster\\"...it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems......again. Whoop-de-do. Yet another nutjob movie...like we don't already have enough of them. To be fair, the \\"creep\\" is genuinely unsettling to look at, and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy, but I'm sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human, albeit a twisted, demented, freakish one. When I saw all the tell-tale rats early on I was hoping for some kind of freaky rat-monster hybrid thing...it was such a let down when the Creep was revealed. On top of this, some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense. (Spoiler)  Why the hell does the Creep kill the security Guard? Whats the point, apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says \\"HI I'm A PSYCHO AND I LIVE DOWN HERE!\\"? Its stupid, and only seems to happen to prevent Franka Potente's character from getting help. what the hells he been eating down there? I got the impression he was effectively walled in, and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose...so has he been munching rats all that time, and if so why do they hang around him so much? Why is he so damn hard to kill? He's thin, malnourished and not exactly at peak performance...but seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that .cripple the non-psycho characters in the film.

Question: suppose drinking high amounts of water happens, how will it affect low water levels in the body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If a person drinks high amounts of water, the water levels in the body will increase. This increased water intake will lead to the following effects on the process mentioned: 1. Blood carried into the kidney by the renal artery: More water will result in an increase in blood volume, leading to the kidneys receiving a higher amount of blood than usual. 2. Nephrons in the kidney filter the blood: With an increased blood volume, nephrons will need to work harder to filter the excess water from the blood. This could potentially lead to more waste being filtered out. 3. The waste that is filtered out mixes with water: More water intake will cause the waste filtered out by the nephrons to mix with a higher amount of water, as there is an increased availability of water in the body. 4. Become urine: Due to the increased water intake, there will be more water available to become urine. This may result in a larger urine volume and potentially more diluted urine, as the waste products are mixed with more water. 5. Ureters carry urine out of the kidneys: With an increase in urine volume produced, the ureters will have more work to do in order to carry urine out of the kidneys, which may result in more frequent urination. In conclusion, drinking high amounts of water will have a significant effect on the second process mentioned (nephrons in the kidney filter the blood). The nephrons will need to work harder to filter the increased blood volume resulting from higher water levels in the body. This could lead to more waste being filtered out and the production of more diluted urine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Please answer the following question: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller.  Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff.  But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.  Warner’s committee is also investigating possible... Generally, how long does individual testimony before a congressional committee usually last? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. several hours  B. many months  C. not enough information  D. a few weeks Answer:","output":"A. several hours Testimony before a congressional committee generally takes several hours, though it can vary depending on the complexity and scope of the subject matter, the number of witnesses testifying, and other factors. This duration allows for a comprehensive session in which the committee can probe the testifying individual thoroughly on specific topics.  During a standard testimony session, the one providing the testimony—be it a public official, a private citizen, a professional expert, etc.—is first sworn in, after which they read a prepared statement. Following this, committee members, usually in order of seniority, ask a series of questions that the witness responds to.  In some cases, members may have only five minutes each to question a witness, so the length can also depend on the size of the committee. If there are multiple witnesses, each one might be questioned individually or they might appear on a panel together.  It's important to note that very significant or high-profile hearings, such as impeachment proceedings or those involving substantial public interest or critical legislative issues, can last much longer, potentially spanning multiple days or even weeks. However, even in these prolonged matters, an individual's testimony would ordinarily last a matter of hours, not extended over the whole duration of the proceeding.  While the details of the testimony—from the list of witnesses to the specific questions asked—depend largely on the committee and the topic at hand, the format of a Congressional hearing is fairly consistent. Such formal procedures are crucial to the orderly conduct of legislative business and to maintain transparency and accountability in public affairs.  Overall, while there may be extensive work and preparation behind the scenes encompassing weeks or even months, the actual delivery of individual testimony before a congressional committee generally takes several hours."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity. It is a basic principle underlying the dominant Westphalian model of state foundation.  - A government or state agency, often an appointed commission, is a permanent or semi-permanent organization in the machinery of government that is responsible for the oversight and administration of specific functions, such as an intelligence agency. There is a notable variety of agency types. Although usage differs, a government agency is normally distinct both from a department or ministry, and other types of public body established by government. The functions of an agency are normally executive in character, since different types of organizations (\\"such as commissions\\") are most often constituted in an advisory rolethis distinction is often blurred in practice however.  - The Green Mountains are a mountain range in the U.S. state of Vermont. The range runs primarily south to north and extends approximately from the border with Massachusetts to that with Quebec, Canada. The part of the same range that is in Massachusetts and Connecticut is known as The Berkshires or the Berkshire Hills (with the Connecticut portion, mostly in Litchfield County, locally called the Northwest Hills or Litchfield Hills) and the Quebec portion is called the Sutton Mountains, or Monts Sutton.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - In the United States, a department of motor vehicles (DMV) is a state-level government agency that administers vehicle registration and driver licensing. Similar departments exist in Canada. The name \\"DMV\\" is not used in every state or province, nor are the traditional DMV functions handled by a single agency in every state, but the generic term is universally understood, particularly in the context of driver's license issuance and renewal.  - Vermont is a state in the New England region of the northeast United States. It borders the other U.S. states of Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, New York to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the names of the five Middle French prose works? ?  Up to c. 1210, continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry; after this date the tales began to be told in prose. The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art. The answer to this question is:","output":"The names of the five Middle French prose works are: 1. Estoire del Saint Grail 2. Estoire de Merlin 3. Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot) 4. Queste del Saint Graal 5. Mort Artu"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.  Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing. Question: Why were the family singing?

UPDATED:. 12:21 EST, 5 December 2013. House prices in Britain will rise far more sharply than expected in the next five years, it was revealed today. Official figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility published as part of the Autumn Statement show the cost of buying a house has been severely underestimated. House prices will on average rise by 5.2 per cent next year, 7.2 per cent in 2015 and will be 10 per cent higher in 2018 than predicted, the OBR says. This will crush many people's hopes of owning their own home. On the up: The OBR has today changed its predictions for house price rises to 8.2%, with the cost peaking in 2015. But George Osborne said in his Autumn Statement today than the OBR's new forecasts still left real house prices 3.1% lower than their 2007 peak. The OBR sharply increased its forecasts, with homes expected to cost 10% more by 2018 than it had previously predicted, and Mr Osborne acknowledged there was a 'weakness of supply' in the market. Message: Mr Osborne used his Autumn Statement to say that he would get house building moving but admitted there was a 'shortage of supply' Mr Osborne said: 'Some of the most important infrastructure for British families is housing and we have to confront this simple truth: if we want more people to own a home, we have to build more homes. 'And the OBR is absolutely right today to draw attention to the weakness of housing supply in this country. 'The good news is the latest survey data showed residential construction growing at its fastest rate for a decade. And our hard-won planning reforms are delivering a 35% increase in approvals for new homes. 'But we need to do more.' The Housing Revenue Account borrowing limit will be raised by £300 million for councils, which will also be encouraged to sell off their most expensive properties to fund more cost-effective homes. Mr Osborne said: 'Aspiration isn't only for people who can afford their own home. We want to regenerate some of our most run-down urban housing estates. 'Councils will sell off the most expensive social housing, so they can house many more families for the same money. 'We are going to give working people in social housing a priority right to move if they need to for a job. 'Right to Buy applications have doubled under this Government and we'll expand it more.' The OBR noted that the growth in residential investment had left household finances in deficit and the gross debt to income ratio rising. Its report said that was consistent with low interest rates and schemes such as Help to Buy but 'may pose risks to the sustainability of the recovery over the medium term'. Mr Osborne acknowledged that the market should be 'functioning' but 'stable' and the Bank of England had powers to deal with any housing bubble. Rising high: House prices surged by 6.5 per cent year-on-year in November alone, according to the Nationwide. He said: 'Help to aspiring families and building more homes - that's what we stand for. But we must also avoid the mistakes of the last decade. 'We want a responsible recovery. 'That is why I am the first Chancellor to give the Bank of England the responsibility and the power not only to monitor overall debt levels, but to take action to deal with asset bubbles if they threaten our stability. 'We want a functioning, stable housing market. 'The OBR's latest house price forecast, while higher, still has real house prices 3.1% lower in 2018 than at their peak in 2007.' The Goverment's coffers will receive a boost from the buoyant housing market, with revenues from capital gains and stamp taxes forecast to increase. The OBR said: 'Our forecast for stamp duty land tax (SDLT) is much higher than in March. We now expect receipts to almost double over the forecast period, from £8.9 billion in 2013/14 to £16.8 billion in 2018/19.' Comparison: This graph shows how the OBR predictions were much lower in March this year compared to today. By 2017/18 higher house prices will contribute around £1.8 billion to the forecast, while a higher volume of transactions will add £1 billion to receipts. Increasing prices will mean 'a greater proportion of transactions' become subject to higher stamp duty bands, the OBR added. Mike Jones, chairman of the Local Government Association's environment and housing board, said the measures would 'provide a glimmer of hope' to people facing lengthy waits for a council house. 'Government has today acknowledged councils' argument that the current restrictions on our ability to invest in new housing are not fit for purpose,' he said. 'This is an important first step towards untying the hands of local authorities to build the new social housing which millions on housing waiting lists desperately need.' It was also announced that families with granny flats or converted buildings will get 50 per cent off their council tax bill. The policy will save £500 off a £2,500 bill.","output":"The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) revealed in 2013 that house prices in Britain would rise far more sharply than expected in the next five years.

One reviewer from The Guardian compares the Sci-Fi Dine-In to Epcot's Coral Reef Restaurant, writing that both restaurants \\"are great settings\\" where \\"eating is awful\\". Sehlinger and Testa consider the prices too high, and the food too simple, although they praise the Reuben sandwich and the ribs. Schultz writes that the food is simple and that some of the beers are decent.

Ed Bumgardner of the Winston-Salem Journal shared this opinion as well, specifically singling out the restaurant's roast beef sandwich as a ripoff, despite calling it delicious. Peggy Katalinich of the Tampa Bay Times writes that, although the food is mediocre, \\"Who cares? Food is besides the point\\".

At the conferences, there are speeches and often heated discussions. It may take several rounds of voting before delegates can agree on a candidate. On the final day of the meeting, the presidential candidate announces his or her choice for vice president. Election Day, by law, is the Tuesday that follows the first Monday in November. On this day, registered voters may cast their votes for president, vice president, and candidates for other federal state, and local offices. The popular vote, however, does not determine who will be president. The president is chosen by a vote of the Electoral College, a group of 538 citizens from the 50 states and the District of Columbia who are chosen to cast votes for the president and vice president. The rules for choosing electors, as with the delegates, vary. Each state also decides whether its electoral votes must reflect the popular vote. The number of electors in each state is determined by the number of representatives and senators that a state sends to Congress and, therefore, may change every 10 years, depending on the results of the United States census  . The winner must get at least 270 of the electoral votes when the Electoral College meets in December of the election year. The election results are not official, however, until the following January, when Congress meets in a joint conference to...

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the man whose men are not allowed to arm themselves? from the following article ?  Wedge Donovan is a tough construction boss, building airstrips in the Pacific for the U.S. Navy during World War II. He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese. When the enemy lands in force on the island, he finally takes matters into his own hands, leading his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily. As a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the US Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar \\"Seabees\\") with Donovan's assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley. Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training. The two men are teamed together on yet another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a clamshell bucket. When word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to oppose this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a petroleum storage tank. The plan works, sending a cascade of burning liquid into the path of the Japanese, who retreat in panic, right into the sights of waiting machine guns.

Available options: (a). Yes (b). No Answer:","output":"Answer: (b). No The statement \\"movement of an air mass\\" is an overly broad and potentially misleading response to the question, \\"What is a way to heat a building?\\" While the movement of an air mass can transfer heat from one location to another, it is not a direct method for generating heat within a building. Rather than attributing the source of heat to the movement of air mass, it is more accurate to identify the specific technology or energy source used to generate and distribute heat within a built environment. One such energy source is geothermal energy, which can be harnessed to heat buildings efficiently and sustainably. Geothermal energy is produced by the Earth's natural geothermal heat, which originates from the radioactive decay of minerals deep within the Earth's core. The heat is generally transferred through underground thermal conduction and convection processes, ultimately reaching the Earth's surface. There are a few ways in which geothermal energy is utilized to heat buildings: 1. Direct Use: This method involves extracting and distributing hot geothermal water directly from underground resources to provide heat for buildings. The hot water can be used to meet various heating needs, including space heating, industrial processes, and even balneology (using water for therapeutic purposes). Once the water has released its heat, it can be re-injected into the ground to maintain the sustainable use of geothermal resources. 2. Geothermal Heat Pumps: These systems utilize the stable temperature of the Earth several meters below the surface to exchange heat with the building. During winter, the heat pumps transfer heat from the ground to the building, and during summer, the process is reversed to cool the building. Geothermal heat pumps are highly efficient as they take advantage of the Earth's nearly constant temperature and can provide both heating and cooling, making them an ideal choice for many climates. 3. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS): In areas where geothermal resources are not readily accessible, advanced technology can be employed to develop geothermal reservoirs artificially. EGS involves the injection of fluid into the subsurface to create a network of fractures, enhancing the permeability of the rock and enabling the extraction of heat. The heated fluid is brought to the surface, where it can be used to generate electricity or provide direct heat to buildings. In conclusion, while the movement of an air mass can be an integral component in the process of heating a building (e.g., as part of a ventilation system that distributes warm air), it is not an adequate or accurate answer to the question. A more informative and accurate response would refer to specific energy sources or technologies, such as geothermal energy, that play a direct role in generating and distributing heat for buildings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Making crafts was fun and easy for Aaron but not Robert because","output":"he lacked the natural artistic ability and patience that Aaron possessed, which made him feel frustrated and overwhelmed with every attempt at creating something beautiful. While Aaron would effortlessly envision a project, gather materials, and bring his ideas to life, Robert struggled with even the most basic steps.  He tried to emulate Aaron's tactics and observe how he approached each project, hoping to acquire some of those valuable skills, but it seemed Robert just wasn't built for it. Every time he started a new craft, whether it was painting, knitting, or woodworking, he found himself overwhelmed by the seemingly complex nature of the task. Often, he ended up comparing his unfinished or, according to him, mediocre creations to Aaron's impeccable work, which only added to his frustration.  The lack of patience also amplified his struggles. As Robert impulsively tried to rush through the process, he often ended up with messy results that didn't resemble his initial vision. Not to mention, the hasty attempts made it difficult for him to learn the proper techniques and give the craft its due time and attention. His frustration began to grow, as did his sense of inadequacy. He started dreading the idea of engaging in crafts with Aaron, fearing the inevitable disappointment that would follow. Aaron, on the other hand, was always encouraging, offering support to Robert and suggesting that they try simpler projects together. This was a sweet gesture, but it barely scratched the surface of Robert's feelings of defeat and incapability. Despite their stark difference in crafting abilities, the two friends continued to spend time together, occasionally engaging in projects that Robert felt more comfortable with. Over time, they discovered that while Aaron's strengths lay in the artistic realm, Robert excelled in other areas like problem-solving and critical thinking. They began to collaborate on projects that allowed them to showcase their individual skills, with Robert assisting in the planning and logistics, and Aaron taking care of the creative aspects. Although Robert never quite mastered the art of crafting as Aaron did, their bond strengthened as they learned from each other's strengths and shared their passions. They came to understand that it's not about being equally skilled in every activity, but rather appreciating the fact that their unique skills and talents combined to form a well-rounded and diverse team. In the end, making crafts remained a fun and enjoyable pastime for Aaron, while Robert gradually developed an appreciation for the art even if he wasn't directly involved in its creation. They both learned the value of patience and persistence in honing their skills, and ultimately, how their differences were a vital part of their friendship's growth and success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presented high levels of water stratification, because of the fresh water discharged by the river; and area B, situated 35 miles south, where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated.  But I can use this background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.  Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  What is an answer for this question: Which of the two areas had less dense water?","output":"Based on the given information, Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, has less dense water. This is due to the higher levels of water stratification caused by the fresh water discharged by the river.

Student abandoned in DEA cell for 4 days to get 4.1 million settlement from U.S. SAN DIEGO — An attorney for the man who was abandoned in a Drug Enforcement Administration holding cell for four days without food or water says his client has agreed to settle claims for 4.1 million. Daniel Chong's attorney, Eugene Iredale, said Tuesday that no one has yet been disciplined for the April 2012 incident and no criminal charges will be filed. Iredale says the Justice Department's inspector general is investigating what caused Chong's near-death experience, but that he still has no answers. RELATED: STUDENT LOCKED IN CELL FOR 5 DAYS BY FORGETFUL DEA SUES FOR 20M Chong's attorneys say the DEA had no policy on the treatment of detainees at the time. It does now, and that policy includes cameras in cells and daily inspections. Chong says he drank his own urine to stay alive and tried to write a farewell message to his mother with his own blood. The Justice Department will pay 4.1 million to a California college student left in a Drug Enforcement Administration holding cell for four days without food or water last year, two people familiar with the case told The Associated Press on Tuesday. RELATED: MAN FORCED TO DRINK OWN URINE AFTER BEING LEFT IN CELL FOR 5 DAYS Daniel Chong, 23, was detained in an April 2012 drug raid in San Diego and left in the 5-by-10-foot windowless holding cell. He said he drank his own urine to stay alive and tried to write a farewell message to his mother with his own blood. The people familiar with the case spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the settlement before it was announced Tuesday morning at a news conference. Chong, who was an engineering student at University of California, San Diego, was at a friend's house in April 2012 when a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration raid netted 18,000 ecstasy pills, other drugs and weapons. Chong and eight others were taken into custody. RELATED: DEA RAIDS SYNTHETIC POT AND BATH SALTS MANUFACTURERS AND SELLERS Agents told Chong he would not be charged and had him wait in the cell at DEA offices in San Diego. The door did not reopen for four days, when agents found him severely dehydrated and covered in his own feces. Chong said he began to hallucinate on the third day. He urinated on a metal bench to drink his urine. He stacked a blanket, his pants and shoes on the bench and tried to reach an overhead fire sprinkler, futilely swatting at it with his cuffed hands to set it off.

This article: Radical rebuilding schemes poured in for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles. If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans. With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches. On Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\". It is a familiar London landmark which has since given its name to a tube station.

Hypothesis: The lady is in her apartment staring at a sparrow. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is correct, as it possesses considerable discrepancies. Let's examine both statements and identify the areas where they differ: 1. Premises: \\"Woman sitting in tree with dove.\\" In this statement, we have some essential details to consider:    a. There is a woman involved in the scenario.    b. The woman is sitting in a tree.    c. She has a dove with her, which is a species of bird distinct from a sparrow. 2. Hypothesis: \\"The lady is in her apartment staring at a sparrow.\\" This statement also provides crucial information, although they significantly deviate from the premises:    a. The subject, a lady or woman, remains consistent.    b. The location has changed from a tree to an apartment.    c. The type and behavior of the bird have been altered. The bird has transitioned from a dove to a sparrow, and the woman is staring at it rather than merely being with the dove. With these details in mind, let's examine the extent to which the hypothesis aligns with the premise: 1. Consistencies:    a. Both statements involve a woman or lady as the central figure. 2. Inconsistencies:    a. The location where the woman is situated is different in both accounts. The woman is in a tree in the premise, while she is in an apartment in the hypothesis.    b. The bird species mentioned in each statement is not the same. The premise refers to a dove, while the hypothesis mentions a sparrow.    c. The woman's interaction with the bird is different. The main premise states that the woman is in the presence of a dove, whereas the hypothesis implies she is actively staring at a sparrow. In conclusion, given the premise \\"Woman sitting in tree with dove,\\" we cannot accurately infer the hypothesis \\"The lady is in her apartment staring at a sparrow.\\" While there is a similarity in both statements referring to a woman, the discrepancies in location, bird species, and the nature of the interaction between the woman and the bird contribute to a fundamental divergence of the hypothesis from the original premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!  I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Jane Marple, usually known as Miss Marple, is a fictional character in several mystery novels by Agatha Christie. This sentence is a translation from German to English. It introduces the character of Jane Marple, commonly referred to as Miss Marple, who appears in a number of mystery novels written by British author Agatha Christie. Miss Marple is an amateur detective, characterized by her strong observational skills, deep understanding of human nature, and her elderly, unassuming appearance. She lives in the village of St. Mary Mead and uses her intuition and insight to solve crimes that often baffle the authorities. Agatha Christie is a renowned English author known for her mystery novels, short stories, and plays. She is one of the best-selling authors of all time, having sold over two billion copies of her books and having been translated into multiple languages. Christie is famous for creating beloved and enduring characters, like Hercule Poirot, Tommy and Tuppence, and Miss Marple. The first Miss Marple novel, \\"The Murder at the Vicarage,\\" was published in 1930. Following the success of the initial novel, Miss Marple went on to feature in eleven more full-length novels and twenty short stories. Some notable books featuring Miss Marple include: 1. The Body in the Library (1942): In this novel, Miss Marple investigates the murder of a young woman whose body is discovered in the library of her friends, Colonel and Mrs. Bantry. 2. A Murder Is Announced (1950): In this story, Miss Marple visits the village of Chipping Cleghorn when a murder announcement appears in the local newspaper, only to be followed by a real murder. 3. The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side (1962): Miss Marple investigates the mysterious death of a woman at a charity event hosted by a famous film actress in her village. A recurring theme throughout the Miss Marple novels is the contrast between the seemingly idyllic, peaceful village life in St. Mary Mead and the dark secrets and crimes that lie beneath. Miss Marple's knowledge of human nature, coupled with her ability to notice small details that others overlook, proves vital in uncovering the truth behind the various mysteries. In addition to the novels and short stories, Miss Marple has been adapted into television series, films, and radio dramas. These adaptations usually maintain the character's essential traits, while sometimes updating or altering the stories to suit the medium and the target audience. In conclusion, Miss Marple is an iconic fictional character created by Agatha Christie and has captivated readers for decades. Her ability to solve complex crimes using her acute observation skills and understanding of human nature, coupled with the contrast between the idyllic English village setting and the hidden darkness within, has ensured the character's enduring popularity and status as a classic detective in the realm of mystery fiction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: What tells you how much of the food you should eat to get the nutrients listed on the label?   Choices:  - regular size  - scoop size  - longer size  - serving size  A:","output":"The answer to the question is \\"serving size\\". According to the information provided in the paragraph, the serving size is the measure that tells you how much of the food you should consume in order to get the nutrients listed on the label. It can usually be found at the top of the nutrition facts label. The serving size is important because it helps you understand the quantity of food that the nutritional information relates to. It is the basis for determining things like the number of calories and nutrient amounts in a portion of food. For the label example in the paragraph, a serving is indicated to be a cup of food from the label, and it contains 250 calories.

Mrs May said 8,000 migrant attempts to cross the Channel to the UK were foiled between 21 June and 11 July, when ferry strikes in France exacerbated problems. Transport bosses said migrant numbers in Calais had risen from 600 in January to 5,000 - and that figure was growing. Mrs May told the Commons hauliers had been subjected to \\"repeated attempts by illegal migrants who attempt to stow themselves away in their vehicles\\". The new zone should provide protection for lorries and their drivers by \\"removing them from the open road where they can become targets for migrants\\", said Mrs May. She said the security zone should \\"transform protection\\" for hauliers. Her announcement came as transport bosses appeared before the Home Affairs Committee to answer questions about the crisis. Kent Police Chief Constable Alan Pughsley told MPs there had been a \\"significant increase\\" in the number of migrants found hiding in vehicles in the UK over the past month. He said: Mr Pughsley said he believed strike action by French ferry workers during that time was a \\"contributing factor\\" to the numbers because it meant \\"easier access\\" for people to trains or lorries. John Keefe, director of public affairs at Eurotunnel, said the 5,000 figure had grown from an estimated 600 migrants in January, and the rise was \\"continuing apace\\". \\"We have never seen numbers like this before and we have not in the past seen the degree of organisation that goes with the numbers either,\\" he said. He said a secure zone would not solve the issue, adding: \\"As soon as you remove an opportunity, the organised criminals who are managing the migrant attacks are moving to the next opportunity - to the next weak spot.\\" Road Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett said the situation was \\"out of control\\" and criticised the fact the secure zone would not be in place until the autumn. \\"This isn't fast enough. We've got drivers being threatened with bars and knives. We've had an example of a driver being threatened with a gun,\\" he said. \\"We've got a problem right now. This is unprecedented and it's escalating. We need action now.\\" The \\"write-off\\" of products due to contamination by migrants entering vehicles could be £1bn a year, he said, adding: \\"There are full loads that are being destroyed.\\" Last week a migrant from Eritrea died attempting to board a freight shuttle headed to Britain. The death came days after about 150 migrants tried to storm the Channel Tunnel terminal in France. The strike by French ferry workers at the end of last month forced the suspension of Channel Tunnel services. It closed the Port of Calais and resulted in thousands of lorry drivers being stuck on the roads into Calais. This led hundreds of migrants to try to board UK-bound lorries. Mrs May said British and French authorities had been working together for months to improve security at Calais. Some £12m will spent on work to reinforce security in northern French ports, including new fencing and work to improve traffic flow and Border Force controls, which would be completed next month, she said. Other security measures already announced include a £2m upgrade of detection technology, £1m extra for dog searches and new fencing in Calais. UKIP's migration spokesman, Steven Woolfe, said the government was \\"waking up to the crisis\\" but called for more UK border personnel in Calais and said the UK should negotiate a scheme where migrants can be returned immediately to France if they have entered the UK illegally. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Britain's border was the scene of a \\"terrible crisis\\" where lives were being lost and people were being injured.","output":"In a big parking space, they are making room for 230 cars which will help keep the line of cars from getting too long.

Paul VI did renounce many traditional symbols of the papacy and the Catholic Church; some of his changes to the papal dress were reversed by Pope Benedict XVI in the early 21st century. Refusing a Vatican army of colourful military uniforms from centuries, he got rid of them. He became the first pope to visit five continents. Paul VI systematically continued and completed the efforts of his predecessors, to turn the Euro-centric Church into a Church of the world, by integrating the bishops from all continents in its government and in the Synods which he convened. His 6 August 1967 motu proprio Pro Comperto Sane opened the Roman Curia to the bishops of the world. Until then, only Cardinals could be leading members of the Curia. What group of clergy did Paul VI include in Vatican decision making that had previously been denied influence in this realm?","output":"Paul VI significantly included the bishops from all around the world in Vatican decision making—a group that before his pontificate had been denied influence in this realm. Before his changes, the Roman Curia, the administrative apparatus of the Church, had solely been open to Cardinals. Cardinals, who are appointed by the Pope, often come from a more limited geographic and ideological range than the wider body of bishops, who lead local dioceses around the world, and their positions are considered to be more prestigious within the Church hierarchy. In doing this, Paul VI helped to realize his vision of promoting a more global Church, not just centered in Europe but incorporating voices, perspectives, and experiences from across all continents. It aligned with his broader efforts to decentralize the Catholic Church's power structures and to increase the representation of global, particularly non-European, churches in governing bodies and decision-making processes. This was notably implemented by his motu proprio Pro Comperto Sane, issued on 6 August 1967, which opened the Roman Curia to bishops around the world. A motu proprio is a type of papal decree that is enacted by the Pope on his own initiative and authority. Pro Comperto Sane specifically mandated the inclusion of non cardinals in leadership positions within the Roman Curia. By including bishops in these decision-making bodies, Paul VI aimed to foster increased collaboration, cooperation, and solidarity among the diverse parts of the global Catholic Church. His efforts were in line with the principles of collegiality and joint responsibility between the Pope and bishops that were reaffirmed during the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). It was a landmark move that had significant impacts on the ways that the Catholic Church was governed and how decisions were made, ensuring that a more diverse range of views and experiences were taken into account in the heart of Vatican decision making. His successors have largely continued his efforts to include bishops in Church governance and decision-making bodies, even as they have differed on other aspects of his legacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Princess of Thieves Movie plot: The film picks up years after the \\"known\\" events of the Robin Hood legend, centering on Robin's daughter, Gwyn, played by Knightley. As Maid Marian has died and Robin Hood (Stuart Wilson) is perpetually away battling in the Crusades, Gwyn has lived much of her life alone. She has grown up to be a strong-willed young woman with a talent for archery, much like her father. Her only friend is the sweet but plain Froderick (Del Synnott), who clearly is in love with her. Upon the death of King Richard the Lionheart, Robin returns to see that the proper man takes Richard's place as King of England. However, Robin is quickly foiled and imprisoned by his enemies, the Sheriff of Nottingham (Malcolm McDowell) and Prince John (Jonathan Hyde).It is then up to Gwyn to save the day. She must complete Robin's mission to find and protect the young Prince Philip (Stephen Moyer), who has just returned from exile in France to claim the throne not an easy task since he has decided to forsake his true identity and is travelling anonymously under his valet's name (who died en route protecting his prince). Though she does fortuitously cross paths with the prince, she is not aware of his identity for much of the film. With a romantic spark budding between them, they must find the Merry Men and join forces to free her father from the tortures of the Tower of London before the evil Prince John ascends to the throne and brings England to ruin. After freeing her father, Gwyn along with her father and Prince Philip stop the coronation of Prince John.In the end when Philip is about to be crowned as king, Gwyn with a heavy heart tells him that she can only serve and work for him and they cannot be together. Robin later explains that he stayed out of Gwyn's life to protect her from the life he leads, but it didn't make any difference because she grew up to be just like him anyway. He then proposes a partnership between the two of them to serve Philip, with the only condition being that she take her orders from him (Robin) alone. She agrees,...

Answer the question Which of these locations in the solar system contains the most asteroids?","output":"To answer this question, I will consider the different locations in the solar system where asteroids are commonly found, and then determine which of these locations contains the most asteroids. Step 1: Identify the locations in the solar system where asteroids are commonly found. There are three main regions where asteroids are commonly found: 1. Asteroid Belt: Located between Mars and Jupiter, the Asteroid Belt is a region containing a significant number of asteroids. 2. Trojans: These are groups of asteroids that share the same orbit as a planet, typically located at the stable points called Lagrange points L4 and L5, which are 60 degrees ahead and behind the planet in its orbit. The most well-known Trojans are associated with Jupiter, but they can be associated with other planets as well. 3. Near-Earth Asteroids: These are asteroids whose orbits bring them close to Earth's orbit. They can be further classified into different groups based on their orbits (Atiras, Apollos, Amors, and Atens). Step 2: Determine which location contains the most asteroids. 1. Asteroid Belt: The Asteroid Belt is believed to contain millions of asteroids, ranging in size from small boulders to large bodies several hundred kilometers in diameter. It is estimated that the total mass of all the asteroids in the Asteroid Belt is about 4% of the mass of Earth's Moon. 2. Trojans: There are thousands of known Trojan asteroids associated with Jupiter, as well as a few hundred associated with Mars, Neptune, and even Earth. 3. Near-Earth Asteroids: There are currently over 26,000 known Near-Earth Asteroids, with more being discovered regularly.

The Rogue River begins at Boundary Springs on the border between Klamath and Douglas counties near the northern edge of Crater Lake National Park. Although it changes direction many times, it flows generally west for 215 miles (346 km) from the Cascade Range through the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Klamath Mountains to the Pacific Ocean at Gold Beach. Communities along its course include Union Creek, Prospect, Trail, Shady Cove, Gold Hill and Rogue River, all in Jackson County; Grants Pass and Galice in Josephine County; and Agness, Wedderburn and Gold Beach in Curry County. Significant tributaries include the South Fork Rogue River, Elk Creek, Bear Creek, the Applegate River, and the Illinois River. Arising at 5,320 feet (1,622 m) above sea level, the river loses more than 1 mile (1.6 km) in elevation by the time it reaches the Pacific. It was one of the original eight rivers named in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, which included 84 miles (135 km) of the Rogue, from 7 miles (11.3 km) west of Grants Pass to 11 miles (18 km) east of the mouth at Gold Beach. In 1988, an additional 40 miles (64 km) of the Rogue between Crater Lake National Park and the unincorporated community of Prospect was named Wild and Scenic. Of the river's total length, 124 miles (200 km), about 58 percent is Wild and Scenic. The Rogue is one of only three rivers that start in or east of the Cascade Range in Oregon and reach the Pacific Ocean. The others are the Umpqua River and Klamath River. These three Southern Oregon rivers drain mountains south of the Willamette Valley; the Willamette River and its tributaries drain north along the Willamette Valley into the Columbia River, which starts in British Columbia rather than Oregon.

The crackdown is “completely deplorable and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms,” said an official statement. In response, “the United States is pursuing a range of possible policy options, including targeted sanctions.” Officials voiced support for the protesters, whose “call for freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and the ability to freely choose their leaders must be heard.” Though the crackdown in Syria continued today, tensions appear to be on the rise in Syria’s army, as soldiers increasingly oppose violence against the protesters. Some soldiers in Daraa refused to fire on demonstrators. It's not the first report of such a refusal, and a number of military officials have apparently been assassinated after reportedly taking the protesters’ side. A division in the army would “cast serious doubt” on the government’s “ability to survive,” writes Nicholas Blanford in the Christian Science Monitor.","output":"Title: US Condemns Brutal Violence from Syria's Government: National Security Council Interference Intensifies  The National Security Council (NSC) has unequivocally denounced the escalating “brutal violence” exerted by the Syrian government against peaceful protesters, as reported by NPR. This comes as a reaction to a sustained government-led crackdown on dissidents seeking democratic and civil liberties in the Middle Eastern nation. The NSC, in an official statement, dubbed the crackdown as “completely deplorable” and condemned it in the strongest possible terms. This statement from one of America's highest security bodies signifies a serious standpoint against the flagrant human rights violations in Syria and yet another assertive stance by the United States in standing up for global democratic values. In response to the abuses by Syria’s government, the US stated it is exploring a comprehensive set of policy mechanisms to counter the situation. Highlighted among these are targeted sanctions, designed to put pressure directly on key figures in the Syrian regime without causing unnecessary strain on the general populace who are already subjected to traumatic experiences. The officials from the NSC voiced their support for the protesters who have remained resilient and unwavering in their call for freedom of expression, assembly, association, and the ability to freely choose their leaders. This sentiment communicates that the global superpower stands firmly behind the principles of democracy, asserting that the voices of Syrian protesters \\"must be heard.\\" While the government's crackdown in Syria is ongoing, a remarkable shift appears to be taking shape within Syria’s army. Notably, soldiers are reportedly increasingly expressing opposition to the violence against protesters. There have been reports of some military personnel in Daraa explicitly refusing to fire on demonstrators — not as isolated instances, but as part of a broader trend.  This trend is causing concern among Syria’s leaders, as it points to a potential division within the military — the backbone of the regime. There have been chilling reports that some military officials who sided with the protesters have been assassinated, casting a shadow over the loyalty of the army to the incumbent government. Nicholas Blanford, writing for the Christian Science Monitor, suggests that such a division within the army could “cast serious doubt” on the government's “ability to survive.” The implication is that a split within the military could destabilize the authoritarian government's iron clad hold on power, thereby accelerating its potential collapse. As the situation develops, the international community and particularly the U.S., through the National Security Council, continues to monitor the situation closely. The emphasis remains on ensuring respect for human rights and democratic values and the pursuit of possible policy options to expedite a resolution to the crisis in Syria. The courage of the Syrian people, as they continue to call out for their freedoms amidst the brutal crackdown, has not gone unnoticed and contributions toward their cause continue to intensify."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This conversion is made possible by solar cells. However, solar energy may not always be practical. Some areas are just too cloudy. Example Solar panels on the roof of this house generate enough electricity to supply a familys needs. Moving Water Falling water can have a lot of energy. Its energy can be converted into kinetic energy. This energy can turn a turbine and generate electricity. The water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam. A drawback of dams is that they flood land upstream. They can also reduce water flow downstream. Either effect may harm ecosystems. Wind Wind is moving air. It has kinetic energy that can do work.

Please write a short summary for the following article: PARENTS' GUIDE TO VISITING DAY AT CAMP THERE is a short but special season of the year that fits neatly between the beginning of July and the end of August. It is the time when parents of children away at summer camp have finally adjusted to tiny loads of laundry, sinfully small grocery bills and plenty of peace and quiet, and it precedes the period when they start dashing off to concert halls, R-rated movies, getaway weekends for two and other ''adult'' activities - before the kids come home. By the middle of summer, the family dog has reluctantly left his post at the kitchen door, having given up hope of seeing his favorite people trooping in at 3 o'clock. Even the family car has accepted the new routine; it has stopped turning automatically onto its old routes - the roads to school, the orthodontist, barbershop, soccer field, dancing lessons and birthday parties. It now knows the way to art museums, antique shows and Japanese restaurants that specialize in sushi. And it appreciates taking a nice, relaxing drive without having its back seat battered by juvenile wrestling and rioting. At this special time, when the eight weeks of summer camp so beautifully balance - four weeks gone and four more weeks to go - parents jump into cars, planes, trains and buses and run off to the country, eager to be the first adults their children will see at camp on Visiting Day. The kids are encouraged by the camping staff to play catch, clean their bunks or ''just play quietly'' while waiting for Visiting Day to begin, but soon after breakfast, they all start drifting toward the main gate. A glimpse of one's parents - or the parents of a friend - can give instant status to someone with sharp eyes. Many things should be considered by parents as they make their way from the parking lot, lugging lawn chairs, blankets and shopping bags filled with ''goodies.'' The following information is presented as a guide to these parents: 1. Be prepared for some changes in your child's appearance. Do not cry, ''Good grief! They're starving you! You must have lost at least 10 pounds!'' Even if your daughter (on whom you have spent close to 2,000 for this summer in the sun) looks like an inner-city advertisement for ''send this poor child to camp,'' don't admit it in front of her. Also, don't comment on other peculiarities; try to ignore tattoo marks (they'll probably wash right off with nail polish remover), experimental hair-dos and recently pierced ears. 2. Remember, you are at camp only for one day. Control the urge to speak your mind. Lay off the scolding. Do not say, ''You needn't call home collect every time you get a stomach ache. This camp has two competent nurses,'' even if you're bursting to do so. Within a week, you'll be swearing they have acute appendicitis and are afraid to let you - or anybody else -know. Do say, ''Things are very quiet at home. Most of the time we just sit around the house and say how glad we are that you're out of the hot city.'' 3. When you visit your child's cabin, studiously avoid any close examination of his or her toilet kit. The toothpaste, soap and shampoo you assiduously purchased in June may still be unwrapped. Furthermore, delving into a dirt-encrusted clothes cubby might excite a field mouse or other country creature that may have made a home for itself in some warm, wet socks. 4. If you must take food, don't take anything perishable. Aunt Helen's chopped liver may be a family treat at home, but it will quickly turn to moldy paste in summer heat. If you buy candy or other snack items, don't buy more than the amount your child will be able to stuff into his or her mouth that night. It is an unwritten custom among campers to gorge themselves on as many food treats as possible within 24 hours after Visiting Day. 5. Do not attempt to give your son a midsummer haircut. He probably thinks he was already scalped in June and his hair is just beginning to ''grow in.'' Also, do not tell him his kid sister stuck her hands into his fish tank ''just to pet them, Mommy,'' and three swordtails died from shock. The bad news can wait until he comes home from camp. 6. You may have received one or two frantic letters written the week before Visiting Day, with outrageous requests such as ''please bring the dog. We can smuggle her into my bunk during General Swim,'' and ''You've got to get me out of here! This is the third night I've had to sleep under the bunk!'' Don't let these pleas get to you on Visiting Day. It's normal to expect some dissatisfactions. One mother spent an entire visit listening to a litany of complaints from her 10-year old daughter. The food was horrid. The other kids hated her. The camp director was always yelling and the head waterfront counselor had threatened to drown her if she didn't master the Australian crawl. By the end of the day, the mother was reduced to jelly. Wondering if she should tell the child to hurry and pack her bags, she tremblingly hugged her and kissed her on the cheek. Before she could speak, her daughter was off, running down the camp trail back to her bunk. Over her shoulder, she called, ''when I come back next year, I want to be in Bunk 8!'' 7. Do not bring any treasured possessions from home. You will immediately hear, ''Let me see it, let me see it,'' from his bunkmates, and the next words may regretfully be, ''Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to break it...'' 8. Be sure to wear comfortable, closed-toe shoes. One mother wearing high-heeled pumps speared as much grass and litter with her stiletto spikes as an overzealous sanitation worker in Central Park. One father, all decked out in new, imported sandals, spent half the car ride home picking gravel and tar off the soles of his feet. 9. Do not leave the camp grounds, especially if you're not familiar with the territory. At one camp in Massachusetts, picnic lunches were offered to campers and their families. A 12-year-old boy invited his folks to eat with him at a ''special place'' he had discovered in the woods. ''Look at the grass,'' he told them, ''it's so warm and moss-like.'' They spread his jelly-roll blanket down on the ground and rubbed their hands on the soft, furry surface. Lunch was eaten and while everyone was relaxing, the head counselor appeared. ''Hi,'' he said, and then he paused nervously. They could tell bad news was coming. ''I hate to tell you this,'' he fidgeted, ''but you're sitting on top of the camp cesspool.'' 10. At departure time, don't be surprised if, having seen what all the other parents brought their children, your child has made a new list of ''must-haves'' for you to send by mail. 11. Make your goodbyes short. Nobody likes to pry his own kid's fingers off the car fender, or shut the car door on a forlorn face. One family drove three miles before they discovered what the ''extra weight'' was in the trunk. Your best bet is to leave a half-hour before Visiting Day concludes, so you and your kids aren't stimulated by the tearful separations around you. Besides, by leaving early you'll beat the other parents back to the city and have more time to enjoy your remaining weeks alone! --------------------------------------------------------------------- Susan J.

Question: It may seem as though the 2020 U.S. presidential election is a long way off. But good luck telling that to President Donald Trump or a dozen or so Democrats contemplating a White House bid two years from now. Trump has already been out on the campaign trail testing themes for his expected re-election bid. \\"Our new slogan for 2020. Do you know what it is? Keep America great!\\" Trump told cheering supporters at a recent rally in Elkhart, Indiana. But Trump also made it clear he is concerned about this year's congressional midterm elections, in which opposition Democrats are favored to make gains.  \\"And all of the great momentum that we are having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military — it is all at stake in November,\\" Trump warned at the Indiana rally.  2020 is expected to produce a bumper crop of Democratic presidential contenders who will vie for their party's nomination. Those in the group range from the well-known like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to a younger, less recognizable contingent that includes California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several potential Democratic presidential contenders spoke about the party's future at a recent conference in Washington hosted by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning public policy institute in Washington. Among the speakers was Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said Democrats face an uphill battle to win back control of Congress this year because of long-standing Republican advantages in winning a majority in the House of Representatives. \\"We can't climb that hill by ignoring the millions of Americans who are angry and scared about the damage this president and this Republican Party have done to our democracy,\\" Warren told the conference to a round of applause. \\"We can't ignore it and we shouldn't want to ignore it.\\" What is probably true about Elizabeth Warren? - She supports Donald Trump - She is a democrat - She is a republican - not enough information Answer:","output":"She is a democrat"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: This article: Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne?, what is it ?

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose first husband murdered her second husband? ?  Monte Beragon, the second husband of Mildred Pierce, is shot. The police tell Mildred that the murderer is her first husband, Bert Pierce, after he is interrogated and confesses to the crime. Mildred protests that he is too kind and gentle to commit murder, and reveals her life story to the investigating officer in flashback. Mildred and Bert are unhappily married. Mildred must bake and sell pies and cakes to support the family after Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay. Bert bitterly accuses Mildred of favoring their daughters, especially Veda, over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they decide to separate. Mildred retains custody of her two daughters, the 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber and aspiring pianist, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide material possessions for Veda, who longs for a social status above that of her family and is ashamed of her mother's work as a baker. When Mildred is forced to take a job as a waitress, she tries to hide the fact from Veda, but Veda learns the truth and treats her mother with derision. Mildred meets Monte Beragon, a Pasadena society playboy and heir whose inheritance is almost depleted. Beragon owns the building that Mildred wants to purchase for a restaurant, and he pursues a romantic interest in her. While the two are at his beach house during a weekend jaunt, Kay contracts pneumonia and dies after a trip with Veda and Bert. Mildred channels her grief into work and throws herself into opening a new restaurant. With the help of her friend and former supervisor, Ida Corwin, Mildred's restaurant is a success. Wally helps Mildred buy the property, and soon she owns a chain of restaurants throughout Southern California.

Dutch also retains full use of the velar fricatives that were present in Proto-Germanic, but lost or modified in many other Germanic languages. Dutch has final-obstruent devoicing: at the end of a word, voicing distinction is neutralised and all obstruents are pronounced voiceless.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write an article based on this \\"Visualize your best self. Make a list of your priorities. Write out a daily schedule. Separate the urgent from the valuable. List your obligations and duties.

To create a life filled with purpose, satisfaction, and happiness, planning and organization play crucial roles. In this article, we explore how visualizing your best self, determining priorities, developing a daily schedule, distinguishing between urgency and value, outlining obligations and duties, and considering relationships can significantly contribute to a well-rounded and fulfilling life. Step 1: Visualize Your Best Self The first step to crafting your life plan is envisioning your best self. Picture where you want to be in the future - both personally and professionally. Ask yourself, \\"What makes me proud and content?\\" By visualizing your goals and aspirations, you create a clear mental picture of the life you wish to lead, which further motivates you to work towards achieving your dreams. Step 2: Make a List of Your Priorities To focus on what matters most, create a list of your priorities. This list will serve as your personal roadmap, guiding the decisions you make and how you allocate your time. Start by dividing your life's multiple facets, such as health, relationships, career, personal development, and hobbies. Next, rank these facets based on the level of importance they hold in your life. This prioritization exercise will help you channel your energies towards activities that genuinely fulfill you. Step 3: Write Out a Daily Schedule Time is a finite resource, and using it efficiently is vital to accomplish your goals. Create a daily schedule that promotes productivity, balance, and overall well-being. Ensure that the vital aspects of your life get the attention they deserve. Incorporating time for self-care and relaxation is equally important as investing time in work and personal development. Step 4: Separate the Urgent from the Valuable In our fast-paced lives, we often confuse urgency with importance. Take a step back and evaluate your tasks based on their impact on your long-term goals. While urgent tasks require immediate attention, valuable tasks may hold more meaningful implications for your future. Practice discernment in choosing which tasks to tackle first and learn to delegate or eliminate activities that don't align with your priorities and long-term aspirations. Step 5: List Your Obligations and Duties A fulfilling life doesn't merely revolve around personal aspirations but also encompasses responsibilities towards others. List out your obligations and duties to ensure that you meet your commitments and contribute positively towards your community and relationships. This might include family responsibilities, career obligations, or volunteering efforts. By striking a balance between personal and external commitments, you'll create a more meaningful and well-rounded existence. Step 6: Think About Your Relationships Lastly, relationships play a significant role in our overall well-being. Take the time to evaluate your current relationships and consider their impact on your life. Foster connections that uplift and support you, and distance yourself from toxic influences. Remember that nurturing quality relationships enriches your life, improves your emotional well-being, and enhances your personal growth. Conclusion Crafting your life plan is a journey of self-discovery and personal growth. By intentionally visualizing your best self, setting priorities, designing a daily schedule, separating urgency from value, outlining obligations and duties, and nurturing relationships, you'll create a meaningful and fulfilling life. Embrace this process with open-mindedness, patience, and determination to mold the life you've always envisioned."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

At the Battle of Kay, or Paltzig, the Russian Count Saltykov with 47,000 Russians defeated 26,000 Prussians commanded by General Carl Heinrich von Wedel.

Frederick himself lost half his army in the Battle of Kunersdorf (now Kunowice Poland), the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide.

A:","output":"\\"Read book\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons: Step 1: Understand the context of the question The question asks what parents encourage kids to do when they are bored.

Step 2: Evaluate the possible answers Now let's evaluate the provided options in the context of the question: a. Read book: Reading is a mentally stimulating activity that engages the child's mind, promoting learning, creativity, and imagination. b. Travel: While travel can be an enriching activity, it is not a practical solution for relieving boredom on a regular basis, and it may not be feasible for parents to encourage travel whenever a child is bored. c. Sleep: Sleeping is generally not encouraged as a solution for boredom, as it doesn't engage the mind or promote personal growth. Additionally, excessive sleep may lead to negative consequences on physical and mental health. d. Play chess: Playing chess is also an intellectually stimulating activity. However, it may not be the most common suggestion given by parents, as not every child is interested in chess or has access to someone to play with. e. Falling down: This option is not aligned with human common sense, as falling down poses a risk of injury and doesn't offer any intellectual, creative, or personal growth benefits.

When I first heard about \\"Down To Earth,\\" I was pretty excited. I'm a pretty big fan a Chris Rock, he was especially hilarious in Dogma. But this film proved to be a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance was not nearly as good as his past performances, and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole. First off, Chris Rock. He plays the entire movie as a standup comedy routine. Obviously, this works fine in the scenes where he's supposed to be doing standup, but in the rest of the movie, it doesn't. Even when he's talking to one other character, he seems to think he's trying to make a roomful of people laugh. He has a few funny moments, but they mostly come during the standup scenes (no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian). As for the rest of the cast, they're pretty much there just to give Rock someone to talk to, none of them stand out. Also, the movie was poorly directed. The movie has basically a one-joke plot: old white guy acting like a young black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, this still could have worked, and been quite funny. The problem was, we saw too much of Rock and not enough of the old white guy. It's supposed to be funny because it's this white guy telling Chris Rock's jokes, but for most of the time, we just see Chris Rock, so it's not nearly as funny. The few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy talking like Rock are, in fact, hilarious. If he had been shown more, the movie would have been a lot funnier. Overall, a few moments of laughter can't make up for the fact that \\"Down To Earth\\" is poorly acted, and poorly directed. This one was a pretty big disappointment. Rating: 4/10 Choose your answer.

The author's father Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: In 1981, when I was nine years old, my father took me to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”.

In this case, there's nothing to simplify, so we will move on to the next step. Step 2: Move all terms containing the variable to one side of the equation. To do this, add 'o' to both sides of the equation to eliminate '-o' on the right-hand side: 2*o - 15 + o = -o + o This simplifies to: 3*o - 15 = 0 Step 3: Isolate the variable. To do this, add 15 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant (-15) on the left-hand side: 3*o - 15 + 15 = 0 + 15 This simplifies to: 3*o = 15 Step 4: Solve for the variable. Now, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable (which is 3 in this case): 3*o / 3 = 15 / 3 This simplifies to: o = 5 So the solution for the linear equation 2*o - 15 = -o is o = 5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.  - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada.

It is based on the principles of equality of opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life. The general term may cover a variety of forms of economic and social organization. The sociologist T.H. Marshall described the modern welfare state as a distinctive combination of democracy, welfare, and capitalism.  - The Prime Minister of Canada is the primary minister of the Crown, chairman of the Cabinet, and thus head of government for Canada, charged with advising the Canadian monarch or federal viceroy on the exercise of the executive powers vested in them by the constitution. Not outlined in any constitutional document, the office exists only as per long-established convention (originating in Canada's former colonial power, the United Kingdom) that stipulates the monarch's representative, the governor general, must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber.

The reason may be easy to see: an overloaded tray, a shelf out of reach, a patch of ice on the road. But more often than not there is a chain of events leading up to the misfortune-frustration, tiredness or just bad temper-that show what the accident really is, a sort of attack on oneself. Road accidents, for example, happen frequently after a family quarrel, and we all know people who are _ , so often at odds with themselves and the world that they seem to cause accidents for themselves and others. By definition, an accident is something you cannot predict or avoid, and the idea which used to be current, that the majority of road accidents are caused by a minority of criminally careless drivers, is not supported by insurance statistics. These show that most accidents involve ordinary motorists in a moment of carelessness or thoughtlessness. It is not always clear, either, what sort of conditions make people more likely to have an accident. For instance, the law requires all factories to take safety actions and most companies have safety committees to make sure the regulations are observed, but still, every day in Britain, some fifty thousand men and women are absent from work due to an accident. These accidents are largely the result of human error or misjudgment-noise and fatigue, boredom or worry are possible factors which contribute to this. Doctors who work in factories have found that those who drink too much, usually people who have a high anxiety level, run three times the normal risk of accidents at work. The passage suggests that  _  .

The force is exerted over a distance and includes forces of attraction and repulsion. North and south poles of two magnets attract each other, while two north poles or two south poles repel each other. A magnet can exert force over a distance because the magnet is surrounded by a magnetic field . In the Figure below , you can see the magnetic field surrounding a bar magnet. Tiny bits of iron, called iron filings, were placed under a sheet of glass. When the magnet was placed on the glass, it attracted the iron filings. The pattern of the iron filings shows the lines of force that make up the magnetic field of the magnet. The concentration of iron filings near the poles indicates that these areas exert the strongest force. You can also see how the magnetic field affects the compasses placed above the magnet.

Use dynamic stretches that move your body while stretching. For instance, start by swinging your arms frontward and backward, then moving on to twisting the top half of your body around to each side. Next, try forward lunges. Step forward with one knee, bringing the other knee almost to the ground. Step forward with the other leg, bringing the other knee almost to the ground. Continue forward with the lunges.  Move on to exercises that will warm up your muscles. For instance, you can hop in place. You can also jog slowly in place bringing your knees up high, and then jog slowly in place while trying to pull your heels up higher in the back as you jog. Faster runners actually take more steps than slower runners.  One way to shorten your stride is to run while jumping rope. That is, take the jump rope out to the track with you. Start out how you would normally jump rope, using two feet.  Begin alternating feet, running in place while jumping.  Move forward while jumping. Once you get the rhythm, start running around the track while still using the jump rope. The jump rope helps rein in your stride.  Another way to shorten your stride is to count your steps in a minute, and then try to up that number little by little. That is, maximize your oxygen intake by using your nose and mouth to inhale and exhale. Your muscles need oxygen to work their best. Take some time to focus on your breathing. As you're running, concentrate on breathing through both your mouth and nose at the same time and blowing air out through both at the same time. If you notice you're only breathing through one or the other, take a moment to focus and correct it. Keep your posture good, and hit the ground with the middle of your foot. Your foot should land below your hip. For good posture, imagine you have a string running up your back that keeps everything upright and straight. Keep your chin up, literally, and focus ahead. Also, try to relax your body, including your shoulders, neck, and jaw. A treadmill forces a pace, which means you must go that fast, which can increase your speed over time. Try going for a particular interval at a slightly faster speed than normal. While running on the treadmill, increase the pace for 1 to 5 minutes, then push it back down. Focus on swinging your arms close to your body, which will also help keep your legs inline. Keeping your legs inline is better technique, which can help your run faster.

Combine facts and answer this: In between Zigadenus and Mutisia , which one is named after José Celestino Mutis?","output":"Mutisia is a genus of plants named after José Celestino Mutis, a Spanish botanist, and physician who was an influential figure in the field of botany during the 18th century. Mutisia is a group of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae, commonly known as the aster, daisy, or sunflower family. There are over 50 different species of Mutisia, mostly found in South America, particularly in the Andes mountain range. José Celestino Mutis was born in 1732 in Cádiz, Spain, and he became an important figure in the botanical exploration of South America. In 1760, he moved to what is now Colombia (then part of the Spanish territory of New Granada) to serve as the personal physician of the Viceroy of New Granada. He spent nearly 40 years in this region, collecting plant specimens and conducting extensive botanical research. In 1783, he was appointed as the head of the Royal Botanical Expedition of the New Kingdom of Granada, where he continued his work until his death in 1808. The genus Mutisia was named in his honor, recognizing his significant contributions to the field of botany. On the other hand, Zigadenus is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae, which is unrelated to the Asteraceae family where Mutisia belongs. Zigadenus consists of a group of plants commonly known as \\"death camas\\" or \\"poison camas\\" due to the toxic alkaloids they contain. The genus name Zigadenus is derived from the Ancient Greek words \\"zygon,\\" which means \\"yoke,\\" and \\"aden,\\" which means \\"gland,\\" referring to the glands on the plant's stamens. Zigadenus species are native to North America, particularly in the Western and Central regions, with a few species found in Eastern parts of the continent. In conclusion, although both Mutisia and Zigadenus are genera of flowering plants, they belong to different plant families and are native to different geographical regions. Mutisia is the genus named after José Celestino Mutis, honoring his extensive work and contributions to the field of botany, particularly in the South American region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Desert plants fall into two sorts according to the way they deal with the problem of surviving drought. There are the drought--avoiders--those which persist  only as seeds, ready to spring up when it rains, to flower quickly and produce another crop of seeds, and to die again. There are also the drought--resisters--those which have evolved various methods for strong water, locating underground water, or reducing their need for water by such devices as shedding their leaves. The drought--resisters are perennials ,they manage to live from one rainy season to another, slowly growing bigger and bigger. Of these, the succulents  is a small but interesting fraction . They may store water in their leaves, in their stems, or in underground containers.    In the American deserts the best--known succulents are the cacti . They come in a wide range of sizes, from 50--foot tall giant saguaros  to tiny round cacti about the size of a thumb--nail. They take thick, cylindrical  or even spherical forms, thereby exposing a minimum of evaporating surface to the air and light. They are leafless, except in youth, and then the leaves are small. Typically their surfaces are spiny, discouraging thirsty animals, and channeled like an accordion , so the fleshy stem may expand quickly when the plant drinks and contract slowly as it uses up the water. The root system is widespread and shallow, with good reason; only about 3 per cent of the rain that falls on the desert penetrates to any significant depth into soil.

To Rand Paul, Legal Immigration Is Also a Concern It’s common to hear a senator express concerns about illegal immigration these days, but Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, is also concerned about legal immigration. “We have 40,000 students coming to this country from all over the world,” he said. “Are they would-be attackers?” Speaking at a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on border patrol corruption, Mr. Paul on Thursday questioned whether the government was adequately screening and then keeping tabs on those who enter the country with student visas or as refugees. He cited the recent arrest of two Iraqi refugees on terrorism charges in his hometown of Bowling Green, Ky.; the men are accused of trying to send weapons and money to Al Qaeda. Mr. Paul said the fingerprints of one of the men had been found on an unused improvised explosive device in Iraq. But while Mr. Paul said he worried about legal immigrants, he was not concerned about the potential threat from American citizens. “We’ve done so many things to think that we’re all terrorists, that universally we have to scrutinize everybody to the Nth degree instead of doing what I just think would be good police work,” Mr. Paul said, adding that it would be less expensive and less intrusive to privacy if the country looked at “the people who did attack us and who continue to attack us, and not really U.S. citizens.” Alan D. Bersin, commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said one million people enter the United States every day, a number that includes immigrants but also American citizens returning from abroad. He cautioned Mr. Paul against dismissing citizens as a potential threat. “If we look at a Faisal Shahzad, who was a U.S. citizen, naturalized, we have to recognize that this risk assessment system can’t just be cut,” Mr. Bersin said. Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani immigrant, was accused of trying to detonate a car bomb in Times Square last year. Mr. Paul said there were factors that should raise a red flag about whether a citizen could pose a threat, including if an American had frequently traveled to Yemen, for example. “It’s not as simple as what your religion is or color your skin is or any of that. It’s more complicated,” he said. “But it’s a whole host of figures that we need to look at.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"U.S. Senator Rand Paul expressed concern not only over illegal immigration, but also legal immigration due to potential security threats.

He cited a recent incident in his hometown of Bowling Green, Kentucky, where two Iraqi refugees were arrested on terrorism charges. While Paul emphasized his worry regarding legal immigrants, he downplayed the threat posed by American citizens, encouraging more focus on those who have directly attacked the U.S. or pose a distinct threat based on suspicious activities. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Alan D. Bersin countered, emphasizing that threats could also come from naturalized citizens. Paul acknowledged the issue's complexity but insisted on the need for a more refined method for identifying potential threats."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: The golf course at the Aurora Country Club cuts their grass to  2 1/2 inches high. The grass at the Augusta Country Club is cut to 4 inches. Sam likes more of a challenge when playing golf but Jack likes to play on turf where the ball rolls easier.  Which Country Club would Jack enjoy playing golf at more, Aurora or Augusta?  Hint: Just as there are good-quality grasses for putting greens, there are good-quality grasses for the fairway and rough. The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to \\"take a divot\\" (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot. Answer:","output":"Jack would enjoy playing golf more at the Aurora Country Club, where the grass is cut to 2 1/2 inches high. This is because the shorter grass height allows for the ball to roll easier, which is what Jack prefers."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Galician.

On a flight to New York for an annual police convention, Chan encounters his old Scotland Yard friend, Hugh Drake. Drake is now a member of military intelligence trying to track down what he believes is a sabotage ring led by a Paul Narvo. A bomber and its pilots crashed the day before. Chan offers his assistance. Chan is welcomed at the airport by New York Police Inspector Vance and, to Chan's surprise, his number two son Jimmy Chan. Chan goes to see Drake the next day at the apartment of George Kirby, where a dinner party is in progress. He finds his friend dead of poison gas in Drake's library, where he had gone to do some work. Drake's briefcase, containing all the information he had gathered about the sabotage ring, is missing. The window is latched, so Chan concludes one of the guests is responsible. Chan discovers that Drake asked that his Oxford classmate Herbert Fenton, actress June Preston and Ralph Percy, chief designer at the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation, be invited to the party. Kirby himself is the company president. The lost bomber crashed at the company's plant. Also present is stockbroker Keith Jeffery. A servant reports chemist David Elliot insisted on seeing Drake, so he showed him in. Chan learns that Preston also spoke with Drake that night, on behalf of a friend, Patricia Shaw.

From the given paragraph, scientists and engineers in the APL Space Department have been making contributions to ocean remote sensing science and technology for over 25 years. Now let's evaluate the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that the contributions have occurred for more than an eighth of a century. An eighth of a century is 100 years divided by 8, which equals 12.5 years. Comparing the given information to the hypothesis, we can see that the given paragraph states that the contributions have happened for more than 25 years (a quarter century), whereas the hypothesis is suggesting that these contributions have happened for more than 12.5 years (1/8 of a century).  Since 25 years is greater than 12.5 years, the hypothesis is true.

Possible answers: [A]. yes; [B]. it is not possible to tell; [C]. no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The second sentence, \\"It was so well made and stitched together,\\" is not conclusively entailed by the first sentence. While the first sentence mentions that \\"it had been slit and they had just sewed it back together\\", this does not necessarily imply that the item was \\"well made and stitched together\\".  Just because an item has been sewed back together doesn't necessarily denote a high quality of craftsmanship. For the second sentence to be entailed by the first, there would need to be more detail supporting the quality of the work done to repair the item. Having a repaired or sewed up slit may suggest an attempt to fix or mend the item, but it doesn't necessarily testify to the overall quality or craftsmanship of the item, which is the main theme of the second sentence. It is then sensible to state that, based on the information present within the first sentence, there is insufficient data to assert that the second sentence would automatically follow.  So, the answer to the question: \\"Is the second sentence entailed by the first sentence\\" would be [B]. it is not possible to tell.

More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering.  Paragraph: A geologist is examining rocks found in neighboring cities. City A recently experienced heavy rainfall for several weeks. Meanwhile, city B hasn't had a single rainy day in the same time span.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city would have had less rock and soil material carried away by the rain? A:","output":"Given the provided information, City B is the city that would have had less rock and soil material carried away by the rain.  As the background information explains, a high volume of rainfall influences the rate of weathering significantly. When it rains heavily, more rainwater passes through the soil, reacting chemically with the particles. This reaction is at its peak at the top layers of the soil, which are in closest contact with the fresh water. Hence, a heavy influx of rain increases the amount of rock undergoing these chemical reactions. Moreover, high rainfall has another weathering effect: it carries material away. This is a process known as erosion. The intensity of rainfall influences the rate of erosion - more intense rainfall will increase water runoff, which in turn, dislodges and carries away soil and rock particles. Consequently, high rainfall exposes new surfaces which further increases the weathering rate by exposing more rock for chemical reactions. Drawing from these concepts, for City A, which has recently experienced heavy rainfall for several weeks, we can infer that it would have a high rate of both chemical weathering and erosion. Hence, greater amounts of rock and soil material would have been exposed to chemical reactions and carried away by the erosive power of rainwater. On the other hand, City B, which hasn't had a single rainy day in the given timeframe, would have a comparatively lower rate of both chemical weathering and erosion. Without rainfall, there's much less water to chemically interact with the rocks, and there's reduced erosion as there is no water runoff to carry away soil and rock particles. Thus, migration of rock and soil material in City B would be considerably less than in City A, indicating that City B would have less rock and soil material carried away by the rain."},{"instruction":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is auto quarter panel Suggested answer: Replacement of a sheet metal quarter panel typically requires it to be cut off the vehicle and a replacement part to be welded (or sometimes bonded) to the Vehicle.

His intention was  to find the mythical land in the Southern Hemisphere. After about eleven months of sailing, in December 1630, he reached Australia, which is indeed in the Southern Hemisphere. Thinking he finally reached the mythical  land, he commenced his return voyage to Europe on June,  1631, He reached Europe in the middle of the following year on July, 1632.  Which place received less direct sunlight when Captain Cook started his voyage to the mythical land in 1630, Europe or Australia?  Hint: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere. A:","output":"When Captain Cook started his voyage to the mythical land in January 1630, Australia received more direct sunlight compared to Europe.

I actually have many goals, but I struggle to see the overall point of accomplishing any of it. Especially seeing as anything I do will be lost in the ink-blots of history. Question: Assuming that shortly following this story the author started a family, which is most likely true of where he/she lives? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","output":"It is not possible to definitively determine where the author lives based on the information provided. However, we can infer certain possibilities based on the context and the author's beliefs and values. The author identifies as Catholic and a libertarian, which may suggest that he/she lives in a country or region with a significant Catholic population and a political environment where libertarian ideas are present. The United States is mentioned as a place where the author sees potential issues with economic freedoms and government encroachment, but the author also expresses a strong preference for staying in the country. Considering these factors, it is likely that the author lives in the United States, potentially in a region or state with higher Catholic concentration (such as the Northeast or Midwest) and libertarian-leaning political attitudes. However, without more specific information, we cannot determine the exact location. The author's struggle with finding a purpose in life is not uncommon, and many people go through periods of questioning their goals and motivations. It's important to recognize that the concept of purpose or meaning in life is highly individualized and can change over time. Personal growth, relationships, spiritual beliefs, and career aspirations can all play a role in shaping our sense of purpose. Given the author's interest in politics and concern for the well-being of others, it's possible that pursuing a political career and working towards positive change in their community or state may provide them with a sense of meaning and direction. Raising a family may also create a sense of purpose by providing the author with opportunities to share their values and experiences with the next generation, while navigating the challenges that such a journey entails. In the end, the author's quest for meaning and purpose may continue to evolve as they pursue their various goals and aspirations, and it's essential to maintain an open and reflective mindset throughout this process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Most people want to work, but it has become more difficult in today's world to find work for everyone. The economy   of the world needs to grow by 4% each year just to keep the old number of jobs for people. Often this is not possible, and so more people are out of work. Some people have no jobs now because new machines can do the work of many people in short time. Also, machines do not ask for more money and longer holiday.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who sighed at the thought of the unhappiness that this failure must cause Saint-Saëns?, using the article: In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing. I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity...., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Who sighed at the thought of the unhappiness that this failure must cause Saint-Saëns?\\" is Hector Berlioz. As one of the judges for the Prix de Rome competition in 1864, Berlioz expressed his regret in having to vote against Camille Saint-Saëns, a great artist who was already well-known. He showed his sympathy and concern about the unhappiness that the competition's failure might bring to Saint-Saëns, as the latter decided to compete despite his established reputation as a soloist and composer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Then she ran to the home of a white woman who had offered to help her. This woman told her how to reach another home where she could hide. Harriet Tubman went from place to place in this way. This was how the Underground Railroad operated. Finally,she went into the northern state of Pennsylvania. During the next ten years,she led an expanded Underground Railroad,and helped 300 slaves escape. Harriet Tubman found another way to fight against slavery during the Civil War. She went into the southern states to spy  for the North. After the Civil War,Harriet Tubman settled in New York State. She gave speeches to raise money for better education for black Americans, worked for women's rights and sought help for older adults who had been slaves. Harriet Tubman died in 1913.By that time, she had been recognized as an American heroine . Question: What can be inferred from the passage?

Answer the following question: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. 'Who's country was Stoltenberg told by someone would be very rich? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Kim - Trump - Moon - not enough information Answer:","output":"Kim"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Their hearts pounding in their chests, the students struggled to conceal their fear, casting anxious glances at one another beneath the safety of their desks. The teacher, Mrs. Johnson, quickly moved to the window and drew the blinds, doing her best to maintain a calm and composed demeanor despite the turmoil that reigned outside. She then stealthily crawled along the floor, checking on each student, offering reassuring words and instructing them to remain as quiet as possible. Outside the classroom, the cries of anguish and the frantic footsteps of the school staff echoed through the hallways, growing steadily louder before fading back into oblivion. Meanwhile, the gunshots seemed to grow increasingly erratic, punctuating the earsplitting wails of the fire alarm like the pounding of an agonizingly slow war drum. Sweat dripped from Mrs. Johnson's furrowed brow as her mind raced to formulate a plan, praying fervently that help would arrive soon. But the relentless ticking of the clock seemed to slow to a crawl, each second stretching into an eternity as they waited, trapped by their unseen assailant.

Though there was no signal available, she received a single notification from the school emergency app. It was a message, urging teachers to keep students calm and engaged amidst the chaos. Hesitantly, she whispered to the students that they should try to keep their minds off the dire situation and suggested they play a quiet game to help ease their anxiety.

We all keep hearing that trains are slow, that they lose money, and that they're dying. But this is far from the truth. In these days of expensive oil, the railways have become highly competitive with motorcars and planes. If you want to carry people or goods from place to place, they are cheaper than planes. And they have much in common with planes. A plane goes in a straight line and so does a railway. What is more, it takes you from the heart of a city into the heart of another. It doesn't leave you as a plane does, miles and miles from the city center. It doesn't hold you up as a car does, in endless traffic jams. And a single train can carry goods which no plane or motorcar could ever do. Far from being dead, the railways are very much alive. Modern railway lines give you a smooth, untroubled journey.

Nelson had much more money than Derrick because","output":"Nelson had much more money than Derrick because he had been financially prudent throughout his life, and had consistently made wise investment choices that allowed his wealth to grow exponentially over time.  In the early years of their friendship, both Nelson and Derrick had been equally financially comfortable. However, as time moved on, their choices led them in different directions. Nelson, who always had a natural inclination towards saving and investing, decided to educate himself about personal finance and money management. As a result of his self-taught knowledge, he strategically planned his financial decisions to maximize his potential earnings. Over the years, Nelson undertook a series of calculated risks and diversified his investments. These included investing in a vibrant mix of stocks, bonds, and real estate, as well as setting up his own successful business venture. He also maintained a disciplined approach towards saving money, regularly setting aside a proportion of his income into an emergency fund, and budgeting his expenses with frugality, while still allowing himself moderate indulgences. Nelson's acumen and perseverance in wealth building led him to accumulate much more money than Derrick, who took a more laid-back approach to his personal finances. Although Derrick earned a decent salary, his inclination for spending meant that his savings were minimal. He often made impulsive and short-sighted decisions, frequently investing in risky ventures without conducting thorough research or seeking expert advice. Misfortune also seemed to find Derrick, as he often found himself a victim of financial scams – despite Nelson's attempts to warn him. Additionally, Derrick struggled with credit card debt and was not diligent in budgeting for the future, resulting in living paycheck to paycheck. He held a minimal interest in learning about personal finance and lacked the patience to gradually grow his wealth. In due time, after years of consistent effort and planning, Nelson accumulated significantly more money than Derrick. It was not merely a result of luck or an accident, but rather the outcome of his determination to take control of his finances and the patient, steady application of financial wisdom. Nelson's success ultimately demonstrates the power of self-education, financial discipline, and the importance of making informed decisions when it comes to money management. It showcases that, with the right mindset and continuous effort, it is possible to overcome financial challenges and grow one’s wealth significantly over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tim has Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, while Nate has the Epstein–Barr virus.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which cousin has a lower chance of  developing Kaposi's sarcoma?  Hint: Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer. Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses that have been used as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years.","output":"To answer the question of which cousin has a lower chance of developing Kaposi's sarcoma, let's first understand the nature of the viruses both cousins have. Tim has Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). KSHV is known to cause Kaposi's sarcoma, which is a type of cancer that develops from the cells lining the blood vessels or lymphatic vessels. KSHV can also cause several lymphoproliferative disorders, including primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). On the other hand, Nate has the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a member of the herpesvirus family. EBV is associated with a number of malignant diseases, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, Kaposi's sarcoma is not one of the malignancies commonly associated with EBV infection. Given the information provided, it is clear that Nate, who has the Epstein-Barr virus, has a lower chance of developing Kaposi's sarcoma as compared to Tim, who has Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Furthermore, it is important to note that viral infections can lead to different health complications. The hint provided offers examples of how various viruses can cause specific diseases or cancers. For instance, hepatitis viruses can lead to liver cancer, human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukemia, and human papillomaviruses can cause cancers of the cervix, skin, anus, and penis. In conclusion, among the two cousins, Nate, with the Epstein-Barr virus infection, has a lower risk of developing Kaposi's sarcoma compared to Tim, who has the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. However, it is crucial for both cousins to manage their infections and maintain regular check-ups with their healthcare providers to monitor any potential complications associated with their respective viral infections."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Mother Night is a very good Vonnegut novel, and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film. The film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. The \\"indie\\" approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big Hollywood studio financing it. These days, I doubt an intelligent novel like Mother Night would ever get the green light from the big Hollywood grindhouses. And normally that is too bad, but not in this case. Mother Night has tight direction and a solid cast. Nick Nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older, still has that \\"everyman\\" persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and great as always. I always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry. I guess making your debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks)with little air time isn't the choicest of roles, even if the TV show becomes a minor phenomenon. Anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, given today's geopolitical realities, the novel's premise may appear dated, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding (I am talking to you, fellow Americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography, history, and lord knows what other subjects!). Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review thought positively of the movie. The reviewer appreciated the indie approach to producing the film, its faithfulness to the original Vonnegut novel, and the tight direction and solid cast.

Let's explore this by analyzing both statements in detail. Premise: In this case, the premise states that UT law students will be responsible for staffing the center and conducting initial interviews with clients to assess their legal problems and determine the potential solutions for those problems. This situation implies that UT law students play a proactive role in both identifying the issues faced by clients and suggesting possible legal support to help them. Hypothesis: The hypothesis presented is that UT law students will interview clients in order to discover their legal issues and explore potential ways of resolving them. This hypothesis appears to be a reformulation of the premise mentioned, emphasizing the process through which clients' problems will be discerned and addressed. Based on the premise provided, the UT law students are said to carry out the initial interviews and assess the legal problems of their clients.

By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity.

In addition to its recent failed attempts at making its Sender ID framework a standard,  #39;Net-wide solution to the problem of spam, Microsoft has also filed over 100 lawsuits against the spammers themselves.","output":"This statement is about Microsoft's anti-spam efforts through the implementation of the Sender ID framework and its legal approach by filing lawsuits against spammers. Let's dive in and explore these two strategies in detail. 1. Sender ID framework: The Sender ID framework is an email authentication technology that Microsoft developed and proposed as a solution to the problem of spam. It aimed to curb spam and phishing attacks by verifying the domain name from which an email was sent, ensuring that it was not spoofed or fraudulent. The framework worked by using a combination of two primary components: the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and the Purported Responsible Address (PRA). The SPF is a text record added to an organization's Domain Name System (DNS) that lists the IP addresses authorized to send emails on behalf of the domain. When a recipient's email server receives an email, it checks the sender's IP address against the domain's SPF record to ensure the sender is legitimate.  The PRA, on the other hand, identifies the email address in the \\"From\\" field of the email and uses this information to cross-check the sender's domain against the domain's SPF record. Despite its potential to mitigate spam, Microsoft faced several challenges when trying to establish the Sender ID framework as a global standard. Some key issues were: a) Compatibility issues: Microsoft's proposed solution was not entirely compatible with older SPF implementations, which created confusion and conflicts. b) Intellectual property rights (IPR) concerns: Critics believed that the inclusion of proprietary technology in an open standard would grant Microsoft undue control, which could potentially lead to patent infringement litigations against those adopting the framework. c) Resistance from the open-source community: The open-source community resented the Sender ID framework for its perceived threats to their IPRs and its reliance on proprietary technology. Due to these hurdles, Microsoft struggled to make the Sender ID framework a widely-accepted solution to combat spam. 2. Legal approach - lawsuits against spammers: In an effort to combat the spam problem from another angle, Microsoft pursued legal action against spammers who violated the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act, which was enacted in the United States in 2003. The act aims to regulate the sending of commercial emails and allows private entities like Microsoft to sue spammers for damages. Microsoft has filed over 100 lawsuits against spammers for violating the CAN-SPAM Act and other related laws. An example of this is the case against Scott Richter, who was once considered one of the world's most prolific spammers. Microsoft won a 7 million settlement from Richter in a lawsuit accusing him of sending millions of spam emails to Hotmail users. These lawsuits not only disrupted spamming operations but also served as a deterrent to others looking to engage in spam-related activities. The legal actions taken by Microsoft demonstrate the company's commitment to protecting users from spam and computer security threats. In conclusion, Microsoft has made serious efforts to address the problem of spam by proposing solutions such as the Sender ID framework and taking aggressive legal action against spammers. Although the Sender ID framework faced significant challenges in becoming a globally accepted standard, Microsoft's lawsuits have been effective in discouraging spammers and bringing attention to the importance of addressing spam issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To clean a laundry basket.","output":"To provide a comparison, it's essential to present both solutions. Since you haven't specified two solutions to compare, I will assume you want a comparison between two popular cleaning methods for a laundry basket: using soap, water, and a sponge or using disinfectant wipes. Method 1: Using soap, water, and a sponge In this cleaning method, you'll need a cleaning solution made of water and mild dishwashing soap. You'll use a sponge or a gentle scrub brush for thorough cleaning. Here is a detailed guide to perform this method: 1. Empty your laundry basket: Remove all the clothes and other items stored in it. 2. Mix the cleaning solution: Fill a sink or basin with warm water and add a few drops of mild dish soap. Mix until bubbles start to form. 3. Soak the sponge: Dip a sponge or gentle scrub brush in the soapy solution, ensuring it is fully saturated. 4. Clean your laundry basket: Scrub all surfaces of your basket, including the interior, exterior, and bottom. Focus on any dirty, stained, or moldy areas, repeating the scrubbing process as needed. 5. Rinse thoroughly: After you've cleaned your laundry basket, rinse the soap by using a hose (if cleaning outdoors) or a wet cloth dipped in clean water. 6. Dry the laundry basket: Allow the basket to air dry completely before using it for storing laundry again. Pat dry with a clean, dry cloth if you want to speed up the drying process. Method 2: Using disinfectant wipes This method involves using commercial disinfectant wipes, which are convenient and portable cleaning tools to eliminate bacteria, germs, and dirt on various surfaces. Here is a step-by-step guide to using disinfectant wipes: 1. Empty your laundry basket: Remove all clothes and other items stored in the basket. 2. Wipe down the surfaces: Using a disinfectant wipe, scrub the entirety of your laundry basket, including the interior, exterior, and bottom. Ensure to cover all areas and use multiple wipes if needed. 3. Let it sit: Follow the directions on the disinfectant wipe packaging for dwell time, which is the time needed to keep the surface wet with disinfectant to effectively kill germs and bacteria. 4. Dry the laundry basket: Allow your basket to air dry completely before using it again for storing laundry. You can also pat it dry using a clean, dry cloth if needed. Comparing these two methods, the better solution for cleaning a laundry basket depends on a variety of factors such as the type of stains, material of the basket, and personal preference.  If you have a plastic or metal basket with easy-to-clean surfaces and want to remove dirt and minor buildup, the disinfectant wipes are more efficient, convenient, and quick to use. However, if your basket is made of cloth or has hard-to-remove stains or mold issues, using soap, water, and a sponge will be more effective in deep cleaning the basket. In conclusion, for a thorough cleaning and sanitization, using the soap, water, and sponge method is generally better, as it provides a deeper clean, is more cost-effective, and can be used on various types of materials without causing damage. On the other hand, disinfectant wipes can be a convenient and quick solution for regular maintenance cleaning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: At least six people were killed when a New York City-bound Amtrak train derailed at a junction bend in northeast Philadelphia on Tuesday night, officials said. \\"Hundreds\\" of passengers were hospitalized, and at least eight of them were reported to be in critical condition at area hospitals, according to authorities at the scene and hospital officials. Not all passengers were accounted for, officials said, including the CEO of a Philadelphia startup, ApprenNet. Rachel Jacobs hasn't been heard from since the crash, the company COO, Emily Foote, said. Five people were reported dead in the hours after the 9:38 p.m. crash, and a sixth person died overnight of a \\"massive chest injury,\\" Herbert Cushing, chief medical officer of Temple University Hospital, said Wednesday morning. At a news conference later Wednesday, Mayor Michael Nutter said the train's \\"black box\\" had been recovered and was being analyzed at an Amtrak operations center in Delaware. The train's conductor was injured in the wreck and was scheduled to give a statement about what happened to the police. Train 188, Amtrak's Northeast Regional service, left Washington, D.C., for a three-and-a-half hour trip and was scheduled to arrive at New York's Penn Station by 10:34 p.m. It was carrying 238 riders and five crew. The front of the train had entered a turn at Frankford Junction, in the working-class Philly neighborhood of Port Richmond, when the cars reportedly started to shake and then came to a sudden stop and derailed, according to reports. The cause of the derailment was not known as of early Wednesday. \\"We felt a jolt. Immediately I could tell the train derailed,\\" passenger Janna D'Ambris told CNN. \\"We were to the right of the rails.\\" Six cars and the engine went off the tracks, a fire official said, and the lead car was nothing more than a mass of mangled metal when it finally came to rest. “The front of the train is really mangled,” passenger and journalist Paul Cheung said. “It’s a complete wreck. The whole thing is like a pile of metal.” Cheung, who works for The Associated Press, was at the back of the train and escaped without harm. “The train started to decelerate, like someone had slammed the brake,” Cheung said. “Then suddenly you could see everything starting to shake. You could see people’s stuff flying over me.” Gaby Rudy, 18, a George Washington University freshman from Livingston, N.J., told The News that she had nodded off prior to the derailment. \\"I was actually sleeping on the train and all of a sudden...I felt it veer off the tracks,” she said. “I was just tumbling and I got thrown to the other side of the train. And the train flipped over almost completely. There was glass everywhere and the doors were shut. And I guess the windows smashed because we climbed out a window.” RELATED: 5 OTHER RECENT CRASHES INVOLVING NEW YORK CITY PASSENGER TRAINS Emergency responders flooded to the scene, which is a four-track section that is not far from the Betsy Ross Bridge spanning the Delaware River. There section of track has a speed limit of 50 mph. In 1943 it was the site of a terrible crash that killed 79 passengers. That too was a Washington-to-New York run on a train that was called The Congressional Limited. It was one of the deadliest train accidents in U.S. history. On Tuesday night, amid the darkness and devastation, eyewitnesses reported scores of bloodied passengers scurrying to get out of overturned cars, jumping out of windows. But many others had to be carried out of the twisted hulk of a train on stretchers. “Most people were able to walk off this train; many were transported (to area hospitals),\\" Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said at a press conference. He added that it was not clear whether all passengers and crew were accounted for. Those who escaped without serious injury realized they were the lucky ones. \\"We're the lucky ones here,\\" a woman at Temple University Hospital told the Daily News after her 29-year-old son, Jake, suffered a fractured rib. The tragedy led to the complete suspension of Amtrak service between New York and Philly. \\"There's no circumstance under which there would be any Amtrak service this week through Philadelphia,\\" Mayor Nutter said Tuesday night, citing the high level of damage. \\"This was an absolute disastrous mess,\\" Nutter added. \\"I have never seen anything like it in my life.\\" By Wednesday morning, 25 people were still receiving treatment at Temple University Hospital, one of several medical centers that received patients in the chaos following the wreck. Most of the injuries were arm, leg and rib fractures. Eight people remain in critical condition, Dr. Herbert Cushing, the hospital's chief medical officer, said. \\"Three went into surgery last night, immediately,\\" he said at a briefing outside the hospital. \\"The patients who were awake and could talk to me were folks that were in the last two cars,\\" Cushing added. Amtrak said the company is \\"deeply saddened by the loss of life\\" and set up a hotline for updates on loved ones: 800-523-9101. But nearly 40 people quickly tweeted at Amtrak complaining about a lack of information from the company. Mayor de Blasio, who was in Washington, D.C., Tuesday, tweeted about the \\"terrible tragedy in Philadelphia tonight.\\" \\"NYC sends thoughts & prayers to the passengers, crew and families of those aboard @Amtrak 188,” he wrote. More than 130 firefighters and 200 police helped passengers from the mangled wreck. Numerous reports indicated 146 people were hospitalized, but initial counts revealed a higher number of people showing up to area hospitals, including dozens of walking wounded. Jefferson University Hospital said it received 26 patients, mostly with minor injuries. Temple University Hospital said it treated at least 36 people. Aria Health said its hospital in Frankford got about 26 patients while 50 were brought to its Torresdale hospital. Hahnemann University Hospital reported 25 injured and Albert Einstein Medical Center said it treated 10 more. The National Transportation Safety Board said it sent a \\"go-team\\" to investigate the Amtrak derailment. And the federal department of transportation has sent officials to help the NTSB investigate, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement.

Pray for those injured,\\" Patrick J. Murphy, a former Congressman from Pennsylvania, tweeted. Yameen Allworld, a Philly-based hip hop producer, was also aboard the train. “Yameen was on that Amtrak train. He's shook up. But he'll be ok. Praying everyone was safe on that crash,” The Roots’ Questlove tweeted. Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) said he exited the train in Wilmington, Del., dodging disaster. “I am grateful to be home safe and sound in Wilmington, and my heart goes out to everyone involved in the crash on @AmtrakNEC #188 tonight,” he tweeted. Jennifer Kim, a violinist for the Washington National Opera, also was reportedly aboard the train. She drew an immediate backlash when she tweeted and then deleted: “@AmtrakNEC @Amtrak thanks a lot for derailing my train. Can I please get my violin back from the 2nd car of train?” Another Amtrak train crashed on Sunday. That train, bound for New Orleans, struck a flatbed truck at a railway crossing in Amite, killing the truck’s driver and injuring two people on the train. In March, at least 55 people were injured when an Amtrak train collided with a tractor-trailer that was stuck on the tracks in North Carolina. Four people were killed in 2013 when a Metro-North engineer dozed off and the Grand Central-bound train took a turn at three times the posted speed, derailing near the Spuyten Duyvil Station in the Bronx. That was one of a spate of wrecks involving trains in or around the New York City area. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE VIDEO HERE.

Context: The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878.

Penniless and in a mad rush to get out of town, the two musicians take a job with Sweet Sue (Joan Shawlee) and her Society Syncopators, an all-female band headed to Miami. Disguised as women and renaming themselves Josephine and Daphne, they board a train with the band and their male manager, Bienstock. Before they board the train, Joe and Jerry notice Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), the band's vocalist and ukulele player. Joe and Jerry become enamored of Sugar and compete for her affection while maintaining their disguises. Sugar confides that she has sworn off male saxophone players, who have stolen her heart in the past and left her with \\"the fuzzy end of the lollipop\\". She has set her sights on finding a sweet, bespectacled millionaire in Florida. During the forbidden drinking and partying on the train, Josephine and Daphne become intimate friends with Sugar, and have to struggle to remember that they are supposed to be girls and cannot make a pass at her. Once in Miami, Joe woos Sugar by assuming a second disguise as a millionaire named Junior, the heir to Shell Oil, while feigning disinterest in Sugar.

L'étude précise, en outre, que l'une des difficultés majeures auxquelles sont confrontés les chercheurs est de combattre la grande capacité des moustiques vecteurs du parasite à s'adapter aux traitements et que les parasites déposés par les moustiques dans l'organisme humain résistent aux médicaments, tandis que les moustiques eux-mêmes développent des résistances aux insecticides. Translate to English","output":"The detailed study further suggests that one of the major challenges faced by researchers is battling the mosquitoes' high adaptability, which carry the malaria parasites, to treatments. These parasites, when deposited by mosquitoes into the human body, are capable of resisting drugs, while the mosquitoes themselves can develop resistance to insecticides. The crux of the issue, according to the study, lies in the resilience and adaptability of both the mosquitoes and the parasites they carry. Mosquitoes, which are the vectors or carriers of the parasites, have demonstrated high abilities to adapt to various treatments aimed at controlling their spread. This ability to evolve and cope with new conditions hastens the development of mosquito populations that are resistant to control efforts. When mosquitoes bite human beings, they deposit these parasites into the human system. Once within the host, the parasites present another major challenge. They are capable of resisting the drugs that are used to treat the infection. Just like the mosquitoes, the parasites have shown the ability to adapt, making it difficult for the drugs to completely clear the parasites from the human body. Meanwhile, the mosquitoes themselves pose another serious challenge. They have exhibited an ability to develop resistance to insecticides which are often applied to control their population and hinder their feeding activity. The chemicals in the insecticides that once killed them are becoming increasingly ineffective. The interplay between the drug-resistant parasites and the insecticide-resistant mosquitoes then creates a complex problem for researchers and public health experts. It's not just about finding drugs that can effectively kill parasites, or developing insecticides that can efficiently control mosquito populations. It's about understanding and combating the adaptive mechanisms of both parasites and mosquitoes, while at the same time developing and implementing control strategies that are sustainable and pose minimal harm to the environment and non-target species. In the view of these challenges, the role of researchers remains crucial. They have to persistently find novel ways to circumvent these resistances and disrupt the life cycle of mosquitoes and parasites. This requires innovation in pharmacological research for new, potent drugs that can treat resistant parasites, as well as in entomology for environmentally-safe insecticides that can effectively control even resistant mosquito populations. While doing this, researchers should also focus on studying the biological and evolutionary processes, especially genetic factors, which enhance the adaptive abilities of the mosquitoes and the parasites. Insights from such studies could offer invaluable pointers to early detection of resistance, and even to the development of strategies that can prevent the development of resistance in the first place.  The study hence underlines a need for a multi-pronged and sustained approach in combating the disease. Taking a singular approach, such as focusing only on developing potent drugs or effective insecticides, won't be holistic and long-lasting. A comprehensive strategy should encompass pharmacological innovations, environmental controls, genetic studies, and public health interventions that will enable health professionals to detect and manage resistance quickly and effectively."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Influenced by papal bulls, Swedish magnates in the 12th century set up crusading expeditions to convert the heathens in the eastern Baltic. This resulted in the establishment of the Catholic Church, the Christian religion and the Swedish conquest of southern Finland in 1249. Turku, or Åbo, became the principal city in Finland and residence of a Bishopric. As a result of Protestant Reformation in the 16th century the Catholic Church had to give way for the Lutheran state church which was established by King Gustav Vasa of Sweden, whose principal reformer in Finland was Mikael Agricola and from 1554 also the Bishop. After the Finnish War in 1809, Finland became a part of the Russian Empire as an autonomous grand duchy. In 1817 the Bishop was created Archbishop and became head of the Church in Finland, which thereupon became the state church of the grand duchy. In 1870, the church was detached from the state as a separate judicial entity.

Background: New Order are an English rock band formed in 1980 by vocalist and guitarist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. New Order were formed in the demise of their previous post-punk band Joy Division, following the suicide of vocalist Ian Curtis. They were joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards later that year. Their integration of post-punk with electronic and dance music made them one of the most critically acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. Context: 1985's Low-Life refined and sometimes mixed the two styles, brandishing \\"The Perfect Kiss\\"--the video for which was filmed by Jonathan Demme--and \\"Sub-culture\\". In February 1986, the soundtrack album to Pretty in Pink featuring \\"Shellshock\\" was released on A&M Records. An instrumental version of \\"Thieves Like Us\\" and the instrumental \\"Elegia\\" appeared in the film but were not on the soundtrack album. Later that summer, New Order headlined a line-up that included the Smiths, the Fall, and A Certain Ratio during the Festival of the Tenth Summer at Manchester's G-Mex.  Brotherhood (1986) divided the two approaches onto separate album sides. The album notably featured \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\" and \\"Angel Dust\\" (of which a remixed instrumental version is available on the UK \\"True Faith\\" CD video single, under the title \\"Evil Dust\\"), a track which marries a synth break beat with Low-Life-era guitar effects. While New Order toured North America with friends Echo & the Bunnymen, the summer of 1987 saw the release of the compilation Substance, which featured the new single \\"True Faith\\". Substance was an important album in collecting the group's 12-inch singles onto CD for the first time and featured new versions of \\"Temptation\\" and \\"Confusion\\"--referred to as \\"Temptation '87\\" and \\"Confusion '87\\". A second disc featured several of the B-sides from the singles on the first disc, as well as additional A-sides \\"Procession\\" and \\"Murder\\". The single, \\"True Faith\\", with its surreal video, became a hit on MTV and the band's first American top 40 hit. The single's B-side, \\"1963\\"--originally planned on being the A-side until the group's label convinced them to release \\"True Faith\\" instead--would later be released as a single in its own right several years later, with two new versions.  In December 1987, the band released a further single, \\"Touched by the Hand of God\\", with a Kathryn Bigelow-directed video parodying glam-metal. The single reached number 20 on the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in the UK Independent Singles chart, but would not appear on an album until the 1994 compilation The Best of New Order.

Here is a news article: Oklahomans had only limited access to safe rooms and shelters during the storm. People who live in Tornado Alley explain why.      Representative Pat Ownbey was hunkered down in a basement of the Oklahoma House of Representatives as the tornado arrived in the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore.      Ownbey had been through a milder episode before. A tornado hit part of his district in 2009, destroying a mobile-home park.      It turned the neighbourhood into \\"a landfill\\", he says.      Afterwards Ownbey tried to get a bill passed that would require mobile-home parks to offer emergency plans to residents.      He also looked into building a shelter for his house - but never got around to it.      \\"It's risk versus cost,\\" says Ownbey. \\"You think it's not going to happen again.\\"      Storm shelter design      Yesterday, though, it did. His wife, daughter, son-in-law and 18-month-old grandson were at his house, a sand-coloured, brick three-bedroom property, in Moore.      As the tornado tore through their neighbourhood, Ownbey watched on television. He was shocked - and forgot that he had once wanted to build a shelter.      \\"At the time I was just praying,\\" he says, talking on a mobile phone in his Jeep Grand Cherokee, a relatively storm-worthy vehicle, as he drives back from Moore.      The tornado missed his house - but killed more than 24 people.      Some may wonder why Ownbey and so many others who live in Tornado Alley, as this part of the country is known, do not build storm shelters.      By his own account, Ownbey embodies many of the reasons for this omission.      He cites both personal and political arguments for living in a house that does not have a place to hide during a storm - and in a state that devotes only limited resources to shelters.      As Ownbey points out, shelters for private homes are expensive - 3,000 to 5,000 (£2,000 to £3,300). At the state level, they cost even more.      He and many others do not believe that the government should invest its money in community storm shelters.      Their views may seem odd to people outside of the region.      Midwesterners are known for their rugged individualism and pioneer spirit.      This hardy streak means that many people in the Midwest are suspicious of outside help - and of government intervention.      They think that people should take care of things on their own.      \\"It's easy to say the government should build shelters for everybody,\\" explains Ownbey. \\"But in the end you can't have the government providing everything to everybody.\\"      \\"There is a risk to life itself.\\"      Setting aside ideological reasons, building a shelter is a hassle. Oklahoma earth can be hard to dig into - much of it is clay.      Still shelters can be built in yards, anchored to a concrete slab. though experts say above-ground ones may not have survived this storm.      As it turns out, however, the city of Moore has no public tornado shelters, as its website makes clear.      \\"There's nowhere you can go,\\" says an official who works for the city's Community Development Department.      There are, however, safe rooms, cellars and places in private homes where people can seek refuge.      \\"There are over 3,000 of them,\\" says the city official, who wishes to remain anonymous. About 55,000 people live in Moore.      As people in Moore discovered after a May 1999 tornado that killed dozens of people, the shelters work.      A researcher said that the units survived - and so did the people hiding inside of them.      Some government money has been provided to people to build safe rooms in Oklahoma over the past several years.      These individuals received support from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) through a programme known as SoonerSafe.      For those who were selected for the scheme, the federal agency paid for 75% of the cost of building a shelter.      A state programme, Operation Safe Room, also provided funds for people in Oklahoma who wanted to build shelters.      Altogether more than 10,000 shelters have been built in Oklahoma with the support of the government, according to a June 2011 article in the Journal Record Legislative Report, an Oklahoma City-based business and legal newspaper.      In other parts of Oklahoma, there are 382 federally funded safe rooms or shelters that are available to the public, according to a Fema spokesperson.      Hundreds of these facilities are located throughout Tornado Ally. Three states, Arkansas, Missouri and Kansas, have more than 150 of the public shelters, and Texas has 49.      Yet those who have seen a tornado do not necessarily invest in a bunker.      \\"It's the afterthought,\\" says Jeremy Davis, the owner of Twister Safe, a Missouri-based firm that builds storm shelters.      There's no safe place inside a mobile home Dirk DeRose, Owner, New Day Tornado Shelters      \\"It's, 'Well, it hit. It probably won't hit again,'\\" says Davis.      \\"But it's the kind of thing that when you need it, you need it.\\"      Still a decision can be made late.      Dirk DeRose, the owner of New Day Tornado Shelters, a company that is based in Tulsa, says that people turned to him yesterday while the storm was brewing.      DeRose, who used to work as an aircraft structural technician, says that he had gotten lost on a gravel road and stopped to ask for directions at a mobile home.      He was outside of Big Cabin, a town that is roughly 50 miles (80km) from Tulsa.      The person in the mobile home saw construction materials in his truck - and asked if he could build a shelter for his family.      DeRose built a safe room in an hour.      \\"There's no safe place inside a mobile home,\\" DeRose says. \\"Now these people have one.\\"      One Israel-based blogger, Laura Rosbrow, says that she cannot understand why people in Oklahoma do not have more publicly-funded shelters.      In Israel, Rosbrow says, bomb shelters are located \\"within blocks of every residence\\".      \\"In Israel, you feel like the country is giving you peace of mind,\\" writes Rosbrow on her blog. \\"Isn't that the way it should be?\\"      In contrast Ownbey believes that the decision to build a shelter should be market driven - and not guided by the government.      Yet he admits that individuals do not always make a prudent choice. Years ago he did not build a shelter. He will now, though.      \\"The second time - I think it's time to put it in,\\" says Ownbey. ||||| Story highlights \\"We're going to help them recover,\\" promises President Obama      At least 24 people were killed; 353 injured in this week's monster tornado      Mayor: Six people previously unaccounted for have been located      With everyone missing now accounted for from this week's deadly tornado, the long and difficult work of recovery can begin.      \\"We are beginning the recovery operations,\\" Oklahoma Gov.

Moore Mayor Glenn Lewis told CNN's Jake Tapper, also Wednesday, that six people previously unaccounted for have been located.      Five were found alive. The sixth is dead, and the body was located at the medical examiner's office. The mayor was not sure whether that death was included in the official count of 24.      He also told CNN that he would push for a law requiring storm shelters or safe rooms in new homes.      \\"What we will do is get the stakeholders here in the city ... and we'll discuss what we think we need to have,\\" he said.      \\"Anybody that lives in any tornado area should have (a storm shelter), but it's just the matter of cost.\\"      Young lives remembered      One of the most heartbreaking scenes in Moore is a pile of wreckage where Plaza Towers Elementary School once stood.      Seven of the 10 children killed in the storm were inside the school when it collapsed.      The children were in a classroom, Moore Fire Chief Gary Bird told CNN on Wednesday. He also said their deaths \\"had nothing to do with flooding, from what I understand.\\" On Tuesday, Lt. Gov. Todd Lamb told CNN the youngsters had drowned in a school basement.      Local resident Adam Baker said he rushed to the school to help in the aftermath. He found some children who had died in a shallow space.      \\"The ones that were deceased had bumps, scrapes, and they probably would have made it if they weren't pinned. It looked like most of them just drowned -- all blue and stuff.\\" Pieces of pipe, metal, desks, 2-by-4s, and other debris were on them, he said.      Officials have not yet released official causes of death.      Kyle Davis, 8, was among the victims.      His family said he loved going with his grandpa to see Monster Trucks and playing soccer.      \\"I am angry to an extent.

Mayor Lewis said the devastation was so catastrophic that city officials rushed to print new street signs to help guide rescuers and residents through the newly mangled and unfamiliar landscape.      President Obama will travel to the area Sunday to witness the damage.      He spoke about the people of Oklahoma, briefly, during a presentation at the White House on Wednesday.      \\"While the road ahead will be long, their country will be with them every single step of the way. That's who we are, and that's how we treat our family and friends and our neighbors wherever they are in the country,\\" he said.      \\"We're going to help them recover.\\"      Insurance claims related to Monday's tornado and storm in metropolitan Oklahoma City are likely to top 2 billion, said Kelly Collins, a representative of the Oklahoma Insurance Department.      Craig Fugate, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, told CNN the agency is in \\"good shape\\" to support the recovery in Oklahoma and in other disaster zones, such as rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey and New York.      \\"We got full allocation last year with the Sandy supplemental funds. We are looking to continue the response here as well as the previous disasters.\\"      But \\"if we have another hurricane, we may need more money,\\" he said Wednesday.      For her part, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano traveled to Moore to thank first responders and show her support.      \\"Our commitment is to be here for the duration -- to work with our federal, state, tribal, local and community partners in the coming days, weeks and months to help you recover and rebuild from this terrible tragedy and emerge even stronger,\\" she said.      Those helping in Moore include police and firefighters from Joplin, Missouri -- a city all too familiar with grief and devastation.      Wednesday marks the second anniversary of a tornado that pulverized Joplin, killing at least 158 people. It was the deadliest single U.S. tornado since federal record-keeping began in 1950.      \\"We remember the amount of assistance that we received following the tornado two years ago, and we want to help others as they helped us,\\" said Joplin City Manager Mark Rohr.      \\"We know too well what their community is facing, and we feel an obligation to serve them as they have served us.\\"      'We just didn't get there fast enough'      Help came from seemingly everywhere the day the tornado struck.      Dustin Ellison ran to the rubble of a convenience store to help get at people trapped in a freezer, which had collapsed.      \\"It was one big pile of rubble. We knew people had went in the freezer, and we knew that there was no way they had come out,\\" he told CNN's Tapper.      \\"We just didn't get there fast enough.\\"      One of the victims Ellison and the others found there was 29-year-old Megan Futrell. Another was her infant son, Case.      \\"She was protecting him,\\" he said.      \\"Your instinct, when you see that is, for me, I ran towards it. There's probably a lot of people that didn't, or that wouldn't, but not around here.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In central Oklahoma, a massive tornado with winds over 200 mph struck the city of Moore, leaving at least 24 people dead, including 10 children, and causing extensive damage to 2,400 homes. In the aftermath of the storm, many questioned why so few homes in Tornado Alley were equipped with storm shelters. Representative Pat Ownbey cited both personal and political reasons behind this issue, stating that many residents in the Midwest are suspicious of government intervention and believe people should be self-sufficient. Furthermore, building a shelter can be costly and difficult due to the hard nature of Oklahoma's clay soil. While there are more than 3,000 safe rooms and shelters for private residences in Moore, the city itself does not have any public tornado shelters. In response to this disaster, Moore's mayor, Glenn Lewis, said he would push for a law requiring storm shelters or safe rooms to be included in new homes, emphasizing the need for people to have a safe place during storms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Many people have taken to social media to complain that executives are being overpaid. And it's not that hard to see why. The High Pay Centre's research suggests the average FTSE 100 chief executive is paid £4.96m a year. According to Tim Bush, from Pensions & Investment Research Consultants (Pirc), that's 180 times more than the average UK employee earns in a year. But how do you decide how much a chief executive deserves or needs to be paid? There is plenty of evidence that the public perception of executive pay is that it is still way above where it should be. Just last month, the  Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) published research that suggested more than half  of UK employees believed high levels of chief executive pay demotivated them at work and was bad for the reputation of UK firms. The most popular justification for high pay has always been the need to pay a competitive rate to get the best in the business. So, most FTSE 100 companies will benchmark the basic salary of their chief executive against the basic pay of other executives within the same industry. But it is not always obvious which companies are directly comparable, which means benchmarking is not a straightforward job. Executives' basic salaries can range between £500,000 and £1.5m. But it is through the top-ups, or long-term incentives and bonuses that company bosses make their real money. Executives in the oil industry tend to be the best paid even compared with bosses in the banking sector, according to Oliver Parry, senior corporate governance adviser at the Institute of Directors (IOD). Tim Bush from Pirc says remuneration committees can be open to a certain amount of manipulation. As long as there is only a handful of people perceived as qualified to do a job, he suggests, it is quite easy to keep salaries elevated. The tendency of remuneration committees to rely heavily on headhunters also helps ensure that many listed companies hire senior executives from a small pool of individuals. The only way to address the problem, according to Pirc, is \\"open advertising\\" of senior roles, something it is very keen to see more of at board level. Another trend is trying to align the interests of directors with the interest of shareholders, which Mr Bush says is \\"superficially compelling but, in detail, isn't\\". The idea is that if you link pay and bonuses to the company's share price, the executive will put his or her shoulder to the wheel. The problem, says Mr Bush, is that directors are taking little, or no, risk, as they aren't investing their own money. More importantly, it often works as a one-way bet, he says. If the share price rises the boss benefits too. But in bad times there is a trend to try to decouple pay and the share price, which Mr Bush suggests is \\"CEOs wanting to have it both ways\\". He says the oil industry has been among the first to develop this \\"fair-weather element\\" to pay. While the oil price was high, he says, executives tended to stay quiet, but now the market has turned and the oil price fallen by two thirds, Mr Bush says there is some evidence of directors wanting to move away from shareholder alignment. Chief executives of publicly-listed companies now face greater scrutiny than ever before. Firms, for example, are now obliged by law to publish a single remuneration figure for their chief executive in their annual reports. \\"What that means is that a shareholder should be able to go to a page in the company's annual report and see how much the CEO gets paid as a basic salary, cash bonus, pension and shares and how much in total that came to,\\" says Mr Parry of the IOD. And shareholders can now vote down the pay packages of chief executives, though this has, by Mr Parry's own admission, been a bit hit and miss up to now, there have been cases where it's had bite. Christopher Bailey, the chief executive of fashion retailer Burberry, found his pay package of £1.1m plus £440,000 cash allowance and shares award worth £15m, became the subject of a shareholder revolt in 2014 - although the shareholder vote was non-binding and his pay package was voted through in the end - with 52% of shareholders voting against Burberry's remuneration policy that year. And in December 2014, oil and gas giant BG Group revised a proposed pay package for its incoming chief executive, Helge Lund, after a shareholder revolt over his £12m upfront shares bonus. Mr Parry thinks institutional shareholders will start to exercise these kinds of powers more on behalf of the people they represent, which is most of us who have a private pension. And he argues the changes that have already been introduced, together with shareholders flexing a bit more muscle, should be sufficient to keep excessive pay in check. For some, this doesn't go far enough. Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at the University of Essex, believes a wider group of people should have a say on pay, not just directors on \\"remuneration committees\\" or shareholders, but others who have a different kind of stake in the company. \\"We know we live in a world where profit matters, but the weight to which we attach profit could be diluted. \\"Get employees and customers to vote on executive remuneration. If they are treating people well, all well and good.\\" Of course, there are alternatives. For US technology entrepreneur Dan Price, it was a simply conversation with one of his employees that convinced him to announce in April 2015 that he was slashing his 1.1m annual salary by 90% to help pay for an increase to the average annual salary of his staff to 70,000. It made international headlines. It won him a great deal of applause from his colleagues and morale is reportedly high. The day a FTSE 100 chief executive follows his example, that will be big news. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the issue of high executive pay, focusing on FTSE 100 CEOs who, on average, are paid £4.96 million a year, 180 times the pay of an average UK employee. There is an ongoing debate about whether executive pay is too high or is deserved due to their high-level responsibilities in managing their companies. The article explores some of the reasons why executive pay is high, one being a competitive market, and how it is determined, such as benchmarking against other companies within the same industry. CEO pay is also linked to company performance, but this has been questioned as CEOs may not actually be investing their own money. The article also highlights recent measures to address high executive pay, such as legally requiring companies to publish CEO remuneration figures in their annual reports and allowing shareholders to vote on pay packages, with some cases leading to shareholder revolts against excessive pay. Some argue that a wider group of people should have a say on executive pay, including employees and customers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: Context: The adipokine chemerin modulates the function of innate immune cells and may link obesity and inflammation, and therefore, a possible relation of chemerin to inflammatory proteins in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) was analysed. As visceral fat contributes to systemic inflammation, chemerin was measured in portal venous (PVS), hepatic venous (HVS) and systemic venous (SVS) blood of patients with liver cirrhosis.', 'Systemic chemerin was determined by ELISA in the serum of normal-weight, overweight and T2D males, in the serum of T2D patients of both sexes, and in PVS, HVS and SVS of patients with liver cirrhosis.', 'Circulating chemerin was similar in T2D and obese individuals but was significantly elevated in both cohorts compared to normal-weight individuals. Chemerin positively correlated with leptin, resistin and C-reactive protein (CRP). In T2D, chemerin was similar in male and female patients and increased in patients with elevated CRP. Chemerin was similar in PVS and SVS, indicating that visceral fat is not a major site of chemerin synthesis. Higher levels of chemerin in HVS demonstrate that chemerin is also released by the liver. Answer: Visceral fat is not a major site of chemerin release, and elevated systemic levels of chemerin in obesity and T2D seem to be associated with inflammation rather than body mass index.

Higher heats might shrink the blanket, or cause synthetic materials like polyester to scorch. If you're drying a down or wool blanket, set the dryer to tumble.  Because it uses no heat, tumble drying takes longer and should only be used if you're worried about damaging a natural fabric. Once again, cotton and synthetics are resilient fabrics, which make them totally dryer-approved (just watch out for high heat on synthetics, as they're prone to burning after a while). Once again, make sure the blanket is distributed evenly in the dryer. Let the blanket lie loosely in the barrel, and try not to bunch it up. Clear out the dryer's lint trap before you begin drying. Fluffy items like bedding tend to shed a lot of lint, which can become a fire hazard as it accumulates. If your blanket is of heavy construction or has been washed and dried many times, it should be okay to let it go through a full drying cycle at low heat. Dry delicate or loosely-woven blankets in short bursts and keep an eye on the blanket's material as it dries. Set the dryer's timer for the desired time, or else monitor the blanket throughout the drying process.  Tumble drying a delicate blanket might take hours. Reset the dryer at the end of a tumble cycle and repeat until the blanket is no longer damp. Overdrying can cause shrinkage or damage. Choose the appropriate time for the blanket you're drying and give it a feel from time to time when machine drying for longer periods. Take the blanket out of the dryer while it is still slightly damp. In most cases, it's preferable to allow blankets to finish air drying—this will help instill a fresh fluffiness in the blanket as the remaining moisture dissipates and spare you the grief of dealing with shrinking, scorching, stretching and static. Smooth the blanket out by hand, then either hang it from a clothesline or drape it over something broad and flat. Let the blanket hang until it's completely dry.  A drying rack or ironing board can be useful for draping a drying blanket if space for a clothesline is unavailable to you. Turn the blanket over periodically to expose both sides to direct air flow.","output":"When drying a blanket in a clothes dryer, it is essential to maintain a heat setting between low and medium to avoid shrinkage or scorching of synthetic materials like polyester. For natural fabrics such as down or wool, opt for tumble drying, which takes longer due to its no-heat process. Cotton and synthetics can generally handle machine drying but be cautious of high heat, especially with synthetic materials as they are prone to burn over time. To ensure an efficient drying process, distribute the blanket evenly in the dryer, avoiding bunching, and clear the lint trap before starting, since lint build-up from fluffy items like bedding can pose a fire hazard. Heavy or frequently washed and dried blankets can typically go through a full drying cycle at low heat, whereas delicate or loosely-woven ones should be dried in short bursts and monitored for any changes in their material. When tumble drying delicate blankets, be prepared for a longer drying time. Once the blanket is no longer damp, remove it from the dryer. Avoid overdrying, as it may cause shrinkage or damage. Air drying the slightly damp blanket can help retain its fluffiness while preventing potential issues such as shrinking, scorching, stretching, and static. Smooth the blanket by hand and either hang it on a clothesline or drape it over a broad surface like a drying rack or ironing board, turning it over periodically to ensure adequate air flow on both sides.

Instead, I would suggest the following steps as a better approach to accomplishing the goal: 1. Clean the area: Gently wash the bug bite with soap and water to remove any bacteria or irritants that might be on the skin's surface. This will help to reduce the risk of infection and can alleviate some of the itchiness. 2. Apply a cold compress: Applying a cold compress or ice pack wrapped in a cloth to the bug bite can help to numb the area and reduce itching. Be sure not to apply ice directly to the skin, and limit the application to 10-20 minutes at a time. 3. Use over-the-counter remedies: Over-the-counter creams or gels containing hydrocortisone, calamine, or antihistamines can help to reduce itchiness and inflammation. Apply as directed on the product label. 4. Avoid scratching: Scratching the bug bite can further irritate the skin, leading to more itchiness and potentially causing an infection. Resist the urge to scratch, and try to keep the area covered if necessary. 5. Home remedies: Baking soda mixed with water to form a paste can also be applied to the bug bite to help soothe itching. Alternatively, a paste made from crushed aspirin and a little water might help to reduce inflammation and itchiness. By following these steps, the itchiness associated with a bug bite can be more effectively managed than by rubbing it with a dry stick or a glue stick."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Rhubarb is a cool-season plant that requires temperatures that drop below 40 °F (4 °C) in order to stimulate growth. The northern states in the US as well as Canada are good places to grow rhubarb. Check your growing zone to find out if you can grow rhubarb in the climate where you live.  Rhubarb grows best in USDA hardiness zones 3-8. This includes much of the northern parts of the Midwest as well as the northeastern regions of the US. Rhubarb wilts during the heat of hot southern summers. If you live in a southern region where it regularly goes above 75 °F (24 °C), it will probably be difficult to grow this plant. Rhubarb is best grown from roots (crowns), not seed, since the seeds take a long time to get established and there's no guarantee they'll ever germinate. Go to your local nursery and buy rhubarb roots or purchase some from an online source.  If you have a friend with a rhubarb plant, you may be able to dig up a crown from the side of their plant to get yours started. Rhubarb should be planted in an area in full sun. Look for a spot that drains well, since rhubarb won't do as well if water sits around its base. To determine whether soil drains well, dig a hole and fill it with water. If the water sits in the hole, the soil there doesn't drain well. If it immediately soaks into the ground, the soil is great for planting rhubarb. You may want to stick a ruler in the hole so that you can measure how quickly it drains. Ideally the water should drain out at a rate of 1-3 inches per hour. If it drains too fast, your plant will dry out; too slow and the roots may rot. Clear out weeds and other plants that may interfere with the rhubarb plants. Till your gardening bed to a depth of several feet and mix in plenty of compost, rotted manure or other organic matter to enrich the soil. This step is essential, since rhubarb needs plenty of nutrients to grow well.   You can also consider  building a raised bed to plant your rhubarb and other vegetables. This way you can control the soil drainage and weed population more easily. Don't treat the area with herbicides or pesticides; rhubarb should only be planted in clean soil.  Don't use chemical fertilizer to treat the soil during the first year of growth; only organic material should be used until the second or third year. Rhubarb plants can grow to become quite large, so it's important to give them plenty of space. Dig the holes in rows. Place the roots in the holes and gently fill them in with compost-rich soil. Water the roots after planting.

If I tell you that Tides occur in water as the moon revolves around Earth, and ask you the question \\"what occurs in water as the moon revolves around Earth?\\", is the correct answer \\"tides\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the correct answer is \\"tides.\\" Tides are the periodic rise and fall of water levels in oceans, seas, and other large bodies of water due to the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon. As the Moon revolves around the Earth, it exerts a gravitational pull on the water, causing a slight bulge in the direction of the Moon. Concurrently, another bulge occurs on the opposite side of Earth, as the planet's own centrifugal force counterbalances the Moon's gravitational pull on the water. Two main types of tides are observed worldwide: diurnal and semi-diurnal. Diurnal tides occur once a day, while semi-diurnal tides occur twice daily – meaning two high tides and two low tides – roughly 12 hours apart. This variation in tidal patterns and frequency is influenced by factors such as the shape of the coastline, depth of the water, and the relative positions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun. In addition to the dominant gravitational force of the Moon on Earth's tides, the Sun also plays a role in influencing the tidal cycle. During the full and new moon phases, the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned, leading to greater gravitational pull and higher-than-average tides called spring tides. Conversely, during the first and third quarter moon phases, the Sun, Earth, and Moon form a right angle, causing lower-than-average tides known as neap tides. Understanding tides is crucial for various human activities such as navigation, fishing, coastal engineering, and environmental conservation. Knowledge of tidal patterns can help ensure safe and efficient maritime travel, maintain sustainable fishery practices, and plan effective coastal infrastructure, as well as help protect vulnerable ecosystems and habitats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Background: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream...  Paragraph: Ben visited two states. Washington state, which had many wildfires year-round, and Oregon, state which had almost no wildfires.

After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out, 2-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings.

Question: Process:  - Water gets into cracks in rocks - The water freezes into ice - The cracks expand - Over time the rocks split - The rocks are now in smaller pieces.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the lung is not expanding happens, how will it affect fewer cracks expand.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The process given is describing the process of freeze-thaw weathering which occurs in rocks. In this process, water gets into the cracks in rocks, and when the temperature drops, the water freezes into ice. Since ice has a larger volume than water, the expansion of ice puts pressure on the surrounding rock, causing the cracks to expand. Over time, as this cycle repeats, the rocks eventually split into smaller pieces. This natural process is important in the breakdown and erosion of rocks, contributing to the formation of soil and other geological features. Now, the perturbation hypothesis suggests a scenario in which the freeze-thaw weathering process would be affected if the expansion of ice (similar to that of the lung) was reduced. First, it's essential to note that the comparison between the lung expansion and the expansion of ice in rocks is not completely fitting, as these are two distinct processes and systems at play. However, we can still evaluate the potential impact of the hypothesis in the context of cracks expanding in rocks for freeze-thaw weathering. If we suppose that the expansion of ice is reduced (fewer cracks expand), the pressure exerted on the surrounding rocks during the freezing phase would also be reduced. This alteration in the process would directly affect the rate and extent of rock disintegration in the following ways: 1. Slower rate of weathering: If the expansion of ice is reduced, the pressure on the surrounding rock would be less significant, leading to a slower rate of crack widening. This means that the rocks would take a longer time to split and break apart due to the freeze-thaw cycle. 2. Smaller fragments: With less expansion and pressure exerted, the cracks in the rocks might not widen to the same extent as in the normal freeze-thaw weathering process. As a result, when the rocks do eventually split, they may not break into as many or as small of pieces as they would under the standard freeze-thaw cycle.  3. Reduced erosion: In the long run, a decrease in the expansion and cracking of rocks would likely lead to a reduction in overall erosion. The fewer rocks breaking down through freeze-thaw weathering would result in less sediment and smaller rock fragments being transported away by natural erosion agents such as water, wind, and gravity. This could potentially impact the formation and layout of soil deposits and other geological features. 4. Ecological impacts: Reduced rock weathering and erosion might also have indirect ecological implications. For example, less eroded rock material might lead to a decrease in the availability of essential minerals for plants and other organisms in the area. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the expansion of ice is reduced, the freeze-thaw weathering process would be negatively affected, with a slower rate of rock disintegration, smaller fragments being produced, reduced erosion, and potential indirect ecological impacts. It's important to remember that the initial comparison between the lung and rock processes is imperfect.

These soldiers wore uniforms and worked hard to keep their country safe and peaceful, just like our superheroes. One day, a group of Pakistani soldiers was going for a walk in a forest. They were doing their job, which means they were looking for any signs of danger or anything bad happening in the area. While they were walking, they were surprised by some people who wanted to do bad things. These people jumped out from behind the trees and attacked the soldiers. This is called an \\"ambush.\\" An ambush means when you surprise someone in a way that they don't see it coming, and it's not a nice thing to do at all. The soldiers fought bravely to stay safe and protect each other, just like we would try to protect our friends if we ever saw them in trouble. But some of the soldiers were hurt really badly because of the surprise, and sadly, a few soldiers lost their lives during that fight. It's important to remember that soldiers are heroes, too, just like our favorite superheroes. They protect us and make sure we can enjoy our lives peacefully. We should always be thankful to them and keep them in our thoughts. In the end, the other soldiers went back home, and everyone was very sad about what happened.

When I saw it a second time in an Australian Cinema class, I realized a second point: communication issues. You see, when a dingo snatched Lindy Chamberlain's (Meryl Streep) baby, she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were grief-stricken but didn't show it. As Seventh Day Adventists, they believed that God willed this to happen, and so they couldn't mourn it. But when people all over Australia saw their lack of sadness, everyone started believing that Lindy did it herself. The point is, the wrong message got communicated to the public, and it turned people against Lindy. Even though this was a pure accident, it still happened. It may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media, regardless of any media outlet's political views. As for the performances, Streep does a very good job with an Australian accent (no surprise there), and Sam Neill is equally great. You will probably get blown away just by what you see here.

ABC News      But the party took a strange turn when a handler wheeled out a caged tiger.      The bizarre choice of entertainment left a sister of one of the students who attends the all-boys Roman Catholic High School aghast.      \\"My mom doesn’t appreciate that she spent 200 for prom and got this type of attraction,\\" the student's sister, Marie-Christine Castellanos, said. \\"Who got down on one knee and proposed to the tiger to go to the prom?      ABC News      \\"He’s nothing more than an object that people used to amuse themselves in exchange for money,\\" she added.      Castellanos, who said her brother is unwilling to come forward for fear of facing reprisals from the school, is worried that the tiger was uncomfortable being put on display as a dance sideshow.      \\"The body language of the tiger showed he is not happy with the situation,\\" the sister, a 19-year-old college student, said. \\"He is stressed. The tiger is pacing up and down.\\"      ABC News      The tiger was part of an ensemble of animals that were captured on video. The footage showed the tiger, birds, a lemur, two macaws and an African fennec fox taking center stage at the event.      Afterward, the school stated that the wildlife was overseen the whole time by a Florida-licensed facility.      The school also released a statement to ABC station Local 10 defending the wild animal entertainment.      \\"The tiger, which was displayed for a few minutes in a cage, was never harmed or in danger, was not forced to perform, was always accompanied by his handlers, and for the great majority of the time, was laying down in a relaxed state, facing away from the audience,\\" it read.      But Castellanos believes the animals didn't have to part of the prom experience.      \\"They're teaching these kids there's some satisfaction through the suffering of others,\\" she said. \\"The saddest part of it all is teaching the children that there is no merit to the life of that animal -- that that animal doesn't deserve any better.\\" ||||| At least 25 people have applied for a vacancy on the Miami Beach City Commission, which will be filled on Jan. 23 when commissioners appoint a resident to serve out the rest of Kristen Rosen Gonzalez’s term. ||||| Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter      MIAMI (CBSMiami) – Things got a little wild at one high school prom and some students, and their parents, are not very happy about it.      Christopher Columbus High’s big night at the Double Tree Hilton Miami Airport Convention Center on Friday had a jungle theme.      Staff and student organizers spruced up the room with jungle themed decorations and made arrangements for several animals to be brought in. Among them was a tiger in a cage.      This angered some who said it was animal abuse for the sake of entertainment.      Student Marie Christine Castellanos’ brother attended the prom.      “My reaction was who got down on one knee and invited this tiger the prom,” she said.      Castellanos posted on her Facebook page “How shameful for Christopher Columbus High school …showing its students on prom night who is the “king of the jungle “ this poor tiger was used as an EXOTIC amusement for the mindless teenagers who were present.”      Castellanos and her family are long time animal rights activists who say this act was abuse. They said the fire juggler act which brought out the tiger was in poor taste.      “Tigers are wild animals. They don’t need to be displayed as objects for our amusement. They don’t like the fire, the cages, the music, the teenagers with the cameras, they didn’t ask for that, they don’t have voices,” she told CBS4’s Joan Murray.      Castellanos faults the school staff who arranged for the animals to be brought in.      Christopher Columbus High put out a statement addressing the situation. It read in part:      “…several animals were displayed in a very controlled situation, including a Lemur, two Macaws, an African Fennec Fox, and a Tiger. Two Miami-Dade Police officers were present the entire time. The animals were provided by facilities that are licensed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The tiger, which was displayed for a few minutes in a cage was never harmed or in danger, was not forced to perform, was always accompanied by his handlers, and for the great majority of the time was lying down in a relaxed state facing away from the audience.”      The school said the hotel approved the tiger appearance. |||||Summary:","output":"A prom night for teenagers in Miami had a surprise guest - a fully grown tiger.

What is the nomination process for the Nobel Peace Prize? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"I will answer each question separately in order to provide accurate and comprehensive information. 1. Why did Doctors Without Borders win the Nobel Peace Prize? Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999. The organization was awarded this prestigious honor in recognition of its humanitarian efforts in providing medical assistance to people affected by armed conflicts, epidemics, and natural disasters. MSF was praised for their independence, impartiality, and neutrality, which allowed them to offer aid to needy populations regardless of political or geographical boundaries. 2. What is the nomination process for the Nobel Peace Prize? The nomination process for the Nobel Peace Prize involves the following steps: Step 1: Invitation to nominate – The Nobel Committee sends out an invitation to eligible people and organizations, such as members of international courts, governments, academics, and previous winners, to submit their nominations by February 1st each year. Step 2: Submission of nominations – The qualified nominators propose their candidates with a detailed explanation justifying their nomination, which must be received by the Nobel Committee before the deadline. Step 3: Shortlisting – The Nobel Committee's permanent secretary reviews all the nominations and prepares a shortlist of the most promising nominees based on the criteria defined by Alfred Nobel's will. Step 4: Expert assessment – For each shortlisted candidate, the Nobel Committee requests assessments from experts in various fields (political, historical, etc.) to evaluate the candidates' contributions and suitability for the prize. Step 5: Choosing the winner – The Nobel Committee reviews the expert assessments and decides on the laureate(s) through a majority vote. The decision is typically made in October. Step 6: Announcement – The Nobel Peace Prize winner(s) are announced by the Nobel Committee soon after the decision is made, and the prizes are awarded at a ceremony on December 10th, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? No, these questions do not have the same meaning. The first question pertains to the reasons that Doctors Without Borders won the Nobel Peace Prize, while the second question is about the nomination process for the Nobel Peace Prize itself. The first question focuses on a specific organization and its accomplishments, whereas the second question concerns the general procedure for selecting and honoring laureates for their contributions to peace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. OPTIONS: (1). not enough information. (2). Let the new people handle it. (3). Hire a cleaning person. (4). Demolish it. Given those answer options, answer the question: Moving can either be out of necessity or an act of desire. Whatever the case, moving rarely comes at a convenient time and involves so many variables that it is difficult to exhale until all of the documents are signed. Even then, that point in the process instantaneously starts a whole new chapter in the book of moving. No matter how long it takes to sell (or not sell) your previous home, whether you’re able to find your dream kitchen or settle for less, if you’re moving down the street, across the country, or around the world, the act of moving can be completely overwhelming. Long story short: Moving is a process. In the midst of all the uncertainties, there are a few ways to stay organized while moving. This short list is meant to guide you through steps to keep you on track during a stressful time. The largest piece of advice I can give you is to start by decluttering your current living space. Having less to deal with will help you feel more in control of the situation. Finding a realtor that you trust and feel comfortable working with will put your mind at ease (most of the time) about the process of listing your house and finding a buyer. Let your realtor do the work for you so you can concentrate on keeping your home “show ready” and begin to look at options on the other side of the move, like where you’ll be working, spending your time, and researching schools or neighborhoods. Make a list of people you’ll need to update contact information with once you leave. This should include any and all businesses you frequent or subscribe to, like pest control services, lawn maintenance, even all of your neighborhood loyal buyer programs you participate in. Do not overlook your banks, investment companies, retirement funds, healthcare providers for you and your family members, and even you pets. And, of course, family and friends. Question: What is probably necessary to get your house in the best shape === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"(3). Hire a cleaning person. Moving is indeed a complex and overwhelming process with many variables to consider. To get your house in the best shape possible, it would be wise to hire a cleaning person, as outlined in option 3. By doing so, you can dedicate your time and energy to other aspects of the moving process, such as organizing, packing, and planning for your new home. A professional cleaning person or service will take the burden of deep-cleaning your house off your shoulders. They can ensure that your home is spotless and inviting for potential buyers, which can positively impact the sale of your property. Additionally, a clean and well-presented house may help you fetch a better price when it's time to close the deal. However, hiring a cleaning person should not be the only step you take in getting your house in the best shape. Other necessary actions include decluttering, making any necessary repairs or improvements, and staging the property in a manner that showcases its best features. By following these tips, you can keep the process of moving well-organized, attract potential buyers, and secure the best possible deal for your home."},{"instruction":"Given the question: To protect you and your fellow passengers, the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) is required by law to check all checked baggage.

Big Brother has always been a good eater, open to trying just about anything we put in front of him. However, discovering that he actually does have some control over what he does, he’s lately turned up his nose on occasion. Little Brother is exactly like me when I was young. He turns his nose up at just about anything. Although he did just spend a week with his grandparents and decided he would eat and make up for lost meals…and make me out to be a liar! Anyway, I keep reminding myself as I find myself challenged at mealtimes, that soon enough, they’ll be eating us out of house and home.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What defining institution of the Greek world was rejected by those who promoted atomism an an asceticism based on freedom from pain, as well as by those who rejected all material possessions and social conventions? Context: The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron, who had studied in the lyceum; the Spartan king Cleomenes III who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II who was also a well known Stoic. This can also be said of the Roman upper classes, were Stoicism was dominant, as seen in the Meditations of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the works of Cicero. Answer:","output":"The defining institution of the Greek world that was rejected by those who promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain, as well as by those who rejected all material possessions and social conventions, is the polis itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rick Perry: Washington a culture of intimidation, over|regulation This is a rush transcript from \\"Your World,\\" June 10, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: You ever wonder, would all of these problems that are just getting bigger and bigger happen if the government weren't getting bigger and bigger? My next guess says not a chance, that there is a connection between then size of government and the abuse of government. To Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry. Governor, there might be something to what you say, because the bigger government gets, the more problems we beget. What's going on here? GOV. RICK PERRY, R-TEXAS: Well, very true. As a matter of fact, back during the presidential campaign, we talked about doing away with some of those agencies of government and Homeland Security, the size of that. We have always seen the possibility of an out- of-control government. And now we're seeing it's not just a possibility. It's not just a probability. It's reality. CAVUTO: Governor, I just wonder. Under the guise of the Patriot Act and keeping us safe, do you think a lot of institutions, as far-flung as the Justice Department to the IRS to even Health and Human Services can make a case for invading our privacies and that it's for our own good? I will suggest to you that there's a balance, and that is what has been lost all too often in government. One of the reasons I think it is important to restrict the size of government -- as a matter of fact, the reason I truly believe that we need a part-time Congress is because when they're not there all the time, they're not sitting around dreaming up new things to do to us, or for us, in their opinion. So, the key is, once you fund that government that can be there 24/7, 365 days out of the year, you get that type of intrusion into your lives. And that's the reason why states like Texas -- our legislature only meets for 140 days every other year. I will suggest to you we keep the legislature out of town, we keep government agencies restrict in their size, their efforts, and Texans live with more freedom than might near any other state. CAVUTO: You know, Governor, I do want to get to the jobs growth and everything else that your state has experienced, but one last question regarding this intrusion trend. When I had Mitt Romney here on Friday, I asked him if he were president at the time of the Boston attacks in April, which apparently was the trigger point for getting all of these Verizon phone records, would he have advocated that? Would he have called for that? And he demurred, but the gist was that that was why all of this happened and that we respond to terror incidents by trying to get as much data as we can to see how large the terror threat is. If you were president at that time, Governor, would you have done the same thing? PERRY: Neil, this has been going on a lot longer than the Boston event. You go back and look and see what happened at the IRS. PERRY: This is a culture. This is a culture of intimidation. This is a culture of trying to put the squeeze on people that you don't agree with. And I think the idea that, somehow, no, this is all about terrorism is a red herring. I think this is an administration that has a mentality of, you go get any information you want from anybody at any time, and then we will figure out if we want to use it or not. CAVUTO: Yes, it does worry me that that is sitting on some bureaucrat's desk just always at the ready. But you might have a very good point there. Governor, on to this less-is-more argument as far as politics are concerned, legislatures meeting and maybe not meeting as in the case of Texas as often. Whatever it is you're doing, and whatever it is that legislature is doing or not doing, a lot of jobs are being drawn to your state, maybe because of this little interference, few regulations, no taxes. And that is and has been your pitch as you continue to travel the country to woo still more jobs to that neck of the country, your neck of the country. Where does that stand right now? PERRY: Well, we're going to be headed to Connecticut and New York over the course of this coming week to take that message that there is still a land of freedom and opportunity. It's called Texas. If you're tired about overtaxation, over-regulation, overlitigation, then come on down and enjoy freedom, freedom from legislators and governments that want to take more of your money and use it for whatever they think is the best idea, rather than leaving it in your hands and letting you decide how the best use of that money would be, whether to grow your business or to hire more people or what have you. It is a model that has worked well for the last decade. Over the last 10 years, over 30 percent of all the new private sector jobs created in America were in the state of Texas. It wasn't by accident. It happened because thoughtful tax regulatory and legal policies have been put into place, along with a commitment to a skilled work force. PERRY: Businesses are leaving those high-tax, high-regulation, high- litigation states to come to Texas. CAVUTO: Governor, good luck on your tour. Stop by here when you're up in this neck of the woods. PERRY: We will see you. So long. CAVUTO: Governor Rick Perry of Texas. Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC.

Given the question: Process: - A mold spore floats through the air - The spore lands on a piece of bread - The spore grows hyphae into the bread - The mold forms a colony - Sporangiophores grow upward - The mold sends out spores.  Question: suppose you are more careful of good hygine happens, how will it affect more mold spores land on bread.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"Less effect. Practicing good hygiene greatly influences the likelihood of mold spores landing on bread and other food items. By being more careful and maintaining a cleaner environment, you can significantly reduce the chances of mold spores coming into contact with food items such as bread. The supposed perturbation of increased hygiene will have a lessened effect on the second outcome mentioned: the mold spore landing on a piece of bread. Good hygiene involves regularly cleaning surfaces, proper food storage, and maintaining a dry and well-ventilated environment that discourages mold growth. Here are some specific ways in which good hygiene practices can help reduce the chances of mold spores landing on bread: 1. Regularly cleaning surfaces: Wiping down countertops, tables, and other surfaces where bread and other food items are placed can help remove potential mold spores in the environment. This simple cleaning act can greatly reduce the chances of mold spores landing on food items. 2. Proper food storage: Storing bread and other perishable items in sealed containers or bags can significantly lower the risk of mold spores reaching the food. This also helps maintain the freshness and extends the shelf life of food items. 3. Reducing humidity: Mold thrives in humid environments. By maintaining a relative humidity level below 60%, you can inhibit mold growth and decrease the chances of mold spores becoming airborne and landing on surfaces or food items. 4. Ensuring proper ventilation: Replace old HVAC filters and make sure your space is adequately ventilated, as stale and stagnant air can contribute to mold growth. Properly ventilating the area can help to keep mold spores from becoming airborne and increase the chances of them landing in other locations. 5. Discarding moldy food items promptly: If you happen to find moldy bread or other moldy food items, quickly discard them to prevent the mold spores from spreading throughout the area. In summary, increasing hygiene practices will result in a lessened effect on the instance of mold spores landing on bread. By implementing proper cleaning habits, food storage, and maintaining adequate environmental conditions, the probability of mold growth can be significantly decreased, and the potential perturbation minimized. This contributes to a cleaner, healthier, and safer environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A.  Which would be lighter, item A or item B?  Hint: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to  0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... A:","output":"Considering the information provided, it is essential to note that Item A represents the Earth, which has various layers and components with varying densities and compositions. On the other hand, Item B represents a surface rock sample, which has a typical specific gravity of 2.7–3.3.  Given that the Earth's mean specific gravity is 5.515, which is higher than the specific gravity of rocks on the surface, we can conclude that the Earth's deeper material is denser than the surface material. Although the Earth has different layers with varying densities, the overall density of the Earth is higher due to the presence of the core, which is composed of an iron alloy and other minerals. Thus, it can be inferred that Item A (the Earth) would be denser and heavier than Item B (a surface rock sample). Remember, the question is asking about weight, which is dependent on mass and gravity. Since Earth (Item A) has a significantly higher overall density than a surface rock (Item B), it follows that the Earth would also have a much greater mass. The effect of gravity on the larger mass of the Earth would result in a much heavier weight for the Earth compared to a single surface rock sample. Therefore, Item A (the Earth) is heavier than Item B (a surface rock sample)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians.  - A decree is a rule of law usually issued by a head of state (such as the president of a republic or a monarch), according to certain procedures (usually established in a constitution). It has the force of law. The particular term used for this concept may vary from country to country. The \\"executive orders\\" made by the President of the United States, for example, are decrees (although a decree is not exactly an order). In non-legal English usage, however, the term refers to any authoritarian decision.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Lille  is a city in northern France, in French Flanders. On the Deûle River, near France's border with Belgium, it is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region and the prefecture of the Nord department.  - Northern Italy is a cultural and geographical region, without any administrative purpose, used to indicate the northern part of the Italian state, also informally referred as \\"Il Nord\\", \\"Settentrione\\" or \\"Alta Italia\\". It consists of 8 regions in northern Italy: Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. According to the 2011 census, its population was 27,213,372.

The historical importance of Roman law is reflected by the continued use of Latin legal terminology in many legal systems influenced by it.  - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\".  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia.

The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences.  - Bologna (;  ) is the largest city (and the capital) of the Emilia-Romagna Region in Northern Italy. It is the seventh most populous city in Italy, located in the heart of a metropolitan area (officially recognized by the Italian government as a \\"città metropolitana\\") of about one million.  - Franciscus Accursius (12251293) was an Italian lawyer, the son of the celebrated jurist and glossator Accursius. The two are often confused.   - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.  - Bordeaux (Gascon Occitan: \\"\\") is a port city on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in southwestern France.  - Ancient Rome was an Italic civilization that began on the Italian Peninsula as early as the 8th century BC. Located along the Mediterranean Sea and centered on the city of Rome, it expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population) and covering 5.0 million square kilometers at its height in AD 117.  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - Jurisdiction (from the Latin \\"ius, \\" meaning \\"law\\" and \\"\\" meaning \\"to speak\\") is the practical authority granted to a legal body to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility, e.g., Michigan tax law. In the federations like USA, areas of jurisdiction apply to local, state, and federal levels; e.g. the court has jurisdiction to apply federal law.  - Odofredus ( died 3 December 1265 ) was an Italian jurist . He was born in Ostia and moved to Bologna in which studied law under Jacobus Balduinus and Franciscus Accursius . After having practised as an advocate both in Italy and France , he became a law professor at Bologna in 1228 . The commentaries on Roman law attributed to him are valuable as showing the growth of the study of law in Italy , and for their biographical details of the jurists of the 12th and 13th centuries . Odofredus died at Bologna in 1265 . Odofredus is famous for the personal remarks with which he sprinkled his teaching , often introduced by Or signori , \`\` Listen , gentlemen '' . Perhaps his most famous saying is : \`\` Everybody wants to know , but nobody wants to know the price of knowledge '' . Under his name appeared the following works , which had already been printed in the late fifteenth century : Lecturae in Codicem ( Lyons , 1480 ) Lecturae in Digestum Vetus ( Paris , 1504 ) Summa de libellis formandis ( Strassburg , 1510 ) Lecturae in Tres Libros ( Venice , 1514 ) Lecturae in Digestum Novum ( Lyons , 1552 )  - Accursius (in Italian Accursio, Accorso or also Accorso di Bagnolo; c. 11821263) was a Roman jurist. He is notable for his organization of the glosses, the medieval comments on Justinian's codification of Roman law, the \\"Corpus Juris Civilis\\". He was not proficient in the classics, but he was called \\"the Idol of the Jurisconsults\\".  - Politics (from Greek: Politiká: P\\"olitika\\", definition \\"affairs of the cities\\") is the process of making decisions applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance  organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.  - Nice (; Niçard , classical norm, or \\"\\", nonstandard,  ) is the fifth most populous city in France and the capital of the Alpes-Maritimes \\"département\\". The urban area of Nice extends beyond the administrative city limits, with a population of about 1 million on an area of . Located in the French Riviera, on the south east coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea, at the foot of the Alps, Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast and the second-largest city in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region after Marseille. Nice is about 13 kilometres (8 miles) from the principality of Monaco, and its airport is a gateway to the principality as well.  - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the  Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.  The largest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany, with a population of more than 1,050,000 people. It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about , with an average discharge of about .    What is the relationship between 'odofredus' and 'latin'? The answer to this question is:","output":"Odofredus was an Italian jurist who lived in the 13th century. He studied law under renowned jurists such as Jacobus Balduinus and Franciscus Accursius and became a law professor at Bologna in 1228. He gained fame for his commentaries on Roman law, which was largely written in Latin. Latin was the language used in legal texts and scholarly works during that time, especially in the field of Roman law. As a jurist and a legal scholar, Odofredus used Latin as the primary language to study, teach, and write about law, which establishes the relationship between Odofredus and Latin."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Context: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

Answer:","output":"The British name given to German white wines originally from the Rhine area is \\"Hock\\" or \\"Hock wine.\\" This term dates back several centuries and has its origins in historical events and traditions. To understand the significance and usage of the term \\"Hock\\" in relation to German white wines, particularly those coming from the Rhine region, we need to delve into the history and characteristics of these wines. The Rhine region is one of Germany's most important and oldest wine-producing areas, known for its picturesque beauty, steep vineyard slopes, and the majestic Rhine River. The area, often referred to as the German wine country, stretches along the Rhine River, and its tributaries such as Mosel, Saar, Ruwer, Nahe, Neckar, Main, and others. This region is famous for producing high-quality white wines with several well-regarded sub-regions like Rheingau, Rheinhessen, Pfalz, and Mosel, among others. The term \\"Hock wine\\" has its origins in the 17th century when wines from the Rhine region began to gain popularity in England. The name \\"Hock\\" is derived from \\"Hochheim,\\" a German town in the Rheingau region, famous for its exceptional quality of wines. British importers and consumers began using the term Hock as a shorthand reference for all white wines coming from the Rhine area, regardless of whether they were actually produced in Hochheim or not. The Hock wines, made predominantly from the Riesling grape, are known for their exceptional quality and flavor profiles. These elegant wines are characterized by their fruity, floral, and mineral aromas, balanced acidity, and a range of flavor profiles depending on the terroir and winemaking techniques. Hock wines can be dry (trocken), off-dry (halbtrocken), or sweet, and they are known to age well, acquiring additional complexity and depth over time. Today, the term Hock might not be as commonly used as in previous centuries, but it is still familiar to many wine enthusiasts and experts, particularly in Britain. While modern-day German wine classifications and labeling focus more on geographical appellations, grape varieties, and wine quality designations such as QbA (Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete) and QmP (Qualitätswein mit Prädikat), the term Hock still holds a special place in the history of wine trade and British-German relations. In conclusion, the British name given to German white wines originally from the Rhine area is \\"Hock\\" or \\"Hock wine.\\" This term has historical significance and stems from the town of Hochheim in the Rheingau wine region. Hock wines, primarily made from Riesling grapes, are appreciated for their unique and diverse flavors, and they continue to be a part of the longstanding tradition and history shared between the British and German wine markets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question Why am I in my gown ? Answer:","output":"You are in your gown because you are at a medical facility, presumably a hospital, and are preparing to undergo a medical procedure. In this context, it appears to be related to the gastrointestinal (GI) system, as you mentioned that you are headed to the GI Lab. Hospitals and medical facilities usually follow standardized protocols and precautions to maintain a sterile environment, and wearing a gown is one of those measures. Hospital gowns are specifically designed for the purpose of medical examinations, tests, or procedures. They allow healthcare professionals easy access to the patient's body, which is essential for examinations, preparing for surgery, or connecting monitoring devices without causing discomfort to the patient. As a result, these gowns are made from lightweight materials and often have loose fittings with openings at the back or sides. Additionally, wearing a gown helps maintain hygiene standards by providing a barrier between the patient's clothing and the medical environment. This is important in reducing the chances of infections, both for the patient and the healthcare workers. The hospital gown also alleviates the need for the patient to undress completely, as the gown can be adjusted according to the specific requirements of the procedure being done. In your case, being in a gown signifies that you have followed the necessary hospital guidelines in preparing for your medical procedure at the GI Lab. It also reflects the healthcare facility's intention to maintain a safe and sterile environment during your procedure, ensuring your comfort and well-being throughout the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question 1 refers specifically to Quora, asking if it is possible to earn money on that platform. Quora is a popular question-answer site where users can both ask questions and offer answers to their peers' inquiries. As of 2021, Yes, there is a way to make money on Quora. Quora has a program known as Quora Partner Program. This scheme lets Quora users earn money when the questions they ask on the platform receive answers. Income is generated from the advertisements that show up on the pages of the asked questions. Therefore, the earnings will depend upon the number of views on the question page. The catch, though, is that this program doesn't pay users for answering questions, but rather for asking questions that generate a lot of traffic. Question 2 is more general and could pertain to any platform—not just Quora. The premise of getting paid to answer questions is a model used by more than a few online platforms. Some websites or apps offer compensation for expert advice, answering survey questions, or providing professional services across a variety of fields.

Zimbabwe is also believed to be close to the limit of its storage space . 4. The Wildlife Authority in the country is now keen for the moratorium on the international sale of ivory to end in 2016 so that they can benefit from the stockpiling and recoup the costs of storage . 5. It is therefore sensible to allow its sale in order to recoup these expenses and to do so on a permanent , controlled basis , rather than through one-off schemes such as the 1999 sale to Japan .","output":"Based on the provided pieces of evidence, the claim that can be made is that lifting the moratorium on the international sale of ivory from Zimbabwe's stockpile on a controlled and permanent basis is justifiable and beneficial for the country's financial and storage concerns. To support this claim, the following points can be considered: 1. Financial burden: The evidence suggests that Zimbabwe is facing considerable expenses, costing 13 million annually, to secure its ivory stockpile. These costs can place a significant burden on the country's resources, which could be better allocated to other socioeconomic or environmental initiatives. 2. Degradation of ivory: Since ivory degrades over time, storing it for an extended period without any opportunity to sell it will result in a decrease in its value. Given that Zimbabwe is investing a substantial amount in maintaining its stockpile, the depreciation of these assets may lead to unnecessary financial losses for the country. 3. Limited storage space: Zimbabwe is believed to be nearing the limit of its storage capacity for ivory. If this issue is not addressed, the country may face further complications and additional expenses in finding or constructing new storage facilities. 4. The Wildlife Authority's position: Zimbabwe's Wildlife Authority has expressed its desire to end the moratorium on the international sale of ivory in 2016, which suggests that the country recognizes the potential benefits of selling their stockpile to recoup storage costs and better utilize resources. 5. Controlled and permanent sale vs. one-off schemes: Allowing the sale of Zimbabwe's ivory stockpile could provide the country with the necessary funds to cover storage expenses and generate income for other initiatives. By implementing a permanent and controlled system, Zimbabwe can avoid relying on unpredictable, one-off schemes, such as the 1999 sale to Japan, and establish a more sustainable source of income. In conclusion, the claim advocates for lifting the moratorium on the international sale of Zimbabwe's ivory stockpile and permitting a controlled and permanent sale system. This would alleviate the financial burden caused by storage costs, preserve the ivory's value before it degrades, make better use of limited storage space, and provide a more reliable income source for the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The group confronts Van Gein, who admits to betraying Rachel due to his own personal vendetta stemming from a past conflict. - With this information, the group devises a daring plan to rescue Rachel from the SS headquarters. They manage to free her, thanks in part to the help of a sympathetic SS officer, who has grown disillusioned with the Nazi regime. Epilogue: - With Rachel back, the group continues their work in the resistance, more aware and wary of the potential for betrayal. However, they also recognize the power of friendship and the importance of trust in the face of adversity. - The movie closes with a title card telling the audience that the war eventually ends, but Rachel's group fought courageously against the oppressive regime."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It appears to have been rebuilt in the third quarter of the 18th century and by the time of Lady (Sarah) Salusbury was a three-storeyed villa with a central canted entrance bay rising the full height of the north front. A lower wing, presumably an addition, ran southward from the east end. In 1789 Humphry Repton landscaped roughly  of demesne grounds and William Wilkins supplied drawings for a Gothic seat. In his Red Book Repton commented favourably on the hilltop site and enhanced the view towards London. The house and 23 acres, increased by 1834 to 53 acres, was occupied by Trotter baronets (1804-36), Lady Trotter (1836-40), Lady (Elizabeth) Salusbury (1840-3), and Charles Hambro (1843-9). The house was extended westward and a semicircular bay was added to the south front in the early 19th century. By 1849 the demesne fell to 27 acres and the house, described in 1816 as being commodious yet having no regularity of architectural character and in 1822 as an elegant seat, three-storeyed. It continued as a gentlemans residence under Mrs. Howard (1850-3), Henry Vallence (1853-6), Mrs. Geach (1856-61), John Coverdale (1862-7), and Thomas Brandon (1867-76), and in 1877 was offered for sale with 52 acres. After remaining empty it was leased as a school, to Margaret Clark (1882-98) and Lucy Soulsby (1898-1915). In 1891 the school added a classroom and dormitory block on the east and later a chapel beyond that. The house continued as a school until 1934 when, described as shabby-looking, it was bought by C. W. B. Simmonds, a builder, and was pulled down to make way for Manor Drive. Question about the article:","output":"What significant changes and uses did the moated house, which existed as a manor house since 1538, undergo throughout its history, including its various occupants and architectural modifications, before eventually being purchased by C. W. B. Simmonds in 1934 and demolished for the construction of Manor Drive?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Does the sentence \\"This 164-page monthly magazine is sold separately from the newspaper of record and is Britain's best-selling travel magazine.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What is the name of the travel magazine sold by The Times?\\"","output":"Step 1: Identify the question being asked The question being asked is \\"What is the name of the travel magazine sold by The Times?\\" Step 2: Analyze the given sentence and determine if it contains the relevant information to answer the question. The given sentence is: \\"This 164-page monthly magazine is sold separately from the newspaper of record and is Britain's best-selling travel magazine.\\" Step 3: Identify relevant information in the sentence From the sentence, we can deduce that there is a 164-page monthly magazine that is sold separately from the newspaper of record, and it is Britain's best-selling travel magazine. Step 4: Check whether the relevant information can answer the question While the given sentence does provide information about a travel magazine, it doesn't specifically mention that the magazine is sold by The Times. Additionally, the sentence does not provide the name of the travel magazine, hence it can't directly answer the question. Step 5: Conclusion The sentence does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"What is the name of the travel magazine sold by The Times?\\" as it does not mention the name of the magazine nor it mentions that the magazine is sold by The Times."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: Which simplifies matters very much, murmured the lawyer.  Here is a hypothesis: The lawyer thought matters were much simpler now. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine if the hypothesis is true given the premise, let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Understand the premise The premise states: \\"Which simplifies matters very much, murmured the lawyer.\\" This implies that the lawyer found something that made the matters much simpler, as expressed through his murmuring. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states: \\"The lawyer thought matters were much simpler now.\\" This statement also implies that the lawyer believes the matters are much simpler due to some event or information. Step 3: Compare the premise and the hypothesis Both the premise and the hypothesis suggest that the lawyer found something that made the matters much simpler. The only difference between them is the expression of the lawyer's thoughts - in the premise, it's mentioned that the lawyer murmured, while in the hypothesis, there is no mention of murmuring. Step 4: Evaluate if the premise being true makes the hypothesis true Given the overall similarity between the two statements, it can be concluded that if the premise is true (i.e., the lawyer found something that made the matters much simpler), then the hypothesis is also true (i.e., the lawyer thought matters were now much simpler). In conclusion, if the premise is true, it's highly likely that the hypothesis is also true, as both convey the same general idea that the lawyer found something that made the matters much simpler."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: You are given a new situation: A startup has build a simple spaceship that uses only sunlight for its propulsion. The more sunlight it gets faster it moves. They planned to send the spaceship to three different points, point A, point B, and point C. Point A is near the planet Saturn, point B is near Pluto, and point C is about 69 light-hours away.  and a hint : For comparison,  sunlight on Saturn is slightly brighter than Earth sunlight at the average sunset or sunrise (see daylight for comparison table). Even on Pluto, the sunlight would still be bright enough to almost match the average living room. To see sunlight as dim as full moonlight on Earth, a distance of about 500 AU (~69 light-hours) is needed; there are only a handful of objects in the Solar System known to orbit farther than such a distance, among them 90377 Sedna and (87269) 2000 OO67.  Please answer this question : Would the spaceship move faster or slower at point B than at point C? Answer:","output":"The spaceship would move faster at point B than at point C.  According to the provided hint, the sunlight at Point B (near Pluto) is bright enough to almost match the average living room. In contrast, at Point C (69 light-hours away), the sunlight is as dim as full moonlight on Earth. Since the spaceship relies on sunlight for propulsion and moves faster with more sunlight, it would have better sunlight access and thus move faster at point B compared to point C."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.  and the situation: Jake and Todd used different farming methods to produce their crops. Jake always tills his land, while Todd uses he no-tillage method.  Answer the following question: Which farmer had less residue from the prior year's crops? Answer:","output":"Jake, who tills his land, had less residue from the prior year's crops. Tilling incorporates the residue from the previous year’s crops into the soil, breaking it down and reducing its presence on the surface. On the other hand, Todd, who uses the no-tillage method, leaves the residue on the soil surface, as this method does not involve turning the soil over or breaking up the residue."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Alps: The largest mammal to live in the highest altitudes are the alpine ibex, which have been sighted as high as 3,000 m (9,843 ft). The ibex live in caves and descend to eat the succulent alpine grasses. Classified as antelopes, chamois are smaller than ibex and found throughout the Alps, living above the tree line and are common in the entire alpine range. Areas of the eastern Alps are still home to brown bears. In Switzerland the canton of Bern was named for the bears but the last bear is recorded as having been killed in 1792 above Kleine Scheidegg by three hunters from Grindelwald.
