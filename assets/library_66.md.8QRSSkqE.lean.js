The exact composition of a gas giant can vary, but one possible chemistry that can contribute to a green appearance is the presence of methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3). Methane gas absorbs red light and reflects or scatters green and blue light, giving it a characteristic green tint. This property is also responsible for the green color seen in the atmospheres of gas giants like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. If a rogue gas giant has a significant amount of methane in its atmosphere, it could potentially appear green as well. Ammonia, on the other hand, is colorless and does not directly contribute to the green appearance. However, its presence in the upper atmosphere of a gas giant can interact with sunlight, producing other molecules like ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH), which can contribute to the overall coloration. These compounds can absorb and scatter light in different ways, leading to the green appearance. It's important to note that the exact chemical composition and appearance of a rogue gas giant can depend on various factors, such as its distance from a star, its temperature, and the availability of different chemical elements. Therefore, while methane and ammonia are commonly associated with a green color, other factors may also come into play and result in different colors or appearances."},{"instruction":"Give hex color for it","output":"The hex color for a green gas giant can vary depending on the exact shade of green desired.

Введение Изучение истории медицинской терминографии открывает удивительный калейдоскоп языковых и научных преобразований. В данном обзоре мы обращаемся к пути русской медицинской науки, от её корней в XI в. до зрелости в XIX в., когда язык медицины начал формироваться в окончательный и знакомый нам вид. Пройдя от древних заимствований до стандартизации терминов, русская медицинская терминография не только обогатила словарный запас, но и отразила культурные и научные взаимодействия этих периодов. В этом введении мы устанавливаем рамки для увлекательного изучения формирования словарей медицинских терминов, которые эволюционировали в тесной связи с историей и культурой России.. 1.Истоки и развитие медицинской терминографии в России Культурное наследие любого народа формируется и развивается не в изоляции, а через непрерывное взаимодействие и обогащение за счет обмена с другими культурами. Корни русской терминологической работы уходят в глубокую древность — к наследию древнегреческой, римской и Византийской культур. Источники античной медицинской терминологии отслеживаются на протяжении четырёх тысячелетий до культур древней Вавилонии-Ассирии и Египта. В 2500 году до нашей эры Мес опотамия дала миру первые библиотеки, содержащие клинописные таблицы с записями о медицинских знаниях[ Примечания . 玛格纳[МАГНА]. 医学史(第2版)[История медицины (2-е изд.)]. 刘学礼译[Перевод Лю Сюэли]. 上海[Шанхай]. 2009.(на кит. яз.)]. Рациональная медицина, как понимаем, зародилась в V в. до нашей эры, в период, когда древнегреческая медицина начала своё могущество. Гиппократ и Аристотель своими трудами, а Александрийская библиотека своим обширным корпусом медицинской литературы заложили фундамент для первоначального зарождения медицинской терминологии. В ту эпоху были разработаны энциклопедии, такие как «О медицине» («De Medicina») Цельса, «Девять книг об обучении» («Nine Books of Disciplines») Варрона, «О медицинской материи» («De materia medica») Диоскорида и «Естественная история» («Naturalis Historia») Плиния Старшего. Эти произведения значительно расширили знания в области ботаники и фармакологии. За время препровождение “великого отца медицины” Гиппократа, во II в. нашей эры римлянин К. Гален выдвинулся как создатель обширной системы медицинских и биологических знаний, которая стала краеугольным камнем европейских учений на протяжении всего Средневековья. Он создал многочисленные трактаты на греческом языке и предложил первые подходы к толкованию терминов, которые включают четкое определение и использование каждого специального слова или термина[. ГОРДИЕНКО Е.В. Зарождение медицинской терминографии сквозь призму формирования и развития медицинской терминологии. В кн.: Актуальные проблемы романо-германской филологии и методики преподавания иностранных языков. 2019. ]. Это свидетельствует о зарождении теоретических основ терминографии в то время. С IV по VII в. наступил золотой период византийской энциклопедической медицины, являвшейся прямым продолжением античных греческих и римских традиций. Основываясь на классических работах Гиппократа и Галена, византийские врачи-ученые создавали фундаментальные медицинские справочники, где синтезировали наследие предшественников и современные им практические достижения. Самым значительным из этих трудов считается 72-томное произведение Орибасия «Врачебное собрание» («Collecta medicinalis»), из которого до нас дошло только 27 томов. Орибасий создал еще сокращенную версию своего всеобъемлющего труда под названием «Обозрение» («Synopsis»), состоящую из девяти книг, которая впоследствии стала учебником для студентов медицины. Взаимодействие цивилизаций способствовало обмену и взаимному обогащению медицинских знаний. Начиная с IX в. великий объем медицинских текстов, включая труды Гиппократа и Галена, был транслирован из Византии в миры Ислама и Европы. Многие античные труды, утерянные в Европе, были вновь восстановлены путем перевода с арабского на латинский, что значительно обогатило европейскую науку. Восточная Европа и Россия получили особенно сильное влияние византийской традиции: уже в IX в. славянские земли достигли пика приема византийского культурного влияния. В дальнейшем переводы греческих текстов на славянские языки положили начало формированию русской медицинской терминологии. Таким образом, исторические корни медицинской терминогафии в России ведут свое начало от величественного наследия древнегреческой и византийской культур. Плодотворное взаимовлияние этих культур привело к широкому распространению и обогащению знаний, что способствовало появлению основ для формирования уникальной системы медицинских терминов в России. 2.Начальные этапы медицинской терминографии в России (XI–XV вв.) Инициация исторического пути русской лексикографии уходит своими корнями в XI в., как подчёркивают В. А. Козырев и В. Д. Черняк в исследовании «Вселенная в алфавитном порядке»[. КОЗЫРЕВ В. А., ЧЕРНЯК В.Д. Вселенная в алфавитном порядке. СПб. 2000.]. Появление первых словарных произведений на Руси было продиктовано развитием письменности и потребностью в интерпретации непонятных слов, зафиксированных в древних манускриптах. Глоссы — маргинальные пояснения к тексту на полях рукописей, выполнили функцию предтеч словарей. Эти примитивные формы глоссариев, по мере времени, трансформировались в более структурированные лексикографические своды, обретая форму азбуковников и лексиконов. Период середины XI в. характеризуется интенсификацией переводческой деятельности, которая достигла своего кульминации в эпоху конца XII — начала XIII веков[. 希尔德·德·里德-西蒙斯[Хильды де Риддер-Симонс]. 欧洲大学史. 中世纪大学(第1卷) [История европейских университетов. Средневековые университеты. (Т. 1)]. 张斌贤译[Перевод Чжан Биньсяня]. Баодин. 2008.(на кит. яз.)]. Значение медицинской дисциплины в общественной жизни того времени стимулировало переводы и диффузию медицинского знания[. 高燕[Гао Янь]. 欧洲中世纪大学医学专业化教育研究（11-14世纪）[Исследование профессионального образования в области медицины в университетах Европы в Средневековье (XI-XIV вв.)]. Шицзячжуан, 2022. (на кит. яз.)]. Произведения таких авторитетов древности, как Аристотель, Гиппократ и Гален, вместе с трудами византийских эрудитов, были переведены с латыни и древнегреческого на церковнославянский, что потребовало их глоссирования. Таким образом, в Киевской Руси XI столетия были заложены основы для развития медицинской терминологии. Однако с середины XIII в., в период монголо-татарского ига, русская медицина и связанное с ней терминологическое составление вошли в период застоя. Эта ситуация продолжалась более 200 лет, пока не начался процесс перемен с установлением Московского княжества. 3.Процесс формирования медицинской терминографии в России (XVI–XVII вв.) К концу XVI в. в России сложился уникальный жанр книжной культуры — азбуковники, синтезирующие грамматические и лексические находки средневековья[. КОЗЫРЕВ В. А., ЧЕРНЯК В.Д. Вселенная в алфавитном порядке. СПб. 2000.]. В.В. Виноградов характеризовал их как сочетание словаря непонятных слов с реальной энциклопедией, где, обычно по алфавиту, приводились разнообразные занимательные сведения[. ВИНОГРАДОВ В.В. Русская наука о русском литературном языке. — Ученые записки Московского ун-та. М. 1946. Вып. 106. Т. III. Кн. 1. с. 25.]. Наивысшей точкой в развитии этого жанра стал азбуковник, созданный выдающимся русским писателем и книжником Сергеем Шелониным в XVII в. — в итоге он составил три таких труда. Третий из них представляет собой наиболее объемный древнерусский лексикон с 16110 статьями, охватывающими знания по ботанике, медицине и прочим областям. В словаре нашли отражение статьи о лекарственных растениях, названия которых на разных языках были переведены с применением русских эквивалентов, фонетических транскрипций, и дополнены иллюстрациями для подробного описания их лечебных свойств[. САПОЖНИКОВА О. С. Лицевой Травник Сергея Шелонина: Список с перевода русского врача XVI в. — Вестник Альянс-Архео. 2016(14), с.11- 40.]. В рассматриваемый период медицинская терминология в России активно развивалась под влиянием бурного прогресса медицинских знаний и практик Западной Европы. В 1654 году была основана первая российская Лекарская школа[. ГРИЦАК, Е. Н. Популярная история медицины. М. 2003.], где учебный процесс строился на использовании переводных европейских учебников, среди которых была “Эпитоме” — сокращенная версия знаменитого труда А. Везалия «О строении человеческого тела» («De humani corporis fabrica», 1543), переведенная на русский язык в 1657—1658 годах Евфимием Славинецким, одним из ведущих просветителей своего времени. Для того чтобы помочь врачам и студентам овладеть западноевропейской научной терминологией, Славинецкий также составил «Лексикон греко-славяно-российский», в котором применял только два способа перевода терминов — использование исконных русских эквивалентов и калькирование, минимально прибегая к заимствованиям[. НИКОЛАЕВА Н.Г. Индивидуальное начало в переводческом творчестве Епифания Славинецкого. — Ученые записки Казанского университета. Сер: Гуманитарные науки. 2014. Т. 156, № 5. с. 30–40. ]. Английский доктор М. Ридли заслуживает отдельного внимания благодаря своему значимому вкладу в расширение русской научной терминологии. Ридли пополнил русский язык множеством новшеств в сфере природоведения и медицины, создав три англо-русских и русско-английских словаря, охватывающих около 6000 наименований. Эти издания также включают специализированные разделы, содержащие списки названий животных, растений и заболеваний[. МИРСКИЙ М.Б. Очерки истории медицины в России XVI-XVIII вв. Владикавказ. 1995.]. Итак, к концу XVI столетия в России сложился уникальный жанр книжности — азбуковники, соединившие грамматику и словарный состав, и стали важным шагом в развитии медицинской терминографии. XVII в. ознаменовался переводами европейских медицинских трудов и созданием первой Лекарской школы, что потребовало адаптации и развития специализированной лексики. Эти фундаментальные изменения повлияли на дальнейшее развитие медицинских знаний и практик в XVIII в., стимулировали формирование новых подходов к обучению и практике врачебного искусства в Российской империи. 4.Утверждение медицинской терминографии в России (XVIII–XIX вв.) XVIII столетие было отмечено фундаментальными преобразованиями в сфере русской лексикографии. Ренессанс типографского мастерства в тот период дал мощный импульс к расцвету словарного творчества. В России того времени было издано 277 лексикографических работ[. ВОМПЕРСКИЙ В.П. Словари XVIII в. М. 1986.], которые можно разделить на четыре главные категории: переводные словари (иноязычно-русские и русско-иноязычные), словари иностранных и непонятных слов, толковые словари, а также специальные (терминологические и энциклопедические) словари[. БИРЖАКОВА Е.Э. Русская лексикография XVIII в. СПб. 2010.], среди которых значительное место занимали и словари медицинской направленности. Особого внимания заслуживает «Лексикон треязычный, сиречь речений славенских, еллино-греческих и латинских сокровище» Ф. П. Поликарпова, выпущенный в Москве в 1704 году. Этот словарь состоит из 19712 статей, содержит значительное число названий болезней и лекарственных трав на греческом, латинском и русском языках. Большое число приводимых им синонимов свидетельствует о широком круге использованных литературных медицинских источников. Каждая статья начинается с русского наименования, которое чаще всего представляет собой или русский эквивалент, или описательное обозначение; реже применяются заимствования — и латинизмы[. БЕКИШЕВА Е.В. Новые направления в исследовании медицинской терминологии. — Вестник нижегородского университета им. Лобачевского. 2013. № 4, с. 260-264.]. К завершению XVIII столетия в России появился первый толковый словарь родного языка – «Словарь Российской академии» (1789-1794), который стал весомым вкладом в развитие научной лексикографии в стране. Словарь включал более чем 600 медицинских терминов, в том числе народные общеупотребительные русские наименования, а также заимствованные научные термины греко-латинского происхождения[. Там же.]. Слова сопровождались весьма полными, тщательно сформулированными определениями. Медицинскую часть словаря составляли ведущие русские ученые врачи А.П. Протасов и Н.Я. Озерецковский. В середине XIX столетия В.И. Даль создал фундаментальное произведение – «Толковый словарь живого великорусского языка» (1863-1866). В этом издании представлены термины анатомии и хирургии, наряду с народными выражениями, касающимися лечения, и предлагаются подробные определения к латинской медицинской терминологии. Выдающийся знаток русского слова, Даль был чутким исследователем национального языка, активно интегрировав в словарь традиционную лексику, обогащая ее уникальным медицинским содержанием. Его многолетний труд по праву считается «универсальным феноменом, отражающим эрудицию врача по профессии и интуицию увлеченного лингвиста»[. ПАПШЕВА Г. О., ГОЛУБЦОВА Н. В., МАТВЕЕВА О. Н. Семантические особенности медицинской лексики в «Толковом словаре» В. И. Даля — Вестник СВФУ. 2021. № 3, с. 106–116.я]. Словарь Даля – это зеркало эпохи, эпохи интенсивных поисков и усилий, времени зарождения и оформления медицинской терминологии, в которое удачно сплелись и займы из других языков, и богатство образного народного словесного творчества. Упомянутые выше словарные издания, несмотря на то, что включали медицинскую терминологию, не были специальными медицинскими словарями. Тем не менее, они внесли значительный вклад в стандартизацию и систематизацию медицинских терминов. Первым значительным этапом в развитии русской медицинской терминографии является создание «Анатомико-физиологического словаря» Н. М. Максимовича-Амбодика в 1783 году. Известный своей ролью в медицину, просветительство и переводы, Максимович-Амбодик также стоял у истоков акушерской науки в России, заложив основы для её развития, и сделал важный шаг вперёд в разработке лексикографии. Его труд, представленный в виде трехъязычного переводного словаря с алфавитно-гнездовой структурой, содержал более 6000 статей и имел учебное направление, являясь помощью для обучения будущих врачей, что подчеркивается и в титуле издания – «В пользу российскаго юношества»[. КАСЬЯНЕНКО Н.Е. Из истории русской терминографии XVIII В. : «анатомико-физиологический словарь» 1783 Г. Н. М. Максимовича-амбодика. — Ученые записки Крымского федерального университета имени В. И. Вернадского. Филологические науки. Том 4 (70). № 3, с. 168–186.]. Данное терминологическое издание стало начальным пунктом развития жанра медицинских словарей. Продолжением этого вектора стал выпуск другого труда того же автора «Медико-патологико-хирургического словаря» (1785), в котором были зафиксированы названия болезней и описания их симптоматики, кроме того, в нём упоминались сложные манипуляции, характерные для хирургической практики того времени, такие как перевязки и операции. Доктор медицины А.Н. Никитин существенно повлиял на развитие медицинской терминологии, опубликовав «Врачебный словарь» в 1835 году. Работа Никитина, редактора и активного участника Общества русских врачей в Санкт-Петербурге, содержала около 4000 записей, охватывая разнообразные области медицинских знаний. Словарь включает информацию об основных медицинских дисциплинах и описания инструментов, медикаментов, а также методов лечения и диагностики. Структура большинства статей в словаре подчиняется установленной схеме: вначале представляется латинский медицинский термин, который служит заглавием статьи, затем следуют русские эквиваленты или короткое определение, после чего предоставляется этимологический комментарий. Некоторые статьи словаря дополнены энциклопедической информацией, которая отражает уровень медицинских знаний соответствующего исторического периода. В этом плане «Врачебный словарь» может рассматривать как толково-переводной словарь, сочетающий в себе различные жанры[. КАСЬЯНЕНКО Н.Е. Из истории русской терминографии XIX В.: «Врачебный словарь» А. Н. Никитина. — Вестник ДонНУ. Сер. Д: Филология и психология. 2021. № 1, с. 39–44. ]. По сравнению со словарями Максимовича-Амбодика, эта работа отличается более продуманной структурой и насыщенностью информации в статьях., что свидетельствовали постепенное созревание концепции терминографии в России. Таким образом, в XVIII-XIX вв. русская медицинская лексикография достигла заметного прогресса благодаря реформам в области здравоохранения и развитию медицинского образования. Создание многоязычных и двуязычных словарей отражало потребность в нормализации медицинских терминов и облегчении образовательного процесса. Основные этапы, такие как выпуск «Лексикона треязычного» Поликарпова и «Словаря Российской академии», представляют период систематизации медицинской терминологии и её интеграции с общеупотребительной лексикой. Создание «Анатомико-физиологического словаря» Максимовича-Амбодика и последующие издания специальных словарей отражали качественный скачок в дидактике медицинских наук. «Врачебный словарь» Никитина показал углубление терминологического подхода, сочетая в себе терминологическую точность и энциклопедический формат. Этот период заложил основу для последующего плодотворного развития медицинской науки и лексикографии в России. Заключение Через ретроспективный взгляд на историю развития медицинской терминологии в России, мы можем увидеть, как глубоко взаимосвязаны язык и медицина с культурными и историческими процессами. От древних переводов и первых терминологических трудов до систематизированных научных словарей, этот путь отражает стремление к пониманию человеческого тела и здоровья. Исследование подчеркивает значимость медицинских терминологических словарей в подготовке специалистов и в развитии медицинской науки, демонстрируя важность сохранения и развития научного и культурного наследия для будущего просвещения и прогресса. 我想把这篇文章投稿到Вопросы истории, 请帮我写一封投稿信","output":"Уважаемые редакторы журнала \\"Вопросы истории\\", Ваше издание давно завоевало авторитет среди исследователей как платформа для публикации значимых исследований в области истории.

Here are some effective paid advertising outlets to consider: 1. **Google Ads**: - Search Ads targeting keywords such as \\"laptop lease,\\" \\"rent a laptop,\\" or \\"laptop subscription service.\\" - Google Shopping Ads if you have a specific catalog of laptops available for lease. - Display Ads and Remarketing to keep your offerings top of mind for consumers who have visited your site or shown interest but have not yet converted. 2. **Social Media Advertising**: - **Facebook Ads**: With its extensive targeting options, you can reach potential customers by interests (technology, computing, gadgets), demographics, and behavior. - **Instagram Ads**: Utilize visually appealing ads to showcase the laptops and entice consumers to consider leasing. - **TikTok Ads**: If your target market includes younger audiences, TikTok can be an effective platform to reach them through creative video content. - **Pinterest Ads**: Since Pinterest is often used for planning and researching future purchases, it can be a worthwhile platform to target individuals considering tech products. 3. **YouTube Ads**: - Run video ads before content related to technology, reviews, and tutorials to reach an audience interested in computing and tech. 4. **Affiliate Marketing**: - Partner with tech bloggers, YouTubers, and influencers who can promote your lease service to their audiences. 5. **Email Marketing**: - Design targeted email campaigns with offers for newsletter sign-ups, tech community memberships, or through partnerships with tech media outlets. 6. **Review and Comparison Sites**: - Advertise on sites where consumers go to read reviews about tech products or compare different services before making decisions. 7. **Local Listing Services**: - Services like Google My Business can help you appear in local searches, especially if you offer services to specific neighborhoods, cities, or regions. 8. **Remarketing**: - Using various networks to target users who have expressed interest in laptop leasing or similar services but have not converted. 9. **Programmatic Advertising**: - Utilize DSPs to place your ads on multiple networks targeting audiences interested in technology and personal computing. 10. **Sponsored Content and Native Advertising**: - Create collaborative content with popular tech websites, blogs or forums where your potential customers engage. Creating compelling ad copy, high-quality images or videos of the available laptops, and clear calls to action are crucial across all platforms. Additionally, consider offering introductory promotions or flexible terms that can be attractive to private market consumers to capture interest and promote conversions. Finally, testing and optimizing your campaigns continuously is vital. Analyze which channels and messaging work best, adjust your budgets accordingly, and refine your targeting strategies to improve ROI. Keep in mind that privacy regulations, like GDPR in Europe, must be adhered to when managing your marketing campaigns."},{"instruction":"I have a budget of 1400 euros, where would I put this?","output":"With a budget of €1,400 for marketing a laptop lease service to the private market, it's important to focus on a few high-impact channels rather than spreading the budget too thin. Here's a suggested approach to allocate your budget for the initial campaign: 1. **Google Ads (€600 - €700)** - Allocate a significant portion to Google Ads, as it can capture users who have high intent and are actively searching for laptop leasing services. - Create a tightly themed ad group with relevant keywords like \\"laptop lease,\\" \\"rent laptop,\\" or \\"laptop rental services.\\" - Use targeted ad copy and set up conversion tracking to measure effectiveness. 2. **Facebook and Instagram Ads (€400 - €500)** - Another good portion of your budget should go into social media ads given the highly granular targeting options available. - These platforms allow for both image and video ads, so consider creating visually appealing content that explains your service benefits. - Target audiences who have shown interest in technology, laptops, and related electronics. Also, consider using lookalike audiences to reach similar users to those who have already engaged with your ad or website. 3. **Remarketing (€200)** - Set aside part of your budget to retarget individuals who have visited your website but have not converted. You can do this through both Google Ads and Facebook Ads. - Create ads that remind them of the benefits of leasing a laptop or provide them with an introductory offer. 4. **Content and Influencer Partnerships (€100 - €200)** - Consider allocating a smaller part of your budget to sponsored content or influencer partnerships to create awareness and trust in your service. - Look for micro-influencers or tech bloggers with engaged audiences, where the cost for partnership or sponsored posts might be more in line with your budget. With a modest budget, it's crucial to monitor your campaign's performance closely. Use analytics to understand which ads perform best, in terms of both lead generation and conversion rates, and adjust the budget allocation accordingly. Often, running an initial campaign serves as market research, helping you to refine your strategy and get better results in the follow-up campaigns. Keep in mind that ad costs can vary greatly depending on factors such as targeting specificity, competition for ad space, time of year, and more. Always focus on your specific goals, whether they are brand awareness, lead generation, or direct conversions, and tailor your ad spend to achieve those objectives. Additionally, be ready to pivot your strategy if you find that one channel is outperforming another considerably. Consider this initial campaign an investment not just in direct customer acquisition but also in valuable data gathering for future marketing efforts."},{"instruction":"As a laptop lease company what group would be best to target","output":"Targeting the right group for a laptop lease company depends on the specific services you offer and the market dynamics. Generally, you'll want to focus on market segments that are most likely to be interested in the flexibility, financial benefits, or convenience of leasing laptops. Here are some key target groups to consider: 1. **Students and Educators**: - Many students and educational professionals seek short-term leasing for laptops due to the limited duration of their courses or projects. - Targeting this segment can be highly effective, especially during back-to-school seasons or at the start of university semesters. 2. **Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)**: - These businesses often have limited capital for outright purchases and may prefer leasing to manage cash flow and expenses. - SMEs may also value the ability to upgrade technology without significant upfront investments. 3. **Startups**: - Startups typically require the newest technology but have limited budgets, making them ideal candidates for laptop leasing. - They tend to scale quickly, which means they need flexible solutions for their growing teams. 4. **Remote Workers and Digital Nomads**: - With the rise of remote work, people who move frequently may prefer not to carry a laptop everywhere. - Leasing provides an option for them to get a laptop wherever they are without the commitment of purchase or the hassle of transportation. 5. **Event Organizers and Training Companies**: - These companies often need laptops in bulk for short-term events like conferences, workshops, or training sessions. - Leasing would allow them to have the necessary equipment without needing to store or maintain it year-round. 6. **Freelancers and Consultants**: - These professionals often need high-quality, reliable equipment for varying project durations and may prefer the lower initial cost of leasing. 7. **Gaming and High-Performance Users**: - Users who need high-end laptops for gaming or performance-heavy applications might opt to lease the latest models instead of purchasing them, avoiding obsolescence and reduced performance over time. As for demographics, it's important to consider factors such as income level, tech-savviness, and lifestyle. For example, younger demographics might be more prone to leasing due to differences in ownership attitudes, whereas older demographics might prioritize ownership but still be interested in leasing for the latest tech without a large lump-sum payment. Once you've identified your target group(s), tailor your marketing message, channels, and creatives to their specific needs and preferences. Additionally, consider any legal and financial requirements these groups might have, as they can vary greatly and affect their decision-making process. Conducting market research and testing different target groups can help refine your marketing strategy for the best results."},{"instruction":"I would say we have a consumer and business side in this. For now let's focus on the consumer side. The consumer side would be more catered to college and university students, fresh graduates, freelancers and startups.

For executing these ideas across different marketing channels, here's how you could distribute your efforts: - **Video Marketing**: Invest in high-quality video production for ads that can be used on various platforms. - **Social Media**: Regularly post engaging content that aligns with your humorous and sustainability themes. Paid social ads can extend your reach to targeted audiences. - **Content Marketing**: Publish articles or blogs on your website and share them on social media platforms and through email newsletters. - **Influencer Marketing**: Work with influencers in the college, university, freelance, and startup niches to create relatable content. - **Native Advertising**: Use platforms like Outbrain or Taboola to promote your sustainability-related content on relevant sites. - **Email Campaigns**: Craft targeted email sequences to nurture leads, combining humor with practical advice for aspiring entrepreneurs. Remember to maintain a consistent voice and branding across all touchpoints so consumers can easily recognize and feel connected to your company. Incorporate clear and compelling calls-to-action in your ads, inviting viewers to learn more about your service or take advantage of special promotions. Finally, measure the effectiveness of your strategies by keeping track of engagement metrics, click-through rates, conversion rates, and overall ROI.

Here's an outline of the changes you need to make: 1. Add a condition to check for long presses along with rapid presses. 2. Update the \`next_image\` and \`previous_image\` methods to handle long presses. 3. Introduce a variable to keep track of whether a button press is in progress. 4. Change the \`display_current_image\` method to load the latest image regardless of press duration. 5. Modify the \`display_image\` method to check whether a press is ongoing before loading the image. Let's update the code: \`\`\`python def __init__(self, root): # ... previous code unaltered ... self.is_button_press_in_progress = False # Variable to track if button is pressed # ... rest of the __init__ code ... def manage_button_press(self): self.is_button_press_in_progress = True if hasattr(self, \\"delayed_display_image_timer\\"): self.root.after_cancel(self.delayed_display_image_timer) def release_button_press(self): self.is_button_press_in_progress = False # Schedule the delayed display of the last intended image self.delayed_display_image_timer = self.root.after(100, self.display_current_image) def next_image(self, event=None): self.manage_button_press() # Indicate start of button press if self.image_folder != \\"\\": self.current_image_index = (self.current_image_index + 1) % len(self.image_files) self.display_image() self.timer_interval = self.set_timer_interval # Reset the timer interval def previous_image(self, event=None): self.manage_button_press() # Indicate start of button press if self.image_folder != \\"\\": self.current_image_index = (self.current_image_index - 1) % len(self.image_files) self.display_image() self.timer_interval = self.set_timer_interval # Reset the timer interval # Bind the release of the arrow keys to release_button_press self.root.bind(\\"<KeyRelease-Left>\\", self.release_button_press) self.root.bind(\\"<KeyRelease-Right>\\", self.release_button_press) def display_image(self): if self.is_button_press_in_progress: # Show the text of the image name instead of loading the actual image image_name = self.image_files[self.current_image_index] self.canvas.delete(\\"all\\") # Clear the canvas self.canvas.create_text( self.canvas.winfo_width() // 2, self.canvas.winfo_height() // 2, text=image_name, fill=\\"white\\" ) else: # Load the current image only if no button press is in progress image_path = os.path.join(self.image_folder, self.image_files[self.current_image_index]) threading.Thread(target=self.load_image, args=(image_path,)).start() \`\`\` These changes introduce a variable \`is_button_press_in_progress\` to indicate when a button press is occurring.

The \`release_button_press\` method is called when the arrow keys are released, which triggers loading the most recent image after a short delay. The \`display_image\` method will only load the image if no interaction is happening.

This is because Tkinter event handlers are passed an event object. To fix this, you need to modify the \`release_button_press\` method to accept an event object as a parameter like this: \`\`\`python def release_button_press(self, event=None): self.is_button_press_in_progress = False # Schedule the delayed display of the last intended image self.delayed_display_image_timer = self.root.after(100, self.display_current_image) \`\`\` Make sure your event binding also passes the event parameter: \`\`\`python # Bind the release of the arrow keys to release_button_press self.root.bind(\\"<KeyRelease-Left>\\", self.release_button_press) self.root.bind(\\"<KeyRelease-Right>\\", self.release_button_press) \`\`\` This way, \`release_button_press()\` is properly defined to take an optional \`event\` parameter, which allows Tkinter to call it with the event argument when the key is released."},{"instruction":"can i put the binding in init method?","output":"Yes, you can absolutely put the event bindings for the key releases in the \`__init__\` method of the \`ImageViewer\` class. Typically, all initial setup for widgets, including event bindings, are done in the \`__init__\` method.

The error could happen in various scenarios, such as when you initialize or update \`self.current_image_index\` without ensuring that it stays within the bounds of \`self.image_files\`. This can occur if there are no images in the folder, or if images are deleted while the program is running, among other cases. To ensure that \`self.current_image_index\` is always within the valid range, you should check the length of \`self.image_files\` before trying to access an element with that index. If \`self.image_files\` is empty, the image-loading functions should be bypassed.

Introduce a method to determine if a 'navigate' action should proceed or wait based on rapid or long button presses. 2. Address the issue with the random functionality. 3. Ensure that images are loaded immediately when navigated to via single button presses or via the timer, and only names are displayed when rapid or long presses are detected. Let's implement these changes step by step: # Step 1: Adjust navigation method We need a method that determines if the action of navigating images should display image names or load the actual image. This method should handle both rapid pressing and long pressing: \`\`\`python def should_load_image(self): threshold_rapid_presses = 6 # after how many rapid presses to display the image name threshold_time = 1 # how long to consider presses as \\"rapid\\" in seconds current_time = time.time() self.switch_timestamps.append(current_time) self.switch_timestamps = [t for t in self.switch_timestamps if current_time - t <= threshold_time] # Reset timer interval self.timer_interval = self.set_timer_interval # Check if rapid or long pressing is occurring if len(self.switch_timestamps) > threshold_rapid_presses or self.is_button_press_in_progress: # Schedule the delayed display of the current image self.display_current_image_with_delay() return False return True \`\`\` # Step 2: Fixing random functionality To fix the random functionality, you need to modify how the next image index is selected when the 'Random' option is enabled. However, in the current code you provided, there isn't an explicit method for random image selection, so you would need to implement it in functions like \`next_image\`, \`previous_image\`, or where you handle the image queue. For example, in \`next_image\` and \`previous_image\` functions: \`\`\`python import random def next_image(self, event=None): self.manage_button_press() if self.image_folder != \\"\\" and self.image_files: if self.should_load_image(): if self.random_next_image_var.get(): # Skip random selection if navigating through images too rapidly or holding the button too long self.current_image_index = random.randint(0, len(self.image_files) - 1) else: self.current_image_index = (self.current_image_index + 1) % len(self.image_files) self.display_image() \`\`\` Do the same in \`previous_image\` with appropriate logic for picking the previous image index. # Step 3: Ensuring images are loaded immediately You need to modify the \`display_image\` method to ensure that images are loaded immediately on single button presses or when the timer runs out, and only image names are displayed on rapid or long presses. \`\`\`python def display_image(self): if self.image_folder != \\"\\" and self.image_files: if self.should_load_image(): # We should immediately load the image image_path = os.path.join(self.image_folder, self.image_files[self.current_image_index]) threading.Thread(target=self.load_image, args=(image_path,)).start() else: # Handling rapid browsing or long press by showing only image name image_name = self.image_files[self.current_image_index] self.show_image_name(image_name) def show_image_name(self, name): self.canvas.delete(\\"all\\") self.canvas.create_text( self.canvas.winfo_width() // 2, self.canvas.winfo_height() // 2, text=name, fill=\\"white\\" ) \`\`\` Update \`update_timer\` method to not call \`next_image\`, as it will handle navigation and image loading: \`\`\`python def update_timer(self): seconds_left = int(self.timer_interval / 1000) self.timer_label.config(text=f\\"{seconds_left}\\") self.timer_interval -= 1000 if self.timer_interval < 0: self.timer_interval = self.set_timer_interval # Use the stored set timer interval # Do not call next_image(); instead reset index and display the image if it is the time for a slide change if not self.random_next_image_var.get(): self.current_image_index = (self.current_image_index + 1) % len(self.image_files) else: self.current_image_index = random.randint(0, len(self.image_files) - 1) self.display_image() \`\`\` Using these changes, the behavior should now be as expected: Images are loaded immediately when navigated to with single presses or via the timer, and only image names are shown when button presses are either too rapid or held for too long."},{"instruction":"creare il codice py per gestire un ascensore.Gli attributi della classe sono quelli che ritenete necessari,mentre i mentodi devono permettere di: 1.Chiamare l'ascensore da un qualsiasi piano 2.Salire 3.Scendere 4.Aprire le porte 5.Chiudere le porte/6.Stato.per stato si intende se l'ascensore è libero o occupato,a quale piano si trova nel momento in cui viene invocato il metodo, e se le porte sono aperte o chiuse.

정말? 진심이야? 그런 방법이 있다고?” “당연하지.” 이후, 신재욱은 이택현과의 일대일 연습에 많은 시간을 쏟았다. 하비에르 마스체라노는 약점이 별로 없는 선수였다. 그러니 세계 최고의 수비형 미드필더라는 말을 듣는 것이고. 다만, 상대할 방법이 없는 건 아니었다. 환생 전에 마스체라노를 여러 번 상대해봤던 신재욱은 그 방법을 알고 있었다. 그리고 그 방법들을 이택현에게 알려줬다. 물론 이유 없는 가르침은 아니었다. ‘이택현이 중원에서 마스체라노를 이겨주면 내가 골을 넣기도 편해질 거야.’ 이택현이 하비에르 마스체라노를 이길 수 있다면. 그건 신재욱의 성장에 분명히 도움이 되는 일이었으니까. 그리고 한국과 아르헨티나의 월드컵 8강전이 펼쳐지고 있는 지금. ― 우오오오오! 이택현 선수가 하비에르 마스체라노를 제쳐냈습니다! ― 이건 놀라운데요? 마스체라노 선수는 일대일에서는 웬만해서 뚫리지 않는 선수거든요? 이택현은 하비에르 마스체라노를 일대일에서 이겨냈다. “이게 바로 이택현 님의 폭풍드리블이다!” 연습한 것이 잘 통했다는 것에 잔뜩 신이 난 이택현은 그대로 다리를 휘둘렀다. 슈팅은 아니었다. 아르헨티나 수비수들의 뒷공간으로 침투하는 신재욱을 향한 스루패스였다. 터엉! 패스를 보낸 후. 이택현은 여전히 미소를 지은 채, 혀를 내둘렀다. “재욱이의 저 침투 타이밍은 보고도 못 따라 하겠다니까?” 공은 낮고 빠르게 쏘아졌다. 일반적인 전진 패스보다 훨씬 더 강한 패스였다. 웬만한 공격수들은 받기 힘들다고 투덜댈 정도로 힘이 들어간 패스. 그러나 신재욱은 좋아했다. ‘이래야 수비수들이 중간에 못 끊지.’ 패스가 세면 셀수록 자신에게 연결될 가능성이 늘어나니까. 아무리 강한 패스라도 받을 수 있다는 자신감이 있으니까. ‘좋은 스트라이커라면 어려운 패스도 받을 수 있어야지.’ 지금도 그랬다. 공에 실린 힘은 굉장히 강했지만, 신재욱은 자신감 있게 발을 뻗었다. 타이밍도 정확히 잡아냈다. 툭! 빨랐던 공이 신재욱의 발에 닿자 급격히 힘을 잃었다. 너무나도 얌전하게 다음 동작을 기다렸다. 그리고 신재욱은 그 공을 강하게 때려냈다. 골키퍼가 막을 생각도 하지 못하게끔 구석을 겨냥한 슛이었다. 쒸이이익! 짧은 바람 소리가 들렸다. 매우 짧은 시간이었다. 쏘아진 공은 아르헨티나의 골망을 흔들고 있었고, 신재욱은 골대 안으로 달렸다. 스윽! 골대 안에 있던 공을 들어 올리고 뛰기 시작했다. 경기장 중앙으로. ― 고오오오오오오올! 신재욱 선수가 또 넣었습니다! 이택현 선수의 패스를 받아서 강력한 슈팅을 때려 골을 기록했습니다! 신재욱 선수의 귀중한 골로 스코어는 3 대 1이 됩니다! ― 놀랍습니다! 우리 선수들이 아르헨티나를 상대로 믿기 어려울 정도로 잘 싸워주고 있습니다! 신재욱은 경기장 중앙으로 뛰었고, 그 주변엔 한국 대표팀 선수들이 있었다. 이들은 함께 뛰면서 골에 대한 기쁨을 드러내고 있었다. 특히 이택현은 다른 선수들보다 훨씬 더 기뻐하며 입을 쉬지 않았다. “재욱아! 봤지? 내가 마스체라노 발라버리는 거 봤지? 마스체라노 당황한 표정 봤지? 와! 이건 내가 하고도 소름이었다. 며칠간 했었던 특훈의 성과가 제대로 나왔어! 그리고 내 패스 어땠어? 딱 너만 받을 수 있을 정도로 쎄게 후려버렸는데, 역시 받아 넣더라고? 쩔었지? 신재욱 맞춤 택배 패스 맞지?” 신재욱은 피식 웃으며 고개를 끄덕였다. “그래. 전부 다 봤고, 패스도 최고였어.” 실제로 이택현의 플레이는 매우 좋았다. 솔직히 하비에르 마스체라노를 뚫어냈을 때는 신재욱조차 깜짝 놀랐다. ‘보면 볼수록 천재성이 대단한 친구야. 고작 며칠 연습했다고 마스체라노를 뚫어버리네.’ 며칠간 이택현을 훈련 시켰지만, 그가 마스체라노와의 대결에서 100% 이길 거라는 생각은 하지 않았다. 준비한 시간이 너무 짧았으니까. 하비에르 마스체라노는 어지간해선 당해주지 않는 대단한 선수니까. 그런데 이택현은 이겨버렸다. 천재적인 재능이 없었다면 불가능했을 일이다. 툭! 신재욱은 공을 바닥에 내려놨다. 그러곤 상대 선수들을 바라봤다. ‘기가 꺾이지 않았어. 3 대 1로 밀리고 있지만, 여전히 이길 수 있다고 생각하는 모양이야.’ 아르헨티나 선수들의 눈빛은 살아있었다. 저건 승리를 생각해야만 나오는 눈빛이었다. 즉, 아르헨티나는 한국을 이길 수 있다고 믿고 있었다. ‘실제로 그렇게 될 수도 있지. 아르헨티나는 그럴 수 있는 팀이니까.’ 신재욱은 상대의 실력을 인정했다. 저들은 한국의 수비를 부숴버릴 수 있는 팀이다. 전반전은 운 좋게 실점을 최소화했지만, 말 그대로 운이 좋았을 뿐이다. 후반전에도 운이 따를 것이라는 보장은 없다. 그래서 신재욱은 집중력을 끌어올렸다. ‘지금 스코어에 만족하면 안 돼. 더 골을 넣어야 이길 수 있어.’ * * * 3 대 1 스코어가 된 이후. 아르헨티나의 공격은 더욱 매서워졌다. 신재욱이 우려했던 부분이 현실이 되고 있었다. ― 리오넬 메시! 2명에게 둘러싸인 상태에서도 탈압박을 해냅니다! 이 선수를 막으려면 적어도 3명은 붙어야 할 것 같습니다! 더 붙어줘야 합니…… 어엇? ― ……! 해설들이 당황했다. 특유의 민첩한 드리블로 탈압박을 해낸 리오넬 메시가 기습적인 왼발 슈팅을 때려냈고, 부드럽게 휘어진 공이 골대 상단으로 파고들었기 때문이었다. 한국 대표팀 선수들이 순간 허탈한 감정을 숨기지 못했을 정도로 깔끔한 골이었다. ― 리오넬 메시 선수다운 골이 나왔습니다……! 우리 선수들이 최선을 다해서 막으려고 했지만, 역부족이었습니다. 축구의 신이라고 불리는 선수답게 엄청난 존재감을 보여주고 있습니다…! ― 비록 실점했지만, 괜찮습니다! 아직 우리가 3 대 2로 앞서나가고 있으니까 남은 시간 동안 잘 싸워준다면 충분히 승리할 수 있습니다! 해설들은 당황한 마음을 추스르며 애써 희망적인 메시지를 던졌다. 다만, 이들은 느끼고 있었다. 한국의 수비가 아르헨티나의 공격에 제대로 대응하지 못하고 있다는 걸. ― 에세키엘 라베시! 윤성영을 너무나도 쉽게 상대하며 한국의 측면을 뚫어냈습니다! 아! 윤성영과의 스피드 차이가 너무 심합니다! 한국의 위기는 끝나지 않았다. 후반 74분에 공을 잡은 에세키엘 라베시가 과감하게 드리블하며 한국의 수비를 휘저었다. ― 오늘 윤성영 선수가 라베시 선수를 전혀 막아내질 못하고 있습니다……! 에세키엘 라베시. 현재 파리 생제르맹 FC에 소속된 선수로 윙어로 뛸 때 매우 뛰어난 능력을 발휘한다. 특히 빠른 스피드와 뛰어난 기술을 바탕으로 한 드리블은 라베시의 가장 큰 무기 중 하나였다. ― 에세키엘 라베시가 공을 몰고 들어옵니다! 막아야죠! 더 들어오게 해서는 안 됩니다! 더 무서운 건 라베시의 무기는 매우 많다는 것이었다. 그는 위협적인 드리블뿐만 아니라 슈팅과 패스, 연계플레이에도 능한 선수였다. 지금도 그랬다. 아르헨티나의 스트라이커 곤살로 이과인을 막는 것에 집중하던 한국의 수비수들 앞에서. 에세키엘 라베시는 직접 슈팅을 시도했다. 측면에서 페널티박스 안으로 파고들며 강하게 때려버린 슈팅. 퍼어엉! 강렬한 타격음이 터졌다. 각도가 매우 좁은 곳에서의 슈팅. 흔히 골키퍼의 머리를 보고 때린다고 말하는 슈팅이었고, 의외로 많은 골이 나오는 위치였다. “……!” 깜짝 놀란 정석룡 골키퍼가 팔을 위로 뻗었다. 휘익! 그러나 공은 그의 행동보다 더 빨랐다. 이미 골대 안으로 파고들고 있었으니까. 철렁! 기어코 터진 아르헨티나의 동점 골. 이어진 아르헨티나 선수들의 세리머니. 한국 대표팀 선수들, 한국의 팬들에겐 믿고 싶지 않은 상황이었다. 실제로 한국의 축구팬들은 크게 당황하며 불안해하고 있었다. └ 아르헨티나 진짜 세다…… 이거 지는 거 아니야……? └ 그냥 수비에만 올인하고 승부차기까지 가야 할 것 같은데……? 아르헨티나랑 맞다이 뜨려고 하니까 계속 골 먹히잖아. └ 승부차기까지 가려면 연장전도 버텨야 하는데 가능할까? 메시랑 라베시 오늘 하는 거 보니까 미쳤는데……? └ 아르헨티나 애들 개잘한다…… 우리 수비는 변한 게 없네. 몸을 열심히 던지긴 하는데, 던지지 말아야 할 때도 던져서 골을 먹히네……. └ 에휴…… 신재욱이랑 이택현이 다 만들어준 밥상을 걷어차 버리는구나. └ ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ아르헨티나는 왜 후반전 되니까 더 세진 것 같냐? └ 전반전도 셌어. 우리가 운이 좋아서 골 안 먹혔던 것뿐이야. └ 신재욱이랑 이택현이 말도 안 되게 잘해주는데, 얘네한테 공이 연결되기도 전에 끊길 때가 너무 많아. 진심 팀이 도움이 안 되고 있어. └ 아…… 이거 나만 질 것 같냐? └ 패배 냄새 진하게 풍김…… 기적은 8강에서 끝나는 건가……. 같은 시각. 신재욱은 동료들을 다독이며 침착하게 상황을 바라봤다. 팀이 연달아 골을 내주며 3 대 3 동점이 된 것. 씁쓸하지만 예상 범위 안에 있는 일이었다. ‘어려운 상대라는 거 알고 있었잖아?’ 상대는 아르헨티나였다. 어떤 팀을 만나도 골을 넣을 수 있는 강팀. 더구나 리오넬 메시라는 세계 최고의 선수까지 보유한 팀이지 않은가. 신재욱이 생각하기엔 한국 대표팀 선수들은 충분히 잘해주고 있었다. 훨씬 더 수준이 높은 아르헨티나를 상대로 이 정도 해주는 것만으로도 고마웠다. 그래서 다시 한번 다짐했다. ‘내가 더 잘하면 돼.’ 자신이 더 좋은 경기력을 보여주겠다고. ― 경기 재개됩니다! 아르헨티나 선수들의 움직임에서 기세가 오른 게 느껴지네요. ― 3 대 1로 밀리던 상황에서 2골을 연달아 넣으며 동점을 만들었으니까요. 아르헨티나 선수들은 자신감이 매우 높아진 상태일 겁니다. 아르헨티나는 적극적이었다. 공을 가지고 있지 않을 때는 활발하게 움직이며 한국을 압박했고, 공을 가지고 있을 때는 과감하게 공격을 시도했다. 체력에도 큰 문제는 없었다. 가장 많이 뛴 선수들을 교체해줬기 때문이었다. 후보 선수들조차 실력이 뛰어난 아르헨티나였기에, 이들의 공격력은 교체 카드를 사용한 이후에도 강력했다. 반면 한국은 쉽게 교체 카드를 사용하지 못하고 있었다. 아르헨티나와는 다르게 주전과 비주전의 실력 차이가 큰 편이었으니까. “기죽지 말고 자신감 있게 하세요! 집중력 잃지 마세요! 역습 기회는 분명히 옵니다!” 신재욱은 밑으로 내려와서 수비에 가담하며 계속해서 동료들을 다독였다. 공격할 기회는 아직 오지 않고 있었다. 그만큼 한국은 경기력에서 밀리고 있었다. 사실상 반코트 게임이었다. 아르헨티나에게 불쌍할 정도로 얻어맞는 중이었다. 그랬음에도 신재욱은 포기하지 않았다. 이길 수 있다는 믿음도 여전했다. ‘지금 아르헨티나의 수비엔 빈틈이 많아. 이번 한 번만 잘 막으면 타이밍은 나온다.’ 많은 경험으로 인해서 알 수 있었다. 지금 아르헨티나는 너무 신이 난 나머지 방심하고 있었다. 신재욱은 그 기회를 기다리고 있었다. 그리고 그 기회는 빠르게 찾아왔다. 툭! 툭! 짧게 공을 치는 특유의 드리블을 하며 다가오는 아르헨티나의 한 선수. 신재욱은 그 선수의 눈을 똑바로 바라봤다. ‘이 친구, 내 기를 꺾고 싶은가 보네.’ 동시에 자세를 낮췄다. 당해줄 생각은 조금도 없었다. ‘누가 이기나 해보자. 리오넬 메시.’","output":"It seems you have provided a narrative involving a fictional or alternate reality football match between South Korea and Argentina, featuring characters such as 신재욱 (Shin Jaewook), 이택현 (Lee Taekhyun), 하비에르 마스체라노 (Javier Mascherano), 리오넬 메시 (Lionel Messi), and 에세키엘 라베시 (Ezequiel Lavezzi).

정말? 진심이야? 그런 방법이 있다고?” “당연하지.” 이후, 신재욱은 이택현과의 일대일 연습에 많은 시간을 쏟았다. 하비에르 마스체라노는 약점이 별로 없는 선수였다. 그러니 세계 최고의 수비형 미드필더라는 말을 듣는 것이고. 다만, 상대할 방법이 없는 건 아니었다. 환생 전에 마스체라노를 여러 번 상대해봤던 신재욱은 그 방법을 알고 있었다. 그리고 그 방법들을 이택현에게 알려줬다. 물론 이유 없는 가르침은 아니었다. ‘이택현이 중원에서 마스체라노를 이겨주면 내가 골을 넣기도 편해질 거야.’ 이택현이 하비에르 마스체라노를 이길 수 있다면. 그건 신재욱의 성장에 분명히 도움이 되는 일이었으니까. 그리고 한국과 아르헨티나의 월드컵 8강전이 펼쳐지고 있는 지금. ― 우오오오오! 이택현 선수가 하비에르 마스체라노를 제쳐냈습니다! ― 이건 놀라운데요? 마스체라노 선수는 일대일에서는 웬만해서 뚫리지 않는 선수거든요? 이택현은 하비에르 마스체라노를 일대일에서 이겨냈다. “이게 바로 이택현 님의 폭풍드리블이다!” 연습한 것이 잘 통했다는 것에 잔뜩 신이 난 이택현은 그대로 다리를 휘둘렀다. 슈팅은 아니었다. 아르헨티나 수비수들의 뒷공간으로 침투하는 신재욱을 향한 스루패스였다. 터엉! 패스를 보낸 후. 이택현은 여전히 미소를 지은 채, 혀를 내둘렀다. “재욱이의 저 침투 타이밍은 보고도 못 따라 하겠다니까?” 공은 낮고 빠르게 쏘아졌다. 일반적인 전진 패스보다 훨씬 더 강한 패스였다. 웬만한 공격수들은 받기 힘들다고 투덜댈 정도로 힘이 들어간 패스. 그러나 신재욱은 좋아했다. ‘이래야 수비수들이 중간에 못 끊지.’ 패스가 세면 셀수록 자신에게 연결될 가능성이 늘어나니까. 아무리 강한 패스라도 받을 수 있다는 자신감이 있으니까. ‘좋은 스트라이커라면 어려운 패스도 받을 수 있어야지.’ 지금도 그랬다. 공에 실린 힘은 굉장히 강했지만, 신재욱은 자신감 있게 발을 뻗었다. 타이밍도 정확히 잡아냈다. 툭! 빨랐던 공이 신재욱의 발에 닿자 급격히 힘을 잃었다. 너무나도 얌전하게 다음 동작을 기다렸다. 그리고 신재욱은 그 공을 강하게 때려냈다. 골키퍼가 막을 생각도 하지 못하게끔 구석을 겨냥한 슛이었다. 쒸이이익! 짧은 바람 소리가 들렸다. 매우 짧은 시간이었다. 쏘아진 공은 아르헨티나의 골망을 흔들고 있었고, 신재욱은 골대 안으로 달렸다. 스윽! 골대 안에 있던 공을 들어 올리고 뛰기 시작했다. 경기장 중앙으로. ― 고오오오오오오올! 신재욱 선수가 또 넣었습니다! 이택현 선수의 패스를 받아서 강력한 슈팅을 때려 골을 기록했습니다! 신재욱 선수의 귀중한 골로 스코어는 3 대 1이 됩니다! ― 놀랍습니다! 우리 선수들이 아르헨티나를 상대로 믿기 어려울 정도로 잘 싸워주고 있습니다! 신재욱은 경기장 중앙으로 뛰었고, 그 주변엔 한국 대표팀 선수들이 있었다. 이들은 함께 뛰면서 골에 대한 기쁨을 드러내고 있었다. 특히 이택현은 다른 선수들보다 훨씬 더 기뻐하며 입을 쉬지 않았다. “재욱아! 봤지? 내가 마스체라노 발라버리는 거 봤지? 마스체라노 당황한 표정 봤지? 와! 이건 내가 하고도 소름이었다. 며칠간 했었던 특훈의 성과가 제대로 나왔어! 그리고 내 패스 어땠어? 딱 너만 받을 수 있을 정도로 쎄게 후려버렸는데, 역시 받아 넣더라고? 쩔었지? 신재욱 맞춤 택배 패스 맞지?” 신재욱은 피식 웃으며 고개를 끄덕였다. “그래. 전부 다 봤고, 패스도 최고였어.” 실제로 이택현의 플레이는 매우 좋았다. 솔직히 하비에르 마스체라노를 뚫어냈을 때는 신재욱조차 깜짝 놀랐다. ‘보면 볼수록 천재성이 대단한 친구야. 고작 며칠 연습했다고 마스체라노를 뚫어버리네.’ 며칠간 이택현을 훈련 시켰지만, 그가 마스체라노와의 대결에서 100% 이길 거라는 생각은 하지 않았다. 준비한 시간이 너무 짧았으니까. 하비에르 마스체라노는 어지간해선 당해주지 않는 대단한 선수니까. 그런데 이택현은 이겨버렸다. 천재적인 재능이 없었다면 불가능했을 일이다. 툭! 신재욱은 공을 바닥에 내려놨다. 그러곤 상대 선수들을 바라봤다. ‘기가 꺾이지 않았어. 3 대 1로 밀리고 있지만, 여전히 이길 수 있다고 생각하는 모양이야.’ 아르헨티나 선수들의 눈빛은 살아있었다. 저건 승리를 생각해야만 나오는 눈빛이었다. 즉, 아르헨티나는 한국을 이길 수 있다고 믿고 있었다. ‘실제로 그렇게 될 수도 있지. 아르헨티나는 그럴 수 있는 팀이니까.’ 신재욱은 상대의 실력을 인정했다. 저들은 한국의 수비를 부숴버릴 수 있는 팀이다. 전반전은 운 좋게 실점을 최소화했지만, 말 그대로 운이 좋았을 뿐이다. 후반전에도 운이 따를 것이라는 보장은 없다. 그래서 신재욱은 집중력을 끌어올렸다. ‘지금 스코어에 만족하면 안 돼. 더 골을 넣어야 이길 수 있어.’ * * * 3 대 1 스코어가 된 이후. 아르헨티나의 공격은 더욱 매서워졌다. 신재욱이 우려했던 부분이 현실이 되고 있었다. ― 리오넬 메시! 2명에게 둘러싸인 상태에서도 탈압박을 해냅니다! 이 선수를 막으려면 적어도 3명은 붙어야 할 것 같습니다! 더 붙어줘야 합니…… 어엇? ― ……! 해설들이 당황했다. 특유의 민첩한 드리블로 탈압박을 해낸 리오넬 메시가 기습적인 왼발 슈팅을 때려냈고, 부드럽게 휘어진 공이 골대 상단으로 파고들었기 때문이었다. 한국 대표팀 선수들이 순간 허탈한 감정을 숨기지 못했을 정도로 깔끔한 골이었다. ― 리오넬 메시 선수다운 골이 나왔습니다……! 우리 선수들이 최선을 다해서 막으려고 했지만, 역부족이었습니다. 축구의 신이라고 불리는 선수답게 엄청난 존재감을 보여주고 있습니다…! ― 비록 실점했지만, 괜찮습니다! 아직 우리가 3 대 2로 앞서나가고 있으니까 남은 시간 동안 잘 싸워준다면 충분히 승리할 수 있습니다! 해설들은 당황한 마음을 추스르며 애써 희망적인 메시지를 던졌다. 다만, 이들은 느끼고 있었다. 한국의 수비가 아르헨티나의 공격에 제대로 대응하지 못하고 있다는 걸. ― 에세키엘 라베시! 윤성영을 너무나도 쉽게 상대하며 한국의 측면을 뚫어냈습니다! 아! 윤성영과의 스피드 차이가 너무 심합니다! 한국의 위기는 끝나지 않았다. 후반 74분에 공을 잡은 에세키엘 라베시가 과감하게 드리블하며 한국의 수비를 휘저었다. ― 오늘 윤성영 선수가 라베시 선수를 전혀 막아내질 못하고 있습니다……! 에세키엘 라베시. 현재 파리 생제르맹 FC에 소속된 선수로 윙어로 뛸 때 매우 뛰어난 능력을 발휘한다. 특히 빠른 스피드와 뛰어난 기술을 바탕으로 한 드리블은 라베시의 가장 큰 무기 중 하나였다. ― 에세키엘 라베시가 공을 몰고 들어옵니다! 막아야죠! 더 들어오게 해서는 안 됩니다! 더 무서운 건 라베시의 무기는 매우 많다는 것이었다. 그는 위협적인 드리블뿐만 아니라 슈팅과 패스, 연계플레이에도 능한 선수였다. 지금도 그랬다. 아르헨티나의 스트라이커 곤살로 이과인을 막는 것에 집중하던 한국의 수비수들 앞에서. 에세키엘 라베시는 직접 슈팅을 시도했다. 측면에서 페널티박스 안으로 파고들며 강하게 때려버린 슈팅. 퍼어엉! 강렬한 타격음이 터졌다. 각도가 매우 좁은 곳에서의 슈팅. 흔히 골키퍼의 머리를 보고 때린다고 말하는 슈팅이었고, 의외로 많은 골이 나오는 위치였다. “……!” 깜짝 놀란 정석룡 골키퍼가 팔을 위로 뻗었다. 휘익! 그러나 공은 그의 행동보다 더 빨랐다. 이미 골대 안으로 파고들고 있었으니까. 철렁! 기어코 터진 아르헨티나의 동점 골. 이어진 아르헨티나 선수들의 세리머니. 한국 대표팀 선수들, 한국의 팬들에겐 믿고 싶지 않은 상황이었다. 실제로 한국의 축구팬들은 크게 당황하며 불안해하고 있었다. └ 아르헨티나 진짜 세다…… 이거 지는 거 아니야……? └ 그냥 수비에만 올인하고 승부차기까지 가야 할 것 같은데……? 아르헨티나랑 맞다이 뜨려고 하니까 계속 골 먹히잖아. └ 승부차기까지 가려면 연장전도 버텨야 하는데 가능할까? 메시랑 라베시 오늘 하는 거 보니까 미쳤는데……? └ 아르헨티나 애들 개잘한다…… 우리 수비는 변한 게 없네. 몸을 열심히 던지긴 하는데, 던지지 말아야 할 때도 던져서 골을 먹히네……. └ 에휴…… 신재욱이랑 이택현이 다 만들어준 밥상을 걷어차 버리는구나. └ ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ아르헨티나는 왜 후반전 되니까 더 세진 것 같냐? └ 전반전도 셌어. 우리가 운이 좋아서 골 안 먹혔던 것뿐이야. └ 신재욱이랑 이택현이 말도 안 되게 잘해주는데, 얘네한테 공이 연결되기도 전에 끊길 때가 너무 많아. 진심 팀이 도움이 안 되고 있어. └ 아…… 이거 나만 질 것 같냐? └ 패배 냄새 진하게 풍김…… 기적은 8강에서 끝나는 건가……. 같은 시각. 신재욱은 동료들을 다독이며 침착하게 상황을 바라봤다. 팀이 연달아 골을 내주며 3 대 3 동점이 된 것. 씁쓸하지만 예상 범위 안에 있는 일이었다. ‘어려운 상대라는 거 알고 있었잖아?’ 상대는 아르헨티나였다. 어떤 팀을 만나도 골을 넣을 수 있는 강팀. 더구나 리오넬 메시라는 세계 최고의 선수까지 보유한 팀이지 않은가. 신재욱이 생각하기엔 한국 대표팀 선수들은 충분히 잘해주고 있었다. 훨씬 더 수준이 높은 아르헨티나를 상대로 이 정도 해주는 것만으로도 고마웠다. 그래서 다시 한번 다짐했다. ‘내가 더 잘하면 돼.’ 자신이 더 좋은 경기력을 보여주겠다고. ― 경기 재개됩니다! 아르헨티나 선수들의 움직임에서 기세가 오른 게 느껴지네요. ― 3 대 1로 밀리던 상황에서 2골을 연달아 넣으며 동점을 만들었으니까요. 아르헨티나 선수들은 자신감이 매우 높아진 상태일 겁니다. 아르헨티나는 적극적이었다. 공을 가지고 있지 않을 때는 활발하게 움직이며 한국을 압박했고, 공을 가지고 있을 때는 과감하게 공격을 시도했다. 체력에도 큰 문제는 없었다. 가장 많이 뛴 선수들을 교체해줬기 때문이었다. 후보 선수들조차 실력이 뛰어난 아르헨티나였기에, 이들의 공격력은 교체 카드를 사용한 이후에도 강력했다. 반면 한국은 쉽게 교체 카드를 사용하지 못하고 있었다. 아르헨티나와는 다르게 주전과 비주전의 실력 차이가 큰 편이었으니까. “기죽지 말고 자신감 있게 하세요! 집중력 잃지 마세요! 역습 기회는 분명히 옵니다!” 신재욱은 밑으로 내려와서 수비에 가담하며 계속해서 동료들을 다독였다. 공격할 기회는 아직 오지 않고 있었다. 그만큼 한국은 경기력에서 밀리고 있었다. 사실상 반코트 게임이었다. 아르헨티나에게 불쌍할 정도로 얻어맞는 중이었다. 그랬음에도 신재욱은 포기하지 않았다. 이길 수 있다는 믿음도 여전했다. ‘지금 아르헨티나의 수비엔 빈틈이 많아. 이번 한 번만 잘 막으면 타이밍은 나온다.’ 많은 경험으로 인해서 알 수 있었다. 지금 아르헨티나는 너무 신이 난 나머지 방심하고 있었다. 신재욱은 그 기회를 기다리고 있었다. 그리고 그 기회는 빠르게 찾아왔다. 툭! 툭! 짧게 공을 치는 특유의 드리블을 하며 다가오는 아르헨티나의 한 선수. 신재욱은 그 선수의 눈을 똑바로 바라봤다. ‘이 친구, 내 기를 꺾고 싶은가 보네.’ 동시에 자세를 낮췄다. 당해줄 생각은 조금도 없었다. ‘누가 이기나 해보자. 리오넬 메시.’","output":"205 --- A few days ago.

But why bring up Mascherano all of a sudden?\\" \\"I'm going to tell you how to beat him.\\" \\"Really? For real? There's a way to do that?\\" \\"Of course.\\" After that, Shin Jaewook spent a lot of time practicing one-on-one with Lee Taekhyun. Javier Mascherano was a player with hardly any weaknesses. That's why he was known as one of the world's best defensive midfielders. However, it wasn't like there was no way to play against him. Shin Jaewook, who had faced Mascherano several times before his reincarnation, knew the method. And he shared these methods with Lee Taekhyun. Of course, his teaching was not without reason. 'If Taekhyun can beat Mascherano in the midfield, it'll be easier for me to score goals.' If Lee Taekhyun could beat Javier Mascherano. That would certainly help Shin Jaewook's growth. And now, as the World Cup quarterfinal between South Korea and Argentina was unfolding. ― Wow! Player Lee Taekhyun has just outplayed Javier Mascherano! ― This is surprising, isn't it? Mascherano is a player who usually doesn't get beaten one-on-one. Lee Taekhyun had beaten Javier Mascherano in a one-on-one. \\"This is Lee Taekhyun's stormy dribble!\\" Elated that the practice had paid off, Lee Taekhyun swung his leg. It wasn't a shot. It was a through pass towards Shin Jaewook, who was penetrating the space behind the Argentine defenders. Thump! After sending the pass, Lee Taekhyun still had a smile on his face, sticking out his tongue. \\"Even if you see it, you can't follow Jaewook's timing for those runs, right?\\" The ball was shot low and fast. It was a much stronger pass than a typical forward pass. A pass so powerful that most forwards would grumble about how hard it was to receive. But Shin Jaewook liked it. 'The stronger the pass, the less likely the defenders are to cut it off.' The stronger the pass, the more likely it was to reach him. Because he had the confidence that he could receive any pass, no matter how powerful. 'A good striker should be able to receive difficult passes.' It was the same now. The ball was shot with great force, but Shin Jaewook confidently extended his foot. He caught the timing just right. Tap! As the fast ball touched Shin Jaewook's foot, it suddenly lost its power. It waited so obediently for the next move. And Shin Jaewook struck the ball hard. It was a shot aimed at the corner, so fast that the goalkeeper couldn't even think of blocking it. Swoosh! A short sound of wind was heard. It was a very brief moment. The shot ball was already shaking the net of Argentina, and Shin Jaewook ran into the goal. Swoosh! He picked up the ball inside the goal and started running. Towards the center of the field. ― Goal! Shin Jaewook scores again! He received a pass from Lee Taekhyun and fired a powerful shot to score! With Shin Jaewook's precious goal, the score is now 3 to 1! ― Amazing! Our players are fighting unbelievably well against Argentina! Shin Jaewook ran to the center of the field, surrounded by the South Korean national team players. They were showing their joy for the goal together. Especially Lee Taekhyun, who was much happier than the other players, couldn't stop talking. \\"Jaewook! Did you see? Did you see me tearing apart Mascherano? Did you see the confused look on Mascherano's face? Wow! It was chilling even for me. The results of the special training over the past few days really paid off! And how was my pass? I hit it hard enough so that only you could receive it, and as expected, you scored, right? Wasn't it cool? It was a perfect delivery pass for Shin Jaewook, right?\\" Shin Jaewook smiled and nodded. \\"Yeah. I saw everything, and the pass was the best.\\" In fact, Lee Taekhyun's play was very good. Even Shin Jaewook was surprised when he broke through Javier Mascherano. 'The more I see, the more I realize his genius. He managed to break through Mascherano with just a few days of practice.' Shin Jaewook had trained Lee Taekhyun for a few days, but he didn't think he would win 100% against Mascherano. The preparation time was too short. After all, Javier Mascherano was a great player who wouldn't easily be beaten. But Lee Taekhyun did win. It would have been impossible without his genius talent. Tap! Shin Jaewook put the ball down on the ground. Then he looked at the opposing players. 'They're not broken yet. They're down 3 to 1, but they still think they can win.' The eyes of the Argentine players were alive. That was the look of someone who believes in victory. In other words, Argentina believed they could beat South Korea. 'In reality, that could happen. Argentina is a team that can do it.' Shin Jaewook acknowledged the opponent's skill. They were a team that could break through South Korea's defense. The first half was lucky to minimize goals, but it was just that—luck. There was no guarantee that luck would continue in the second half. So Shin Jaewook raised his concentration. 'We can't be satisfied with the current score. We need to score more goals to win.' --- After the score became 3 to 1. Argentina's attacks became even more ferocious. The concerns Shin Jaewook had were becoming a reality. ― Lionel Messi! Even surrounded by two players, he manages to break free! To stop this player, you need at least three... more should join in to help... Oh? ― ...! The commentators were flustered. Lionel Messi, with his characteristic agile dribbling, had taken a surprise left-footed shot, and the smoothly curving ball was heading towards the top of the goal. It was such a clean goal that even the South Korean players couldn't hide their momentary disappointment. ― A goal worthy of Lionel Messi...! Our players did their best to stop him, but it wasn't enough. Showing his tremendous presence as a player called the god of football...! ― Although we conceded a goal, it's okay! We're still leading 3 to 2, so if we fight well for the remaining time, we can definitely win! The commentators tried to regain their composure and sent a hopeful message. However, they felt it. South Korea's defense was not properly responding to Argentina's attack. ― Ezequiel Lavezzi! He easily gets past Yoon Seongyoung and breaks through South Korea's flank! Ah! The speed difference between Yoon Seongyoung and Lavezzi is too great! South Korea's crisis was not over. In the 74th minute of the second half, Ezequiel Lavezzi, who had the ball, boldly dribbled and shook South Korea's defense. ― Today, Yoon Seongyoung is completely unable to stop Lavezzi...! Ezequiel Lavezzi. Currently playing for Paris Saint-Germain FC, he shows excellent ability when playing as a winger. Especially his fast speed and excellent dribbling skills based on his technique were one of Lavezzi's biggest weapons. ― Ezequiel Lavezzi is driving the ball in! You have to stop him! You can't let him come any further! What was even scarier was that Lavezzi had many weapons. He was not only threatening with his dribbling but also skilled in shooting, passing, and link-up play. It was the same now. In front of South Korea's defenders, who were focused on stopping Argentina's striker Gonzalo Higuain. Ezequiel Lavezzi attempted a direct shot. He penetrated from the flank into the penalty box and fired a powerful shot. Bang! A loud impact sound erupted. It was a shot from a very tight angle. It's commonly referred to as a shot taken at the goalkeeper's head, and it was a position from which many goals were scored. \\"…!\\" Startled, goalkeeper Jung Seokryong stretched his arms up. Whoosh! But the ball was faster than his action. It was already burrowing into the goal. Clang! Argentina's equalizing goal finally happened. The following celebration by the Argentine players. For the South Korean team players and fans, it was an unbelievable situation. In fact, South Korean soccer fans were greatly flustered and anxious. └ Argentina is really strong... Are we going to lose this...? └ Should we just focus on defense and go to a penalty shootout...? Every time we try to face Argentina head-on, we keep conceding goals. └ Can we survive extra time to get to a penalty shootout? Seeing Messi and Lavezzi play today, they're insane...? └ The Argentine players are so good... Our defense hasn't changed. They're throwing themselves into it, but they're also throwing themselves in when they shouldn't and conceding goals... └ Sigh... Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun set the table, and now it's being kicked away. └ ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Why does Argentina seem stronger in the second half? └ They were strong in the first half too. We were just lucky not to concede goals. └ Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun are playing unbelievably well, but the ball gets cut off before it even reaches them too often. Seriously, the team isn't helping. └ Ah... Am I the only one who feels like we're going to lose? └ The smell of defeat is strong... Is the miracle ending in the quarterfinals...? At the same time. Shin Jaewook was calming his teammates and calmly observing the situation. The team had conceded two goals in a row, making it a 3 to 3 tie. It was bitter, but within the expected range. 'You knew it was a tough opponent, right?' The opponent was Argentina. A strong team that could score against any team. Moreover, they had Lionel Messi, one of the world's best players. In Shin Jaewook's opinion, the South Korean national team players were doing well enough. He was grateful that they were doing this well against a much higher-level Argentina. So he made a promise to himself again. 'I just have to do better.' He would show a better performance in the game. ― The game resumes! You can feel the momentum rising among the Argentine players. ― They were down 3 to 1, but after scoring two goals in a row to tie the game, the Argentine players must be very confident now. Argentina was aggressive. When they didn't have the ball, they moved actively to pressure South Korea, and when they had the ball, they boldly attempted attacks. They didn't have major issues with stamina either. They had substituted their most tired players. Even the substitute players of Argentina were skilled, so their attacking power remained strong even after using the substitution cards. On the other hand, South Korea couldn't easily use substitution cards. Unlike Argentina, there was a significant difference in skill between the starters and the substitutes. \\"Don't get discouraged and play with confidence! Don't lose focus! The chance for a counterattack will definitely come!\\" Shin Jaewook joined the defense and kept encouraging his teammates. The opportunity to attack had not yet come. That's how much South Korea was being outplayed. It was practically a half-court game. They were being beaten up by Argentina to the point of pity. Yet Shin Jaewook did not give up. He still believed they could win. 'There are many gaps in Argentina's defense right now. If we defend well this one time, the timing will come.' He could tell from his many experiences. Argentina was currently too excited and letting their guard down. Shin Jaewook was waiting for that opportunity. And that opportunity came quickly. Tap! Tap! An Argentine player approached with his characteristic short dribbling. Shin Jaewook looked straight into that player's eyes. 'This guy wants to break my spirit.' At the same time, he lowered his stance. He had no intention of being defeated. 'Let's see who wins. Lionel Messi.'"},{"instruction":"translate to english","output":"It looks like you may have forgotten to include the text you'd like to have translated into English.

정말? 진심이야? 그런 방법이 있다고?” “당연하지.” 이후, 신재욱은 이택현과의 일대일 연습에 많은 시간을 쏟았다. 하비에르 마스체라노는 약점이 별로 없는 선수였다. 그러니 세계 최고의 수비형 미드필더라는 말을 듣는 것이고. 다만, 상대할 방법이 없는 건 아니었다. 환생 전에 마스체라노를 여러 번 상대해봤던 신재욱은 그 방법을 알고 있었다. 그리고 그 방법들을 이택현에게 알려줬다. 물론 이유 없는 가르침은 아니었다. ‘이택현이 중원에서 마스체라노를 이겨주면 내가 골을 넣기도 편해질 거야.’ 이택현이 하비에르 마스체라노를 이길 수 있다면. 그건 신재욱의 성장에 분명히 도움이 되는 일이었으니까. 그리고 한국과 아르헨티나의 월드컵 8강전이 펼쳐지고 있는 지금. ― 우오오오오! 이택현 선수가 하비에르 마스체라노를 제쳐냈습니다! ― 이건 놀라운데요? 마스체라노 선수는 일대일에서는 웬만해서 뚫리지 않는 선수거든요? 이택현은 하비에르 마스체라노를 일대일에서 이겨냈다. “이게 바로 이택현 님의 폭풍드리블이다!” 연습한 것이 잘 통했다는 것에 잔뜩 신이 난 이택현은 그대로 다리를 휘둘렀다. 슈팅은 아니었다. 아르헨티나 수비수들의 뒷공간으로 침투하는 신재욱을 향한 스루패스였다. 터엉! 패스를 보낸 후. 이택현은 여전히 미소를 지은 채, 혀를 내둘렀다. “재욱이의 저 침투 타이밍은 보고도 못 따라 하겠다니까?” 공은 낮고 빠르게 쏘아졌다. 일반적인 전진 패스보다 훨씬 더 강한 패스였다. 웬만한 공격수들은 받기 힘들다고 투덜댈 정도로 힘이 들어간 패스. 그러나 신재욱은 좋아했다. ‘이래야 수비수들이 중간에 못 끊지.’ 패스가 세면 셀수록 자신에게 연결될 가능성이 늘어나니까. 아무리 강한 패스라도 받을 수 있다는 자신감이 있으니까. ‘좋은 스트라이커라면 어려운 패스도 받을 수 있어야지.’ 지금도 그랬다. 공에 실린 힘은 굉장히 강했지만, 신재욱은 자신감 있게 발을 뻗었다. 타이밍도 정확히 잡아냈다. 툭! 빨랐던 공이 신재욱의 발에 닿자 급격히 힘을 잃었다. 너무나도 얌전하게 다음 동작을 기다렸다. 그리고 신재욱은 그 공을 강하게 때려냈다. 골키퍼가 막을 생각도 하지 못하게끔 구석을 겨냥한 슛이었다. 쒸이이익! 짧은 바람 소리가 들렸다. 매우 짧은 시간이었다. 쏘아진 공은 아르헨티나의 골망을 흔들고 있었고, 신재욱은 골대 안으로 달렸다. 스윽! 골대 안에 있던 공을 들어 올리고 뛰기 시작했다. 경기장 중앙으로. ― 고오오오오오오올! 신재욱 선수가 또 넣었습니다! 이택현 선수의 패스를 받아서 강력한 슈팅을 때려 골을 기록했습니다! 신재욱 선수의 귀중한 골로 스코어는 3 대 1이 됩니다! ― 놀랍습니다! 우리 선수들이 아르헨티나를 상대로 믿기 어려울 정도로 잘 싸워주고 있습니다! 신재욱은 경기장 중앙으로 뛰었고, 그 주변엔 한국 대표팀 선수들이 있었다. 이들은 함께 뛰면서 골에 대한 기쁨을 드러내고 있었다. 특히 이택현은 다른 선수들보다 훨씬 더 기뻐하며 입을 쉬지 않았다. “재욱아! 봤지? 내가 마스체라노 발라버리는 거 봤지? 마스체라노 당황한 표정 봤지? 와! 이건 내가 하고도 소름이었다. 며칠간 했었던 특훈의 성과가 제대로 나왔어! 그리고 내 패스 어땠어? 딱 너만 받을 수 있을 정도로 쎄게 후려버렸는데, 역시 받아 넣더라고? 쩔었지? 신재욱 맞춤 택배 패스 맞지?” 신재욱은 피식 웃으며 고개를 끄덕였다. “그래. 전부 다 봤고, 패스도 최고였어.” 실제로 이택현의 플레이는 매우 좋았다. 솔직히 하비에르 마스체라노를 뚫어냈을 때는 신재욱조차 깜짝 놀랐다. ‘보면 볼수록 천재성이 대단한 친구야. 고작 며칠 연습했다고 마스체라노를 뚫어버리네.’ 며칠간 이택현을 훈련 시켰지만, 그가 마스체라노와의 대결에서 100% 이길 거라는 생각은 하지 않았다. 준비한 시간이 너무 짧았으니까. 하비에르 마스체라노는 어지간해선 당해주지 않는 대단한 선수니까. 그런데 이택현은 이겨버렸다. 천재적인 재능이 없었다면 불가능했을 일이다. 툭! 신재욱은 공을 바닥에 내려놨다. 그러곤 상대 선수들을 바라봤다. ‘기가 꺾이지 않았어. 3 대 1로 밀리고 있지만, 여전히 이길 수 있다고 생각하는 모양이야.’ 아르헨티나 선수들의 눈빛은 살아있었다. 저건 승리를 생각해야만 나오는 눈빛이었다. 즉, 아르헨티나는 한국을 이길 수 있다고 믿고 있었다. ‘실제로 그렇게 될 수도 있지. 아르헨티나는 그럴 수 있는 팀이니까.’ 신재욱은 상대의 실력을 인정했다. 저들은 한국의 수비를 부숴버릴 수 있는 팀이다. 전반전은 운 좋게 실점을 최소화했지만, 말 그대로 운이 좋았을 뿐이다. 후반전에도 운이 따를 것이라는 보장은 없다. 그래서 신재욱은 집중력을 끌어올렸다. ‘지금 스코어에 만족하면 안 돼. 더 골을 넣어야 이길 수 있어.’ * * * 3 대 1 스코어가 된 이후. 아르헨티나의 공격은 더욱 매서워졌다. 신재욱이 우려했던 부분이 현실이 되고 있었다. ― 리오넬 메시! 2명에게 둘러싸인 상태에서도 탈압박을 해냅니다! 이 선수를 막으려면 적어도 3명은 붙어야 할 것 같습니다! 더 붙어줘야 합니…… 어엇? ― ……! 해설들이 당황했다. 특유의 민첩한 드리블로 탈압박을 해낸 리오넬 메시가 기습적인 왼발 슈팅을 때려냈고, 부드럽게 휘어진 공이 골대 상단으로 파고들었기 때문이었다. 한국 대표팀 선수들이 순간 허탈한 감정을 숨기지 못했을 정도로 깔끔한 골이었다. ― 리오넬 메시 선수다운 골이 나왔습니다……! 우리 선수들이 최선을 다해서 막으려고 했지만, 역부족이었습니다. 축구의 신이라고 불리는 선수답게 엄청난 존재감을 보여주고 있습니다…! ― 비록 실점했지만, 괜찮습니다! 아직 우리가 3 대 2로 앞서나가고 있으니까 남은 시간 동안 잘 싸워준다면 충분히 승리할 수 있습니다! 해설들은 당황한 마음을 추스르며 애써 희망적인 메시지를 던졌다. 다만, 이들은 느끼고 있었다. 한국의 수비가 아르헨티나의 공격에 제대로 대응하지 못하고 있다는 걸. ― 에세키엘 라베시! 윤성영을 너무나도 쉽게 상대하며 한국의 측면을 뚫어냈습니다! 아! 윤성영과의 스피드 차이가 너무 심합니다! 한국의 위기는 끝나지 않았다. 후반 74분에 공을 잡은 에세키엘 라베시가 과감하게 드리블하며 한국의 수비를 휘저었다. ― 오늘 윤성영 선수가 라베시 선수를 전혀 막아내질 못하고 있습니다……! 에세키엘 라베시. 현재 파리 생제르맹 FC에 소속된 선수로 윙어로 뛸 때 매우 뛰어난 능력을 발휘한다. 특히 빠른 스피드와 뛰어난 기술을 바탕으로 한 드리블은 라베시의 가장 큰 무기 중 하나였다. ― 에세키엘 라베시가 공을 몰고 들어옵니다! 막아야죠! 더 들어오게 해서는 안 됩니다! 더 무서운 건 라베시의 무기는 매우 많다는 것이었다. 그는 위협적인 드리블뿐만 아니라 슈팅과 패스, 연계플레이에도 능한 선수였다. 지금도 그랬다. 아르헨티나의 스트라이커 곤살로 이과인을 막는 것에 집중하던 한국의 수비수들 앞에서. 에세키엘 라베시는 직접 슈팅을 시도했다. 측면에서 페널티박스 안으로 파고들며 강하게 때려버린 슈팅. 퍼어엉! 강렬한 타격음이 터졌다. 각도가 매우 좁은 곳에서의 슈팅. 흔히 골키퍼의 머리를 보고 때린다고 말하는 슈팅이었고, 의외로 많은 골이 나오는 위치였다. “……!” 깜짝 놀란 정석룡 골키퍼가 팔을 위로 뻗었다. 휘익! 그러나 공은 그의 행동보다 더 빨랐다. 이미 골대 안으로 파고들고 있었으니까. 철렁! 기어코 터진 아르헨티나의 동점 골. 이어진 아르헨티나 선수들의 세리머니. 한국 대표팀 선수들, 한국의 팬들에겐 믿고 싶지 않은 상황이었다. 실제로 한국의 축구팬들은 크게 당황하며 불안해하고 있었다. └ 아르헨티나 진짜 세다…… 이거 지는 거 아니야……? └ 그냥 수비에만 올인하고 승부차기까지 가야 할 것 같은데……? 아르헨티나랑 맞다이 뜨려고 하니까 계속 골 먹히잖아. └ 승부차기까지 가려면 연장전도 버텨야 하는데 가능할까? 메시랑 라베시 오늘 하는 거 보니까 미쳤는데……? └ 아르헨티나 애들 개잘한다…… 우리 수비는 변한 게 없네. 몸을 열심히 던지긴 하는데, 던지지 말아야 할 때도 던져서 골을 먹히네……. └ 에휴…… 신재욱이랑 이택현이 다 만들어준 밥상을 걷어차 버리는구나. └ ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ아르헨티나는 왜 후반전 되니까 더 세진 것 같냐? └ 전반전도 셌어. 우리가 운이 좋아서 골 안 먹혔던 것뿐이야. └ 신재욱이랑 이택현이 말도 안 되게 잘해주는데, 얘네한테 공이 연결되기도 전에 끊길 때가 너무 많아. 진심 팀이 도움이 안 되고 있어. └ 아…… 이거 나만 질 것 같냐? └ 패배 냄새 진하게 풍김…… 기적은 8강에서 끝나는 건가……. 같은 시각. 신재욱은 동료들을 다독이며 침착하게 상황을 바라봤다. 팀이 연달아 골을 내주며 3 대 3 동점이 된 것. 씁쓸하지만 예상 범위 안에 있는 일이었다. ‘어려운 상대라는 거 알고 있었잖아?’ 상대는 아르헨티나였다. 어떤 팀을 만나도 골을 넣을 수 있는 강팀. 더구나 리오넬 메시라는 세계 최고의 선수까지 보유한 팀이지 않은가. 신재욱이 생각하기엔 한국 대표팀 선수들은 충분히 잘해주고 있었다. 훨씬 더 수준이 높은 아르헨티나를 상대로 이 정도 해주는 것만으로도 고마웠다. 그래서 다시 한번 다짐했다. ‘내가 더 잘하면 돼.’ 자신이 더 좋은 경기력을 보여주겠다고. ― 경기 재개됩니다! 아르헨티나 선수들의 움직임에서 기세가 오른 게 느껴지네요. ― 3 대 1로 밀리던 상황에서 2골을 연달아 넣으며 동점을 만들었으니까요. 아르헨티나 선수들은 자신감이 매우 높아진 상태일 겁니다. 아르헨티나는 적극적이었다. 공을 가지고 있지 않을 때는 활발하게 움직이며 한국을 압박했고, 공을 가지고 있을 때는 과감하게 공격을 시도했다. 체력에도 큰 문제는 없었다. 가장 많이 뛴 선수들을 교체해줬기 때문이었다. 후보 선수들조차 실력이 뛰어난 아르헨티나였기에, 이들의 공격력은 교체 카드를 사용한 이후에도 강력했다. 반면 한국은 쉽게 교체 카드를 사용하지 못하고 있었다. 아르헨티나와는 다르게 주전과 비주전의 실력 차이가 큰 편이었으니까. “기죽지 말고 자신감 있게 하세요! 집중력 잃지 마세요! 역습 기회는 분명히 옵니다!” 신재욱은 밑으로 내려와서 수비에 가담하며 계속해서 동료들을 다독였다. 공격할 기회는 아직 오지 않고 있었다. 그만큼 한국은 경기력에서 밀리고 있었다. 사실상 반코트 게임이었다. 아르헨티나에게 불쌍할 정도로 얻어맞는 중이었다. 그랬음에도 신재욱은 포기하지 않았다. 이길 수 있다는 믿음도 여전했다. ‘지금 아르헨티나의 수비엔 빈틈이 많아. 이번 한 번만 잘 막으면 타이밍은 나온다.’ 많은 경험으로 인해서 알 수 있었다. 지금 아르헨티나는 너무 신이 난 나머지 방심하고 있었다. 신재욱은 그 기회를 기다리고 있었다. 그리고 그 기회는 빠르게 찾아왔다. 툭! 툭! 짧게 공을 치는 특유의 드리블을 하며 다가오는 아르헨티나의 한 선수. 신재욱은 그 선수의 눈을 똑바로 바라봤다. ‘이 친구, 내 기를 꺾고 싶은가 보네.’ 동시에 자세를 낮췄다. 당해줄 생각은 조금도 없었다. ‘누가 이기나 해보자. 리오넬 메시.’","output":"205 --- A few days ago. Shin Jaewook called over Lee Taekhyun. \\"Taekhyun, I have something to tell you.\\" \\"Huh? What is it?\\" \\"Do you know Mascherano from Argentina?\\" \\"Javier Mascherano? Of course, I know him! He's one of the world's best defensive midfielders. I've been analyzing him a lot recently to try to beat him. But why bring up Mascherano all of a sudden?\\" \\"I'm going to tell you how to beat him.\\" \\"Really? Are you serious? There's a way to do that?\\" \\"Of course.\\" After that, Shin Jaewook spent a lot of time practicing one-on-one with Lee Taekhyun. Javier Mascherano was a player with hardly any weaknesses. That's why he was known as one of the world's best defensive midfielders. However, it wasn't like there was no way to play against him. Shin Jaewook, who had faced Mascherano several times before his reincarnation, knew the method. And he taught those methods to Lee Taekhyun. Of course, his teaching was not without reason. 'If Taekhyun can beat Mascherano in the midfield, it'll be easier for me to score goals.' If Lee Taekhyun could beat Javier Mascherano. That would certainly help Shin Jaewook's growth. And now, during the World Cup quarterfinals between Korea and Argentina. ― Wow! Player Lee Taekhyun has just outplayed Javier Mascherano! ― This is surprising, isn't it? Mascherano is a player who usually doesn't get beaten one-on-one. Lee Taekhyun had beaten Javier Mascherano one-on-one. \\"This is Lee Taekhyun's stormy dribble!\\" Excited that the practice had paid off, Lee Taekhyun swung his leg. It wasn't a shot. It was a through pass towards Shin Jaewook, who was infiltrating the space behind the Argentine defenders. Thump! After sending the pass. Lee Taekhyun still had a smile on his face, sticking out his tongue. \\"Even if you see it, you can't follow Jaewook's timing for infiltrating, can you?\\" The ball was shot low and fast. It was a much stronger pass than a typical forward pass. A pass so powerful that most forwards would complain about how hard it was to receive. But Shin Jaewook liked it. 'That's how the defenders can't cut it off.' The stronger the pass, the more likely it was to reach him. Because he had the confidence that he could receive any pass, no matter how powerful. 'A good striker should be able to receive difficult passes.' It was the same now. The ball was shot with tremendous force, but Shin Jaewook confidently extended his foot. He caught the timing perfectly. Tap! As the fast ball touched Shin Jaewook's foot, it suddenly lost its power. It waited so obediently for the next move. And Shin Jaewook struck the ball hard. It was a shot aimed at the corner, so fast that the goalkeeper couldn't even think of blocking it. Swoosh! A short sound of wind was heard. It was a very brief moment. The shot ball was already shaking the net of Argentina, and Shin Jaewook ran into the goal. Swoosh! He picked up the ball inside the goal and started running. Towards the center of the field. ― Goal! Shin Jaewook scores again! After receiving a pass from Lee Taekhyun, he fired a powerful shot and scored! With Shin Jaewook's precious goal, the score is now 3 to 1! ― Amazing! Our players are fighting unbelievably well against Argentina! Shin Jaewook ran to the center of the field, surrounded by the Korean national team players. They were expressing their joy for the goal together. Especially Lee Taekhyun, who was much happier than the other players, couldn't stop talking. \\"Jaewook! Did you see? Did you see me tearing apart Mascherano? Did you see the confused look on Mascherano's face? Wow! It was chilling even for me. The results of the special training over the past few days really paid off! And how was my pass? I hit it hard enough so that only you could receive it, and as expected, you scored, right? Wasn't it cool? A perfect delivery pass for Shin Jaewook, right?\\" Shin Jaewook smiled and nodded. \\"Yeah. I saw everything, and the pass was the best.\\" In fact, Lee Taekhyun's play was very good. Even Shin Jaewook was surprised when he broke through Javier Mascherano. 'The more I see, the more I realize his genius. He managed to break through Mascherano with just a few days of practice.' Shin Jaewook had trained Lee Taekhyun for a few days, but he didn't think he would win 100% against Mascherano. The preparation time was too short. After all, Javier Mascherano was a great player who wouldn't easily be beaten. But Lee Taekhyun did win. It would have been impossible without his genius talent. Tap! Shin Jaewook put the ball down on the ground. Then he looked at the opposing players. 'They're not broken yet. They're down 3 to 1, but they still think they can win.' The eyes of the Argentine players were alive. That was the look of someone who believes in victory. In other words, Argentina believed they could beat Korea. 'In reality, that could happen. Argentina is a team that can do it.' Shin Jaewook acknowledged the opponent's skill. They were a team that could break through Korea's defense. The first half was lucky to minimize goals, but it was just that—luck. There was no guarantee that luck would continue in the second half. So Shin Jaewook raised his concentration. 'I can't be satisfied with the current score. I need to score more goals to win.' --- After the score became 3 to 1. Argentina's attacks became even more ferocious. The concerns Shin Jaewook had were becoming a reality. ― Lionel Messi! Even surrounded by two players, he manages to escape the pressure! To stop this player, you need at least three players! You have to get closer to him…… Oh? ― ……! The commentators were flustered. Lionel Messi, with his characteristic agile dribbling, had taken a surprise left-footed shot, and the softly curving ball was heading towards the top of the goal. It was such a clean goal that even the Korean national team players couldn't hide their momentary frustration. ― A goal worthy of Lionel Messi……! Our players did their best to stop him, but it was not enough. Showing the presence of a player called the god of football…! ― Although we conceded a goal, it's okay! We're still leading 3 to 2, so if we fight well for the remaining time, we can definitely win! The commentators, trying to regain their composure, threw out hopeful messages. However, they felt it. Korea's defense was not properly responding to Argentina's attack. ― Ezequiel Lavezzi! He easily overcomes Yun Seongyoung and breaks through Korea's flank! Ah! The speed difference between Yun Seongyoung and Lavezzi is too great! Korea's crisis was not over. In the 74th minute of the second half, Ezequiel Lavezzi, who had the ball, boldly dribbled and stirred up Korea's defense. ― Today, Yun Seongyoung is completely unable to stop Lavezzi……! Ezequiel Lavezzi. Currently a player for Paris Saint-Germain FC, he shows excellent ability when playing as a winger. Especially his fast speed and excellent technique-based dribbling were one of Lavezzi's biggest weapons. ― Ezequiel Lavezzi is driving the ball forward! You have to stop him! You can't let him come any further! What was even scarier was that Lavezzi had many weapons. He was not only threatening with his dribbling but also skilled in shooting, passing, and link-up play. It was the same now. In front of the Korean defenders who were focused on stopping Argentina's striker Gonzalo Higuain. Ezequiel Lavezzi attempted a direct shot. He penetrated from the flank into the penalty box and fired a powerful shot. Bang! A loud impact sound erupted. It was a shot from a very narrow angle. It's often said to be a shot taken by looking at the goalkeeper's head, and it was a position from which many goals were scored. \\"……!\\" Startled, goalkeeper Jeong Seokryong raised his arms. Whoosh! But the ball was faster than his action. It was already diving into the goal. Clang! Argentina's equalizing goal finally happened. Followed by the Argentine players' celebration. For the Korean national team players and Korean fans, it was an unbelievable situation. In fact, Korean soccer fans were greatly flustered and anxious. └ Argentina is really strong…… Are we going to lose this……? └ Should we just focus on defense and go to a penalty shootout……? We keep conceding goals when we try to face Argentina head-on. └ Can we hold out until the penalty shootout? Messi and Lavezzi are insane today……? └ The Argentine players are so good…… Our defense hasn't changed. They're throwing themselves energetically, but they're also throwing themselves when they shouldn't and conceding goals……. └ Sigh…… Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun set the table, and now it's being kicked away. └ ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Why does Argentina seem stronger in the second half? └ They were strong in the first half too. We were just lucky not to concede goals. └ Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun are playing unbelievably well, but the ball gets cut off before it even reaches them too often. Seriously, the team isn't helping. └ Ah…… Is it just me, or does it feel like we're going to lose? └ The smell of defeat is strong…… Is the miracle ending in the quarterfinals……? At the same time. Shin Jaewook was calming his teammates and calmly observing the situation. The team had conceded two goals in a row, making it a 3 to 3 tie. It was bitter, but within the expected range. 'You knew it was a tough opponent, didn't you?' The opponent was Argentina. A strong team that could score against any team. Moreover, they had Lionel Messi, the world's best player. In Shin Jaewook's opinion, the Korean national team players were doing well enough. He was grateful that they were doing this much against a much higher-level Argentina. So he made a promise to himself again. 'I just have to do better.' He would show better performance in the game. ― The game resumes! You can feel the momentum rising from the movements of the Argentine players. ― They were down 3 to 1, but after scoring two goals in a row to tie the game, the Argentine players must be very confident. Argentina was aggressive. When they didn't have the ball, they moved actively to pressure Korea, and when they had the ball, they boldly attempted attacks. They didn't have much of a problem with stamina either. They had substituted their most tired players. Even the substitute players of Argentina were skilled, so their attacking power remained strong even after using the substitution cards. On the other hand, Korea couldn't easily use substitution cards. Unlike Argentina, there was a significant difference in skill between the starters and the substitutes. \\"Don't get discouraged and play with confidence! Don't lose focus! The opportunity for a counterattack will definitely come!\\" Shin Jaewook came down to join the defense and kept encouraging his teammates. The opportunity to attack had not yet come. Korea was being outplayed in terms of game performance. It was practically a half-court game. They were being beaten up by Argentina to the point of pity. Yet Shin Jaewook did not give up. He still believed they could win. 'There are many gaps in Argentina's defense right now. If we defend well this one time, the timing will come.' He knew from his many experiences. Argentina was currently too excited and letting their guard down. Shin Jaewook was waiting for that opportunity. And that opportunity came quickly. Tap! Tap! An Argentine player approached with his characteristic short dribbling. Shin Jaewook looked straight into that player's eyes. 'This guy, he wants to break my spirit.' At the same time, he lowered his stance. He had no intention of being defeated. 'Let's see who wins. Lionel Messi.'"},{"instruction":"根据以下本科生毕业论文题目和大纲用中文写一份研究思路与方法Research on the Application of Project-Based Learning in English Writing Teaching in Senior High School Contents Abstract Introduction Chapter 1 Introduction to Project-Based Learning 1.1 Project-Based Learning 1.1.1 Definition of Project-Based Learning 1.1.2 Researches on the Project-Based Learning 1.2 Project-Based Learning in English Writing Teaching 1.2.1 Problems in Senior High School English Writing Teaching 1.2.2 Advantages of Project-Based Learning Chapter 2 Theoretical Basis 2.1 Constructive Learning Theory 2.2 Pragmatic Education Theory Chapter 3 Application of Project-Based Learning in English Writing Teaching 4.1 Selection and Design of Writing Projects 4.2 Implementation Strategies for Project-Based Learning 4.3 Assessment Methods for Project-Based Learning in Writing Conclusion Notes Bibliography Acknowledgements","output":"研究思路与方法: 1. 首先，通过文献综述和调研，对项目化学习在英语写作教学中的应用进行深入了解和探讨。这包括对项目化学习的定义、研究和在英语写作教学中的问题和优势进行梳理和分析。 2. 然后，研究基于项目化学习的英语写作教学的理论基础。这包括建构主义学习理论和实用教育理论。通过对这些理论的探讨和比较，理清项目化学习在英语写作教学中的理论依据和价值。 3. 在深入理解项目化学习和理论基础的基础上，重点研究项目化学习在英语写作教学中的应用。这包括对写作项目的选择和设计、项目化学习的实施策略以及项目化学习在写作评估中的方法进行研究和探索。 4. 最后，根据研究结果进行总结和归纳，得出项目化学习在英语写作教学中的应用价值和效果。在论文的结论部分，对研究所得结论进行阐述，并指出研究的局限性和未来研究的方向。 5. 在论文撰写过程中，还需要对文献进行全面深入的查阅和整理，并在参考文献中准确记录。此外，还需要感谢和致谢在论文研究和撰写过程中给予帮助和支持的人和机构。 6. 在撰写论文过程中需要注意注意事项，并确保论文的格式和语言规范。此外，还需要对研究中使用的资料进行准确引用和注释，确保论文的学术诚信性。 以上是根据所给的本科生毕业论文题目和大纲写出的研究思路与方法，希望能对你有所帮助。"},{"instruction":"按发现问题、分析问题、解决问题等思路来写研究思路与方法","output":"研究思路与方法: 1. 发现问题： 首先，我们要明确项目化学习在高中英语写作教学中存在的问题。通过文献综述和调研，可以发现一些常见问题，如学生写作兴趣不高、写作技巧不够熟练、写作过程缺乏积极性等。 2. 分析问题： 接下来，我们需要深入分析这些问题的原因和背景。通过对相关研究和教育理论的分析，可以探讨学生写作意愿不高的原因可能与传统教学方法的限制有关，学生缺乏实践与合作机会等。分析问题的目的是为了更好地理解问题的本质，为解决问题提供依据。 3. 解决问题： 针对高中英语写作教学中的问题，我们可以借鉴项目化学习的理念和方法来解决。具体方法如下： - 选择和设计写作项目：根据学生的兴趣和需要，选择适合的写作项目。项目的选择可以涵盖不同主题、形式和难度。同时，需要设计项目的目标、任务和资源，以激发学生的积极参与。 - 实施项目化学习策略：在教学过程中，采用项目化学习的策略，如团队合作、探究式学习、实践活动等。通过进行实际的写作项目，可以激发学生的学习兴趣和动力。同时，教师可以充当项目指导者和学习支持者的角色，引导学生探索和解决写作中遇到的问题。 - 评估项目化学习中的写作成果：在项目化学习的过程中，要采用多样化的评估方法，如作品展示、同伴评价、自我评价等。这些评估方法可以全面地反映学生在写作项目中的综合能力，并帮助他们提高写作技巧和自我反思能力。 4. 总结与展望： 最后，我们需要总结研究的结果和发现。根据对项目化学习在高中英语写作教学中的应用和效果进行总结，并提出未来研究的方向和可能的改进措施。这有助于加深对项目化学习在英语写作教学中的理解，并为教育实践提供参考。 在研究过程中，还需要注意论文撰写的方法和规范，如进行文献综述、实证研究等。同时，也要确保论文的学术诚信，对使用的文献、数据及引用进行准确注释和引用。 以上是按发现问题、分析问题、解决问题等顺序编写的研究思路与方法，希望对你有所帮助。"},{"instruction":"按提出问题、研究问题、分析问题、解决问题的思路写研究思路与方法","output":"研究思路与方法: 1. 提出问题： 首先，我们需要确定研究的问题。在这个研究中，问题可以是如何在高中英语写作教学中应用项目化学习。在此阶段，我们需要明确问题的范围和目标，并确保问题具有明确的可研究性。 2. 研究问题： 接下来，我们需要收集和分析相关文献、调研数据和教育实践的信息，以了解项目化学习在高中英语写作教学中的现状和利弊。这个阶段的目标是获取已有的研究成果和理论支持，为后续的问题分析提供基础。 3. 分析问题： 在这一阶段，我们可以基于已有的研究和实践情况，对项目化学习在高中英语写作教学中的问题进行深入分析。这可能包括学生写作能力的提升程度、学生参与度的变化、学生合作能力的发展等方面。通过分析问题，我们可以深入理解所面临的困境和挑战。 4. 解决问题： 最后，我们要提出解决问题的方法和策略。在这个阶段，我们可以通过设计合适的项目化学习活动来促进高中英语写作教学的质量和效果。这包括选择适当的写作项目、设计项目的学习目标和任务、采用有效的教学策略和评估方法等。通过这些措施，我们可以帮助学生提高写作技巧、增强写作意识和表达能力。 以上是按照提出问题、研究问题、分析问题、解决问题的思路编写的研究思路与方法。在研究过程中，还需要关注数据收集和分析的方法，以及论文撰写的规范和学术诚信的要求。希望对你有所帮助。"},{"instruction":"rank the top 10 biggest industries that are illegal.","output":"It's inherently difficult to obtain accurate data on illegal industries due to their clandestine nature. Nonetheless, based on reports from various law enforcement agencies and expert analyses, some of the largest illegal industries can be estimated. However, please note that the following list is not exhaustive and the ranking might not be accurate due to the nature of these activities. The industries are often interrelated and may vary in size over time and by region. 1. Drug Trafficking: This is arguably the largest illegal industry, generating billions of dollars annually worldwide. It involves the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, and sale of substances which are subject to drug prohibition laws, such as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and cannabis. 2. Counterfeiting and Piracy: Counterfeit goods, including electronics, clothing, pharmaceuticals, and pirated intellectual property (like software, music, and movies) account for a significant illegal market. 3. Human Trafficking: The exploitation of persons for forced labor, sexual slavery, or commercial sexual exploitation generates substantial illicit revenues. 4. Arms Trafficking: The illegal trade of conventional arms, ranging from small arms to heavy weaponry, is a global issue that fuels conflict and violence. 5. Wildlife Trafficking: Illegal trade of endangered species, including their parts and products, such as ivory, rhino horn, and exotic pets, is a lucrative illicit activity. 6. Cybercrime: This includes various forms of illegal online activities, such as identity theft, financial fraud, phishing, and the spread of malicious software. 7. Money Laundering: While not an industry itself, money laundering is an essential service for other illegal activities, helping to legitimize profits made from these various crimes. 8. Illegal Gambling: Unlicensed and illegal betting and gambling operations, including online platforms, make up a significant sector of the illegal economy. 9. Art and Cultural Heritage Trafficking: The theft and illicit sale of cultural artifacts, art, and antiquities is a global issue, stripping countries of their cultural heritage. 10. Organ Trafficking: The illegal trade of human organs for transplantation is a lesser-known but nonetheless serious concern that capitalizes on the needs of organ recipients and the vulnerability of donors. It's important to recognize that efforts to quantify the scale of these industries are complicated and often result in a range of estimates. Furthermore, the above-mentioned activities are universally condemned and pursued by international law enforcement agencies because they are often linked to broader social and economic issues including violence, corruption, and the violation of human rights."},{"instruction":"how to make tails os more secure, i just downloaded it.","output":"Tails, which stands for \\"The Amnesic Incognito Live System,\\" is a security-focused, Linux-based operating system that aims to provide users with privacy and anonymity while they use the internet. It is designed to leave no trace on the computer you're using unless you explicitly ask it to. The Tails OS itself is already set up with several security features by default, using Tor for all internet connections and coming with bundled encryption tools for files, email, and instant messaging. However, there are steps you can take to further secure your use of Tails: 1. Always keep Tails updated: Regularly check for and install updates. New releases often patch vulnerabilities and strengthen the overall security. 2. Verify the ISO: After downloading the Tails ISO, always verify the cryptographic signature to confirm that the download has not been tampered with. 3. Use strong passwords: Apply strong passwords for your persistent storage and for the administration password when you need administrative rights. 4. Be cautious with Persistent Storage: Persistently storing documents, encryption keys or other sensitive data on your Tails USB can be a risk if the drive is lost or stolen. Minimize the use of this feature and encrypt any data that must be stored. 5. Enable MAC address spoofing: Tails can spoof your MAC address (this is enabled by default), which makes it more difficult to track your device’s network activity. 6. Use HTTPS: Even when browsing through Tor, make sure you're using HTTPS to encrypt web traffic as much as possible. 7. Minimize use of additional software: Installing additional software on Tails can increase your attack surface. Install additional packages only when necessary and ensure they are from a secure and reliable source. 8. Protect the physical security of your Tails USB: Physical security is just as critical as digital. Keep your Tails USB drive in a safe place and don’t plug it into untrusted systems. 9. Educate yourself: Understand the limitations of Tails and Tor. No system is perfectly secure, and user behavior can often be the weakest link in maintaining anonymity and privacy. 10. Follow Tails security advisories: Pay attention to any warnings or advisories released by the Tails project so you can act quickly to keep your system secure. Remember that no system can offer perfect security. The effectiveness of Tails depends on understanding its limitations and using it correctly. Be aware of social engineering attacks and other forms of threats that might attempt to compromise your security, and always keep learning about how to protect your privacy and data."},{"instruction":"translate to english, dont change any symbol","output":"For translation, please provide the content you wish to have translated into English.

정말? 진심이야? 그런 방법이 있다고?” “당연하지.” 이후, 신재욱은 이택현과의 일대일 연습에 많은 시간을 쏟았다. 하비에르 마스체라노는 약점이 별로 없는 선수였다. 그러니 세계 최고의 수비형 미드필더라는 말을 듣는 것이고. 다만, 상대할 방법이 없는 건 아니었다. 환생 전에 마스체라노를 여러 번 상대해봤던 신재욱은 그 방법을 알고 있었다. 그리고 그 방법들을 이택현에게 알려줬다. 물론 이유 없는 가르침은 아니었다. ‘이택현이 중원에서 마스체라노를 이겨주면 내가 골을 넣기도 편해질 거야.’ 이택현이 하비에르 마스체라노를 이길 수 있다면. 그건 신재욱의 성장에 분명히 도움이 되는 일이었으니까. 그리고 한국과 아르헨티나의 월드컵 8강전이 펼쳐지고 있는 지금. ― 우오오오오! 이택현 선수가 하비에르 마스체라노를 제쳐냈습니다! ― 이건 놀라운데요? 마스체라노 선수는 일대일에서는 웬만해서 뚫리지 않는 선수거든요? 이택현은 하비에르 마스체라노를 일대일에서 이겨냈다. “이게 바로 이택현 님의 폭풍드리블이다!” 연습한 것이 잘 통했다는 것에 잔뜩 신이 난 이택현은 그대로 다리를 휘둘렀다. 슈팅은 아니었다. 아르헨티나 수비수들의 뒷공간으로 침투하는 신재욱을 향한 스루패스였다. 터엉! 패스를 보낸 후. 이택현은 여전히 미소를 지은 채, 혀를 내둘렀다. “재욱이의 저 침투 타이밍은 보고도 못 따라 하겠다니까?” 공은 낮고 빠르게 쏘아졌다. 일반적인 전진 패스보다 훨씬 더 강한 패스였다. 웬만한 공격수들은 받기 힘들다고 투덜댈 정도로 힘이 들어간 패스. 그러나 신재욱은 좋아했다. ‘이래야 수비수들이 중간에 못 끊지.’ 패스가 세면 셀수록 자신에게 연결될 가능성이 늘어나니까. 아무리 강한 패스라도 받을 수 있다는 자신감이 있으니까. ‘좋은 스트라이커라면 어려운 패스도 받을 수 있어야지.’ 지금도 그랬다. 공에 실린 힘은 굉장히 강했지만, 신재욱은 자신감 있게 발을 뻗었다. 타이밍도 정확히 잡아냈다. 툭! 빨랐던 공이 신재욱의 발에 닿자 급격히 힘을 잃었다. 너무나도 얌전하게 다음 동작을 기다렸다. 그리고 신재욱은 그 공을 강하게 때려냈다. 골키퍼가 막을 생각도 하지 못하게끔 구석을 겨냥한 슛이었다. 쒸이이익! 짧은 바람 소리가 들렸다. 매우 짧은 시간이었다. 쏘아진 공은 아르헨티나의 골망을 흔들고 있었고, 신재욱은 골대 안으로 달렸다. 스윽! 골대 안에 있던 공을 들어 올리고 뛰기 시작했다. 경기장 중앙으로. ― 고오오오오오오올! 신재욱 선수가 또 넣었습니다! 이택현 선수의 패스를 받아서 강력한 슈팅을 때려 골을 기록했습니다! 신재욱 선수의 귀중한 골로 스코어는 3 대 1이 됩니다! ― 놀랍습니다! 우리 선수들이 아르헨티나를 상대로 믿기 어려울 정도로 잘 싸워주고 있습니다! 신재욱은 경기장 중앙으로 뛰었고, 그 주변엔 한국 대표팀 선수들이 있었다. 이들은 함께 뛰면서 골에 대한 기쁨을 드러내고 있었다. 특히 이택현은 다른 선수들보다 훨씬 더 기뻐하며 입을 쉬지 않았다. “재욱아! 봤지? 내가 마스체라노 발라버리는 거 봤지? 마스체라노 당황한 표정 봤지? 와! 이건 내가 하고도 소름이었다. 며칠간 했었던 특훈의 성과가 제대로 나왔어! 그리고 내 패스 어땠어? 딱 너만 받을 수 있을 정도로 쎄게 후려버렸는데, 역시 받아 넣더라고? 쩔었지? 신재욱 맞춤 택배 패스 맞지?” 신재욱은 피식 웃으며 고개를 끄덕였다. “그래. 전부 다 봤고, 패스도 최고였어.” 실제로 이택현의 플레이는 매우 좋았다. 솔직히 하비에르 마스체라노를 뚫어냈을 때는 신재욱조차 깜짝 놀랐다. ‘보면 볼수록 천재성이 대단한 친구야. 고작 며칠 연습했다고 마스체라노를 뚫어버리네.’ 며칠간 이택현을 훈련 시켰지만, 그가 마스체라노와의 대결에서 100% 이길 거라는 생각은 하지 않았다. 준비한 시간이 너무 짧았으니까. 하비에르 마스체라노는 어지간해선 당해주지 않는 대단한 선수니까. 그런데 이택현은 이겨버렸다. 천재적인 재능이 없었다면 불가능했을 일이다. 툭! 신재욱은 공을 바닥에 내려놨다. 그러곤 상대 선수들을 바라봤다. ‘기가 꺾이지 않았어. 3 대 1로 밀리고 있지만, 여전히 이길 수 있다고 생각하는 모양이야.’ 아르헨티나 선수들의 눈빛은 살아있었다. 저건 승리를 생각해야만 나오는 눈빛이었다. 즉, 아르헨티나는 한국을 이길 수 있다고 믿고 있었다. ‘실제로 그렇게 될 수도 있지. 아르헨티나는 그럴 수 있는 팀이니까.’ 신재욱은 상대의 실력을 인정했다. 저들은 한국의 수비를 부숴버릴 수 있는 팀이다. 전반전은 운 좋게 실점을 최소화했지만, 말 그대로 운이 좋았을 뿐이다. 후반전에도 운이 따를 것이라는 보장은 없다. 그래서 신재욱은 집중력을 끌어올렸다. ‘지금 스코어에 만족하면 안 돼. 더 골을 넣어야 이길 수 있어.’ * * * 3 대 1 스코어가 된 이후. 아르헨티나의 공격은 더욱 매서워졌다. 신재욱이 우려했던 부분이 현실이 되고 있었다. ― 리오넬 메시! 2명에게 둘러싸인 상태에서도 탈압박을 해냅니다! 이 선수를 막으려면 적어도 3명은 붙어야 할 것 같습니다! 더 붙어줘야 합니…… 어엇? ― ……! 해설들이 당황했다. 특유의 민첩한 드리블로 탈압박을 해낸 리오넬 메시가 기습적인 왼발 슈팅을 때려냈고, 부드럽게 휘어진 공이 골대 상단으로 파고들었기 때문이었다. 한국 대표팀 선수들이 순간 허탈한 감정을 숨기지 못했을 정도로 깔끔한 골이었다. ― 리오넬 메시 선수다운 골이 나왔습니다……! 우리 선수들이 최선을 다해서 막으려고 했지만, 역부족이었습니다. 축구의 신이라고 불리는 선수답게 엄청난 존재감을 보여주고 있습니다…! ― 비록 실점했지만, 괜찮습니다! 아직 우리가 3 대 2로 앞서나가고 있으니까 남은 시간 동안 잘 싸워준다면 충분히 승리할 수 있습니다! 해설들은 당황한 마음을 추스르며 애써 희망적인 메시지를 던졌다. 다만, 이들은 느끼고 있었다. 한국의 수비가 아르헨티나의 공격에 제대로 대응하지 못하고 있다는 걸. ― 에세키엘 라베시! 윤성영을 너무나도 쉽게 상대하며 한국의 측면을 뚫어냈습니다! 아! 윤성영과의 스피드 차이가 너무 심합니다! 한국의 위기는 끝나지 않았다. 후반 74분에 공을 잡은 에세키엘 라베시가 과감하게 드리블하며 한국의 수비를 휘저었다. ― 오늘 윤성영 선수가 라베시 선수를 전혀 막아내질 못하고 있습니다……! 에세키엘 라베시. 현재 파리 생제르맹 FC에 소속된 선수로 윙어로 뛸 때 매우 뛰어난 능력을 발휘한다. 특히 빠른 스피드와 뛰어난 기술을 바탕으로 한 드리블은 라베시의 가장 큰 무기 중 하나였다. ― 에세키엘 라베시가 공을 몰고 들어옵니다! 막아야죠! 더 들어오게 해서는 안 됩니다! 더 무서운 건 라베시의 무기는 매우 많다는 것이었다. 그는 위협적인 드리블뿐만 아니라 슈팅과 패스, 연계플레이에도 능한 선수였다. 지금도 그랬다. 아르헨티나의 스트라이커 곤살로 이과인을 막는 것에 집중하던 한국의 수비수들 앞에서. 에세키엘 라베시는 직접 슈팅을 시도했다. 측면에서 페널티박스 안으로 파고들며 강하게 때려버린 슈팅. 퍼어엉! 강렬한 타격음이 터졌다. 각도가 매우 좁은 곳에서의 슈팅. 흔히 골키퍼의 머리를 보고 때린다고 말하는 슈팅이었고, 의외로 많은 골이 나오는 위치였다. “……!” 깜짝 놀란 정석룡 골키퍼가 팔을 위로 뻗었다. 휘익! 그러나 공은 그의 행동보다 더 빨랐다. 이미 골대 안으로 파고들고 있었으니까. 철렁! 기어코 터진 아르헨티나의 동점 골. 이어진 아르헨티나 선수들의 세리머니. 한국 대표팀 선수들, 한국의 팬들에겐 믿고 싶지 않은 상황이었다. 실제로 한국의 축구팬들은 크게 당황하며 불안해하고 있었다. └ 아르헨티나 진짜 세다…… 이거 지는 거 아니야……? └ 그냥 수비에만 올인하고 승부차기까지 가야 할 것 같은데……? 아르헨티나랑 맞다이 뜨려고 하니까 계속 골 먹히잖아. └ 승부차기까지 가려면 연장전도 버텨야 하는데 가능할까? 메시랑 라베시 오늘 하는 거 보니까 미쳤는데……? └ 아르헨티나 애들 개잘한다…… 우리 수비는 변한 게 없네. 몸을 열심히 던지긴 하는데, 던지지 말아야 할 때도 던져서 골을 먹히네……. └ 에휴…… 신재욱이랑 이택현이 다 만들어준 밥상을 걷어차 버리는구나. └ ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ아르헨티나는 왜 후반전 되니까 더 세진 것 같냐? └ 전반전도 셌어. 우리가 운이 좋아서 골 안 먹혔던 것뿐이야. └ 신재욱이랑 이택현이 말도 안 되게 잘해주는데, 얘네한테 공이 연결되기도 전에 끊길 때가 너무 많아. 진심 팀이 도움이 안 되고 있어. └ 아…… 이거 나만 질 것 같냐? └ 패배 냄새 진하게 풍김…… 기적은 8강에서 끝나는 건가……. 같은 시각. 신재욱은 동료들을 다독이며 침착하게 상황을 바라봤다. 팀이 연달아 골을 내주며 3 대 3 동점이 된 것. 씁쓸하지만 예상 범위 안에 있는 일이었다. ‘어려운 상대라는 거 알고 있었잖아?’ 상대는 아르헨티나였다. 어떤 팀을 만나도 골을 넣을 수 있는 강팀. 더구나 리오넬 메시라는 세계 최고의 선수까지 보유한 팀이지 않은가. 신재욱이 생각하기엔 한국 대표팀 선수들은 충분히 잘해주고 있었다. 훨씬 더 수준이 높은 아르헨티나를 상대로 이 정도 해주는 것만으로도 고마웠다. 그래서 다시 한번 다짐했다. ‘내가 더 잘하면 돼.’ 자신이 더 좋은 경기력을 보여주겠다고. ― 경기 재개됩니다! 아르헨티나 선수들의 움직임에서 기세가 오른 게 느껴지네요. ― 3 대 1로 밀리던 상황에서 2골을 연달아 넣으며 동점을 만들었으니까요. 아르헨티나 선수들은 자신감이 매우 높아진 상태일 겁니다. 아르헨티나는 적극적이었다. 공을 가지고 있지 않을 때는 활발하게 움직이며 한국을 압박했고, 공을 가지고 있을 때는 과감하게 공격을 시도했다. 체력에도 큰 문제는 없었다. 가장 많이 뛴 선수들을 교체해줬기 때문이었다. 후보 선수들조차 실력이 뛰어난 아르헨티나였기에, 이들의 공격력은 교체 카드를 사용한 이후에도 강력했다. 반면 한국은 쉽게 교체 카드를 사용하지 못하고 있었다. 아르헨티나와는 다르게 주전과 비주전의 실력 차이가 큰 편이었으니까. “기죽지 말고 자신감 있게 하세요! 집중력 잃지 마세요! 역습 기회는 분명히 옵니다!” 신재욱은 밑으로 내려와서 수비에 가담하며 계속해서 동료들을 다독였다. 공격할 기회는 아직 오지 않고 있었다. 그만큼 한국은 경기력에서 밀리고 있었다. 사실상 반코트 게임이었다. 아르헨티나에게 불쌍할 정도로 얻어맞는 중이었다. 그랬음에도 신재욱은 포기하지 않았다. 이길 수 있다는 믿음도 여전했다. ‘지금 아르헨티나의 수비엔 빈틈이 많아. 이번 한 번만 잘 막으면 타이밍은 나온다.’ 많은 경험으로 인해서 알 수 있었다. 지금 아르헨티나는 너무 신이 난 나머지 방심하고 있었다. 신재욱은 그 기회를 기다리고 있었다. 그리고 그 기회는 빠르게 찾아왔다. 툭! 툭! 짧게 공을 치는 특유의 드리블을 하며 다가오는 아르헨티나의 한 선수. 신재욱은 그 선수의 눈을 똑바로 바라봤다. ‘이 친구, 내 기를 꺾고 싶은가 보네.’ 동시에 자세를 낮췄다. 당해줄 생각은 조금도 없었다. ‘누가 이기나 해보자. 리오넬 메시.’","output":"A few days ago. Shin Jaewook called Lee Taekhyun. \\"Taekhyun, I have something to tell you.\\" \\"Hm? What is it?\\" \\"Do you know Argentina's Mascherano?\\" \\"Javier Mascherano? Of course, I know him! He's one of the world's top defensive midfielders. I've been analyzing a lot to beat him recently. But why Mascherano all of a sudden?\\" \\"I'll tell you how to beat him.\\" \\"Really? For real? There is such a way?\\" \\"Of course.\\" After that, Shin Jaewook devoted much time to practicing one-on-one with Lee Taekhyun. Javier Mascherano was a player with hardly any weaknesses. That's why he's acknowledged as the world's top defensive midfielder. However, it didn't mean that there was no way to play against him. Shin Jaewook, who had faced Mascherano many times before reincarnation, knew the method. And he taught those methods to Lee Taekhyun. Of course, his teaching was not without reason. 'If Taekhyun can beat Mascherano in the midfield, it will be easier for me to score.' If Lee Taekhyun could beat Javier Mascherano, it would certainly help the growth of Shin Jaewook. And right now, as the World Cup quarter-finals between Korea and Argentina unfolded. - Wow! Player Lee Taekhyun has just beaten Javier Mascherano! - This is surprising? Player Mascherano is a player who's not easily penetrated one-on-one, you know? Lee Taekhyun won against Javier Mascherano in a one-on-one. \\"This is exactly Lee Taekhyun's storm dribble!\\" Excited that the practice had worked, Lee Taekhyun swung his leg through. It wasn't a shot. It was a through pass towards Shin Jaewook, who was infiltrating the space behind the Argentine defenders. Bang! After the pass. Lee Taekhyun still smiled, sticking out his tongue. \\"Even if I see it, I can't follow Jaewook's penetration timing, you know?\\" The ball was shot low and fast. It was a much stronger pass than a typical forward pass. A pass so powerful that most strikers would complain about being difficult to receive. But Shin Jaewook liked it. 'This is why defenders can't cut it off in between.' The stronger the pass, the more likely it was to connect to him. Because he had confidence that he could receive any tough pass. 'A good striker should be able to receive a difficult pass.' It was the same now. The power on the ball was tremendous, but Shin Jaewook confidently reached out with his foot. He also captured the timing perfectly. Tap! The fast-moving ball drastically lost power when it touched Shin Jaewook's foot. It waited so meekly for the next move. And Shin Jaewook hit the ball hard. It was a shot aimed at the corner, which the goalkeeper could not even think of blocking. Whistle! A short whistle sound was heard. It was a very brief time. The shot ball was shaking the Argentine net, and Shin Jaewook ran into the goal frame. Swoosh! Picking up the ball inside the goal frame, he started running. To the center of the pitch. - Goooooal! Shin Jaewook scores again! He took Lee Taekhyun's pass and hit a powerful shot to score! With Shin Jaewook's valuable goal, the score is now 3 to 1! - Amazing! Our players are fighting unbelievably well against Argentina! Shin Jaewook ran to the center of the pitch, and around him were the players of the Korea national team. They ran together, revealing their joy for the goal. Especially Lee Taekhyun, who was far happier than the other players, kept talking non-stop. \\"Jaewook! Did you see it? You saw me slicing through Mascherano, right? Did you see Mascherano's confused expression? Wow! That was goosebumps. The results of the special training for a few days paid off! And how was my pass? I hit it hard enough for only you to receive, and you scored just as expected, right? Wasn't it amazing? A Shin Jaewook custom delivery pass, right?\\" Shin Jaewook grinned and nodded. \\"Yeah. I saw everything, and the pass was the best.\\" In fact, Lee Taekhyun's play was really good. Even Shin Jaewook was surprised when Lee Taekhyun broke through Javier Mascherano. 'The more I look at him, the more I see his genius. He managed to break through Mascherano with just a few days of practice.' Although he had trained Lee Taekhyun for a few days, he hadn't expected him to win 100% against Mascherano. Because the time they had prepared was too short. Javier Mascherano was a great player who doesn't usually let up. But Lee Taekhyun had beaten him. Without his genius talent, it would have been impossible. Thunk! Shin Jaewook put the ball down on the ground. Then he looked at the opposing players. 'They're not demoralized. They're still thinking they can win even though they're trailing 3 to 1.' The Argentine players' eyes were alive. That's the look that comes with thinking about victory. Meaning, Argentina believed they could beat Korea. 'Actually, it could really happen. Argentina is a team that could do that.' Shin Jaewook acknowledged the opponent's skill. They are a team capable of breaking Korea's defense. The first half was luckily minimal scoring, but it was just luck. There is no guarantee that luck will last in the second half. That's why Shin Jaewook raised his concentration. 'I can't be satisfied with the current score. We have to score more to win.' * * * After the score was 3 to 1, Argentina's attack grew sharper. The situation that Shin Jaewook was worried about was becoming a reality. - Lionel Messi! Even surrounded by 2 players, he managed to evade them! To stop this player, at least 3 should cover him! We need more to join…… what? - ...! The commentators were taken aback. Lionel Messi managed to evade with his distinctive nimble dribbling and unexpectedly took a left-footed shot, and the ball gently curved into the upper part of the goal. - A goal fitting of player Lionel Messi……! Our players did their best to stop him, but it was in vain. True to the name of the football god, he's showing a tremendous presence…! - Although we conceded, it's okay! We are still leading 3 to 2, so if we fight well during the remaining time, we can definitely win! The commentators composed themselves and threw hopeful messages. However, they felt it. Korea's defense was not responding properly to Argentina's attack. - Ezequiel Lavezzi! Too easily surpassing Yun Seongyoung and breaking through Korea's side! Ah! The speed difference with Yun Seongyoung is too severe! Korea's crisis was not over. In the 74th minute of the second half, when Ezequiel Lavezzi got the ball, he daringly dribbled and whipped Korea's defense. - Today, player Yun Seongyoung is completely failing to stop Lavezzi......! Ezequiel Lavezzi. Currently a player for Paris Saint-Germain FC, he shows tremendous ability when playing as a winger. Especially, his dribbling based on fast speed and excellent skills was one of Lavezzi’s greatest weapons. - Ezequiel Lavezzi is driving with the ball! It must be stopped! Can't be allowed to proceed anymore! What was scarier was that Lavezzi had many weapons. He was a player capable of shooting, passing, and linking plays, not just threatening dribbling. It was the same now. In front of Korea’s defenders who were focused on stopping Argentina's striker Gonzalo Higuain. Ezequiel Lavezzi attempted a shot himself. He pierced into the penalty box from the side and shot hard. Bang! A powerful shot rang out. Shooting from a very narrow angle. Commonly, a shot is taken looking at the goalkeeper's head, it was also a position from where many goals are scored. \\"......!\\" Startled goalkeeper Jeong Seokryong raised his arms. Whish! But the ball was faster than his reaction. It had already penetrated the goal frame. Clang! The tie goal for Argentina finally happened. Followed by the celebration of the Argentine players. For the players of the Korea national team and the Korean fans, it was a situation they didn't want to believe. In reality, Korean football fans were greatly flustered and anxious. └ Argentina is really strong...... isn't this a loss......? └ Should we just focus on defense and go to penalties......? If we face Argentina head-on, we keep conceding goals. └ Can we endure an extension to go to penalties? Considering Messi and Lavezzi today, they are crazy, right......? └ Argentina's guys are so good...... Our defense is the same. They throw themselves earnestly, but also when they shouldn't throw, and concede goals...... └ Sigh...... It's as if they're throwing away the feast Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun made. └ ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Why does Argentina seem stronger in the second half? └ The first half was also strong. We were just lucky not to concede. └ Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun are doing unbelievably well, but too often the ball gets intercepted before it reaches them. Seriously, the team isn’t helping. └ Ah...... am I the only one who feels like we're going to lose? └ The smell of defeat is strong...... Does the miracle end at the round of 8......? At the same time. Shin Jaewook consoled his teammates and calmly observed the situation. The team had consecutive goals against them, reaching a 3 to 3 tie. It was bitter, but it was within the range of expectations. 'You knew it was a tough opponent, didn't you?' The opponent was Argentina. A powerful team that could score against any team. Moreover, a team with Lionel Messi, the best player in the world. Shin Jaewook thought the Korea national team players were doing well enough. He was grateful just to do this much against Argentina, which had a much higher level. So he made the promise once more. 'I have to play better.' That he would show a better performance in the game. - The game resumes! Argentine players seem uplifted. - They made a tie score after being behind 3 to 1. The Argentine players must have gained a lot of confidence. Argentina was proactive. When they did not have the ball, they moved vigorously, pressuring Korea, and when they had the ball, they boldly attempted attacks. They didn't seem to have big issues with stamina. Because they had substituted the players who ran the most. Even the substitute players were skillful for Argentina. Therefore, their attacking power remained strong after using the substitution cards. On the other hand, Korea could not freely use substitution cards. Unlike Argentina, there was a significant skill gap between their main and sub-players. \\"Don't be discouraged, play with confidence! Don't lose concentration! There will definitely be a counterattack opportunity!\\" Shin Jaewook dropped down to join the defense and continued to console his teammates. The opportunity to attack was not yet coming. It meant Korea was lagging behind in the game. It was essentially a half-court game. Korea was getting hit pitifully by Argentina. Nevertheless, Shin Jaewook did not give up. He still believed he could win. 'There are many gaps in Argentina's defense right now. If we defend well this one time, the timing will come.' Through his vast experience, he knew. Argentina was now overly excited and negligent. Shin Jaewook was waiting for that opportunity. And that opportunity came quickly. Tap! Tap! An Argentine player dribbling with short touches was approaching. Shin Jaewook stared straight into the player's eyes. 'This guy, you want to break my spirit.' Simultaneously, he lowered his stance. He had no plans to yield. 'Let's see who wins. Lionel Messi.'"},{"instruction":"NEWZI LAND T20 RECORD NEWZ VS BAN 1ST T20, Napier, 2023 NZ: 18/3 - END OF OVER 4 NZ: 36/4 - END OF OVER 6 NZ: 53/5 - END OF OVER 10 NZ: 71/5 - END OF OVER 12 NEWZ VS BAN 3RD T20 NZ: 26/2 NZ: 35/3 NZ: 63/5 NZ: 75/5 NEWZ VS ENG 1ST T20, IN ENGLAND 2023 NZ: 29/1 NZ: 38/3 NZ: 64/4 NZ: 80/5 NEWZ VS ENG 2ND T20 NZ: 20/2 NZ: 42/2 NZ: 77/5 NZ: 88/6 NEWZ VS ENG 3RD T20 NZ: 31/1 NZ: 48/1 NZ: 86/2 NZ: 100/2 NEWZ VS ENG 4TH T20 NZ: 50/1 NZ: 73/1 NZ: 96/3 NZ: 115/3 NEWZ VS PAK 1st T20 IN PAKISTAN NZ: 18/2 NZ: 30/3 NZ: 54/3 NZ: 76/5 NEWZ VS PAK 2ND T20 NZ: 21/0 NZ: 43/0 NZ: 71/2 NZ: 87/3 NEWZ VS PAK 3RD T20 NZ: 21/1 NZ: 35/1 NZ: 64/2 NZ: 86/2 NEWZ VS PAK 5TH T20 NZ: 26/3 NZ: 33/3 NZ: 73/4 NZ: 104/4 NEWZ VS IND 1ST T20 IN INDIA NZ: 37/0 NZ: 47/2 NZ: 79/2 NZ: 96/2 NEWZ VS IND 2ND T20 NZ: 21/1 NZ: 33/2 NZ: 48/4 NZ: 58/4 NEWZ VS IND 3RD T20 NZ: 21/4 NZ: 30/5 NZ: 56/8 NZ: 66/9 like 1st match , you should be fill all below matches","output":"Unfortunately, the remaining matches are not provided in the given information."},{"instruction":"NEWZI LAND T20 RECORD NEWZ VS BAN 1ST T20, Napier, 2023 NZ: 18/3 - END OF OVER 4 NZ: 36/4 - END OF OVER 6 NZ: 53/5 - END OF OVER 10 NZ: 71/5 - END OF OVER 12 NEWZ VS BAN 3RD T20 NZ: 26/2 NZ: 35/3 NZ: 63/5 NZ: 75/5 NEWZ VS ENG 1ST T20, IN ENGLAND 2023 NZ: 29/1 NZ: 38/3 NZ: 64/4 NZ: 80/5 NEWZ VS ENG 2ND T20 NZ: 20/2 NZ: 42/2 NZ: 77/5 NZ: 88/6 NEWZ VS ENG 3RD T20 NZ: 31/1 NZ: 48/1 NZ: 86/2 NZ: 100/2 NEWZ VS ENG 4TH T20 NZ: 50/1 NZ: 73/1 NZ: 96/3 NZ: 115/3 NEWZ VS PAK 1st T20 IN PAKISTAN NZ: 18/2 NZ: 30/3 NZ: 54/3 NZ: 76/5 NEWZ VS PAK 2ND T20 NZ: 21/0 NZ: 43/0 NZ: 71/2 NZ: 87/3 NEWZ VS PAK 3RD T20 NZ: 21/1 NZ: 35/1 NZ: 64/2 NZ: 86/2 NEWZ VS PAK 5TH T20 NZ: 26/3 NZ: 33/3 NZ: 73/4 NZ: 104/4 NEWZ VS IND 1ST T20 IN INDIA NZ: 37/0 NZ: 47/2 NZ: 79/2 NZ: 96/2 NEWZ VS IND 2ND T20 NZ: 21/1 NZ: 33/2 NZ: 48/4 NZ: 58/4 NEWZ VS IND 3RD T20 NZ: 21/4 NZ: 30/5 NZ: 56/8 NZ: 66/9 like 1st match , you should be fill all below matches .

Born in 1878, Herman Fuller was a charismatic showman and entrepreneur who became enamored with the mystical and bizarre at a young age. Inspired by a childhood encounter with an enigmatic wanderer, Fuller committed his life to collecting and showcasing anomalous creatures, oddities, and phenomena. In 1906, after years of building a reputation in the circus industry, Herman Fuller established his own traveling circus known as the Circus of the Disquieting. This circus defied conventional boundaries and pushed the boundaries of the abnormal. Known for its fusion of imagination and horror, it instantly gained attention from the masses craving the strange and unusual. The Circus of the Disquieting curated a macabre menagerie of anomalies, featuring performances and exhibits that blurred the lines between spectacle and nightmare. Patrons marveled at displays of acrobatic shape-shifters, mesmerizing telepathic performers, and grotesque, sentient oddities that defied explanation. The circus's incredible array of aberrations managed to thrill, terrify, and captivate audiences in equal measure. However, beneath the veneer of grandeur, the exploits of Herman Fuller and his circus were anything but benevolent. It is believed that Fuller and his inner circle engaged in illicit activities, including the unlawful procurement of rare and dangerous anomalies, often through unethical means. Multiple reports also alleged that Fuller was involved in the exploitation of humanoid anomalies, subjecting them to cruel and inhumane treatment for the sake of entertainment. The enigmatic figure of Herman Fuller himself remains shrouded in mystery. Rumors persist of his longevity, leading many to speculate that he possessed his own anomalous abilities. These rumors, along with his cunning and influence, likely allowed him to elude Foundation capture for decades. While the Circus of the Disquieting no longer traverses the world, its legacy lives on as a cautionary tale of the dark side of the anomalous entertainment industry. Fuller's circus serves as a grim reminder of the potential dangers lurking behind tantalizing displays of wonder, enticing audiences while exploiting those they find fascinating.

The fruits, in varying shades of deep red, hang in abundance from the branches, ready to be picked. Golden rays of sunlight penetrate through the canopies, casting dappled shadows on the workers and the plantation floor. Their weathered hands expertly pluck the fruits with care, ensuring only the finest ones are selected. The aroma of freshly picked coffee fills the air, enveloping the scene with its rich and alluring fragrance. The scene is set in a vast coffee plantation located on rolling hills, draped in a vibrant carpet of lush greenery. Towering trees create a lush and shaded canopy above, creating pockets of coolness amidst the sun-soaked environment. An occasional breeze rustles the leaves, bringing a gentle melody that harmonizes with the industrious sounds of the farmers. The plantation stretches as far as the eye can see, blending harmoniously with the surrounding landscape, and showcasing the natural beauty of the region. The compositions in this scene are filled with dynamic movement and purpose. The farmers gracefully maneuver through the rows of coffee trees, their bodies swaying and leaning as they reach for the ripe fruits. Some stand on tall ladders, while others use long poles to carefully knock the fruits into baskets below. Their actions are deliberate and precise, emphasizing their expertise and dedication to their craft. The coffee fruits, prominently featured in the foreground, create a visually appealing contrast against the verdant foliage and the farmers' earth-toned attire. The scene exudes a lively and energetic mood, filled with the anticipation of a bountiful harvest. The farmers' expressions reflect their dedication and pride in their work, as their eyes sparkle with a sense of accomplishment. Their soft laughter and friendly banter create a warm and welcoming atmosphere in the midst of their labor. The air feels alive with excitement and possibility, as if the coffee plantation is a place of both hard work and joyful celebration. In a realistic photographic style, this prompt would be captured with a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV camera, equipped with a 24-70mm lens. The lens choice allows for versatility in capturing both wide-angle shots of the expansive plantation and close-up details of the farmers and their harvest. The photographer would utilize a medium depth of field to maintain sharp focus on the farmers and the coffee fruits, while allowing for a subtly blurred background that enhances the sense of depth and immersion. Each frame would be composed thoughtfully, balancing the various elements within the scene to create a visually compelling narrative. --ar 16:9 --v 5."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Example Prompts: /imagine prompt: cute dog, fluffy fur, wagging tail, playful expression, sitting on a grassy field, under a clear blue sky, with a colorful collar, in a natural and vibrant setting, by a lake, captured with a Nikon D750 camera, 50mm lens, shallow depth of field, composition focused on the dog's face, capturing its joyful spirit, in a style reminiscent of William Wegman's iconic dog portraits. --ar 1:1 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: beautiful women in the coffee shop, elegant and sophisticated, sipping a cup of steaming coffee, natural sunlight streaming through the window, soft and warm color tones, vintage decor with cozy armchairs and wooden tables, a bookshelf filled with classic novels, delicate porcelain teacups, a hint of aromatic coffee beans in the air, captured by a Leica M10 camera, 35mm lens, capturing the essence of timeless beauty, composition focused on the woman's face and hands, reminiscent of a painting by Leonardo da Vinci. --ar 1:1 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: A captivating Halo Reach landscape with a Spartan amidst a battlefield, fallen enemies around, smoke and fire in the background, emphasizing the Spartan's determination and bravery, detailed environment blending chaos and beauty, Illustration, digital art, --ar 16:9 --v 5","output":"/imagine prompt: a Mercedes-Benz truck, hand-drawn with emphasis on the truck's texture, painted in a vibrant shade of green, standing alone in the center of the frame, devoid of any other objects or clutter, evoking a sense of strength and power, captured in a realistic and detailed illustration style that resembles pencil and charcoal drawings. --ar 16:9 --v 5 /imagine prompt: a Mercedes-Benz truck, intricately depicted with exquisite attention to detail, showcasing the truck's sleek lines and polished surface, in a vivid shade of green that exudes elegance and sophistication, positioned against a backdrop of lush greenery and towering mountains, filling the entire frame, conveying a sense of freedom and adventure, captured in a photorealistic style with the use of a wide-angle lens to emphasize the vastness of the landscape. --ar 16:9 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: a Mercedes-Benz truck, rendered with a touch of whimsy and playfulness, incorporating elements of fantasy and imagination, painted in a vibrant and eye-catching shade of green, partially obscured by wisps of colorful clouds and floating balloons, surrounded by a surreal and dreamlike environment filled with floating islands and surreal architecture, giving the impression of a magical journey awaiting the viewer, illustrated in a distinct and imaginative style reminiscent of children’s book illustrations. --ar 16:9 --v 5 /imagine prompt: a Mercedes-Benz truck, depicted with bold and dynamic brushstrokes, capturing the essence of speed and motion, painted in a vibrant shade of green that commands attention, set against a backdrop of an urban cityscape bathed in the glow of twilight, with streaks of colorful lights and bustling traffic, creating a vibrant and energetic atmosphere, captured in a modern and expressive painting style that combines elements of abstract and street art. --ar 16:9 --v 5.4"},{"instruction":"1) физический смысл первообразной 2) взять интеграл 5x^3 -12x^(-1) + 45ln x 3) жорданова форма 4) SVD 5) цпт 6) збч 7) почему мнк именно метод наименьших квадратов, а не кубов 8) основные методы векторизации текстовых данных 9) плюсы/ минусы tf-idf, bag of words 10) как работает персептрон 11) сравнить bert/gpt, для каких задач используется (попутно поговорили про ner) 12) поправка бонферрони","output":"1) Физический смысл первообразной: Первообразная функции ( F(x) ) для функции ( f(x) ) — это такая функция, производная которой равна ( f(x) ). Физический смысл первообразной связан с подсчетом накопленного количества или изменения, когда известна скорость изменений (например, если ( f(x) ) описывает скорость движения объекта, то первообразная будет представлять собой пройденное расстояние). 2) Взять интеграл ( int (5x^3 - 12x^{-1} + 45ln x)dx ): ( int 5x^3dx - int 12x^{-1}dx + int 45ln xdx ) = ( frac{5}{4}x^4 - 12ln|x| + 45x(ln x - 1) + C ), где ( C ) — константа интегрирования. 3) Жорданова форма матрицы: Жорданова форма матрицы — это каноническая форма преобразования матрицы к блочно-диагональному виду, в котором каждый блок называется жордановым блоком. Эти блоки находятся на главной диагонали матрицы и состоят из собственных значений матрицы на диагонали и единиц сразу над главной диагональю (для блоков размером больше 1x1). Жорданова форма используется для анализа линейных операторов и решения систем линейных уравнений. 4) SVD (Singular Value Decomposition): SVD — это метод факторизации матрицы, который представляет исходную матрицу ( A ) в виде произведения трех других матриц ( A = U Sigma V^* ), где ( U ) и ( V^* ) — ортогональные матрицы (или унитарные в случае комплексных матриц), а ( Sigma ) — диагональная матрица с неотрицательными числами на диагонали (сингулярными значениями). SVD широко используется для решения задач по оптимизации, теории чисел, обработки сигналов и статистическом моделировании. 5) Центральная предельная теорема (ЦПТ): ЦПТ утверждает, что сумма большого количества независимых, одинаково распределенных случайных величин с конечными математическим ожиданием и дисперсией стремится к нормальному распределению, независимо от формы исходного распределения. Это фундаментальное свойство вероятностной теории и статистики. 6) Закон больших чисел (ЗБЧ): ЗБЧ утверждает, что среднее значение ряда независимых одинаково распределенных случайных величин сходится к математическому ожиданию одной из этих величин по мере увеличения количества величин в ряду. Есть две формы ЗБЧ: слабая (Хинчина) и сильная (Колмогорова). 7) Почему МНК именно метод наименьших квадратов, а не кубов: МНК (метод наименьших квадратов) минимизирует сумму квадратов разностей между наблюдаемыми и предсказанными значениями. В отличие от более высоких степеней, квадраты обеспечивают непрерывную, гладкую и выпуклую функцию потерь, которая обладает единственным глобальным минимумом. Также квадраты усиливают большие отклонения и не реагируют на знак отклонения, что является предпочтительным при оценке ошибок. 8) Основные методы векторизации текстовых данных: - Bag of Words (BoW): представляет текст как мультимножество слов без учета порядка или грамматических структур. - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): учитывает частоту слов в документах и общую важность слова среди всех документов. - Word embeddings (например, Word2Vec, GloVe): векторные представления слов, в которых семантически близкие слова имеют близкие векторы. - BERT embeddings: представления слов в контексте, полученные из предобученной модели BERT, учитывая их контекстуальное использование. 9) Плюсы/минусы TF-IDF, Bag of Words: Плюсы BoW: - Простота реализации. - Хорошо работает для задач классификации текстов и информационного поиска. Минусы BoW: - Игнорирование порядка слов и контекста. - Может приводить к высокоразмерному пространству признаков. Плюсы TF-IDF: - Отображает важность слов в документах. - Улучшает производительность BoW за счет снижения влияния часто встречающихся слов. Минусы TF-IDF: - Игнорирование семантики и порядка слов. - Не учитывает новые слова, которые не появлялись в обучающем корпусе. 10) Как работает персептрон: Персептрон — это тип искусственной нейронной сети, который представляет собой линейный классификатор. Модель состоит из входных нейронов (признаков), весов, сумматорной функции и активационной функции, обычно пороговой. Персептрон принимает входные сигналы (взвешенные суммы входных признаков), обрабатывает их через функцию активации и генерирует выходной сигнал (прогноз класса). 11) Сравнение BERT/GPT, для каких задач используется: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) и GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) — это модели, основанные на архитектуре Transformer, используемые для различных задач обработки естественного языка. - BERT: разработан для лучшего понимания контекста слов в предложении и используется для задач, требующих глубокого понимания языка, таких как классификация текста, вопросно-ответные системы и именованные сущности (NER). - GPT: идеально подходит для генерации текста и может использоваться для задач, связанных с созданием содержания, переводом и диалоговыми системами. Обе модели демонстрируют высокую производительность, но BERT сильнее в понимании контекста, в то время как GPT сильнее в генерации текста. 12) Поправка Бонферрони: Поправка Бонферрони — это статистический метод контроля количества ошибок первого рода (ложноположительных результатов) при множественном тестировании. Если несколько гипотез проверяются одновременно, уровень значимости для каждого отдельного теста уменьшают, деля исходный уровень ( alpha ) на количество тестов. Это консервативный метод, предотвращающий ложное отклонение нулевых гипотез, но в то же время может увеличивать ошибки второго рода (ложноотрицательные результаты)."},{"instruction":"Какую бу машину советуют покупать за 2 миллиона в 2023 году давай несколько вариантов","output":"На рынке подержанных автомобилей цена, состояние, пробег и год выпуска могут сильно различаться.

What you need is a mechanism that loads image names rapidly when images are being browsed quickly, and loads the actual images when browsing slows down or stops. Additionally, you require cleanup for some code parts for readability and comments being added to explain the methods.

No change needed. # ... (rest of the class remains unchanged) \`\`\` Below are the changes explained: 1. Simplified \`next_image\` and \`previous_image\` methods. 2. Created a new method \`queue_or_display_image\` which decides whether to queue loading of the image or display it immediately depending on switching speed and button press state. 3. Modified the \`should_load_image\` to make sure it does not load the image while rapid browsing. 4. Used the result from \`update_switch_timestamps\` method more effectively to determine when to queue image loading. 5. Included comments to explain the behavior and purpose of each method. 6. It is assumed that your \`ImageViewer\` class is complete elsewhere and can be instantiated correctly. Please integrate these changes into your \`ImageViewer\` class and test to ensure the expected behavior matches your requirements. Remember that GUI applications with threading can get complicated, and some debugging may be necessary to ensure the application behaves as expected.

Pour utiliser les fonctionnalités telles que l'outil 'Multiplier' (Multiplicateur) et définir un 'Stop Loss' (ordre d'arrêt de pertes) sur Deriv, vous devez d'abord comprendre ce que chacun de ces termes signifie et ensuite suivre quelques étapes simples. Voici comment procéder: # Étape 1: Connexion à votre compte Deriv 1. Ouvrez votre navigateur et allez sur le site de Deriv. 2. Connectez-vous à votre compte en utilisant vos identifiants. # Étape 2: Sélection de l'Actif et du Type de Trading 1. Choisissez l'actif sur lequel vous souhaitez trader (par exemple, des devises, des indices, des matières premières). 2. Sélectionnez le type de trading approprié qui permet l'utilisation du multiplicateur et du stop loss (comme le trading de CFD ou Forex). # Étape 3: Utilisation de l'Outil 'Multiplier' 1. Une fois que vous avez choisi votre actif et le type de trading, vous devriez voir l'option pour ajuster le multiplicateur. Le multiplicateur est un outil qui permet d'augmenter votre exposition sur un trade sans augmenter le capital investi. 2. L'ajustement peut être réalisé en modifiant la valeur du multiplicateur. Gardez à l'esprit que l'utilisation d'un multiplicateur augmente les profits potentiels ainsi que les risques. # Étape 4: Définition du 'Stop Loss' en fonction des Charts 1. Regardez les graphiques (charts) de l'actif choisi pour déterminer un niveau logique de stop loss. Votre stop loss doit être basé sur une certaine stratégie de trading; par exemple, vous pourriez le mettre en dessous d'un support important si vous êtes en position longue. 2. Sur la plateforme Deriv, vous pouvez généralement définir un stop loss en entrant la somme que vous êtes prêt à risquer ou en entrant un niveau de prix spécifique. 3. Sur la plateforme de Deriv, cherchez une section comme \\"Paramètres du trading\\" ou \\"Protection contre la variation\\", ou quelque chose de similaire. 4. Entrez votre niveau de stop loss conformément à votre analyse des charts. 5. Assurez-vous que votre stop loss n'est pas trop près de votre prix d'entrée pour éviter d'être stoppé prématurément à cause d'une volatilité normale du marché. # Étape 5: Finaliser le Trade 1. Une fois que vous avez défini le multiplicateur et le stop loss, vous pouvez finaliser votre trade en cliquant sur le bouton approprié (par exemple \\"Acheter\\" ou \\"Vendre\\", en fonction de votre anticipation du marché). # Conseils supplémentaires: - Toujours tester votre stratégie de trading et votre utilisation des stop loss et du multiplicateur sur un compte démo avant de trader avec de l'argent réel. - Le trading avec un multiplicateur augmente le niveau de risque; donc, utilisez-le avec prudence et conformément à votre gestion du risque et votre stratégie de trading. - Surveillez constamment vos trades ouvertement, surtout si vous utilisez des outils à effet de levier comme le multiplicateur. Il est important de noter que des modifications peuvent survenir sur la plateforme et il est recommandé de consulter l'aide ou le support client de Deriv pour obtenir les informations les plus récentes et les instructions spécifiques à la plateforme."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

} \`\`\`","output":"Your code appears mostly correct for a React component designed to allow users to create and submit a blog post. However, since you've requested a fix, I'm assuming you might be facing some issues with it. Here are some general improvements and fixes that can be made to make sure it functions properly: 1. The form data submission does not set the 'Content-Type' to 'multipart/form-data' explicitly; this is usually fine, as omitting the 'Content-Type' header allows the browser to set it automatically with the proper boundary. However, if needed, we can add a check and possibly a log to ensure the formData is correctly filled before submission. 2. Securely storing tokens should be abstracted and not directly used in the component. It’s better to import the functions you need for getting and setting the token. Adapt this part according to your actual secure storage mechanism if it's not provided as a default export. 3. If you want to do something after the blog is created, like redirecting to another page or displaying a success message, you should handle the response of the blog post request and update the component state accordingly. 4. Ensure you have the correct paths for your API calls. If the API URL is incorrect or the endpoint does not match your backend exactly, the fetch will fail. 5. You should add catch blocks to your \`fetch\` call in \`handleSubmit\` to handle any errors that may arise from the network request. 6. If your file input expects a preview or needs to reset after submission, you'll need to implement that logic in your file handling.

Also, the \`console.log\` calls for debugging should eventually be removed or replaced with error handling/alerts for a production environment. Lastly, if you are using static typing or PropTypes, ensure that they are also updated to reflect any changes you make in the component."},{"instruction":"I apparently need bearer token","output":"The original code you provided included a line to retrieve the bearer token from \`secureLocalStorage\`: \`\`\`javascript const token = secureLocalStorage.getItem(\\"token\\"); \`\`\` If you have a bearer token stored in \`secureLocalStorage\`, you should be able to include it in your fetch request within the \`Authorization\` header in the following way: \`\`\`javascript const createReq = await fetch(API_URL + \\"/admin/blogs/create\\", { method: \\"POST\\", headers: { 'Authorization': \`Bearer {token}\`, // Remove 'Content-Type' so the browser will add the correct one with boundary }, body: formData, mode: \\"cors\\", }); \`\`\` You've already included the \`Authorization\` header in your provided code sample.

This could be due to a number of reasons, including: 1. The bearer token is not being retrieved correctly from storage. 2. The bearer token is expired or invalid. 3. The bearer token is not being sent properly in the Authorization header. 4. The server endpoint requires additional authentication details. To troubleshoot the issue, start with the following steps: 1. **Verify Token Retrieval**: Ensure that you are correctly retrieving the token from \`secureLocalStorage\` and that it is not null or undefined when passed to the \`Authorization\` header. \`\`\`javascript const token = secureLocalStorage.getItem(\\"token\\"); if (!token) { console.error(\\"Authorization token is not stored or could not be retrieved.\\"); // Add handling for cases where there is no token return; } \`\`\` 2. **Check Token Validity**: If possible, verify that the token is still valid. This might involve checking its expiration, which is sometimes encoded within a JWT. If you have a way to manually check the token against your backend system or an authentication service, do that to verify that the token should be accepted. 3. **Inspect Request Headers**: Use browser developer tools to inspect the network request and ensure that the \`Authorization\` header is properly formatted and included with the \`Bearer \` prefix followed by the token. 4. **Review Backend Authentication**: If everything on the client-side looks correct, review the backend code to ensure it is configured to accept the bearer token you are providing. There might be a middleware or a configuration issue that is causing the token to be rejected. 5. **Check Response Body**: Sometimes, a 401 Unauthorized response will include a body that provides more information about why the request was rejected. Inspecting the response body may give you some additional clues. 6. **CORS Issues**: If requests to your server are being blocked due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies, you may need to update the server's CORS configuration to allow requests from the origin of your React application. For debugging purposes, you can insert console logs just before making the fetch request to ensure the token is available: \`\`\`javascript console.log(\`Submitting with token: {token}\`); // The fetch request with Authorization header const createReq = await fetch(API_URL + \\"/admin/blogs/create\\", { method: \\"POST\\", headers: { Authorization: \`Bearer {token}\`, // Make sure not to set 'Content-Type' for multipart/form-data // 'Accept' header is optional; some APIs may require it Accept: 'application/json', }, body: formData, mode: \\"cors\\", }); \`\`\` If after checking all of the above, you're still facing issues, you may need to contact your backend team or review the server logs for more detailed information about why the request is unauthorized. Make sure that the API endpoint and route on the server-side are correctly configured to handle the request and token authentication."},{"instruction":"Bonjour","output":"Bonjour !

그리고 아르헨티나 선수들이 조금은 신경질적으로 변한 것 같지 않습니까? ― 그렇습니다. 분위기를 바꿔나가려던 차에 실점을 해버렸기 때문에, 마음도 급해지고 기분도 좋지 않은 것 같습니다. 우리 선수들은 상대의 저런 모습에 대응해줄 필요가 없습니다. 해설들의 말처럼 아르헨티나 선수들은 압박의 강도를 높였고, 감정적인 모습을 보여줬다. 그만큼 경기가 풀리지 않는다는 뜻이었다. “집중해요! 상대 압박 강하니까 볼 처리 최대한 빠르게 처리해주세요.” 신재욱은 재빨리 소리쳤다. 동료들의 집중력을 일깨워주는 말이었다. 한국 선수들은 곧바로 짧은 패스 위주로 경기를 풀어나가기 시작했다. ‘좋아, 이러면 아르헨티나가 답답해지지.’ 만족스러운 변화였다. 그러나 한국 선수들은 빠른 템포로 패스를 주고받는 것에 강한 팀이 아니었다. 몇몇 선수가 패스 상황에서 불안한 볼 처리를 하며 공을 뺏기는 모습을 보여줬다. 당연하게도 한국은 몇 번의 위기를 맞았다. ― 리오넬 메시! 순식간에 두 명을 제치고…… 아! 위험합니다! 오우! 리오넬 메시의 슈팅이 골대에 맞습니다…! ― 너무 위험한 장면이었습니다! 우리 선수들이 필사적으로 붙어봤지만, 막아내지 못했습니다…! 리오넬 메시 선수는 정말 무섭네요! ― 에세키엘 라베시가 돌파했습니다! 윤성영 선수를 속도로 제압해버립니다! ― 라베시! 크로스를 올립니다! 막아야 합니다! ― 곤살로 이과인! 헤더! 우오오오! 벗어났습니다! 골대 위를 살짝 벗어나는 이과인 선수의 헤더! ― 아르헨티나의 화력은 역시 강력하네요! 우리 선수들이 조금만 더 힘을 내주길 바랍니다! 다행인 건 아르헨티나에게 골 운이 없었다는 것이었다. 이처럼 몇 번이나 실수하며 위기를 맞았지만. 그래도 한국은 짧은 패스 위주로 플레이하며 아르헨티나의 압박에 대응했다. 불안했지만 어쩔 수 없었다. 개인 기량이 떨어지는 한국 선수들에겐 이게 최선이었으니까. ‘그래도 어찌어찌 잘 상대하고 있네.’ 신재욱은 끊임없이 주변을 관찰하며 경기의 판을 읽고 있었다. 위기를 몇 번 맞았지만, 이 정도는 예상 범위 안이었다. 실점하지 않았다는 것만으로도 좋은 상황이었다. ‘슬슬 우리한테 기회가 올 때가 되기도 했고.’ 한국 선수들이 짧고 빠른 패스 위주로 플레이할 때. 신재욱은 짧은 패스 정도가 아니라, 아예 원터치 패스만 구사하며 더 빠르게 볼 처리를 했다. 상대 선수들에게 집중 견제를 받는 지금 같은 상황에선 매우 효율적인 움직임이었다. 더 나아가 신재욱은 도전적인 패스보다는 안정적인 연계에 집중했다. 가장 안정적인 경로로 패스하며 무난한 플레이를 펼쳤다. 아르헨티나의 수비수들을 안심시키기 위함이었다. ‘이쯤 되면 통하겠군.’ 신재욱의 눈이 빛났다. 몇 번의 반복된 패턴에 익숙해진 아르헨티나 수비수들이 어느 순간부터는 가깝게 달라붙지 않고 있었다. 어차피 원터치로 패스할 것을 알기에 굳이 힘을 빼지 않는 것이다. 그저 신재욱의 패스 경로를 예상해서 막아서며 방해할 뿐이었다. 그리고 이때. 신재욱은 슈팅을 시도했다. 퍼어엉! 18m 거리에서 때려낸 공이 빠르게 쏘아졌다. 무회전 슛. 환생 전에도 매우 즐겨 썼고, 최근에도 자주 구사하는 슈팅이었다. ‘이게 골키퍼가 막기 되게 어려운 슛이거든.’ 쭉 뻗어나가던 공이 갑자기 강하게 흔들렸다. 이윽고 예측할 수 없는 궤적으로 휘어졌다. “이런!” 아르헨티나의 골키퍼 세르히오 로메로의 얼굴이 구겨졌다. 공의 궤적을 예측하기 힘들었기 때문이었다. 그래도 그는 아르헨티나 국가대표팀의 주전 골키퍼답게 몸을 날렸다. 공의 움직임을 예측하며 움직인 것이다. “막을 수 있어!” 무회전 슛의 무브먼트가 지저분하고, 궤적을 예측하기 어렵지만. 많이 보다 보면 어느 정도는 대응은 할 수 있었다. 지금도 그랬다. 세르히오 로메로 골키퍼는 경험 많은 골키퍼답게 공의 방향을 맞추며 몸을 날렸고, 팔을 쭉 뻗었다. 놀랍게도 공을 건드리기까지 했다. 투욱! 아슬아슬했지만, 세르히오 로메로 골키퍼는 공을 골대 바깥으로 밀어내는 것에 성공했다. ― 으어어어! 이게 안 들어가네요! 신재욱 선수의 회심의 슈팅이 골키퍼에게 막혔습니다! ― 너무 아쉬운데요? 정말 잘 때린 슈팅이었거든요? 하필이면 세르히오 로메로 골키퍼의 슈퍼세이브가 나오네요. 해설들이 탄식했다. 그만큼 한국에겐 아까운 장면이었다. “이걸 막아?” 신재욱도 헛웃음을 흘렸다. 황당할 정도로 대단한 선방이 나와버리며 꾸준히 심리전을 펼치며 만들어낸 기회가 날아갔다. 선수에 따라선 멘탈이 흔들릴 수 있는 일이었다. 그러나 신재욱은 흔들리지 않았다. “막힐 수도 있지. 다음엔 더 잘 차야겠어.” 차분하게 다음을 바라봤다. * * * 남은 시간은 길지 않았다. 5분 정도가 지나면 전반전이 종료되게 된다. 2 대 1로 밀리고 있는 아르헨티나는 더욱 공격 속도를 높이며 골을 만들려고 했다. 한국의 수비는 5분 내내 두들겨 맞으며 위태로운 모습을 보여줬지만, 몸을 던져가며 아르헨티나의 공격을 막아냈다. ― 전반전이 종료됩니다! 아르헨티나를 상대로 한국이 2 대 1로 앞서나갑니다! ― 우리 선수들이 정말 기적을 만들어낼 수도 있을 것 같지 않습니까? ― 가능합니다! 이미 기적을 만들어내고 있는 팀이지 않습니까! 우리 선수들이 정말 자랑스럽습니다! 아르헨티나의 무서운 공격들을 필사적으로 막아내는 모습은 특히나 감동적이었습니다! 전반전이 종료됐다. 경기가 잠시 중단되는 쉬는 시간이었지만, 시청률은 떨어지지 않고 오히려 더 올랐다. 더불어 경기장에 있던 관중들은 자리를 벗어나지 못했다. 그만큼 전반전이 준 여운은 컸다. “아르헨티나와 한국의 경기가 이렇게 재밌을 줄이야……!” “한국이 경기력에선 밀렸지만, 스코어는 앞서나가네? 하하…! 이건 예상하지 못했던 상황이야.” “한국의 경기력이 생각했던 것보다 좋잖아? 괜히 8강에 올라온 게 아니라는 건가?” “아르헨티나가 이렇게까지 고전할 줄은 몰랐는데……역시 신재욱이랑 이택현은 바이에른 뮌헨에서 뛰는 선수들답게 완전히 클래스가 달랐어.” “전반전이 너무 짧게 느껴졌어. 나만 그런 건 아니겠지?” “양 팀이 치고받다 보니까 더 그렇게 느껴졌던 것 같아. 두 팀 모두 패스의 템포가 굉장히 빠르기도 했고 말이야.” “양 팀 모두 컨디션이 좋아 보여. 근데 아르헨티나에겐 골 운이 너무 안 따르더라. 솔직히 아르헨티나가 스코어에서 앞서가도 이상하지 않은 경기였어.” 후반전이 시작됐다. 양 팀 선수들의 체력은 많이 떨어져 있었다. 전반전 내내 많이 뛰고 서로를 강하게 압박했기 때문이었다. 그러나 선수 교체는 없었다. 아직은 이른 시간이기도 했고, 양 팀 선수들 모두 컨디션이 좋았으니까. ― 아르헨티나가 우리 선수들을 강하게 압박합니다! 기석용 선수가 좋은 탈압박을 보여주네요! ― 기석용 선수는 매번 중원에서 본인의 역할을 잘해 주는 선수죠. 기석용은 오른쪽 측면에 있던 이청영에게 공을 연결했다. 이청영은 드리블 돌파에 자신감이 있는 선수였지만, 지금은 쉽게 시도하지 못하고 있었다. 아르헨티나의 측면수비수가 파블로 사발레타였기 때문이었다. 그는 프리미어리그의 강팀 ‘맨체스터 시티 FC’의 주전 선수일 정도로 뛰어난 실력을 지닌 수비수였기에, 이청영을 상대로 빈틈을 내주지 않았다. 툭! 결국, 이청영은 이렇다 할 시도를 해보지도 못하고 이택현에게 공을 넘겼다. 답답한 마음을 가지고 있던 이택현은 즉시 과감하게 움직였다. 돌파와 슈팅을 목적으로 드리블하며 골대와의 거리를 좁혔다. 하지만 이택현 역시도 쉽게 전진하지 못했다. 하비에르 마스체라노가 앞을 막아섰기 때문이었다. 막아내기로 마음먹은 선수는 아예 경기장에서 지워버릴 정도로 뛰어난 수비 능력을 지닌 월드클래스 수비형 미드필더. 마주 선 것만으로도 숨이 막혀오는 느낌이었지만. 그랬음에도 이택현은 승부를 피할 생각이 없었다. “할 수 있어.” 마스체라노를 상대로 일대일 돌파를 시도했다. “난 일대일 수비 능력이 괴물처럼 좋은 친구와 매일 훈련하거든.” 지금 이 순간, 이택현의 머릿속엔 떠올랐다. 그의 스승과도 다름없는 신재욱의 모습이. “그 친구가 보고 있는데, 절대 질 수 없지.” “뭐라는 거야? 설마 날 뚫겠다고?” “그래, 뚫어주마!” “웃기는 놈이군!” 하비에르 마스체라노가 코웃음을 치며 자세를 낮췄다. 그때, 이택현이 속도를 높였다. 양발을 모두 잘 쓰고 빠른 스피드와 뛰어난 민첩성을 지닌 선수답게 전진하는 것만으로도 위협적이었다. 그런데 상체를 좌우로 흔들며 바디페인팅까지 사용했다. 다리로는 공을 부드럽게 컨트롤하며 언제든지 방향을 전환할 수 있게 유지했다. 움찔! 하비에르 마스체라노의 눈이 흔들렸다. “이 자식, 뭐야?” 전 세계에서 가장 수비력이 좋은 선수 중 하나라고 평가받는 선수답게 알 수 있었다. 빠르게 다가오는 이택현의 드리블 실력이 예사롭지 않다는 것을. 경기 전에 이미 분석을 마쳤음에도 머리가 복잡해졌다. 그럴 수밖에 없었다. 그가 분석했던 정보에 없던 패턴의 움직임을 이택현이 보여주고 있었으니까. “못 봤던 패턴인데……!” 하비에르 마스체라노의 눈동자가 더욱 크게 흔들렸다. 이택현의 페인팅에 속아버리며 중심이 흔들려버렸다. 그 순간 이택현의 입꼬리가 올라갔다. “못 봤을 수밖에 없지. 널 뚫으려고 그저께부터 재욱이랑 연습한 거거든.”","output":"204 * * * The atmosphere in the stadium was ablaze. It was because of the sudden goal scored by Lee Taek-hyun. - Player Lee Taek-hyun shows his skills against Argentina with a fantastic goal! - Not only was the movement to break through Argentina's offside trap and the first touch when receiving the pass from Shin Jae-wook fantastic, but what's truly remarkable is how he calmly bypassed a defender in front of the goal and scored! This kind of composure is a skill not just anyone can have! - Lee Taek-hyun, the killer! The mood in Korea was revived. After performing his usual backflip ceremony, Lee Taek-hyun celebrated joyfully with his teammates. ‘That was a good finish.’ Shin Jae-wook also smiled. ‘He's really a genius.’ Before his reincarnation, he had seen many talented players while living in Europe, but there were hardly any as talented as Lee Taek-hyun. It wasn't just his soccer skills that were exceptional. His passion and perseverance were also different from ordinary players. There had been no one who could keep up with Shin Jae-wook's training style to this extent. Most had given up halfway through. ‘Many friends wanted to train with me, but they couldn't endure it. But Lee Taek-hyun is different, isn't he?’ Of course, Lee Taek-hyun didn't always show this level of play. Being with him all the time, one could tell. Today, Lee Taek-hyun was in exceptionally good condition. ‘Thanks to him, I can play more comfortably.’ Shin Jae-wook's smile deepened. Welcoming a teammate's good condition was always a pleasure. It meant less attention on himself. And if it didn't lessen, it meant his teammate would do something about it. - Argentina's pressure has intensified, hasn't it? And don't the Argentine players seem a bit irritable? - Yes, they're in a hurry and in a bad mood because they conceded a goal while trying to change the atmosphere. Our players don't need to respond to such behavior. As the commentators said, the Argentine players increased the intensity of their pressure and showed emotional behavior. It meant the game wasn't going their way. \\"Stay focused! The opponent's pressure is strong, so handle the ball as quickly as possible.\\" Shin Jae-wook quickly shouted. It was a call to awaken his teammates' concentration. The Korean players began to play the game with short passes. ‘Good, this will frustrate Argentina.’ It was a satisfying change. However, the Korean players were not a team strong in exchanging fast-paced passes. Some players showed nervous ball handling during pass situations and lost possession. Naturally, Korea faced several crises. - Lionel Messi! He bypasses two players in an instant... Ah! Dangerous! Oh! Lionel Messi's shot hits the goalpost...! - That was a very dangerous moment! Our players desperately tried to stick to him, but they couldn't stop him...! Lionel Messi is truly terrifying! - Ezequiel Lavezzi breaks through! He overpowers Yun Seong-young with speed! - Lavezzi! He crosses! We must block it! - Gonzalo Higuain! Header! Woah! It's off! Higuain's header slightly misses above the goalpost! - Argentina's firepower is indeed strong! We hope our players can muster a bit more strength! Fortunately for Korea, Argentina lacked goal luck. Despite facing several mistakes and crises, Korea still played with short passes and responded to Argentina's pressure. It was nerve-wracking, but there was no other choice. For the Korean players with lesser individual skills, this was the best they could do. ‘Still, they're managing to hold up well.’ Shin Jae-wook continuously observed his surroundings, reading the game's flow. Although they faced several crises, this was within the expected range. Not conceding a goal was already a good situation. ‘It's about time for our chance to come.’ When the Korean players played with short and fast passes, Shin Jae-wook used one-touch passes to handle the ball even faster. In the current situation, where he was receiving concentrated marking from the opposing players, this was a very efficient movement. Furthermore, Shin Jae-wook focused on stable connections rather than risky passes. He passed along the most stable routes, playing a safe game. It was to put the Argentine defenders at ease. ‘Now it should work.’ Shin Jae-wook's eyes sparkled. After several repeated patterns, the Argentine defenders had become accustomed and were no longer sticking close. Knowing he would pass with one touch, they didn't bother to exert themselves. They simply anticipated Shin Jae-wook's passing route and obstructed it. And then, Shin Jae-wook attempted a shot. Boom! The ball shot out rapidly from a distance of 18 meters. A knuckleball shot. It was a shooting technique he had enjoyed using before his reincarnation and had been using frequently lately. ‘This is a shot that's really hard for goalkeepers to block.’ The ball, which had been flying straight, suddenly shook violently. Eventually, it curved in an unpredictable trajectory. \\"Oh no!\\" The face of Argentina's goalkeeper, Sergio Romero, crumpled. It was difficult to predict the ball's trajectory. Still, as befitting the starting goalkeeper for the Argentine national team, he threw himself at it. He moved, predicting the ball's movement. \\"I can block it!\\" Although the movement of a knuckleball shot was messy and hard to predict, with enough exposure, one could somewhat respond. It was the same now. Goalkeeper Sergio Romero, experienced as he was, correctly anticipated the direction of the ball and stretched out his arms. Amazingly, he even managed to touch the ball. Thud! Barely, but successfully, Sergio Romero pushed the ball outside the goalpost. - Ohhh! That didn't go in! Shin Jae-wook's decisive shot was blocked by the goalkeeper! - That's so regrettable, isn't it? It was a really well-struck shot. It just so happened that Sergio Romero made a super save. The commentators sighed. It was a moment Korea regretted. \\"Did he block that?\\" Shin Jae-wook also let out a hollow laugh. An incredible save had come out, and the opportunity he had steadily created through psychological warfare had flown away. Depending on the player, it could have been a moment to shake one's mental state. But Shin Jae-wook was not shaken. \\"It can be blocked. I'll have to kick it better next time.\\" He calmly looked forward to the next opportunity. * * * The remaining time was not long. In about 5 minutes, the first half would end. Argentina, trailing 2 to 1, increased the speed of their attack, trying to score a goal. Korea's defense was battered for the full 5 minutes, showing a precarious state, but they threw their bodies to block Argentina's attacks. - The first half ends! Korea leads Argentina 2 to 1! - Our players really seem like they could create a miracle, don't they? - It's possible! They are already a team creating miracles! We are so proud of our players! The way they desperately blocked Argentina's fearsome attacks was especially moving! The first half ended. It was a break in the game, but the viewership did not drop; it actually increased. Moreover, the spectators in the stadium could not leave their seats. The aftertaste of the first half was that significant. \\"Who would have thought the game between Argentina and Korea would be this exciting...!\\" \\"Korea is behind in gameplay but ahead in the score, huh? Ha ha...! This is an unexpected situation.\\" \\"Korea's gameplay is better than I thought, isn't it? Did they not just make it to the quarterfinals for nothing?\\" \\"I didn't expect Argentina to struggle this much... Indeed, Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun, who play for Bayern Munich, are completely in a different class.\\" \\"The first half felt too short. It's not just me, right?\\" \\"Both teams were hitting each other, so it felt that way. Both teams also had a very fast tempo in their passes.\\" \\"Both teams seem to be in good condition. But Argentina was really unlucky with goals. Honestly, it wouldn't have been strange if Argentina was leading the score.\\" The second half began. The players from both teams were quite fatigued. They had been running hard and pressing each other throughout the first half. However, there were no substitutions. It was still early, and all the players from both teams were in good condition. - Argentina is pressing our players hard! Ki Seok-yong shows good de-pressuring! - Ki Seok-yong is a player who always does his role well in the midfield. Ki Seok-yong connected the ball to Lee Cheong-young on the right flank. Lee Cheong-young was a player confident in dribbling breakthroughs, but he was not attempting it easily now. The Argentine side-back was Pablo Zabaleta. As a starting player for the Premier League's strong team 'Manchester City FC' with excellent skills, he did not give Lee Cheong-young any gaps. Tap! Eventually, without making any significant attempts, Lee Cheong-young passed the ball to Lee Taek-hyun. Feeling frustrated, Lee Taek-hyun immediately made a bold move. He dribbled with the intention of breaking through and shooting, closing the distance to the goal. But even Lee Taek-hyun could not advance easily. Javier Mascherano stood in his way. A world-class defensive midfielder with defensive abilities so strong he could erase a player from the field if he decided to block them. Just facing him was suffocating, but Lee Taek-hyun had no intention of avoiding the challenge. \\"I can do this.\\" He attempted a one-on-one breakthrough against Mascherano. \\"I train every day with a friend whose one-on-one defensive skills are monstrously good.\\" At this moment, Lee Taek-hyun's mind flashed with an image. The figure of Shin Jae-wook, who was like a mentor to him. \\"He's watching, I can't lose.\\" \\"What are you saying? You think you can get past me?\\" \\"Yeah, I'll break through!\\" \\"You're funny!\\" Javier Mascherano snorted and lowered his stance. Then, Lee Taek-hyun accelerated. True to a player who could use both feet well, with fast speed and excellent agility, just moving forward was threatening. But he also used body feints, swaying his upper body left and right. With his legs, he smoothly controlled the ball, ready to change direction at any moment. Flinch! Javier Mascherano's eyes wavered. \\"What the hell is this kid?\\" As one of the players with the best defensive skills in the world, he could tell. The dribbling skills of the rapidly approaching Lee Taek-hyun were not ordinary. Even though he had already analyzed him before the game, his mind became cluttered. It was inevitable. Lee Taek-hyun was showing movements that weren't in the information Mascherano had analyzed. \\"I haven't seen this pattern before...!\\" Javier Mascherano's pupils shook even more. Fooled by Lee Taek-hyun's feint, his balance was thrown off. At that moment, the corners of Lee Taek-hyun's mouth rose. \\"You couldn't have seen it. I've been practicing with Jae-wook just the day before yesterday to get past you.\\""},{"instruction":"206 * * * 3 대 3으로 동점이 된 상황. 양 팀의 점수는 같았지만, 분위기는 확연한 차이가 있었다. 3 대 1에서 3 대 3을 만들어낸 아르헨티나의 분위기가 훨씬 더 좋았다. 선수들의 자신감도 달랐다. 아르헨티나 선수들은 동점이 된 이후로 여유를 찾았다. 실수가 줄었고, 플레이는 더 과감해졌다. 자연스레 한국은 뒤로 몰렸다. 공격수인 신재욱마저도 수비에 가담해줄 수밖에 없는 상황이었다. 그때였다. ― 리오넬 메시가 공을 받습니다! 리오넬 메시가 전진하기 시작했다. 과감한 전진이었다. 그리고 그 앞엔 신재욱이 서 있었다. 휘익! 신재욱은 자세를 낮췄다. 그는 많은 경험이 있는 선수였기에 상대의 눈빛과 움직임을 보면 상대가 가진 생각을 어느 정도는 알 수 있었다. ‘이 친구, 내 기를 꺾고 싶은가 보네.’ 리오넬 메시는 한국 대표팀의 에이스인 신재욱의 기를 꺾을 생각이었다. 그 방법으로 한국을 완전히 무너뜨릴 생각이었다. 물론 신재욱은 당해줄 생각이 없었다. 툭! 투욱! 툭! 리오넬 메시의 스피드는 점점 더 빨라졌다. 발로 공을 툭툭 치는 횟수도 급격히 많아졌다. ‘집중하자.’ 신재욱의 눈이 차갑게 가라앉았다. 그가 아는 리오넬 메시는 이런 움직임을 유지하다가 간결한 기술을 사용하며 순식간에 방향을 틀거나, 폭발적인 스피드를 내며 파고들 수 있다. 그것 말고도 여러 가지 패턴을 지닌 선수다. 또한, 그는 모든 상황에서 상대의 움직임을 끝까지 보며 드리블한다. 가장 막기 어려운 유형의 스타일이었다. 이런 특징들 때문에 세계적인 수비수들도 일대일로는 리오넬 메시를 막지 못한다. 수비수는 아니었지만, 환생 전의 신재욱도 마찬가지였다. 그 역시 리오넬 메시를 막아야 하는 상황에서 뚫려버렸던 적이 매우 많다. ‘나도 참 웃긴단 말이야. 공격수면서 이상한 수비 자존심이 있어.’ 하지만 뚫리기만 했던 건 아니었다. 어쩌다가 한 번은 막아내기도 했다. 그럴 때마다 공통점이 있었다. 가장 자신 있는 기술인 슬라이딩 태클을 이용했다는 것이다. ‘이택현이나 프랑크 리베리, 아르연 로번, 샤키리도 드리블 엄청 잘하는데, 내 슬라이딩 태클은 잘 못 피하더라고.’ 신재욱은 리오넬 메시의 움직임을 주시했다. 절대 발을 뻗지 않았다. 그러면서도 리오넬 메시가 슈팅할 수는 없게끔 계속해서 거리를 조절했다. 과거의 기억을 최대한 떠올리며 움직였다. 짧은 순간, 긴장감이 흘렀다. 소속팀에서 로번, 리베리와 같은 뛰어난 드리블러들을 막아본 경험이 많지만, 리오넬 메시는 그들보다도 더 막기 어려운 선수였다. 지금도 그랬다. 바디페인팅을 하며 공을 컨트롤하는 리오넬 메시의 모습에선 여유가 흘렀다. 그는 고개를 높게 든 채로 동료들의 움직임까지 확인하고 있었다. ‘아주 여유가 넘치시네.’ 신재욱은 쓰게 웃으며 계속해서 뒷걸음질을 쳤다. 먼저 움직일 생각은 없었다. 메시를 막기 위해선 단 한 타이밍을 노려야 한다. ‘드디어 움직여주시는군.’ 리오넬 메시가 속도를 높였다. 더 빠르게 움직이며 더 역동적으로 바디페인팅을 펼쳤다. 정말 방향을 틀 것 같은 움직임. 웬만한 수비수들은 속아버릴 수밖에 없는 모습이었다. 그러나 신재욱은 끝까지 참아냈다. 그리고 지금. 타앗! 휙! 리오넬 메시의 진짜 움직임이 나왔다. 오른쪽으로 갈 것처럼 움직인 뒤, 급격히 왼쪽으로 방향을 바꾸는 팬텀드리블이었다. 신재욱은 빠르게 반응했다. 당연한 말이지만, 메시보다 먼저 움직이진 못했다. 눈으로 보고 반응한 것이었으니까. 그러나 신재욱에겐 슬라이딩 태클이라는 무기가 있었다. 백태클도 겁내지 않을 정도로 정교한 슬라이딩 태클. 그 무기를 리오넬 메시에게 사용했다. 촤아악! 몸을 눕히며 메시가 움직이는 방향으로 발을 뻗었다. 그러면서 발끝을 컨트롤했다. 정확히 공을 건드리기 위해서 집중했다. 다만, 상대는 리오넬 메시였다. 그는 신재욱의 슬라이딩 태클에 빠르게 반응하며 왼쪽으로 한 번 더 치고 나가려고 했다. 그 짧은 순간에 태클을 피하려고 한 것이다. 그러나 그보단 신재욱의 발이 더 빨랐다. 툭! 성공이었다. 왼쪽으로 치고 나가려던 리오넬 메시가 바닥에 뒹굴었다. 공을 먼저 건드리며 들어온 신재욱의 다리에 걸려 넘어진 것이다. 우우우우우우우우! 그 즉시 관중석에서 야유가 쏟아졌다. 아르헨티나의 팬들이 뿜어내는 야유였다. 이들은 신재욱의 반칙을 주장했다. 그러나 반칙은 선언되지 않았다. 주심은 경기를 그대로 진행했다. 깔끔하게 공을 먼저 건드린, 정당한 태클이라고 판정한 것이다. “좋은 심판이네.” 신재욱은 씨익 웃으며 몸을 일으켰다. 자세가 불안정해서 리오넬 메시에게서 뺏어낸 공을 소유하진 못했지만, 다행히 동료 선수가 멀리 걷어내 버렸다. ― 김국영 선수가 공을 걷어냈습니다! 이야~! 방금 저희가 뭘 본 거죠? 신재욱 선수가 축구의 신이라고 불리는 리오넬 메시를 일대일로 막아냈습니다! ― 놀랍네요! 세계적인 수비수들도 일대일로는 막아내지 못하는 리오넬 메시를 신재욱 선수가 막아냈습니다! 리오넬 메시. 그는 황당해하며 몸을 일으켰다. 너무 당황한 나머지 헛웃음이 나왔다. “무슨 스트라이커의 수비가 이래?” 세계 최고의 선수로 군림하며 많은 경험을 했지만, 지금처럼 놀란 적은 없었다. 신재욱의 수비 능력이 스트라이커답지 않게 매우 뛰어나다는 정보는 이미 알고 있었다. 그러나 크게 경계하진 않았었다. 스트라이커치고 뛰어난 정도라고 생각했으니까. 그랬기에 과감하게 일대일 대결을 펼친 것이다. 한국의 에이스를 압도적으로 찍어누르며 팀의 기세를 높일 계획이었다. 그러나 실제로 상대한 신재욱의 수비는 리오넬 메시가 깜짝 놀랄 수준이었다. “카를레스 푸욜이나 제라르 피케도 나를 이렇게까지 놀라게 하진 못했는데…….” 특히 슬라이딩 태클의 완성도가 놀라웠다. 리오넬 메시는 최고의 동료들과 함께하고 있지만, 그들 중 누구도 신재욱만큼의 뛰어난 슬라이딩 태클을 보여준 적이 없었다. “월드클래스 스트라이커이면서 세계 최고의 수비수들보다 뛰어난 슬라이딩 태클 실력을 지녔다고……? 재밌는 녀석이네.” 리오넬 메시의 눈빛이 변했다. 흐르던 여유가 사라졌고 표정도 진지하게 변했다. “이제 진지하게 상대해주마.” * * * 김국영이 걷어낸 공은 라인 밖으로 나갔다. ― 아르헨티나의 스로인입니다. 신재욱 선수는 오늘 굉장히 열심히 뛰어주고 있네요. 팀에서 가장 어린 선수인데, 오늘도 에이스 역할을 해주고 있습니다! ― 하지만 경기의 분위기는 여전히 아르헨티나 쪽으로 넘어간 상황입니다. 냉정하게 말하면 우리 선수들이 경기력에서 밀리고 있기에, 연장전까지 가는 것은 우리에게 좋지 않을 것 같습니다. 가능하다면 후반전이 끝나기 전에 우리 선수들이 골을 만들었으면 좋겠네요! 아르헨티나의 공격은 계속 이어졌다. 한국이 웅크린 채로 얻어맞는 반코트 게임도 다시 시작됐다. 아르헨티나의 선수들은 빠르게 패스를 주고받으면서도 공을 뺏기질 않았다. 더 심각한 건 한국 수비수들의 불안한 볼 처리였다. 체력이 떨어진 후반전이었기에, 한국의 수비수들은 집중력이 떨어진 모습을 보여줬고 강한 압박을 펼치지도 못했다. 그러다 보니 아르헨티나의 볼 점유율은 더욱 높아졌다. ― 아…… 우리 선수들이 계속해서 밀리고 있습니다……! 상황이 좋지 못한데요? ― 대한민국이 계속해서 위험한 상황을 내주고 있습니다! 우리 수비수들은 힘들겠지만, 조금만 더 집중해서 볼 처리를 확실하게 해줄 필요가 있습니다! 자연스레 한국의 위기도 이어졌다. 그리고 후반전 84분이 되었을 때. 한국은 큰 위기를 맞았다. ― 에세키엘 라베시가 측면을 파고듭니다! 크로스! 에세키엘 라베시가 측면에서 올린 크로스는 날카로운 궤적으로 한국의 페널티박스 안쪽으로 날아갔다. 그 공을 향해 점프한 선수는 한국의 수비수 김영원과 아르헨티나의 스트라이커 곤살로 이과인이었다. 동시에 점프한 두 선수. 그러나 두 선수의 피지컬 차이는 컸다. 점프력과 몸싸움 능력, 심지어 위치선정 능력까지 곤살로 이과인이 김영원을 압도했다. 월드클래스 스트라이커 곤살로 이과인. 그는 너무나도 쉽게 공중볼을 따내며 헤더 골을 터트렸다. ― 아…… 곤살로 이과인 선수의 골입니다……! 아르헨티나가 4 대 3으로 앞서나갑니다……! ― 우리 선수들이 잘 싸워줬는데…… 결국 실점을 하고 말았네요……. 후반전 84분에 나온 한국의 실점. 한국 해설들의 목소리엔 안타까운 감정이 묻어나왔다. 이들은 알고 있었기 때문이었다. 지금처럼 늦은 시간에 실점을 해버리면 사실상 승리는 멀어진다는 것을. 한국의 축구팬들 역시 비슷한 반응이었다. └ 아…… 결국 지는 건가……? └ 잘했는데ㅠㅠㅠ 4강 갈 것 같았는데ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ └ 아르헨티나가 후반전에 강하네……. └ 우리 선수들이 너무 지쳤어…… 지치면 집중력도 떨어질 수밖에 없지. └ 아르헨티나가 잘하긴 한다…… 리오넬 메시, 라베시, 곤살로 이과인, 마스체라노는 특히 잘하고. └ 이거 동점 골 넣을 수도 있지 않을까……? └ 힘들다고 봐야지. 이제 후반 85분이야. 추가시간까지 전부 포함해도 10분도 안 남았어. └ 경기력이 좋으면 그나마 기대할 수 있을 텐데, 반코트 게임이라서 이건 뭐…… 사실상 끝났다고 봐야지. └ 아ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 어떻게든 동점 골만 넣으면 연장전이라도 갈 텐데ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 한국 축구팬들은 사실상 한국의 패배가 매우 가까워졌다고 생각했다. 긍정적인 생각은 하지 못했다. 경기력에서 밀리고 있었으니까. 한국 대표팀 선수들은 달랐다. 포기하지 않고 있었다. “집중해요! 적어도 한 번은 기회가 올 거예요! 절대 포기하지 말고 기회가 올 때까지 버텨요.” 쉬지 않고 동료들을 다독이는 신재욱과. “재욱이 말이 맞아요! 저랑 재욱이가 또 이런 상황에 강하거든요? 딱 한 번만 기회 오면 어떻게든 살려줄 테니까 힘들어도 참아줘요!” 커다란 목소리로 맞장구를 치는 이택현의 노력 덕분이었다. 하지만 시간은 계속 흘렀다. 후반 87분…… 89분…… 90분……. 한국 대표팀 선수들과 팬들의 불안감은 점점 더 커졌다. 그리고 추가시간 2분이 흘렀을 때. ― 오오?! 이러면 역습 기회입니다! 드디어 한국의 공격 기회가 생겼다.","output":"206 * * * The score was tied at 3 to 3. Although the scores of both teams were the same, there was a clear difference in the atmosphere. Argentina's mood was much better after coming back from 3 to 1 to tie at 3 to 3. The confidence of the players was also different. After tying the score, the Argentine players found their composure. Mistakes decreased, and their play became bolder. Naturally, Korea was pushed back. Even Shin Jae-wook, a forward, had no choice but to join in on defense. That's when it happened. - Lionel Messi receives the ball! Lionel Messi began to advance. It was a bold move forward. And in front of him stood Shin Jae-wook. Whisk! Shin Jae-wook lowered his stance. As a player with a lot of experience, he could somewhat understand the opponent's thoughts by observing their eyes and movements. ‘This guy wants to break my spirit.’ Lionel Messi intended to break the spirit of Shin Jae-wook, the ace of the Korean national team. He planned to completely crumble Korea with this method. Of course, Shin Jae-wook had no intention of letting that happen. Tap! Thud! Tap! Lionel Messi's speed increased rapidly. The frequency of his touches on the ball also increased sharply. ‘Focus.’ Shin Jae-wook's eyes grew cold. The Lionel Messi he knew could maintain such movements and then use concise skills to change direction in an instant or burst forward with explosive speed. He was a player with various patterns. Moreover, he dribbles while watching the opponent's movements until the end. It was the most difficult style to defend against. Because of these characteristics, even world-class defenders couldn't stop Lionel Messi one-on-one. Shin Jae-wook, before his reincarnation, was no different as a defender. He too had been pierced through by Lionel Messi in situations where he had to defend against him. ‘It's funny, really. I'm a forward, yet I have this strange defensive pride.’ But it wasn't just defeats. Occasionally, he managed to stop him. There was a common factor each time. He used his most confident skill, the sliding tackle. ‘Even Taek-hyun, Franck Ribéry, Arjen Robben, and Shaqiri, who are all great at dribbling, couldn't avoid my sliding tackles.’ Shin Jae-wook kept an eye on Lionel Messi's movements. He never extended his foot recklessly. While doing so, he continued to adjust the distance to prevent Messi from shooting. He moved, recalling past memories as much as possible. For a brief moment, tension flowed. He had a lot of experience blocking excellent dribblers like Robben and Ribéry in his team, but Lionel Messi was even more difficult to stop than them. It was the same now. Lionel Messi, controlling the ball with body feints, exuded ease. He was checking his teammates' movements while keeping his head high. ‘You're quite at ease.’ Shin Jae-wook smiled bitterly and continued to backpedal. He had no intention of moving first. To stop Messi, he had to wait for just one timing. ‘Finally, you make your move.’ Lionel Messi accelerated. He moved faster and displayed more dynamic body feints. It looked like he was really going to change direction. Most defenders would have been fooled by such a move. But Shin Jae-wook held out until the end. And now. Ta-dah! Whoosh! Lionel Messi's real movement came out. After feinting to the right, he abruptly changed direction to the left with a phantom dribble. Shin Jae-wook reacted quickly. Of course, he couldn't move before Messi. He had reacted after seeing with his eyes. However, Shin Jae-wook had a weapon: the sliding tackle. A sliding tackle so precise he wasn't afraid of back tackles. He used that weapon against Lionel Messi. Swoosh! He laid his body down and extended his foot in the direction Messi was moving. At the same time, he controlled the tip of his foot, focusing on touching the ball precisely. However, the opponent was Lionel Messi. He quickly reacted to Shin Jae-wook's sliding tackle and tried to push the ball further to the left. He tried to avoid the tackle in that brief moment. But Shin Jae-wook's foot was faster. Tap! It was a success. Lionel Messi, who was trying to push the ball to the left, tumbled to the ground. He tripped over Shin Jae-wook's leg, which had touched the ball first. Woooooo! Immediately, boos poured from the stands. It was the booing of Argentine fans. They were claiming a foul by Shin Jae-wook. However, no foul was declared. The referee let the game continue. It was judged to be a clean tackle that touched the ball first. \\"Good refereeing.\\" Shin Jae-wook grinned and got up. His posture was unstable, so he couldn't keep possession of the ball he had taken from Lionel Messi, but fortunately, a teammate kicked it far away. - Kim Guk-young clears the ball! Wow! What did we just see? Shin Jae-wook has stopped Lionel Messi, known as the god of soccer, one-on-one! - Amazing! Shin Jae-wook has stopped Lionel Messi, whom even world-class defenders can't stop one-on-one! Lionel Messi. He got up, dumbfounded, and let out a hollow laugh out of sheer surprise. \\"Since when does a striker defend like this?\\" Despite being the world's best player with a lot of experience, he had never been as surprised as he was now. He already knew that Shin Jae-wook's defensive ability was unusually excellent for a striker. But he hadn't taken it too seriously. He thought it was just exceptional for a striker. That's why he boldly engaged in a one-on-one duel. He planned to overwhelmingly suppress Korea's ace and boost his team's momentum. However, the defense of Shin Jae-wook, who he actually faced, was surprisingly strong enough to astonish Lionel Messi. \\"Even Carles Puyol or Gerard Piqué never surprised me this much...\\" Especially the perfection of the sliding tackle was astonishing. Lionel Messi played with the best teammates, but none of them had shown a sliding tackle as outstanding as Shin Jae-wook's. \\"A world-class striker with sliding tackle skills better than the world's best defenders...? What an interesting guy.\\" Lionel Messi's eyes changed. The ease that had been flowing disappeared, and his expression turned serious. \\"Now I'll take you on seriously.\\" * * * The ball Kim Guk-young cleared went out of bounds. - It's Argentina's throw-in. Shin Jae-wook is working very hard today. He's the youngest player on the team, but he's playing the role of the ace today as well! - However, the atmosphere of the game is still leaning towards Argentina. To be frank, our players are being outplayed, so going into extra time would not be good for us. I hope our players can score a goal before the end of the second half! Argentina's attack continued. The half-court game, where Korea was hunkered down and taking hits, resumed as well. The Argentine players exchanged passes quickly without losing the ball. More serious was the nervous ball handling by the Korean defenders. In the second half, with their stamina depleted, the Korean defenders showed a lack of concentration and couldn't exert strong pressure. As a result, Argentina's ball possession increased even more. - Ah... our players are continuously being pushed back...! The situation isn't good, is it? - South Korea keeps giving away dangerous situations! Our defenders are having a hard time, but they need to focus a little more and handle the ball properly! Naturally, Korea's crises continued. And when it was the 84th minute of the second half. Korea faced a major crisis. - Ezequiel Lavezzi breaks through on the flank! Cross! Ezequiel Lavezzi's cross from the flank flew with a sharp trajectory into the Korean penalty box. The player who jumped for the ball was Korea's defender Kim Young-won and Argentina's striker Gonzalo Higuain. Both players jumped simultaneously. However, there was a significant physical difference between the two players. In terms of jumping ability, physical confrontation, and even positioning, Gonzalo Higuain overwhelmed Kim Young-won. World-class striker Gonzalo Higuain. He easily won the aerial ball and scored with a header. - Ah... it's a goal by Gonzalo Higuain...! Argentina takes the lead 4 to 3... - Our players fought well... but in the end, we conceded... The goal scored against Korea in the 84th minute of the second half. Regret was evident in the voices of the Korean commentators. They knew. Conceding a goal at such a late time essentially meant victory was slipping away. Korean soccer fans felt similarly. └ Ah... are we going to lose after all...? └ We played wellㅠㅠㅠ It looked like we could make it to the semifinalsㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ └ Argentina is strong in the second half... └ Our players are too exhausted... When you're tired, your concentration inevitably drops. └ Argentina is playing well... especially Lionel Messi, Lavezzi, Gonzalo Higuain, and Mascherano. └ Could we still score an equalizing goal...? └ It's tough to say. It's already the 85th minute of the second half. Even including added time, there's less than 10 minutes left. └ If our gameplay was good, we could have some hope, but with a half-court game like this... it's essentially over. └ Ahㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ If we could just score an equalizing goal, we could at least go to extra timeㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Korean soccer fans thought Korea's defeat was very close. They couldn't think positively. They were being outplayed. The players of the Korean national team were different. They hadn't given up. \\"Focus! At least one opportunity will come! Don't give up and hold on until the opportunity comes.\\" Thanks to the efforts of Shin Jae-wook, who kept encouraging his teammates without rest, and \\"Jae-wook is right! Taek-hyun and I are strong in situations like this! Just hold on even if it's tough, and I'll make something happen if we get even one chance!\\" Lee Taek-hyun, who responded with a loud voice. But time kept passing. The 87th minute... 89th minute... 90th minute... The anxiety of the Korean national team players and fans grew more and more. And when 2 minutes of added time had passed. - Oh?! This could be a chance for a counterattack! Finally, an opportunity for a Korean attack arose."},{"instruction":"208 * * * 경기가 종료될 때까지 겨우 1분이 남은 지금. 스코어는 기적적으로 동점이 됐다. ― 신재욱 선수가 대한민국을 구해냈습니다! 8강으로 끝날 것 같았던 도전이 신재욱 선수 덕분에 계속 이어질 수 있다는 희망이 생겼습니다! ― 다시 봐도 놀랍네요! 엄청난 골이었습니다! 신재욱 선수의 멘탈은 다이아몬드인가요? 분명히 긴장될 것 같은 상황이었는데도 정확한 슈팅으로 골을 집어넣었습니다! 게다가 골을 넣은 지금도 너무 침착하지 않습니까?! 경기장의 분위기가 불타올랐다. 한국대표팀 선수들도 흥분해서 서로를 껴안고 기뻐했다. 그런데 골을 넣은 신재욱은 차분하게 서 있었다. 세레머니도 하지 않았다. 크게 기쁘지도 않았다. 그는 승리를 생각하고 있었으니까. ‘아직 경기는 안 끝났어. 이제 동점일 뿐이야.’ 경기에서 이기려면 아직 해야 할 일이 남았으니까. 그래서 달려오는 동료들을 진정시켰다. “다들 모여보세요.” 진지한 얼굴로 양쪽 손바닥을 앞으로 내밀며 한 말. 신재욱의 그 행동에 한국대표팀 선수들은 어리둥절한 표정을 지었다. “어? 재욱아, 왜 그래?” “뭐야? 무슨 일 있어? 미친 골을 넣어놓고 왜 그래?” “다 모이라고? 하고 싶은 세레머니라도 있어?” “일단 모여봐! 이유가 있겠지.” 한국대표팀 선수들은 의아해했지만, 그래도 신재욱의 주변에 모였다. 다른 선수도 아니고 신재욱이라면 이러는 이유가 있을 것이라고 믿었기 때문이었다. “동점 됐어요. 기쁜 일이죠. 근데 기뻐하면 안 돼요. 연장전이 남았거든요. 기뻐하는 건 아르헨티나를 이긴 뒤에, 4강에 올라가는 게 확정됐을 때 해도 늦지 않아요.” 신재욱은 동료들을 바라봤다. 대부분 상태가 좋지 못했다. 숨은 헐떡이고 있었고, 다리는 후들거렸다. 완전히 녹초가 되어버렸다는 말이 어울렸다. “힘들 거예요. 그래도 이기고 싶잖아요? 그럼 어쩔 수 없어요. 참고 더 뛰어야 해요.” 냉정하지만 동료들에게 필요한 말들을 과감하게 뱉어낸 뒤. 신재욱은 씨익 웃으며 마지막 말을 내뱉었다. “이기러 가죠!” 그 말을 끝으로 신재욱은 움직였다. 자신의 자리를 향해서 천천히 걸었다. 그리고 한국대표팀 선수들은 잠시 아무런 말이 없었다. 이들 모두 본인들의 몸 상태를 확인하며 생각에 잠겼다. ‘얼마나 뛸 수 있을까? 한 10분 정도는 뛸 수 있으려나?’ ‘조금만 더 뛰어도 쥐날 것 같은데…….’ ‘몸에 힘이 하나도 없어……완전히 다 쏟아 부어버렸는데……연장전까지 뛸 수 있을까?’ ‘당장 쓰러질 것 같은데 연장전이라니…….’ 선수들 모두 두려워했다. 체력이 바닥나버린 상태였기 때문이었다. 사실상 정신력으로만 뛰어야 하는 상태였기에 자신감이 떨어졌다. 그때였다. “…재욱이 좀 봐봐.” 이들 중 누군가가 말했다. 신재욱을 보라고. 그 순간 한국대표팀 선수들의 시선은 전부 신재욱의 뒷모습에 꽂혔다. 동시에 이들은 입술을 깨물었다. 마음속에 있는 불안한 감정도 씻은 듯 사라져버렸다. 그럴 수밖에 없었다. 이들의 눈엔 보였으니까. 덜덜 떨리는 신재욱의 다리가. “……우리 더 뛰어보자.” “그래. 막내가 저렇게까지 해주는데, 형들이 덜 뛰면 안 되지. 에이 씨! 뒤질 것 같지만 더 뛰어보자!” “좋아요! 해보죠! 저는 그냥 죽었다 생각하고 뛰렵니다!” “설마 죽기야 하겠어요? 그냥 죄다 쏟아붓죠!” 한국대표팀 선수들의 눈빛이 변했다. 분위도 완전히 달라졌다. 위닝 멘탈리티. 선수들 모두 오직 승리만을 생각하기 시작했다. ― 경기가 재개됩니다! 남은 시간은 매우 적습니다. 아마도 주심이 금방 경기를 종료시킬 것 같……아! 말을 하던 도중에 경기가 종료됩니다! 이제 곧 연장전이 진행됩니다! ― 우리 선수들! 굉장히 힘들 겁니다! 그러나 이 승부에서 이긴다면 4강에 올라갈 수 있습니다! 새로운 기적을 만들 수 있습니다! 정신력이 단단해진 한국대표팀은 1분이라는 시간 동안 실수 없이 잘 버텨냈다. 경기가 종료된 이후에도 한국대표팀 선수들의 눈빛은 살아있었다. 이들 모두 필사적으로 휴식을 취하며 연장전을 준비했다. 그리고 그 모습을 본 신재욱은 옅은 미소를 지었다. ‘역시 통하네.’ 선수들을 불러모은 뒤에 연설을 펼치고 다리를 후들거리는 모습을 보여주는 것. 전부 의도했던 행동이었다. ‘팀의 사기를 끌어 올리는 데에는 이것만 한 게 없지.’ 연기력이 중요하지만, 성공하기만 한다면 지쳐버린 동료들에게 커다란 동기부여를 주는 방법이었다. 환생 전에도 잘 먹혔던 방법이었고, 이번에도 통했다. 신재욱은 동료들의 분위기가 달라진 걸 느끼며 다리를 주물렀다. ‘연기로 과장하긴 했지만, 힘들긴 하네. 그나저나 은퇴하면 연기에 도전해볼까?’ * * * 연장전이 펼쳐질 시간은 금방 다가왔다. 선수들에게 주어진 쉬는 시간은 아주 잠깐이었다. 아직 회복의 별로 되지 않은 선수들에게 주심은 경기를 준비하라는 압박을 줬다. 잠자코 휴식을 취하던 아르헨티나 선수들은 투덜대며 불만을 드러냈다. “이건 미친 짓 같아. 방금 95분에 가까운 시간을 뛰었는데, 또 30분을 뛰어야 한다고?” “젠장, 오늘 밤엔 몸살이 나겠어.” “다리에 힘이 하나도 없는데, 어떻게 뛰어야 하지?” “아오! 한국은 왜 저렇게 끈질긴 거야? 쟤네랑 연장전까지 갈 줄은 몰랐는데…….” 이들 모두 강한 피로감을 느끼고 있었다. 그러나 이들의 머릿속엔 여전히 ‘패배’라는 단어는 없었다. “연장전 전반에 골 넣고 잠가버리자.” “그래, 그냥 1골만 빨리 넣고 수비해서 버티자. 힘들어서 못 뛰겠어.” “가능하면 2골 넣은 뒤에 버티자. 쟤네 화력은 세서 1골로는 불안해.” 한국과 4 대 4라는 스코어로 연장전까지 가게 됐지만, 그래도 무조건 이길 수 있다고 믿었다. 세계적인 선수들을 여럿 보유한 아르헨티나였기에 가능한 생각이었다. 반면 한국대표팀 선수들은 말이 없었다. 이들은 조용히 아르헨티나 선수들을 바라보며 승리를 향한 의지를 다졌다. ‘이제 곧 시작하겠네. 오늘 무조건 이겨서 4강 올라간다.’ ‘집중하자. 남은 시간 동안 모든 걸 쏟아부어서 팀이 이기게 만들어 줄 거야.’ ‘아르헨티나 애들도 지쳐 보여. 어차피 다들 지친 마당에 제대로 한 번 붙어보자. 한국의 무서움을 보여주마.’ ‘애써 티를 안 내려고 하지만 재욱이가 완전히 지쳐버린 것 같아. 이젠 우리가 해줘야 해! 재욱이가 최대한 덜 뛸 수 있게 내가 조금이라도 더 뛰어야겠어!’ 같은 시각. 신재욱은 동료들과는 다른 곳을 바라보고 있었다. “이 타이밍에도 메시지가 뜨네?” 연장전이 시작되기 직전에 떠오른 반투명한 메시지. 허공에 떠오른 그것을 바라보며, 신재욱은 미소를 지었다. [체력이 1 올랐습니다!] 체력 능력치가 올랐다는 내용이었다. “운도 좋네. 지금 상태에서 가장 도움 되는 능력이 오르다니.” 그렇게 중얼거리며, 신재욱은 시선을 옮겨 아르헨티나 선수들을 바라봤다. 저들은 각자의 자리를 향해 움직이고 있었다. 연장전에 돌입할 준비를 하는 것이다. 다시 시선을 옮겼다. 이번엔 한국대표팀 선수들의 모습이 보였다. 이들도 각자의 자리를 향해 걸었다. “어떻게 되려나?” 신재욱은 궁금했다. 경기의 흐름이 어떻게 흘러갈지. “동료들이 생각보다 더 잘해줄 수도 있을 것 같은데.” 자신의 연설이 완전히 먹혀들었고, 한국대표팀 선수들은 승리를 향한 의지를 드러내고 있었다. 이처럼 정신력이 강하게 무장되었을 땐 지닌 실력보다 더 좋은 경기력이 나오곤 한다. 그래서 신재욱은 기대했다. “팀빨 좀 받아보려나?” 편안한 연장전이 되기를. ― 연장전이 시작됩니다! 전반전 15분, 후반전 15분, 총 30분간 진행되는 연장전에서 골을 넣는 팀은 어디일까요? 만약 양 팀 모두 동점으로 연장전을 끝낸다면 승부차기로 넘어가게 됩니다! ― 저는 승부차기까지 가진 않을 것 같습니다. ― 왜 그렇게 생각하시죠? ― 양 팀 모두 4골씩을 넣었을 정도로 화력이 좋은 팀이기 때문이죠. 한국엔 신재욱 선수와 이택현 선수가 있고, 아르헨티나엔 리오넬 메시 선수와 곤살로 이과인 선수가 있습니다. 물론 체력이 많이 떨어졌겠지만, 그래도 이 선수들은 언제든 골을 만들어낼 수 있는 선수들입니다. 양 팀 선수들이 움직였다. 체력이 바닥난 상태로 펼쳐진 연장전이었기에, 양 팀 선수들의 움직임은 눈에 띄게 둔해졌다. 그런데 둔해진 정도는 아르헨티나가 더 심했다. 한국대표팀 선수들은 이를 악물고 최대한 빠르게, 많이 뛰고 있었다. ― 우리 선수들이 필사적으로 뛰어주고 있습니다! 분명 서 있는 것조차 힘들어했던 선수들인데 말이죠! 대단한 정신력입니다! 어떻게든 4강에 올라가겠다는 강력한 의지가 보입니다! ― 너무 놀라운데요…? 이건 초인적인 정신력이거든요?! 반면, 유독 멀쩡하게 뛰어다니는 선수도 있었다. “체력이 많이 좋아지긴 했어. 처음 환생했을 땐 체력이 너무 안 좋아서 놀랐었는데 말이야. 그땐 체력 능력치가 51이었는데, 지금은 91이 됐네.” 신재욱이었다. 그는 연장전이 시작된 이후, 그 누구보다도 활발하게 뛰어다녔다. 이게 가능한 이유는 체력 능력치가 91이어서만은 아니었다. [극도의 정신력] [등급] S [효과] 체력이 완전히 바닥났을 때, 극도의 정신력을 발휘하며 많은 시간 더 뛸 수 있게 됩니다. 특성의 효과가 발휘될 때, 컨디션이 매우 좋아집니다. S급 특성인 극도의 정신력. 이 특성의 효과가 큰 역할을 했다. “추가시간에 골 넣었을 때보다 오히려 지금이 컨디션은 더 좋은 것 같단 말이야?” 풀타임을 뛰고, 연장전까지 소화하는 선수답지 않은 활발한 움직임. 게다가 상대가 공을 잡으면 강한 압박까지 펼치는 플레이. 이런 신재욱의 움직임에 아르헨티나 선수들은 당황할 수밖에 없었다. 연장전이 시작된 지 단 3분 만에 아르헨티나 선수들의 동공은 크게 떨리고 있었다. “쟤, 뭐야?! 어떻게 저렇게 뛰어다닐 수가 있는 거야?” “…미친놈인가? 신재욱 저 녀석, 전반전이랑 후반전 내내 많이 뛰었잖아? 어떻게 지금도 뛰어다닐 수가 있는 거지?” “미쳤군. 체력이 하비에르 마스체라노보다도 뛰어난 사람은 처음 봐.” 같은 시각. 한국대표팀 선수들의 눈동자도 흔들렸다. 다만, 아르헨티나 선수들과는 다른 이유였다. 이들은 신재욱을 보며 감동하고 있었다. ‘저렇게까지 뛰어준다고? 분명 제대로 걷지도 못할 정도로 지쳐있었는데…….’ ‘재욱이는 다 지쳤으면서 저렇게 뛰어주네……정말……존경스러울 정도야.’ ‘하……재욱이가 엄청 뛰어주네……힘든 거 다 아는데…….’ 한국대표팀 선수들 모두 신재욱의 체력이 바닥났다고 믿고 있었기에 생긴 일이었다. 이들은 신재욱이 오로지 팀을 위해서 힘든 걸 참아가며 정신력으로 뛰고 있다고 생각했다. 그리고 이런 생각들은 한국대표팀 선수들의 정신력을 더욱 강하게 만들어줬다. ― 어어? 뭐죠? ― 좋은데요? 오오오! 연장전 전반 3분 40초. 한국이 좋은 경기력을 보여주기 시작했다.","output":"208 * * * With just 1 minute left until the end of the match, the score miraculously tied. - Shin Jae-wook has saved South Korea! The challenge that seemed to end in the quarterfinals can now continue, thanks to <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, giving us hope! - It's amazing to see again! What an incredible goal! Does Shin Jae-wook have a diamond mentality? Despite what must have been a nerve-wracking situation, he scored with a precise shot! And even now, after scoring, isn't he too calm?! The atmosphere in the stadium was electric. The players of the Korean national team were excited, hugging and celebrating with each other. But Shin Jae-wook, who scored the goal, stood calmly. He didn't celebrate. He wasn't overly joyful. He was thinking about victory. ‘The game isn't over yet. It's only a tie now.’ There was still work to be done to win the game. So he calmed down his approaching teammates. \\"Everyone, gather around.\\" With a serious face and palms outstretched forward, he spoke. The Korean national team players looked puzzled by Shin Jae-wook's actions. \\"Huh? Jae-wook, what's up?\\" \\"What? What's going on? You score a crazy goal and act like this?\\" \\"Are you telling us to gather? Do you have a celebration in mind?\\" \\"Let's gather first! There must be a reason.\\" The Korean national team players were curious, but they still gathered around Shin Jae-wook. They trusted that if it was Shin Jae-wook, there must be a reason for his behavior. \\"We've tied the game. It's a happy occasion, right? But we can't celebrate yet. We have extra time ahead of us. Celebrating can wait until after we've beaten Argentina and our advancement to the semifinals is confirmed.\\" Shin Jae-wook looked at his teammates. Most of them were not in good shape. They were gasping for air, and their legs were trembling. They were completely exhausted. \\"It's going to be tough. But you want to win, right? Then there's no choice. You have to endure and keep running.\\" After boldly speaking the harsh but necessary words to his teammates, Shin Jae-wook smiled and delivered his final line. \\"Let's go win this!\\" With those words, Shin Jae-wook moved. He walked slowly towards his position. The Korean national team players were silent for a moment. They all checked their physical condition and were lost in thought. 'How much longer can I run? Maybe 10 more minutes?' 'I feel like I'm going to cramp if I run even a little more...' 'I have no strength left in my body... I've completely exhausted myself... Can I make it through extra time?' 'I feel like I'm going to collapse right now, and there's extra time...' All the players were afraid. They were completely drained of energy. Since they had to rely solely on their willpower, their confidence had dropped. That's when it happened. \\"...Look at Jae-wook.\\" Someone among them spoke. Look at Shin Jae-wook. At that moment, all the Korean national team players' eyes were fixed on Shin Jae-wook's back. They all bit their lips. The uneasy feelings in their hearts seemed to wash away. They had no choice but to feel this way. They saw it with their own eyes. Shin Jae-wook's legs were trembling. \\"…Let's run more.\\" \\"Yeah. If the youngest is doing that much, we older players can't run less. Ah, damn it! I feel like I'm going to die, but let's run more!\\" \\"Alright! Let's do it! I'll just think I'm dead and run!\\" \\"We're not going to die, are we? Let's just give it our all!\\" The eyes of the Korean national team players changed. The atmosphere completely shifted. A winning mentality. All the players began to think only of victory. - The game resumes! There's very little time left. It seems the referee will end the match soon... Ah! The game ends while I'm speaking! Extra time will begin shortly! - Our players! It's going to be very tough! But if we win this match, we can advance to the semifinals! We can create a new miracle! With their mental strength solidified, the Korean national team managed to hold on without mistakes for the 1-minute duration. Even after the game ended, the eyes of the Korean national team players were still alive. They all desperately took a rest and prepared for extra time. Seeing this, Shin Jae-wook smiled faintly. 'It worked.' Gathering the players and giving a speech, then showing them his trembling legs. It was all intentional. 'There's nothing like it for boosting the team's morale.' Acting skills were important, but if successful, it was a way to give great motivation to exhausted teammates. It was a method that had worked well before his reincarnation, and it worked this time too. Shin Jae-wook massaged his legs, feeling the change in his teammates' mood. 'I exaggerated with the acting, but I am tired. Maybe I should try acting after I retire?' * * * Extra time approached quickly. The players had only a brief moment to rest. The referee pressured the players, who were hardly recovered, to prepare for the game. The Argentine players, who had been quietly resting, grumbled and expressed their dissatisfaction. \\"This is crazy. We just ran for nearly 95 minutes, and now we have to run another 30?\\" \\"Damn, I'm going to have a fever tonight.\\" \\"I have no strength in my legs, how am I supposed to run?\\" \\"Ah! Why is Korea so tenacious? I didn't expect to go into extra time with them...\\" All of them felt a strong sense of fatigue. However, the word 'defeat' was still not in their minds. \\"Let's score a goal in the first half of extra time and then lock it down.\\" \\"Yeah, let's just score one goal quickly and then defend. I'm too tired to run.\\" \\"If possible, let's score two goals and then defend. Their firepower is strong, so one goal feels insecure.\\" Despite going into extra time with a score of 4 to 4 against Korea, they still believed they could definitely win. It was a possible thought for Argentina, which had several world-class players. On the other hand, the Korean national team players were silent. They quietly watched the Argentine players and steeled their will to win. 'It's about to start. We're going to win today and move up to the semifinals.' 'Focus. I'll give everything I have for the remaining time to ensure the team wins.' 'The Argentine players look tired too. Since everyone's exhausted, let's face them properly. Let's show them the terror of Korea.' 'It looks like Jae-wook is completely exhausted, trying not to show it. Now it's our turn to do it! I have to run more so Jae-wook can run less!' At the same time, Shin Jae-wook was looking somewhere else. \\"Messages at this timing?\\" He looked at the translucent message that appeared just before the start of extra time and smiled. [Your stamina has increased by 1!] The message indicated that his stamina attribute had increased. \\"Lucky. The most helpful ability for my current state has increased.\\" Muttering to himself, Shin Jae-wook shifted his gaze to the Argentine players. They were moving towards their positions, preparing to enter extra time. He shifted his gaze again. This time he saw the Korean national team players. They were also walking towards their positions. \\"What will happen?\\" Shin Jae-wook was curious. How the flow of the game would go. \\"My teammates seem like they might perform better than I thought.\\" His speech had completely taken effect, and the Korean national team players were showing their will to win. When mental strength is so strongly armed, better performance than one's actual skill can emerge. That's why Shin Jae-wook was hopeful. \\"Maybe I'll get some team support?\\" Hoping for a comfortable extra time. - Extra time begins! The first half is 15 minutes, the second half is 15 minutes, for a total of 30 minutes of extra time. Which team will score? If both teams remain tied after extra time, the match will go to a penalty shootout! - I don't think it will go to a shootout. - Why do you think that? - Because both teams have scored 4 goals each, showing they have good firepower. Korea has Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun, and Argentina has Lionel Messi and Gonzalo Higuain. Although they must be very tired, these players can score at any time. Both teams' players moved. As extra time began with players drained of energy, the movements of both teams were noticeably slower. However, Argentina's sluggishness was more severe. The Korean national team players gritted their teeth and ran as fast and as much as they could. - Our players are running desperately! These are players who were clearly struggling to stand! What incredible mental strength! You can see their strong will to advance to the semifinals at all costs! - This is too surprising...? This is superhuman mental strength?! Meanwhile, there was one player who was running around quite comfortably. \\"My stamina has improved a lot. When I first reincarnated, I was shocked by how bad my stamina was. Back then, my stamina attribute was 51, but now it's 91.\\" It was Shin Jae-wook. Since the start of extra time, he had been moving more actively than anyone else. The reason he could do this was not just because his stamina attribute was at 91. [Extreme Mental Strength] [Grade] S [Effect] When stamina is completely depleted, extreme mental strength allows you to run for a much longer time. When the trait's effect is active, your condition improves significantly. The S-grade trait, Extreme Mental Strength, played a significant role. \\"I feel like my condition is even better now than when I scored during added time.\\" His lively movements were uncharacteristic of a player who had played full time and was now in extra time. Moreover, he exerted strong pressure whenever the opponent had the ball. The Argentine players were inevitably flustered by Shin Jae-wook's movements. Just 3 minutes into extra time, the pupils of the Argentine players were shaking greatly. \\"What's with that guy?! How can he run around like that?\\" \\"...Is he crazy? Shin Jae-wook, that guy, ran a lot during the first and second half, right? How can he still be running now?\\" \\"He's insane. I've never seen anyone with more stamina than Javier Mascherano.\\" At the same time, the pupils of the Korean national team players were also shaking. However, for a different reason than the Argentine players. They were moved by watching Shin Jae-wook. 'He's running that much? He was clearly too exhausted to walk properly...' 'Jae-wook is running for us even though he's exhausted... Really... It's admirable.' 'Ah... Jae-wook is running so much... We all know he's tired...' The Korean national team players all believed that Shin Jae-wook's stamina was depleted. They thought he was running solely for the team, enduring the hardship with his mental strength. And these thoughts further strengthened the mental fortitude of the Korean national team players. - Huh? What's this? - That's good! Oh! 3 minutes and 40 seconds into the first half of extra time. Korea began to show good gameplay."},{"instruction":"210 * * * 신재욱은 침착함을 유지했다. 골을 넣었지만 기뻐하지 않았다. 물론 기뻤다. 하지만 일부러 티를 내지 않았다. 팀의 좋은 분위기를 깨고 싶지 않았기 때문이었다. ‘여기서 흥분해서 날뛰면 괜히 나사가 풀려버릴 수도 있어.’ 골을 넣은 뒤에 방심하다가 곧바로 실점을 허용하는 것. 프로 무대에서 종종 발생하는 일이다. 어찌어찌 정신력으로 버티고 있지만, 한 번 넘어지면 일어날 힘조차 남지 않은 게 지금의 한국 대표팀이었다. 조심해야 했다. 더 나아가 연기까지 펼쳤다. 동료들을 모아놓고 말을 하며 일부러 다리를 떨고, 휘청거리는 모습을 보여줬다. ‘이런 액션이 제일 잘 먹힐 타이밍이거든.’ 신재욱의 연기력은 뛰어난 편이라서 동료들을 전부 속이는 것에 성공했다. 한국 대표팀 선수들은 표정에서부터 엄청난 동기부여가 된 모습을 보여 주고 있었다. 이들 모두 웃지 않고 있었다. 이글거리는 눈빛을 한 채로 엄청난 승부욕을 드러내고 있었다. ‘다행이야. 제대로 먹혀들었어.’ 신재욱은 웃음이 나오려는 걸 참으며, 자신의 자리를 향해 걸었다. 도중에 한 번 더 휘청거리는 것도 잊지 않았다. 그런데 이때, 웃음을 참기 힘든 일이 생겨버렸다. [슈팅이 1 올랐습니다!] 슈팅 능력치가 올랐다는 메시지 때문이었다. ‘슈팅 능력치가 벌써 93이 됐어!’ 너무 기쁜 나머지 신재욱은 주먹을 불끈 쥐었다. 웃음도 터져 나올 것 같아서 재빨리 고개를 푹 숙였다. 지금 웃는 모습을 보여 주면 팀의 분위기를 깨버릴 수도 있다. 더구나 열심히 해온 연기도 의미가 없어진다. “참자.” 신재욱은 새어 나오려는 웃음을 간신히 참아냈다. 숙였던 고개를 들었다. 동시에 몸을 살짝 휘청거렸다. 마치 어지러워서 고개를 숙였었던 것처럼. 위기를 기회로 만드는 연기였다. “재욱아! 괜찮아?” “괜찮은 거야? 뛸 수 있겠어?” “쉬어야 하는 거 아니야? 너 너무 무리한 거 같은데?” “어지러운 거 맞지?” 깜짝 놀란 동료들이 달려왔고. 신재욱은 옅은 미소와 함께 고개를 저었다. “저는 괜찮아요. 더 뛸 수 있어요.” 한국 대표팀 선수들은 걱정스러운 눈빛을 보냈지만, 신재욱은 곧 경기가 재개되니 빨리 자리로 돌아가 달라고 말하며 상황을 무마시켰다. ― 한국이 5 대 4로 앞서갑니다! 이제는 정말 월드컵 4강이 아주 가까운 곳까지 다가온 것 같습니다! 오늘도 기적이 일어나고 있습니다! ― 특히 신재욱 선수는 대단합니다! 월드클래스 선수 한 명이 팀에 있는 게 얼마나 큰 영향을 미치는지 너무나도 보여 주는 것 같습니다! 게다가 가장 호흡이 잘 맞는 이택현 선수도 있고요! 경기가 재개됐다. 아르헨티나의 선수들은 연장전에 실점하게 됐다는 사실에 큰 충격을 받았다. 이대로라면 질 수도 있겠다는 생각이 마음속에 자리 잡았다. ‘이거 큰일인데…? 이러다가 질 수도 있겠어…….’ ‘이 시간에 실점한 건 좀 큰데…….’ ‘젠장! 우리가 넣었어야 했는데…….’ ‘빨리 따라가지 않으면 위험하겠어.’ 당연하게도 마음이 급해졌고, 움직임에서 드러나던 여유도 사라졌다. 뛰어난 기술력을 바탕으로 나오던 안정감도 이제는 보이지 않았다. ― 아르헨티나 선수들이 너무 급한데요? 자꾸만 실수가 나오고 있습니다! ― 만회 골을 빨리 넣고 싶은 것 같은데요? 그런데 우리 선수들이 집중력을 잃지 않고 있습니다! 너무 잘해주네요! 체력이 바닥난 상태에서 집중력까지 떨어진 아르헨티나 선수들은 실수를 남발했다. 다만 한국은 쉽게 역습을 시도하지 못했다. 신재욱도 다르지 않았다. 체력에 여유가 있었지만 신중했다. ‘허술하지만, 그래도 아르헨티나야. 언제 날카로운 공격을 할지 몰라. 내가 같이 막아줘야 해.’ 신재욱의 눈엔 보였으니까. 움직임을 최소화하며 체력을 아껴두고 있는 한 선수가. ‘리오넬 메시가 안 뛰고 있어. 쟤는 분명히 한 번쯤을 힘을 낼 거야. 그때를 조심해야 해.’ 아르헨티나의 에이스이자 세계 최고의 선수인 리오넬 메시. 그는 연장전에 들어선 이후로 거의 뛰지 않았다. 정말 산책을 하듯 걸어 다니고 있었다. 체력을 아꼈다가 기회가 났을 때 힘을 폭발시키려는 전략이었다. 물론 저런 전략은 동료들을 힘들게 한다. 한 명이 안 뛰면 나머지 동료들이 그만큼 더 뛰어줘야 했으니까. 그리고 아르헨티나는 그게 가능한 팀이었다. ‘아르헨티나 선수들은 메시의 플레이를 받쳐줄 수 있지.’ 신재욱은 리오넬 메시를 경계하고 있었다. 냉정하게 한국 대표팀엔 리오넬 메시를 막을 선수는 없다. 체력이 쌩쌩할 때도 못 막았는데, 지친 지금은 어떻게 막겠는가. ‘내가 해야 해.’ 그래서 자신이 막아야 한다고 생각했다. 다만 확신은 없었다. 3번 중 1번 막으면 대박이었다. 리오넬 메시는 그만큼 막기 힘든 선수였으니까. ‘그래도 해야지.’ 신재욱은 집중력을 유지했다. 언제든지 반응할 준비를 마치고 있었다. 그때였다. 허술해졌던 아르헨티나의 공격이 달라지기 시작했다. 정확히 말하면 분위기 자체가 달라졌다. 리오넬 메시가 공을 잡았기 때문이었다. 툭! 툭! 매우 짧게 공을 치며 드리블하는 리오넬 메시. 경기장 내에서 체구가 가장 작은 선수였지만, 공을 몰고 다가오는 그의 모습은 너무나도 커 보였다. 지금 한국 대표팀 선수들의 눈엔 리오넬 메시가 거인처럼 보였다. ― 리오넬 메시가 속도를 냅니다! 리오넬 메시는 아껴뒀던 힘을 폭발시켰다. 빠르게 드리블하며 순식간에 거리를 좁히려고 했다. 그 순간 신재욱이 움직였다. ‘끊어줘야 해.’ 반칙을 각오했다. 리오넬 메시를 막으려면 어쩔 수 없었다. 깔끔한 태클로 막으려고 하다간 역으로 당할 수 있다. 휘익! 리오넬 메시가 바디페인팅과 동시에 방향을 틀며 전진했따. 앞을 가로막은 신재욱을 단숨에 제쳐내려는 움직임이었다. ‘역시 메시의 이런 움직임은 알고도 당할 수밖에 없겠어.’ 신재욱은 감탄했다. 리오넬 메시의 돌파는 막는 게 너무 어려웠다. 그냥 바디페인팅을 하며 움직이는 것이지만, 그 움직임이 너무 정교했다. 더군다나 리오넬 메시는 신재욱의 움직임을 하나도 놓치지 않고 주시하면서 이동했다. 세계 최고라는 말이 어울리는, 대단한 드리블 실력이었다. 그러나 신재욱은 당해줄 수가 없었다. 어떻게든 막아야 했다. ‘차라리 프리킥을 내주는 게 나아.’ 신재욱은 리오넬 메시에게 달라붙었다. 바디페인팅에 속지 않고 어깨싸움을 펼치며 전진을 늦췄다. 발은 뻗지 못했다. 발을 뻗는 순간 리오넬 메시에게 당해버릴 것 같다는 느낌이 들었기 때문이었다. ‘어렵네.’ 그때였다. 리오넬 메시는 동료를 이용했다. 주변에 있던 곤살로 이과인과 짧은 2 대 1 패스를 주고받으며 신재욱을 떨어뜨리려고 했다. 그러나 신재욱은 그것도 놓치지 않았다. ‘미안하지만, 그건 내가 제일 잘하는 거야.’ 동료를 이용하는 플레이에는 도가 튼 신재욱이었다. 상대의 의도를 정확히 꿰뚫고, 곤살로 이과인에겐 시선도 안 줬다. 오로지 리오넬 메시에게만 집중했다. ‘이럴 줄 알았어.’ 생각과는 다르게 신재욱이 떨어지지 않자, 리오넬 메시의 표정이 굳었다. “좀 떨어지는 게 어때?” 경기 중에 웬만해선 말을 하지 않는 리오넬 메시가 감정적인 말을 뱉어냈다. 그만큼 짜증이 난 것이다. 이에 신재욱은 씨익 웃으며 대답했다. “축구의 신을 어떻게 혼자 놔둬? 어떻게든 막아야지.” 리오넬 메시의 얼굴이 일그러졌다. 감정적으로 격해진 그는 신재욱을 도발했다. “네가 막을 수 있다고 생각하는 거야?” 하지만 전혀 통하지 않았다. 신재욱은 웃음을 터트리며 다리를 쭉 뻗었다. “막을 수 없다고 생각했으면 덤비지도 않았지.” 기습적인 태클은 아니었다. 순간적으로 리오넬 메시의 움직임이 흔들린 것을 보고 들어간 것이다. 웬만한 선수는 잡아내지 못하는 아주아주 작은 빈틈. 신재욱은 그 틈을 향해 슬라이딩 태클을 했다. 촤아아악! 잔디를 쓸고 들어가는 발. 발끝을 정교하게 움직이며 리오넬 메시의 공을 건드렸다. 축구의 신이라고 불리는 남자답게 리오넬 메시는 그 짧은 순간에도 공을 빼내려고 했다. 신재욱의 태클을 피해내려고 했다. 실제로 피할 뻔했다. 하지만 신재욱의 발끝이 공에 닿는 것이 아주 조금 더 빨랐다. 툭! 리오넬 메시와 공의 거리가 벌어졌다. 주인을 잃은 공. 그 공을 향해 한 선수가 달려들었다. 신재욱이라면 리오넬 메시를 막아낼 것이라고 100% 믿었던 선수였다. ― 이택현 선수가 공을 잡고 달려나갑니다! 대한민국의 역습입니다! ― 바이에른 뮌헨 듀오가 또다시 좋은 장면을 만들어내고 있습니다! 신재욱 선수가 리오넬 메시를 막아냈고, 이택현이 그 공을 몰고 전진하고 있습니다! ― 이택현 선수의 체력도 대단하네요! 연장전인데도 불구하고 꽤나 빠른 속도를 내고 있습니다! 아직도 이런 힘이 남아있었나요?! 이택현은 빨랐다. 수비가담에 집중하며 잠시 회복됐던 체력을 전부 쏟아내며 폭발적인 스피드를 내고 있었다. 물론 지쳐있는 상태였기에 평소의 속도는 내지 못했지만. 양 팀 선수들 모두 지친 상태에선 충분히 빠른 스피드였다. 툭! 타다닷! 스피드를 내면서도 공과 적당한 거리를 유지하며 드리블하는 것. 지칠수록 더 어려운 플레이였지만, 이택현은 자연스럽게 펼치고 있었다. 이때, 한 선수가 덤벼들었다. 하비에르 마스체라노였다. 그는 이택현을 중심으로 한 역습을 빨리 끊어내야 한다고 판단했다. 그래서 슬라이딩 태클을 시도했다. “어딜 가려고!” 하비에르 마스체라노는 계획했다. 신재욱이 리오넬 메시를 막았던 것처럼, 자신도 깔끔한 태클로 이택현을 막아 보이겠다고. 그러나 그가 미처 신경 쓰지 못한 부분이 있었다. “안 통하지.” 이택현은 예상한 채로 기다리고 있었다. 하비에르 마스체라노가 슬라이딩 태클을 하는 타이밍을. 그래서 빠르게 반응할 수 있었다. 툭! 타닷! 이택현은 민첩한 움직임으로 대각선으로 길게 드리블했다. 이 움직임으로 하비에르 마스체라노의 슬라이딩 태클을 피해냈다. 미리 준비하고 있었기에 가능한 회피였다. 만약 예상하지 않았다면 피하지 못했을 태클이었다. ‘세계 최고의 수비형 미드필더다운 태클이야.’ 피해내긴 했지만, 이택현은 마스체라노의 태클에 감탄했다. 동시에 다른 선수를 떠올렸다. ‘근데 재욱이의 태클이 더 좋은 것 같은데? 걔 거는 미리 알고도 피하기가 어렵잖아.’ 신재욱의 슬라이딩 태클이 떠올랐다. 단둘이 일대일 훈련을 할 때마다 예상을 한 채로 대비해도 당할 때가 더 많았다. 그래서일까? 이택현은 하비에르 마스체라노보다 신재욱의 슬라이딩 태클 실력이 더 뛰어나다고 느꼈다. ‘집중하자.’ 이택현은 잡생각을 날려버렸다. 현 상황에 집중했다. 그는 덤벼드는 아르헨티나 선수를 또 한 번 제쳐냈다. 이번엔 상대의 측면 수비수였다. 현재 맨체스터 시티 FC에서 활약하고 있는 파블로 사발레타. 클래스가 있는 선수였지만, 지쳐버린 지금은 스피드 완급조절을 이용해서 드리블하는 이택현을 막아내지 못했다. ‘거의 다 왔어!’ 이택현의 입꼬리가 올라갔다. 좋은 기회를 거의 다 만들었다는 생각이 들었다. 그런데 이때. 잘 나가던 이택현은 드리블을 멈췄다. 그는 가깝게 따라붙은 동료에게 공을 넘기며 전방을 향해 뛰어나갔다. ‘이번에도 올 줄 알았어. 재욱아.’ 툭! 연장전 전반 13분. 신재욱이 공을 잡았다.","output":"210 * * * Shin Jae-wook maintained his composure. He had scored a goal, but he didn't celebrate. Of course, he was happy. But he deliberately didn't show it. He didn't want to disrupt the good atmosphere of the team. 'Getting too excited and jumping around now could loosen the screws.' Conceding a goal right after scoring due to complacency. It's a common occurrence on the professional stage. The Korean national team was barely holding on with sheer willpower, but once they fell, they wouldn't have the strength to get back up. They had to be careful. He even went as far as to act. He gathered his teammates and deliberately trembled his legs and staggered while speaking. 'This kind of action works best at times like this.' Shin Jae-wook's acting skills were good enough to deceive all his teammates. The Korean national team players showed immense motivation, not smiling but revealing intense competitiveness in their eyes. 'Good, it worked perfectly.' Shin Jae-wook suppressed the urge to laugh and walked towards his position. He didn't forget to stagger once more along the way. But then, something happened that made it hard for him to keep from laughing. [Your shooting has increased by 1!] The message indicated that his shooting attribute had increased. 'My shooting attribute is already at 93!' Overjoyed, Shin Jae-wook clenched his fist. He quickly bowed his head to prevent laughter from bursting out. Showing laughter now could disrupt the team's mood, and the effort he put into acting would be for naught. 'Hold it in.' Shin Jae-wook barely managed to suppress the laughter that was trying to escape. He lifted his head. At the same time, he staggered slightly. As if he had bowed his head because he was dizzy. It was an act of turning a crisis into an opportunity. \\"Jae-wook! Are you okay?\\" \\"Are you alright? Can you keep playing?\\" \\"Shouldn't you rest? You seem to be pushing yourself too hard.\\" \\"You're dizzy, aren't you?\\" His startled teammates rushed over. Shin Jae-wook, with a faint smile, shook his head. \\"I'm fine. I can keep playing.\\" The Korean national team players looked worried, but Shin Jae-wook quickly defused the situation by telling them to return to their positions as the game was about to resume. - Korea leads 5 to 4! Now the World Cup semifinals seem very close! A miracle is happening today! - Especially Shin Jae-wook is amazing! It really shows how much impact having a world-class player on the team can have! And there's also Lee Taek-hyun, who has great synergy with him! The game resumed. The Argentine players were shocked to have conceded a goal in extra time. The thought that they could lose began to take root in their minds. 'This is serious... We could actually lose...' 'Conceding at this time is a big deal...' 'Damn! We should have scored...' 'We need to catch up quickly, or it'll be dangerous.' Naturally, they became anxious, and the composure that had been evident in their movements disappeared. The sense of stability that came from their excellent skills was no longer visible. - The Argentine players are too hasty, aren't they? They keep making mistakes! - They seem to want to score a comeback goal quickly, don't they? But our players are not losing focus! They're doing so well! The Argentine players, drained of energy and now concentration, made numerous mistakes. However, Korea couldn't easily counterattack. Even Shin Jae-wook, who had energy to spare, was cautious. 'It's sloppy, but it's still Argentina. You never know when they'll launch a sharp attack. I have to help defend.' Shin Jae-wook saw it. A player who was minimizing his movements to conserve energy. 'Lionel Messi isn't running. He's definitely going to explode with energy at some point. I have to be careful then.' Lionel Messi, Argentina's ace and one of the world's best players. He had hardly run since the start of extra time. He was walking around as if taking a stroll, saving his energy to explode when the opportunity arose. Of course, such a strategy puts a strain on his teammates. If one person doesn't run, the rest have to run that much more. And Argentina was a team that could afford to do that. 'The Argentine players can support Messi's play.' Shin Jae-wook was wary of Lionel Messi. Realistically, there was no one on the Korean national team who could stop Messi. They couldn't stop him when they were fresh, let alone now that they were exhausted. 'I have to do it.' So he thought he had to stop Messi himself. But he wasn't certain. It would be a jackpot if he could stop him even once out of three attempts. Messi was that difficult to stop. 'But I still have to try.' Shin Jae-wook stayed focused. He was ready to react at any moment. That's when it happened. Argentina's attack, which had been sloppy, began to change. More precisely, the atmosphere itself changed. It was because Lionel Messi had the ball. Tap! Tap! Lionel Messi dribbled with very short touches. Although he was the smallest player on the field, his presence seemed huge as he advanced with the ball. To the Korean national team players, Lionel Messi appeared like a giant. - Lionel Messi is picking up speed! Messi unleashed the energy he had been saving. He dribbled quickly, trying to close the distance in an instant. At that moment, Shin Jae-wook moved. 'I have to cut him off.' He was prepared to commit a foul. To stop Messi, it was unavoidable. If he tried to stop him with a clean tackle, he might be taken advantage of. Whisk! Messi feinted with his body and changed direction, trying to bypass Shin Jae-wook in one go. 'As expected, Messi's movements are something you can't avoid even if you know them.' Shin Jae-wook was impressed. Messi's breakthrough was too difficult to stop. It was just body feinting, but the movements were too precise. Moreover, Messi was watching Shin Jae-wook's movements without missing a beat as he moved. It was a dribbling skill worthy of being called the world's best. But Shin Jae-wook couldn't let him pass. He had to stop him somehow. 'I'd rather give away a free kick.' Shin Jae-wook stuck close to Messi. He didn't fall for the body feints and slowed down Messi's advance with shoulder-to-shoulder combat. He couldn't extend his foot. He felt that the moment he did, Messi would take advantage of him. 'This is tough.' That's when it happened. Messi used a teammate. He exchanged a short one-two pass with Gonzalo Higuain, who was nearby, trying to shake off Shin Jae-wook. But Shin Jae-wook didn't miss that either. 'Sorry, but that's what I'm best at.' Shin Jae-wook was adept at plays involving teammates. He saw through the opponent's intentions and didn't even look at Higuain. He focused solely on Messi. 'I knew it would be like this.' Contrary to what he thought, Messi's expression hardened when Shin Jae-wook didn't fall back. \\"Why don't you back off a bit?\\" Messi, who rarely spoke during a match, let out an emotional remark. He was that frustrated. To this, Shin Jae-wook responded with a smirk. \\"How can I leave the god of soccer alone? I have to stop you somehow.\\" Messi's face contorted. Becoming emotionally agitated, he taunted Shin Jae-wook. \\"Do you think you can stop me?\\" But it didn't work at all. Shin Jae-wook burst into laughter and stretched out his leg. \\"If I thought I couldn't stop you, I wouldn't have even tried.\\" It wasn't a surprise tackle. He had gone in after seeing a momentary wobble in Messi's movement. A very, very small gap that most players couldn't catch. Shin Jae-wook aimed for that gap with a sliding tackle. Swoosh! His foot swept the grass, moving precisely to touch Messi's ball. True to his reputation as the god of soccer, Messi tried to pull the ball away even in that brief moment. He tried to avoid Shin Jae-wook's tackle. He almost did. But Shin Jae-wook's toe touched the ball just a bit faster. Tap! The distance between Messi and the ball widened. The ball without an owner. A player rushed towards it. He was someone who believed 100% that Shin Jae-wook would stop Messi. - Lee Taek-hyun grabs the ball and runs! It's a counterattack for South Korea! - The Bayern Munich duo is creating another great moment! Shin Jae-wook has stopped Lionel Messi, and Lee Taek-hyun is advancing with the ball! - Lee Taek-hyun's stamina is also impressive! Despite being in extra time, he's moving at quite a speed! Does he still have this much energy left?! Lee Taek-hyun was fast. He poured out all the energy he had recovered while focusing on defense, displaying explosive speed. Of course, he couldn't reach his usual speed because he was tired. But in the current state where both teams' players were exhausted, it was sufficiently fast. Tap! Tadadat! Dribbling while maintaining a proper distance from the ball, even as he tired. It was a play that became more difficult as fatigue set in, but Lee Taek-hyun executed it naturally. Then, a player lunged at him. It was Javier Mascherano. He decided he needed to quickly cut off Lee Taek-hyun's counterattack. So he attempted a sliding tackle. \\"Where do you think you're going!\\" Mascherano planned it. Just as Shin Jae-wook had cleanly tackled Messi, he would show a clean tackle on Lee Taek-hyun. But there was something he hadn't paid attention to. \\"It won't work.\\" Lee Taek-hyun was waiting for it. Waiting for the timing of Mascherano's sliding tackle. So he could react quickly. Tap! Tadat! Lee Taek-hyun dribbled diagonally with agile movements, avoiding Mascherano's sliding tackle. It was an evasion he could make because he was prepared. If he hadn't anticipated it, he wouldn't have been able to avoid the tackle. 'That's a tackle worthy of the world's best defensive midfielder.' Although he avoided it, Lee Taek-hyun admired Mascherano's tackle. At the same time, he thought of another player. 'But Jae-wook's tackles seem better, don't they? Even when I know they're coming, they're hard to avoid.' He recalled Shin Jae-wook's sliding tackles. During one-on-one training, even when he anticipated and prepared, he was often caught. Perhaps that's why? Lee Taek-hyun felt that Shin Jae-wook's sliding tackle skills were superior to Mascherano's. 'Focus.' Lee Taek-hyun shook off the distractions. He concentrated on the current situation. He shook off another Argentine player who lunged at him. This time it was the side-back. Pablo Zabaleta, currently playing for Manchester City FC. Although he was a player with class, he couldn't stop Lee Taek-hyun, who was dribbling using speed control, now that he was exhausted. 'I'm almost there!' Lee Taek-hyun's lips curled up. He felt he had almost created a good opportunity. But then. Lee Taek-hyun, who had been advancing well, stopped his dribble. He passed the ball to a close teammate and ran forward. 'I knew you'd come this time too, Jae-wook.' Tap! 13 minutes into the first half of extra time. Shin Jae-wook got the ball."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

당연히 알지! 세계 최고의 수비형 미드필더잖아. 최근에 걔 이기려고 엄청 분석하고 있어. 근데 갑자기 마스체라노는 왜?” “걔 이길 방법을 알려주려고.” “어? 정말? 진심이야? 그런 방법이 있다고?” “당연하지.” 이후, 신재욱은 이택현과의 일대일 연습에 많은 시간을 쏟았다. 하비에르 마스체라노는 약점이 별로 없는 선수였다. 그러니 세계 최고의 수비형 미드필더라는 말을 듣는 것이고. 다만, 상대할 방법이 없는 건 아니었다. 환생 전에 마스체라노를 여러 번 상대해봤던 신재욱은 그 방법을 알고 있었다. 그리고 그 방법들을 이택현에게 알려줬다. 물론 이유 없는 가르침은 아니었다. ‘이택현이 중원에서 마스체라노를 이겨주면 내가 골을 넣기도 편해질 거야.’ 이택현이 하비에르 마스체라노를 이길 수 있다면. 그건 신재욱의 성장에 분명히 도움이 되는 일이었으니까. 그리고 한국과 아르헨티나의 월드컵 8강전이 펼쳐지고 있는 지금. ― 우오오오오! 이택현 선수가 하비에르 마스체라노를 제쳐냈습니다! ― 이건 놀라운데요? 마스체라노 선수는 일대일에서는 웬만해서 뚫리지 않는 선수거든요? 이택현은 하비에르 마스체라노를 일대일에서 이겨냈다. “이게 바로 이택현 님의 폭풍드리블이다!” 연습한 것이 잘 통했다는 것에 잔뜩 신이 난 이택현은 그대로 다리를 휘둘렀다. 슈팅은 아니었다. 아르헨티나 수비수들의 뒷공간으로 침투하는 신재욱을 향한 스루패스였다. 터엉! 패스를 보낸 후. 이택현은 여전히 미소를 지은 채, 혀를 내둘렀다. “재욱이의 저 침투 타이밍은 보고도 못 따라 하겠다니까?” 공은 낮고 빠르게 쏘아졌다. 일반적인 전진 패스보다 훨씬 더 강한 패스였다. 웬만한 공격수들은 받기 힘들다고 투덜댈 정도로 힘이 들어간 패스. 그러나 신재욱은 좋아했다. ‘이래야 수비수들이 중간에 못 끊지.’ 패스가 세면 셀수록 자신에게 연결될 가능성이 늘어나니까. 아무리 강한 패스라도 받을 수 있다는 자신감이 있으니까. ‘좋은 스트라이커라면 어려운 패스도 받을 수 있어야지.’ 지금도 그랬다. 공에 실린 힘은 굉장히 강했지만, 신재욱은 자신감 있게 발을 뻗었다. 타이밍도 정확히 잡아냈다. 툭! 빨랐던 공이 신재욱의 발에 닿자 급격히 힘을 잃었다. 너무나도 얌전하게 다음 동작을 기다렸다. 그리고 신재욱은 그 공을 강하게 때려냈다. 골키퍼가 막을 생각도 하지 못하게끔 구석을 겨냥한 슛이었다. 쒸이이익! 짧은 바람 소리가 들렸다. 매우 짧은 시간이었다. 쏘아진 공은 아르헨티나의 골망을 흔들고 있었고, 신재욱은 골대 안으로 달렸다. 스윽! 골대 안에 있던 공을 들어 올리고 뛰기 시작했다. 경기장 중앙으로. ― 고오오오오오오올! 신재욱 선수가 또 넣었습니다! 이택현 선수의 패스를 받아서 강력한 슈팅을 때려 골을 기록했습니다! 신재욱 선수의 귀중한 골로 스코어는 3 대 1이 됩니다! ― 놀랍습니다! 우리 선수들이 아르헨티나를 상대로 믿기 어려울 정도로 잘 싸워주고 있습니다! 신재욱은 경기장 중앙으로 뛰었고, 그 주변엔 한국 대표팀 선수들이 있었다. 이들은 함께 뛰면서 골에 대한 기쁨을 드러내고 있었다. 특히 이택현은 다른 선수들보다 훨씬 더 기뻐하며 입을 쉬지 않았다. “재욱아! 봤지? 내가 마스체라노 발라버리는 거 봤지? 마스체라노 당황한 표정 봤지? 와! 이건 내가 하고도 소름이었다. 며칠간 했었던 특훈의 성과가 제대로 나왔어! 그리고 내 패스 어땠어? 딱 너만 받을 수 있을 정도로 쎄게 후려버렸는데, 역시 받아 넣더라고? 쩔었지? 신재욱 맞춤 택배 패스 맞지?” 신재욱은 피식 웃으며 고개를 끄덕였다. “그래. 전부 다 봤고, 패스도 최고였어.” 실제로 이택현의 플레이는 매우 좋았다. 솔직히 하비에르 마스체라노를 뚫어냈을 때는 신재욱조차 깜짝 놀랐다. ‘보면 볼수록 천재성이 대단한 친구야. 고작 며칠 연습했다고 마스체라노를 뚫어버리네.’ 며칠간 이택현을 훈련 시켰지만, 그가 마스체라노와의 대결에서 100% 이길 거라는 생각은 하지 않았다. 준비한 시간이 너무 짧았으니까. 하비에르 마스체라노는 어지간해선 당해주지 않는 대단한 선수니까. 그런데 이택현은 이겨버렸다. 천재적인 재능이 없었다면 불가능했을 일이다. 툭! 신재욱은 공을 바닥에 내려놨다. 그러곤 상대 선수들을 바라봤다. ‘기가 꺾이지 않았어. 3 대 1로 밀리고 있지만, 여전히 이길 수 있다고 생각하는 모양이야.’ 아르헨티나 선수들의 눈빛은 살아있었다. 저건 승리를 생각해야만 나오는 눈빛이었다. 즉, 아르헨티나는 한국을 이길 수 있다고 믿고 있었다. ‘실제로 그렇게 될 수도 있지. 아르헨티나는 그럴 수 있는 팀이니까.’ 신재욱은 상대의 실력을 인정했다. 저들은 한국의 수비를 부숴버릴 수 있는 팀이다. 전반전은 운 좋게 실점을 최소화했지만, 말 그대로 운이 좋았을 뿐이다. 후반전에도 운이 따를 것이라는 보장은 없다. 그래서 신재욱은 집중력을 끌어올렸다. ‘지금 스코어에 만족하면 안 돼. 더 골을 넣어야 이길 수 있어.’ * * * 3 대 1 스코어가 된 이후. 아르헨티나의 공격은 더욱 매서워졌다. 신재욱이 우려했던 부분이 현실이 되고 있었다. ― 리오넬 메시! 2명에게 둘러싸인 상태에서도 탈압박을 해냅니다! 이 선수를 막으려면 적어도 3명은 붙어야 할 것 같습니다! 더 붙어줘야 합니…… 어엇? ― ……! 해설들이 당황했다. 특유의 민첩한 드리블로 탈압박을 해낸 리오넬 메시가 기습적인 왼발 슈팅을 때려냈고, 부드럽게 휘어진 공이 골대 상단으로 파고들었기 때문이었다. 한국 대표팀 선수들이 순간 허탈한 감정을 숨기지 못했을 정도로 깔끔한 골이었다. ― 리오넬 메시 선수다운 골이 나왔습니다……! 우리 선수들이 최선을 다해서 막으려고 했지만, 역부족이었습니다. 축구의 신이라고 불리는 선수답게 엄청난 존재감을 보여주고 있습니다…! ― 비록 실점했지만, 괜찮습니다! 아직 우리가 3 대 2로 앞서나가고 있으니까 남은 시간 동안 잘 싸워준다면 충분히 승리할 수 있습니다! 해설들은 당황한 마음을 추스르며 애써 희망적인 메시지를 던졌다. 다만, 이들은 느끼고 있었다. 한국의 수비가 아르헨티나의 공격에 제대로 대응하지 못하고 있다는 걸. ― 에세키엘 라베시! 윤성영을 너무나도 쉽게 상대하며 한국의 측면을 뚫어냈습니다! 아! 윤성영과의 스피드 차이가 너무 심합니다! 한국의 위기는 끝나지 않았다. 후반 74분에 공을 잡은 에세키엘 라베시가 과감하게 드리블하며 한국의 수비를 휘저었다. ― 오늘 윤성영 선수가 라베시 선수를 전혀 막아내질 못하고 있습니다……! 에세키엘 라베시. 현재 파리 생제르맹 FC에 소속된 선수로 윙어로 뛸 때 매우 뛰어난 능력을 발휘한다. 특히 빠른 스피드와 뛰어난 기술을 바탕으로 한 드리블은 라베시의 가장 큰 무기 중 하나였다. ― 에세키엘 라베시가 공을 몰고 들어옵니다! 막아야죠! 더 들어오게 해서는 안 됩니다! 더 무서운 건 라베시의 무기는 매우 많다는 것이었다. 그는 위협적인 드리블뿐만 아니라 슈팅과 패스, 연계플레이에도 능한 선수였다. 지금도 그랬다. 아르헨티나의 스트라이커 곤살로 이과인을 막는 것에 집중하던 한국의 수비수들 앞에서. 에세키엘 라베시는 직접 슈팅을 시도했다. 측면에서 페널티박스 안으로 파고들며 강하게 때려버린 슈팅. 퍼어엉! 강렬한 타격음이 터졌다. 각도가 매우 좁은 곳에서의 슈팅. 흔히 골키퍼의 머리를 보고 때린다고 말하는 슈팅이었고, 의외로 많은 골이 나오는 위치였다. “……!” 깜짝 놀란 정석룡 골키퍼가 팔을 위로 뻗었다. 휘익! 그러나 공은 그의 행동보다 더 빨랐다. 이미 골대 안으로 파고들고 있었으니까. 철렁! 기어코 터진 아르헨티나의 동점 골. 이어진 아르헨티나 선수들의 세리머니. 한국 대표팀 선수들, 한국의 팬들에겐 믿고 싶지 않은 상황이었다. 실제로 한국의 축구팬들은 크게 당황하며 불안해하고 있었다. └ 아르헨티나 진짜 세다…… 이거 지는 거 아니야……? └ 그냥 수비에만 올인하고 승부차기까지 가야 할 것 같은데……? 아르헨티나랑 맞다이 뜨려고 하니까 계속 골 먹히잖아. └ 승부차기까지 가려면 연장전도 버텨야 하는데 가능할까? 메시랑 라베시 오늘 하는 거 보니까 미쳤는데……? └ 아르헨티나 애들 개잘한다…… 우리 수비는 변한 게 없네. 몸을 열심히 던지긴 하는데, 던지지 말아야 할 때도 던져서 골을 먹히네……. └ 에휴…… 신재욱이랑 이택현이 다 만들어준 밥상을 걷어차 버리는구나. └ ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ아르헨티나는 왜 후반전 되니까 더 세진 것 같냐? └ 전반전도 셌어. 우리가 운이 좋아서 골 안 먹혔던 것뿐이야. └ 신재욱이랑 이택현이 말도 안 되게 잘해주는데, 얘네한테 공이 연결되기도 전에 끊길 때가 너무 많아. 진심 팀이 도움이 안 되고 있어. └ 아…… 이거 나만 질 것 같냐? └ 패배 냄새 진하게 풍김…… 기적은 8강에서 끝나는 건가……. 같은 시각. 신재욱은 동료들을 다독이며 침착하게 상황을 바라봤다. 팀이 연달아 골을 내주며 3 대 3 동점이 된 것. 씁쓸하지만 예상 범위 안에 있는 일이었다. ‘어려운 상대라는 거 알고 있었잖아?’ 상대는 아르헨티나였다. 어떤 팀을 만나도 골을 넣을 수 있는 강팀. 더구나 리오넬 메시라는 세계 최고의 선수까지 보유한 팀이지 않은가. 신재욱이 생각하기엔 한국 대표팀 선수들은 충분히 잘해주고 있었다. 훨씬 더 수준이 높은 아르헨티나를 상대로 이 정도 해주는 것만으로도 고마웠다. 그래서 다시 한번 다짐했다. ‘내가 더 잘하면 돼.’ 자신이 더 좋은 경기력을 보여주겠다고. ― 경기 재개됩니다! 아르헨티나 선수들의 움직임에서 기세가 오른 게 느껴지네요. ― 3 대 1로 밀리던 상황에서 2골을 연달아 넣으며 동점을 만들었으니까요. 아르헨티나 선수들은 자신감이 매우 높아진 상태일 겁니다. 아르헨티나는 적극적이었다. 공을 가지고 있지 않을 때는 활발하게 움직이며 한국을 압박했고, 공을 가지고 있을 때는 과감하게 공격을 시도했다. 체력에도 큰 문제는 없었다. 가장 많이 뛴 선수들을 교체해줬기 때문이었다. 후보 선수들조차 실력이 뛰어난 아르헨티나였기에, 이들의 공격력은 교체 카드를 사용한 이후에도 강력했다. 반면 한국은 쉽게 교체 카드를 사용하지 못하고 있었다. 아르헨티나와는 다르게 주전과 비주전의 실력 차이가 큰 편이었으니까. “기죽지 말고 자신감 있게 하세요! 집중력 잃지 마세요! 역습 기회는 분명히 옵니다!” 신재욱은 밑으로 내려와서 수비에 가담하며 계속해서 동료들을 다독였다. 공격할 기회는 아직 오지 않고 있었다. 그만큼 한국은 경기력에서 밀리고 있었다. 사실상 반코트 게임이었다. 아르헨티나에게 불쌍할 정도로 얻어맞는 중이었다. 그랬음에도 신재욱은 포기하지 않았다. 이길 수 있다는 믿음도 여전했다. ‘지금 아르헨티나의 수비엔 빈틈이 많아. 이번 한 번만 잘 막으면 타이밍은 나온다.’ 많은 경험으로 인해서 알 수 있었다. 지금 아르헨티나는 너무 신이 난 나머지 방심하고 있었다. 신재욱은 그 기회를 기다리고 있었다. 그리고 그 기회는 빠르게 찾아왔다. 툭! 툭! 짧게 공을 치는 특유의 드리블을 하며 다가오는 아르헨티나의 한 선수. 신재욱은 그 선수의 눈을 똑바로 바라봤다. ‘이 친구, 내 기를 꺾고 싶은가 보네.’ 동시에 자세를 낮췄다. 당해줄 생각은 조금도 없었다. ‘누가 이기나 해보자. 리오넬 메시.’","output":"205 * * * A few days ago. Shin Jaewook called Lee Taekhyun. \\"Taekhyun, I have something to tell you.\\" \\"Huh? What is it?\\" \\"Do you know Mascherano from Argentina?\\" \\"Javier Mascherano? Of course, I know him! He's one of the world's best defensive midfielders. I've been analyzing a lot to beat him recently. But why bring up Mascherano all of a sudden?\\" \\"I'm going to tell you how to beat him.\\" \\"Really? Seriously? There's a way to do that?\\" \\"Of course.\\" After that, Shin Jaewook spent a lot of time practicing one-on-one with Lee Taekhyun. Javier Mascherano was a player with hardly any weaknesses. That's why he was known as one of the world's best defensive midfielders. However, it wasn't like there was no way to play against him. Shin Jaewook, who had faced Mascherano several times before his reincarnation, knew the method. And he taught those methods to Lee Taekhyun. Of course, the teaching was not without reason. 'If Taekhyun can beat Mascherano in the midfield, it will be easier for me to score goals.' If Lee Taekhyun could beat Javier Mascherano. That would certainly help Shin Jaewook's growth. And now, during the World Cup quarterfinals between Korea and Argentina. ― Wow! Player Lee Taekhyun has just outplayed Javier Mascherano! ― This is surprising, isn't it? Mascherano is a player who usually doesn't get beaten one-on-one, right? Lee Taekhyun had beaten Javier Mascherano one-on-one. \\"This is Lee Taekhyun's storm dribble!\\" Excited that the practice had paid off, Lee Taekhyun swung his leg. It wasn't a shot. It was a through pass towards Shin Jaewook, who was infiltrating the space behind the Argentine defenders. Thump! After sending the pass. Lee Taekhyun still had a smile on his face, sticking out his tongue. \\"I can't even follow Jaewook's timing even when I see it.\\" The ball was shot low and fast. It was a much stronger pass than a typical forward pass. A pass so powerful that most forwards would complain about how hard it was to receive. But Shin Jaewook liked it. 'That's how the defenders can't cut it off.' The stronger the pass, the more likely it was to reach him. Because he had the confidence that he could receive any strong pass. 'A good striker should be able to receive difficult passes.' It was the same now. The ball, which had been moving fast, lost its power abruptly when it reached Shin Jaewook's foot. It waited so obediently for the next move. And Shin Jaewook struck the ball hard. It was a shot aimed at the corner, so fast that the goalkeeper couldn't even think of blocking it. Swoosh! A short sound of wind was heard. It was a very brief moment. The shot ball was shaking the net of Argentina, and Shin Jaewook ran into the goal. Swoosh! He picked up the ball inside the goal and started running. Towards the center of the field. ― Goal! Shin Jaewook scores again! He received a pass from Lee Taekhyun and fired a powerful shot to score! With Shin Jaewook's precious goal, the score is now 3 to 1! ― Amazing! Our players are fighting unbelievably well against Argentina! Shin Jaewook ran to the center of the field, and around him were the Korean national team players. They were showing their joy for the goal together. Especially Lee Taekhyun, who was much happier than the other players, couldn't stop talking. \\"Jaewook! Did you see? Did you see me tearing apart Mascherano? Did you see Mascherano's confused face? Wow! It was chilling even for me. The results of the special training over the past few days really paid off! And how was my pass? I hit it hard enough so only you could receive it, and as expected, you scored, right? Wasn't it cool? A perfect delivery pass for Shin Jaewook, right?\\" Shin Jaewook smiled and nodded. \\"Yeah. I saw everything, and the pass was the best.\\" In fact, Lee Taekhyun's play was very good. Even Shin Jaewook was surprised when he broke through Javier Mascherano. 'The more I see, the more I realize his genius. He managed to break through Mascherano with just a few days of practice.' Shin Jaewook had trained Lee Taekhyun for a few days, but he didn't think he would win 100% against Mascherano. The preparation time was too short. After all, Javier Mascherano was a great player who wouldn't easily be beaten. But Lee Taekhyun did win. It would have been impossible without his genius talent. Thump! Shin Jaewook put the ball down on the ground. Then he looked at the opposing players. 'They're not discouraged. They're down 3 to 1, but they still think they can win.' The eyes of the Argentine players were alive. That was the look of someone who thinks they can win. In other words, Argentina believed they could beat Korea. 'In reality, that could happen. Argentina is a team that can do that.' Shin Jaewook acknowledged the opponent's skill. They were a team that could break Korea's defense. The first half was lucky to minimize the goals, but it was just good luck. There was no guarantee that luck would continue in the second half. So Shin Jaewook raised his concentration. 'I can't be satisfied with the current score. I need to score more goals to win.' * * * After the score became 3 to 1. Argentina's attack became even more fierce. The part Shin Jaewook was worried about was becoming a reality. ― Lionel Messi! He manages to escape pressure even when surrounded by two players! To stop this player, you need at least three... You need to get closer... Oh? ― ...! The commentators were flustered. Lionel Messi, who had escaped pressure with his unique agile dribbling, took a surprise left-footed shot, and the softly curving ball drilled into the top of the goal. ― A goal worthy of Lionel Messi...! Our players did their best to stop it, but it wasn't enough. Showing his tremendous presence as a player called the god of football...! ― Although we conceded a goal, it's okay! We're still leading 3 to 2, so if we fight well for the remaining time, we can definitely win! The commentators tried to regain their composure and threw hopeful messages. However, they felt it. Korea's defense was not properly responding to Argentina's attack. ― Ezequiel Lavezzi! He easily breaks through Korea's flank against Yoon Seongyoung! Ah! The speed difference between Yoon Seongyoung and Lavezzi is too great! Korea's crisis was not over. In the 74th minute of the second half, Ezequiel Lavezzi, who had the ball, boldly dribbled and stirred Korea's defense. ― Today, Yoon Seongyoung can't stop Lavezzi at all...! Ezequiel Lavezzi. Currently a player for Paris Saint-Germain FC, he shows excellent ability when playing as a winger. Especially his dribbling based on fast speed and excellent technique was one of Lavezzi's greatest weapons. ― Ezequiel Lavezzi is driving with the ball! You have to stop him! You can't let him come in any further! What was scarier was that Lavezzi had many weapons. He was not only threatening with his dribbling but also skilled in shooting, passing, and link-up play. It was the same now. In front of Korea's defenders, who were focused on blocking Argentina's striker Gonzalo Higuain. Ezequiel Lavezzi attempted a direct shot. He penetrated from the flank into the penalty box and fired a powerful shot. Bang! A loud impact sound exploded. A shot from a very narrow angle. It was commonly referred to as a shot taken by looking at the goalkeeper's head, and it was a position where many goals were scored. \\"......!\\" Startled, goalkeeper Jeong Seokryong stretched his arms up. Whisk! But the ball was faster than his action. It was already drilling into the goal. Clang! Argentina's equalizing goal finally burst. The following celebration by the Argentine players. For the Korean national team players and Korean fans, it was an unbelievable situation. In fact, Korean soccer fans were greatly flustered and anxious. └ Argentina is really strong... Are we going to lose this...? └ Should we just focus on defense and go to a penalty shootout...? We keep conceding goals when we try to face Argentina head-on. └ Can we survive extra time to get to a penalty shootout? Seeing Messi and Lavezzi play today, they're insane...? └ Argentina's players are so good... Our defense hasn't changed. They're throwing themselves hard, but they're also throwing themselves when they shouldn't and conceding goals... └ Sigh... Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun set the table, and now it's being kicked away. └ ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Why does Argentina seem stronger in the second half? └ They were strong in the first half too. We were just lucky not to concede goals. └ Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun are playing unbelievably well, but the ball gets cut off before it even reaches them too often. Seriously, the team isn't helping. └ Ah... Am I the only one who feels like we're going to lose? └ The smell of defeat is strong... Is the miracle ending in the quarterfinals...? At the same time. Shin Jaewook was calming his teammates and calmly observing the situation. The team had conceded consecutive goals and the score was tied at 3 to 3. It was bitter, but it was within the expected range. 'You knew it was a tough opponent, right?' The opponent was Argentina. A strong team that could score against any team. Moreover, they had Lionel Messi, the world's best player. Shin Jaewook thought the Korean national team players were doing well enough. He was grateful that they were doing this much against a much higher-level Argentina. So he made a promise to himself again. 'I just have to do better.' He would show better performance in the game. ― The game resumes! You can feel the momentum rising from the movements of the Argentine players. ― They were down 3 to 1, but after scoring two goals in a row, they tied the game, so the Argentine players must be very confident now. Argentina was aggressive. When they didn't have the ball, they moved actively and pressed Korea, and when they had the ball, they boldly attempted attacks. There was no big problem with their stamina. They had substituted their most tired players. Even the substitute players of Argentina were skilled, so their attacking power remained strong even after using the substitution cards. On the other hand, Korea couldn't easily use substitution cards. Unlike Argentina, there was a big difference in skill between the starters and the substitutes. \\"Don't get discouraged and play with confidence! Don't lose focus! There will definitely be a chance for a counterattack!\\" Shin Jaewook came down to join the defense and kept comforting his teammates. The opportunity to attack had not yet come. Korea was being outplayed in the game. It was practically a half-court game. They were being beaten up by Argentina to the point of pity. Yet Shin Jaewook did not give up. He still believed they could win. 'There are many gaps in Argentina's defense right now. If we defend well this one time, the timing will come.' He knew it from his many experiences. Argentina was now too excited and being careless. Shin Jaewook was waiting for that opportunity. And that opportunity came quickly. Thump! Thump! An Argentine player approached with his characteristic short dribbling. Shin Jaewook looked straight into that player's eyes. 'This guy wants to break my spirit.' At the same time, he lowered his stance. He had no intention of being beaten. 'Let's see who wins. Lionel Messi.'"},{"instruction":"207 * * * ― 우리 선수들이 모든 걸 쏟아붓고 있습니다! 체력이 다 떨어진 상황에서도 포기하지 않고 끝까지 싸우고 있습니다! ― 지금 같은 시간대면 선수들은 서 있는 것조차 힘들거든요? 그래도……그래도 조금만 더 힘을 내주길 바랍니다! 숨이 턱 끝까지 차올랐지만. 한국대표팀 선수들은 최선을 다했다. 그러나 제대로 된 공격을 시도하지 못하고 있었다. 아르헨티나가 라인을 올린 채로 공을 돌렸기 때문이었다. 골을 넣기보단 시간을 끌려는 의도. 한국대표팀 선수들도 그 의도를 눈치챘지만, 쉽게 덤벼들지 못했다. 공간을 내주면 곧바로 실점으로 이어질 수 있었으니까. 아르헨티나의 화력은 그만큼 강력했으니까. ― 아르헨티나 선수들도 정말……필사적으로 뛰고 있네요. 이 선수들, 4강을 향한 의지가 대단합니다. ― 시간이 별로 없네요……하지만 끝까지 봐야 합니다! 경기는 끝날 때까지 끝난 게 아닙니다! 90분이 되었을 때. 추가시간은 4분이 주어졌다. 한국대표팀 선수들은 여전히 포기하지 않고 있었다. 동료들을 끊임없이 격려하고 희망적인 말을 내뱉는 신재욱과 이택현 덕분이었다. 그러나 한국을 응원하던 팬들은 불안한 감정을 숨기지 못하고 있었다. └ 진 것 같은데……? └ 아……한국의 기적은 8강에서 끝나는구나……. └ 결국엔 아르헨티나한테 발목이 잡히는 건가ㅠㅠ └ 근데 어쩔 수 없긴 해……우리 수비 실력 알고 있었잖아? 얘네로 리오넬 메시랑 곤살로 이과인을 어떻게 막아……. └ 90분 됐네……하……이젠 진짜 사실상 끝났다고 봐도 되겠네……. └ ㅠㅠㅠ진짜 수비ㅠㅠㅠ 개빡친다ㅠㅠㅠㅠ └ 수비한텐 애초에 기대하면 안 돼. 근데 오늘은 신재욱이랑 이택현, 기석용 말고는 다 못했어. └ 아르헨티나랑 수준 차이가 이렇게 크구나. 그나마 희망적인 건 신재욱과 이택현은 몇 년 뒤면 더 무서워질 것 같다는 거야. 잘하면 4년 뒤의 월드컵에선 더 높은 곳까지 올라갈 수도 있겠어. └ 아쉽지만 8강도 잘한 거긴 해ㅠㅠㅠ 한국팬들은 불안해하는 것을 넘어서 체념했다. 시간은 없는데, 경기는 여전히 아르헨티나가 이끌고 있었으니까. 그래서일까? 추가시간 2분이 되었을 때. 여전히 활발하게 뛰어다니던 신재욱이 상대의 패스를 끊어냈다. 주특기인 슬라이딩 태클을 이용한 컷팅이었다. ― 신재욱 선수가 페르난도 가고 선수에게서 공을 뺏어냈습니다! 아! 이건 후반전에 교체되어 들어온 페르난도 가고 선수의 치명적인 실수이기도 하죠! 조금은 느린 타이밍에 패스를 시도한 페르난도 가고. 그 틈을 신재욱은 놓치지 않았다. 촤악! 신재욱은 손바닥으로 잔디가 깔린 바닥을 짚고 몸을 일으켰다. 가능한 한 가장 빠르게 움직였다. 최대 속도로 역습을 펼쳐야 했다. 그래야 역습이 통할 확률이 높아진다. ‘이번 기회는 꼭 살려야 해.’ 한국의 해설들이 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. ― 오오?! 이러면 역습 기회입니다! ― 신재욱 선수! 재빨리 몸을 일으킵니다! 빠르게 전진해야 합니다! 우리 선수들! 힘들겠지만, 그래도 힘을 내줬으면 좋겠습니다! 한국대표팀 선수들은 체력적으로 지쳐있었다. 그럴 수밖에 없었다. 경기 내내 너무 많이 뛰었으니까. 더구나 신재욱의 빠른 역습 템포에 따라올 수 있는 선수 자체가 별로 없었다. 그래도 다행인 것은. “재욱아! 일단 넘겨줘!” 이택현의 존재였다. 터엉! 신재욱은 이택현의 말이 끝나기도 전에 패스를 뿌렸다. 워낙 시야가 넓은 그였기에 이미 이택현의 위치와 움직임을 파악하고 있었다. 툭! 이택현도 지쳐있었지만, 다른 선수들에 비해선 상태가 나았다. 타고난 체력이 좋은 데다가 체력훈련까지 치열하게 해온 결과였다. ― 이택현 선수가 공을 몰고 달립니다! 그리고 그 뒤에서 신재욱 선수도 달립니다! 바이에른 뮌헨 듀오가 사실상 마지막 공격을 펼치고 있습니다! ― 이택현 선수의 체력은 대단하네요! 경기가 거의 끝나가는 시간대임에도 너무나도 빠른 속도를 보여주고 있습니다! 달리는 이택현에게 아르헨티나의 수비형 미드필더 루카스 비글리아가 덤벼들었다. 지금은 아르헨티나에게도 워낙 급한 상황이었기에, 루카스 비글리아는 반칙으로 이택현의 전진을 막아내려고 했다. 옷을 붙잡은 것이다. 웬만한 선수는 넘어질 수밖에 없는 반칙. 그런데 이택현은 달랐다. “으아아아아! 놔 인마!” 강한 힘과 굉장한 피지컬을 지닌 이택현은 전진을 멈추지 않았다. 뒤에서 옷을 잡는 루카스 비글리아를 강하게 뿌리쳐냈다. 그 과정에서 이택현의 유니폼 상의가 찢어졌다. 찌지직! 이택현은 신경도 쓰지 않았다. 오로지 골을 만들기 위해 집중할 뿐이었다. ‘집중! 계속 집중하자! 내가 뺏기지만 않으면 돼. 그리고 꼭 혼자 할 필요도 없어. 재욱이라면 분명 근처에 있을 거야!’ 이택현은 땅을 강하게 박찼다. 옷이 잡혀서 줄어든 속도를 다시 높였다. 타앗! 타다닷! 빠르게 역습을 나온 상황. 그럼에도 아르헨티나의 수비수는 4명이나 있었다. 애초에 아르헨티나의 수비수들은 라인을 올리고 있지 않았기 때문이었다. ‘재욱이랑 둘이 다 해야 하는구나?’ 이택현과 신재욱 둘이서 수비수 4명을 이겨야 하는 상황. 쉬운 일이 아니었다. 그러나 이택현은 전혀 두려워하지 않았다. 걱정도 없었다. ‘그랬던 적 많잖아.’ 비슷한 경험이 많았으니까. ‘다른 동료라면 모를까, 신재욱이랑 같이 가는 건데 뭘.’ 그에게 있어서 가장 든든한 친구이자 동료는 신재욱이었으니까. ‘내가 조금 실수해도 저 괴물이 다 해줄 거야.’ 이택현은 아르헨티나의 수비수 2명을 앞에 둔 채로 자신감 있게 움직였다. 뚫으려는 의도는 아니었다. 물론 빈틈이 있다면 그렇게 하겠지만, 상대는 수준 낮은 수비수들이 아니다. 빈틈이 별로 없었다. 그러나 아예 없는 건 아니었다. 이택현은 스텝오버를 한 뒤, 오른쪽 대각선으로 움직였다. 수비수들을 끌어들이려는 의도였다. 투욱! 툭! 툭! 수비수 하나가 가까이 달라붙었지만 이택현은 흔들리지 않았다. 강력한 피지컬과 볼 키핑 능력을 발휘하며 공을 지켜냈다. 그때였다. ‘지금! 지금이라면 재욱이가 뒤에 있을 것 같아!’ 감각과 경험에 의존한 플레이였다. 이택현은 뒤를 보지 않은 채, 발뒤꿈치로 백패스를 했다. 신재욱이 있을 것을 예상하며 보낸 힐패스였다. 뒤를 확인하지 않은 이유는 하나였다. ‘이렇게 해야 속으니까.’ 아르헨티나의 수준 높은 수비수들을 속이기 위함이었다. 하지만 도박성 플레이라는 건 변하지 않았다. 만약 신재욱이 이택현의 의도를 예상하지 못하고 있었다면, 그냥 어이없게 기회를 날리게 되는 것이다. 이때, 이택현의 뒤에서 기다렸던 목소리가 들렸다. “좋은 패스야.” 그 순간 이택현의 입꼬리가 올라갔다. “그래, 신재욱 너라면 거기쯤 있을 줄 알았어.” 경기장엔 거대한 함성이 쏟아져나왔다. 이택현과 신재욱의 놀라운 호흡과 기적적인 동점 골을 만들어낼 수도 있겠다는 기대감이 담긴 함성이었다. 그런 상황에서 신재욱이 다리를 휘둘렀다. 굳이 수비수들을 직접 상대할 생각은 없었다. ‘슈팅 한 방이면 충분한데, 왜 상대를 해줘야 해?’ 이택현이 공간을 다 만들어줬다. 패스도 슈팅하기 좋게끔 줬다. 굳이 공을 잡고 시간을 끌 필요가 없지 않겠는가. 게다가 슈팅은 신재욱의 가장 강한 무기 중 하나이지 않은가. 퍼어엉! 신재욱의 발등에 걸린 공이 커다란 타격음과 함께 빠르게 날아갔다. ― 신재욱! 때립니다! 함성을 지르던 관중들은 입을 다물었다. 이들 모두 눈을 부릅뜬 채 공에 집중했다. * * * 신재욱은 발등으로 공을 때려낸 순간 느꼈다. ‘잘 맞았어.’ 아주 좋은 슈팅을 만들어냈다는 것을. 쒸이이이익! 빠른 속도로 쏘아지는 공을 바라봤다. 당연하게도 골키퍼가 움직이는 것도 보였다. ‘세르히오 로메로, 좋은 골키퍼야.’ 그러나 공은 골키퍼보다 훨씬 더 빨랐다. ‘근데 이 슈팅은 못 막을 거야.’ 골키퍼가 손을 휘둘렀을 때. 공은 골대 안으로 들어가 골망을 찢을 듯 흔들었다. “……됐다.” 신재욱은 참았던 숨을 터트렸다. 아무런 표정이 없던 얼굴엔 드디어 미소가 떠올랐다. ― 어억? 우어어어어! 고…골! 골입니다…! 신재욱 선수의 골입니다! 기적적인 골이 나왔습니다! 한국! 동점 골을 만들어냈습니다! ― 이건 정말 기적입니다! 이택현 선수와 신재욱 선수가 환상적인 호흡을 발휘하며 기적과도 같은 골을 만들어냈습니다! 사실상 우리의 패배로 끝이 날 것 같은 경기였는데, 이 어린 천재들이 희망의 불씨를 살려냈습니다! ― 신재욱 선수는 방금 넣은 골로 해트트릭을 기록했습니다! 월드컵 8강이라는 큰 무대에서! 아르헨티나라는 강팀을 상대로 해트트릭을 하는 만18세의 선수가 여기 있습니다! 현재 시각 추가시간 3분. 경기 종료를 1분 남기고 터진 골이었다. * * * 신재욱의 기적 같은 골로 4 대 4 스코어가 된 지금. 아르헨티나 선수들은 깊은 한숨을 내쉬며 고개를 숙였다. 고개를 숙이는 바람에 보이지 않았지만, 이들 모두 믿을 수 없다는 표정을 짓고 있었다. “하…….” “아……이렇게 된다고……?” “말도 안 돼…….” “다 왔는데……4강까지 다 왔는데…….” 아르헨티나를 응원하던 팬들도 경악하고 있었다. 이들은 너무 큰 충격을 받아서 아무런 말도 하지 못하고 있었다. 반면 한국은 축제 분위기였다. └ 미친!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 됐어!!!!!!!!!!!!!! └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ이거 뭐야?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ이게 된다고?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ ㅅㅂ 꿈 아니지? 이거 실화 맞지? └ 골!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! └ 신재욱 해트트릭ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 아르헨티나한테 해트트릭 박는 한국인 선수가 있다???? └ 와나ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이택현이 뒤 안 보고 힐패스 할 때 쌍욕 나올 뻔했는데, 이걸 또 신재욱이 다이렉트 중거리 슛으로 골을 넣어버리네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 얘네 둘 진짜 뭐야? 둘이 텔레파시 있는 거 아니냐고?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 둘이 호흡이 미쳤어ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 신재욱은 이택현이 패스할 걸 다 알고 있었다는 것처럼 움직였다니까?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이택현도 신재욱이 올 걸 알고 있다는 듯이 힐패스를 했고ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 이런 게 기적인가……? 이 경기가 연장전까지 간다고……? └ 대박!!!!! 설마 이기려나? 아르헨티나를?;;;;; └ 신재욱은 신이야. 걍 GOD재욱임. └ 4강 가나요? 여러분!!! 4강 갈 수 있는 희망이 생겼습니다!!!! └ GOD재욱이 이걸 멱살 잡고 끌고 가네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이처럼 TV로 경기를 보던 한국팬들은 미친 듯 열광했고. 각종 방송사는 실시간으로 일어난 기적을 재빨리 보도하기 시작했다. 한국 최대의 포털사이트에서의 반응도 비슷했다. 신재욱의 이름과 월드컵 8강전과 관련된 기사들이 계속해서 생성되고 있었다. 같은 시각. 골을 넣은 신재욱은 골대 안을 향해 달려가지 않았다. 지금은 경기장 중앙으로 뛸 생각이 없었다. 대신 그는 한국대표팀 동료들을 불러모았다. “다들 모여보세요.”","output":"207 * * * ― Our players are giving it their all! Even though they are completely drained, they are not giving up and fighting to the end! ― At this time, it's even hard for the players to stand, right? But still... we hope they can muster a little more strength! The Korean national team players were out of breath but did their best. However, they were unable to attempt a proper attack. It was because Argentina was circulating the ball with a high line. Their intention was more to waste time than to score a goal. The Korean players noticed this intention but couldn't easily attack. If they gave up space, it could lead directly to conceding a goal. Argentina's firepower was that strong. ― The Argentine players are really... running desperately. Their will to reach the semifinals is tremendous. ― There's not much time left... but we have to watch until the end! The game isn't over until it's over! When the 90th minute arrived. There were 4 minutes of added time. The Korean national team players were still not giving up. Thanks to Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun, who were constantly encouraging their teammates and speaking words of hope. But the fans supporting Korea couldn't hide their anxiety. └ It feels like we've lost... └ Ah... Korea's miracle ends in the quarterfinals... └ Are we going to be tripped up by Argentina in the end?ㅠㅠ └ But it's inevitable... We knew about our defensive skills, right? How could we stop Lionel Messi and Gonzalo Higuain... └ It's been 90 minutes... sigh... now it's really over... └ ㅠㅠㅠ Really the defenseㅠㅠㅠ It's so frustratingㅠㅠㅠㅠ └ You shouldn't expect too much from the defense. But today, except for Shin Jaewook, Lee Taekhyun, and Ki Seok-yong, everyone else didn't perform well. └ The level difference with Argentina is this big. At least the hopeful thing is that Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun seem like they'll be even scarier in a few years. If they do well, we might climb higher in the World Cup four years from now. └ It's a pity, but reaching the quarterfinals was still goodㅠㅠㅠ Korean fans had moved beyond anxiety to resignation. There was no time left, and Argentina was still leading the game. Perhaps that's why? When there were 2 minutes left in added time. Shin Jaewook, who had been actively running, intercepted the opponent's pass. It was a cutting using his specialty sliding tackle. ― Shin Jaewook has stolen the ball from Fernando Gago! Ah! This is a critical mistake by Fernando Gago, who was substituted in the second half! Fernando Gago attempted a pass with slightly slow timing. Shin Jaewook didn't miss that opportunity. Swoosh! Shin Jaewook pushed himself up from the grass-covered ground with his palms. He moved as quickly as possible. He had to launch a counterattack at maximum speed. That was the only way to increase the chance of a successful counterattack. 'I must make the most of this opportunity.' The Korean commentators stood up from their seats. ― Oh?! This could be a chance for a counterattack! ― Shin Jaewook! He quickly gets up! He needs to advance quickly! Our players! It must be hard, but we hope you can muster the strength! The Korean national team players were physically exhausted. It was inevitable. They had run too much throughout the game. Moreover, there were hardly any players who could keep up with Shin Jaewook's fast counterattack tempo. Fortunately, there was one thing. \\"Jaewook! Just pass it to me!\\" It was the presence of Lee Taekhyun. Thump! Shin Jaewook passed the ball even before Lee Taekhyun finished speaking. Having a wide field of vision, he had already grasped Lee Taekhyun's position and movement. Thump! Lee Taekhyun was tired too, but he was in better shape than the other players. It was the result of his naturally good stamina and intense physical training. ― Lee Taekhyun is running with the ball! And Shin Jaewook is running behind him! The Bayern Munich duo is carrying out what is essentially the last attack! ― Lee Taekhyun's stamina is incredible! Even though the game is almost over, he is showing such a fast speed! Lucas Biglia, Argentina's defensive midfielder, charged at the running Lee Taekhyun. It was such an urgent situation for Argentina that Lucas Biglia tried to stop Lee Taekhyun's advance with a foul. He grabbed his shirt. A foul that would normally cause any player to fall. But Lee Taekhyun was different. \\"Uaaaah! Let go, damn it!\\" Lee Taekhyun, with his strong strength and tremendous physicality, did not stop advancing. He forcefully shook off Lucas Biglia, who was grabbing his shirt from behind. In the process, Lee Taekhyun's jersey was torn. Rip! Lee Taekhyun didn't care. He was only focused on creating a goal. 'Focus! Keep focusing! I just need not to lose the ball. And I don't have to do it alone. Jaewook will definitely be nearby!' Lee Taekhyun stomped on the ground. He increased his speed, which had been reduced due to his shirt being grabbed. Tap! Tap-tap! In the situation of a fast counterattack. Yet, there were still four Argentine defenders. Initially, Argentina's defenders were not pushing up their line. 'It's just Jaewook and me against them?' Lee Taekhyun and Shin Jaewook had to beat four defenders. It wasn't an easy task. But Lee Taekhyun was not afraid at all. He had no worries. 'We've been through this many times.' He had plenty of similar experiences. 'With anyone else, I might not know, but with Shin Jaewook, what's there to worry about?' For him, the most reliable friend and teammate was Shin Jaewook. 'Even if I make a little mistake, that monster will take care of everything.' Lee Taekhyun moved confidently with two Argentine defenders in front of him. He wasn't intending to break through. Of course, if there was an opening, he would do so, but the opponents were not low-level defenders. There were hardly any gaps. But not completely none. Lee Taekhyun did a stepover and then moved diagonally to the right. He intended to draw in the defenders. Thump! Thump! Thump! One defender got close, but Lee Taekhyun was not shaken. He demonstrated his strong physicality and ball-keeping ability to protect the ball. Then the moment came. 'Now! If it's now, Jaewook should be behind me!' It was a play based on instinct and experience. Without looking back, Lee Taekhyun back-heeled a pass. It was a heel pass sent with the expectation that Shin Jaewook would be there. He didn't check behind for one reason. 'It's more deceptive this way.' It was to fool Argentina's high-level defenders. But the play was still a gamble. If Shin Jaewook had not anticipated Lee Taekhyun's intention, it would have been a wasted opportunity. Then, a voice came from behind Lee Taekhyun. \\"Nice pass.\\" At that moment, the corners of Lee Taekhyun's mouth rose. \\"Yeah, Shin Jaewook, I knew you'd be around there.\\" A massive cheer erupted in the stadium. It was a cheer filled with the expectation that the amazing coordination between Lee Taekhyun and Shin Jaewook could create a miraculous equalizing goal. In that situation, Shin Jaewook swung his leg. He had no intention of directly confronting the defenders. 'Why bother with them when one shot is enough?' Lee Taekhyun had created the space. The pass was also perfect for shooting. There was no need to hold the ball and waste time. Besides, shooting was one of Shin Jaewook's strongest weapons. Bang! The ball struck by Shin Jaewook's instep flew away with a loud impact sound. ― Shin Jaewook! He shoots! The shouting crowd fell silent. Everyone focused on the ball with wide eyes. * * * Shin Jaewook felt it the moment he struck the ball with his instep. 'It hit well.' He had produced a very good shot. Swoosh! He watched the ball fly at high speed. Naturally, he also saw the goalkeeper moving. 'Sergio Romero, a good goalkeeper.' But the ball was much faster than the goalkeeper. 'But he won't be able to stop this shot.' When the goalkeeper swung his hand. The ball entered the goal and shook the net as if to tear it apart. \\"...It's done.\\" Shin Jaewook let out the breath he had been holding. A smile finally appeared on his previously expressionless face. ― Uh? Wow! Go... Goal! It's a goal by Shin Jaewook! A miraculous goal! Korea! They have scored the equalizing goal! ― This is truly a miracle! Lee Taekhyun and Shin Jaewook have shown fantastic coordination to create a goal that's like a miracle! It seemed like the game was going to end in our defeat, but these young geniuses have revived the spark of hope! ― With that goal, Shin Jaewook has scored a hat-trick! On the big stage of the World Cup quarterfinals! Against a strong team like Argentina, here is an 18-year-old player who has scored a hat-trick! With 3 minutes into added time. The goal came with just 1 minute left before the end of the game. * * * Now, with the score at 4 to 4 thanks to Shin Jaewook's miraculous goal. The Argentine players sighed deeply and hung their heads. They were all wearing expressions of disbelief, though it wasn't visible because their heads were down. \\"Ha...\\" \\"Ah... how did it come to this...?\\" \\"It doesn't make sense...\\" \\"We were so close... to the semifinals...\\" The fans supporting Argentina were also in shock. They were so stunned that they couldn't say a word. On the other hand, Korea was in a festive mood. └ Crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's done!!!!!!!!!!!!!! └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ What is this?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Is this really happening?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ ㅅㅂ Is this not a dream? This is real, right? └ Goal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! └ Shin Jaewook hat-trickㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ A Korean player scoring a hat-trick against Argentina???? └ Wowㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ When Lee Taekhyun did the no-look heel pass, I almost cursed, but then Shin Jaewook scores with a direct long-range shotㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ What are these two? Do they have telepathy or something?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Their coordination is insaneㅋㅋㅋㅋ Shin Jaewook moved as if he knew Lee Taekhyun would pass itㅋㅋㅋㅋ And Lee Taekhyun did the heel pass as if he knew Shin Jaewook would comeㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Is this what a miracle is...? Is this game going to extra time...? └ Amazing!!!!! Could we actually win? Against Argentina?;;;;; └ Shin Jaewook is a god. Just GOD Jaewook. └ Are we going to the semifinals? Everyone!!! We have hope to reach the semifinals!!!! └ GOD Jaewook is dragging us alongㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Like this, Korean fans watching the game on TV were ecstatic. Various broadcasters began to report the miracle that had just happened in real-time. The reaction on Korea's largest portal site was similar. Articles related to Shin Jaewook and the World Cup quarterfinals were continuously being generated. At the same time. Shin Jaewook, who had scored the goal, did not run towards the goal. He had no intention of running to the center of the field right now. Instead, he called his teammates from the Korean national team together. \\"Everyone, gather around.\\""},{"instruction":"209 * * * 연장전이 시작된 지 얼마 지나지 않았을 때. 신재욱 덕에 동기부여를 했던 한국대표팀의 정신력이 더욱 강해졌다. 기세도 더 강해졌다. ― 우리 선수들의 움직임이 더욱 좋아진 것 같은데요? 정말…말이 안 될 정도로 대단한 정신력입니다! ― 어떻게 이렇게까지 뛰어줄 수 있죠? 연장전까지 오느라 분명히 힘들 텐데 말이죠! ― 그만큼 이 경기에서 이기고 싶은 것 같습니다! 우리 선수들이 4강을 바라보고 있습니다! 이번에도 신재욱 때문이었다. 다리가 풀려버려 제대로 걷지도 못하는 모습을 보여줬던 팀의 막내이자 에이스가. 연장전이 시작되자마자 이를 악물고 가장 활발하게 뛰어다니는 모습을 보여줬으니까. ― 우리 선수들 모두 놀라울 정도로 많이 뛰어주고 있는데, 특히 신재욱 선수는……엄청나게 뛰어다니네요……! ― 이제는 걱정이 될 정도입니다. 신재욱 선수는 오늘 경기장에 있는 선수 중 가장 많이 뛰고 있는 선수거든요? 그런데 연장전에서도 지친 모습을 보이지 않고 뛰고 있습니다! 혹시 신재욱 선수는 힘든 걸 느끼지 못하는 걸까요? ― 분명 힘들 겁니다. 현역으로 뛰는 선수들이 했던 말 중에 그런 말이 있습니다. 90분 풀타임을 뛰면 힘들어서 죽을 것 같고, 연장전을 뛰면 이미 죽은 상태로 뛰는 것이라고요. 그만큼 힘들다는 겁니다. 신재욱 선수는 워낙 정신력이 뛰어나기에 참고 뛰는 것 같습니다. 해설들과 경기장에 있는 선수들, 그리고 경기를 지켜보는 팬들까지. 너무 많이 뛰는 신재욱을 걱정했다. └ 신재욱 괜찮은 건가……? 너무 많이 뛰는 것 같은데? └ 거의 쉬질 않고 뛰고 있어. 오늘 경기 내내 혼자 2인분 이상은 계속 해주고 있는데? 저게 가능한 거구나……? └ 2인분은 무슨ㅋㅋㅋ 축알못이냐? 최전방에서 공 따주지, 공 지켜주지, 내려와서 연계해주지, 수비 가담해주지, 공 잡으면 상대 선수들 2~3명이 달라붙지. 이건 그냥 최소 3인분은 해주고 있는 거야. └ 위에 말이 맞아. 신재욱이 3인분 정도는 해주고 있어. 그러니까 연장까지 왔지. 근데 그건 그렇고, 신재욱 체력이 왜 저렇게 좋아?;;;; 예전엔 저 정도는 아니었던 것 같은데? └ 노력파 천재잖아. 아직도 팀에서 가장 열심히 훈련한다더라. 바이에른 뮌헨에서도 그렇고, 국가대표팀에 와서도 똑같다던데? 기석용이 한 인터뷰 못 봤어? 기석용이 대표팀에서 신재욱을 처음 봤을 때 너무 놀랐다잖아. 훈련을 너무 열심히 한대. 훈련하는 시간 자체가 긴데, 그 시간 내내 집중해서 필사적으로 한다더라. └ ㄷㄷㄷ미쳤네……근데 오늘은 좀 걱정되는데? 저러다가 쓰러지는 거 아님? └ 그러게. 오늘은 과하게 뛰는 것처럼 보이는데……. 이처럼 모두가 걱정하고 있을 때. 한국의 경기력은 점점 좋아졌다. 그리고 연장전 전반 3분 40초가 되었을 때는. ― 좋습니다! 기석용 선수가 아르헨티나의 패스를 끊어냈습니다! 기석용은 좋은 컷팅이었다. 공을 가로챈 그는 곧바로 전방을 향해 낮고 빠른 패스를 뿌렸다. 지친 상태였지만, 강한 정신력을 발휘하고 있는 상태였기에 집중력을 잃지 않았다. 툭! 공이 연결됐다. 신재욱에게로. ― 신재욱 선수가 공을 받습니다! 패스가 조금은 강해 보였는데, 예술적인 트래핑 실력으로 받아내네요! ― 신재욱 선수의 순두부 터치는 이미 유명하죠! 이 선수는 웬만한 패스는 다 안정적으로 받아냅니다! 조금은 밑으로 내려와서 공을 받은 상황. 신재욱은 몸을 돌리는 것과 동시에 패스를 뿌렸다. 다른 선수였다면 주변의 시야를 확인한 다음에 패스를 시도했겠지만, 신재욱은 그럴 필요가 없었다. 주변의 시야는 공을 받기 전에 이미 확인해둔 상태였으니까. 퍼어엉! 기습적으로 뿌려낸 패스. 아르헨티나의 반응은 느렸다. 지쳤기 때문이었다. 반면 공을 받으러 가는 이택현의 반응은 빨랐다. 신재욱과 함께 강도 높은 훈련을 소화해온 그는 거친 숨을 내쉬면서도 움직임을 멈추지 않았다. 상대의 뒷공간을 침투하면서도 날아오는 공을 발등으로 부드럽게 떨어뜨렸다. 달리던 속도도 거의 떨어지지 않았다. 투욱! 좋은 퍼스트터치였다. 상대의 뒷공간으로 침투했고, 공도 잘 받아낸 상황. 평소의 이택현이라면 골대 근처까지 달려가서 직접 골을 만들어 수 있는 기회였다. 그러나 지금은 연장전이었다. 전속력으로 스프린트하고 공을 받아내는 움직임만으로도 이택현은 힘들어했다. ‘죽을 것 같네.’ 이택현은 거친 숨을 내쉬며 주변을 둘러봤다. 이미 상대 선수 하나가 근처까지 쫓아오고 있었다. 교체되어 들어왔기 때문에 아직 체력에 여유가 있는 선수였다. 평소엔 유럽에서도 손에 꼽힐 정도로 빠른 이택현이었지만, 지금은 그렇게 빠른 속도를 내지 못하고 있었다. 이대로라면 따라잡힐 것만 같았다. 자연스레 동료를 찾게 됐다. ‘아무나 도와줘!’ 입 밖으로 도와달라는 말을 외치고 싶었지만 그러지 못했다. 입을 여는 순간, 말이 아니라 심장이 튀어나올 것만 같았으니까. 그만큼 모든 부분에서 한계치였다. 그때였다. 이택현의 눈엔 보였다. 그를 앞질러 달려가는 선수가. “……?” 너무 놀라서 그 선수의 얼굴도 확인하지 못했지만, 이택현은 본능적으로 공을 툭― 밀어줬다. 예상되는 선수가 있었기 때문이었다. “…신재욱?” 예상은 틀리지 않았다. 뒷모습만으로도 알 수 있었다. 신재욱이라는 것을. 그는 너무나도 멀쩡하게, 마치 갓 경기에 출전한 것처럼 공을 몰고 전진했다. 이어서 달려드는 골키퍼까지 제쳐낸 뒤, 골대 안을 향해 가볍게 공을 밀어 넣었다. 긴장감이라고는 조금도 없는 모습. 연장전에 골을 넣었으면서도 전혀 흥분하지 않고 당연하다는 듯 손가락 4개를 들어 올리는 모습. 그 모습을 바라보며 이택현은 작게 중얼거렸다. “……따라가려면 멀었네.” * * * 우와아아아아! 함성이 쏟아졌다. 관중석에 있던 한국팬들은 ‘대한민국’을 외치며 열광했다. ― 고오오오오오오오오올! 골입니다! 신재욱 선수가 해냈습니다! 한국의 천재가 아르헨티나를 상대로 4개의 골을 터트립니다! ― 이번에도 바이에른 뮌헨 듀오네요! 이 두 선수가 또다시 귀중한 골을 선물했습니다! ― 경이롭네요! 신재욱 선수가 정말 경이로운 플레이를 보여줬습니다! 이택현 선수에게 패스한 뒤에 필사적으로 달려가더니 결국엔 골까지 만들어냈습니다! 마지막엔 침착하게 골키퍼까지 제쳐냈고요! ― 이제 스코어는 5 대 4가 되었습니다! 우리가 추가 실점 없이 버텨낸다면 4강에 올라갈 수 있게 됐습니다! 연장전에 나온 신재욱의 골은 아르헨티나를 제외한 모두를 흥분시켰다. 한국팬들과 독일팬들, 더 나아가 전 세계축구팬들이 열광했다. 신재욱을 아는 축구팬들은 전부 자리에서 일어나 놀라움을 드러냈다. “저 천재 스트라이커가 월드컵에서도 놀라운 장면을 만들어내는구나!” “흐흐! 아르헨티나가 불쌍하군! 하필이면 분데스리가 최강의 스트라이커를 만났어!” “신재욱은 아르헨티나의 수비수들이 막을 수 없는 선수지. 챔피언스리그에서도 미쳐 날뛰던 녀석을 어떻게 막겠어?” “리오넬 메시의 굴욕이군. 축구의 신이라고 불리는 리오넬 메시는 지쳐서 뛰지도 못하고 있는데, 신재욱은 멀쩡하게 뛰어다니고 골까지 넣었잖아?” “벌써 몇 골째야? 3골인가? 아니지! 방금 넣은 골까지 합치면 4골을 넣었네? 신재욱 이 녀석, 진짜 괴물이군!” 그만큼 중요한 타이밍에 나온 골이었다. 더군다나 한국이라는 약팀 소속으로 해낸 일이라는 게 전 세계축구팬들을 더욱 놀라게 했다. └ 이걸로 충분히 증명된 것 같네. 신재욱은 바이에른 뮌헨 소속이 아니어도 잘할 거야. └ 오늘 경기를 보니까 알겠어. 신재욱은 어떤 팀을 가도 득점왕이 될걸? └ 이렇게 대단한 녀석이 18살이라고? 차원이 다른 재능을 지닌 선수군. 오늘 보여준 신재욱의 플레이는 월드클래스 그 이상이야. 오늘 경기만 보면 리오넬 메시보다 훨씬 더 위협적으로 보여. └ 일단 골 기회를 안 놓치니까. 오프더볼 움직임도 좋고, 수비가담도 잘해주는 스트라이커인데 골 결정력이 엄청나. 이 정도 능력이면 세계 최고의 스트라이커라고 말해도 되는 거 아니야? └ 내 생각엔 신재욱이 다음 시즌에도 잘해주면 이견 없이 세계 최고의 스트라이커라고 인정받을 것 같아. └ 다음 시즌까지 갈 것도 없어. 월드컵 우승하면 그냥 신재욱이 세계 최고의 스트라이커야. └ 우승은 무리지. 한국대표팀 소속으로 어떻게 우승을 해? └ 혹시 모르지! 우승 후보인 아르헨티나를 상대로도 잘 싸우고 있잖아? └ 너무 잘한다! 난 이번 월드컵을 보면서 신재욱의 팬이 됐어! 이 미친 천재 때문에 다른 경기는 놓치더라도, 한국의 경기는 절대 안 놓치고 보는 중이야! 모두가 흥분하고 있을 때. 신재욱은 차분했다. 주변에 모인 동료들 역시 흥분하지 않고 신재욱을 바라보고 있었다. “다들 너무 잘해주고 있어요. 고마워요. 이제 거의 다 왔어요. 연장 후반전까지 20분 정도 남았는데, 한번 불태워봅시다.” 마지막까지 최선을 다하자는 신재욱의 말. 그 말을 들은 한국대표팀 선수들은 조용히 고개를 끄덕였다. 귀중한 골을 넣으며 5 대 4로 앞서가게 되었지만, 그 누구도 좋아하지 못하고 있었다. 이들의 눈엔 신재욱이 당장 쓰러져도 이상하지 않을 정도로 위태로워 보였으니까. ‘상태가 많이 안 좋아 보이는데……? 방금도 말하다가 휘청거렸던 것 같은데…….’ ‘대단한 정신력이야……다리가 다 풀린 상태로도 끝까지 달려가서 골을 넣었어. 이젠 재욱이한테 미안할 정도야……휴……나도 힘들지만, 그래도 재욱이를 위해서라도 더 뛰어봐야겠어.’ ‘많이 힘들어 보여. 제대로 서 있지도 못하고 있잖아?’ ‘재욱아……괜찮은 거냐……?’ 세레머니는 없었다. 그 누구도 세레머니를 하자는 말을 내뱉지 못했다. 한국대표팀 선수들은 그저 걱정스러운 눈빛으로 신재욱을 바라볼 뿐이었다. 그리고 신재욱은 자신의 자리를 향해 걷기 시작했다. 걸음은 매우 느렸고, 중간에 비틀대기도 했지만 쉬지 않고 움직였다. 계속 뛸 수 있다는 의지를 드러냈다. 이런 신재욱의 행동은 한국대표팀들의 마음에 또다시 불을 지폈다. 귀중한 골을 넣으며 풀어지려던 마음을 다시 한번 다잡게 됐다. ‘풀어지지 말고 끝까지 최선을 다하자.’ ‘재욱이가 저렇게까지 해주는데, 내가 안 뛸 수는 없지. 어떻게든 뛰어서 동점 골 절대 안 먹히게 할 거야.’ ‘해보자! 신재욱은 저런 상태로도 뛰는데, 나라고 못 할 게 뭐야? 나이 더 먹은 형답게 책임감 있는 모습 보여주마!’ ‘방심하지 말자! 집중하자!’ 그런데 이때. 자리로 돌아가던 신재욱이 걸음을 멈췄다. 경기장 위에 우뚝 선 그는 고개를 푹 숙였다. 갑작스러운 신재욱의 행동. 그 행동을 본 한국대표팀 선수들의 눈이 커졌다. “엇…?” “왜 저러지?!” “뭐야…?!” 신재욱이 혹시나 과로로 쓰러지는 게 아닐까? 라는 불안한 생각이 이들의 머릿속에 파고들었다. 당연하게도 한국대표팀 선수들은 알지 못했다. 고개를 숙인 신재욱이 웃고 있다는 것을.","output":"209 * * * Not long after the start of extra time. The Korean national team's morale, motivated by Shin Jaewook, had become even stronger. Their momentum had also increased. ― It seems like our players' movements have improved, right? This is an incredible display of mental strength! ― How can they keep running like this? They must be exhausted from playing all the way to extra time! ― It seems like they really want to win this game! Our players are aiming for the semifinals! It was all thanks to Shin Jaewook again. The youngest member of the team and the ace, who had been so exhausted that he could barely walk properly, was now biting down and running around more actively than anyone as soon as extra time started. ― All of our players are running impressively, but especially Shin Jaewook... he's running around incredibly! ― Now I'm getting worried. Shin Jaewook has run the most out of all the players on the field today, right? And he's still running in extra time without showing signs of fatigue! Is it possible that Shin Jaewook doesn't feel tired? ― He must be tired. There's a saying among active players: if you play the full 90 minutes, you feel like you're going to die, and if you play in extra time, you're running as if you're already dead. That's how tough it is. Shin Jaewook seems to be running on his exceptional mental strength. Commentators, players on the field, and fans watching the game were all worried about Shin Jaewook running too much. └ Is Shin Jaewook okay...? He seems to be running too much, doesn't he? └ He's been running almost non-stop. He's been doing the work of more than two people throughout the game today, hasn't he? So that's possible...? └ More than two people? Are you kidding me? He's fighting for the ball upfront, protecting it, coming back to link up, joining the defense, and when he gets the ball, 2-3 opponents stick to him. He's doing the work of at least three people. └ The comment above is right. Shin Jaewook is doing the work of about three people. That's why we've made it to extra time. But that aside, why does Shin Jaewook have so much stamina?;;;; I don't think he used to be like this? └ He's a hardworking genius. He still trains the hardest on the team. Both at Bayern Munich and now with the national team, it's the same. Didn't you see Ki Seok-yong's interview? Ki Seok-yong was shocked when he first saw Shin Jaewook on the national team. He said Jaewook trains too hard. He spends a long time training, and he's desperate the whole time. └ ㄷㄷㄷ That's crazy... But I'm worried about today. Isn't he overdoing it? └ That's what I'm saying. He seems to be running too much today... While everyone was worried like this, Korea's performance on the field kept improving. And when it was 3 minutes and 40 seconds into the first half of extra time. ― Good! Ki Seok-yong has intercepted an Argentine pass! It was a great cutting by Ki Seok-yong. After intercepting the ball, he immediately sent a low and fast pass forward. Although he was tired, he was in a state of strong mental strength and did not lose his concentration. Thump! The ball connected. To Shin Jaewook. ― Shin Jaewook receives the ball! The pass looked a bit strong, but he controlled it beautifully with his trapping skills! ― Shin Jaewook's silky touch is already famous! He can securely receive almost any pass! In a situation where he had come down a bit to receive the ball, Shin Jaewook turned and passed it at the same time. Another player might have checked their surroundings before attempting a pass, but Shin Jaewook didn't need to. He had already checked his surroundings before receiving the ball. Bang! The pass was sent out unexpectedly. Argentina's reaction was slow. They were tired. On the other hand, Lee Taekhyun, who was going to receive the ball, reacted quickly. Having gone through intense training with Shin Jaewook, he did not stop moving even while gasping for breath. He infiltrated the opponent's space and softly cushioned the incoming ball with his instep. His running speed hardly decreased. Thump! It was a good first touch. He had infiltrated the opponent's space and received the ball well. Under normal circumstances, Lee Taekhyun would have run up to the goal area and created a scoring opportunity himself. But now it was extra time. Just sprinting at full speed and receiving the ball was enough to make Lee Taekhyun struggle. 'I feel like I'm going to die.' Lee Taekhyun gasped for breath and looked around. An opposing player had already chased close to him. It was a player who had been substituted in and still had plenty of stamina. Normally, Lee Taekhyun was one of the fastest in Europe, but now he couldn't reach that speed. It seemed like he would be caught if things continued like this. Naturally, he looked for a teammate. 'Someone help me!' He wanted to shout for help, but he couldn't. If he opened his mouth, it felt like his heart would jump out instead of words. He was at his limit in every way. That's when it happened. Lee Taekhyun saw it. A player who was overtaking him. \\"......?\\" He was so surprised that he didn't even check the player's face, but Lee Taekhyun instinctively nudged the ball forward. Because he expected a certain player to be there. \\"...Shin Jaewook?\\" His expectation was not wrong. He could tell just from the back. That it was Shin Jaewook. He advanced with the ball as if he had just entered the game, completely unfazed, and after bypassing the charging goalkeeper, he lightly pushed the ball into the goal. There was no sign of tension. Even after scoring a goal in extra time, he was not excited at all and naturally raised four fingers. Looking at him, Lee Taekhyun muttered softly. \\"...I have a long way to go to catch up.\\" * * * Wow! Cheers poured out. The Korean fans in the stands shouted \\"Republic of Korea\\" and were ecstatic. ― Goal! It's a goal! Shin Jaewook has done it! Korea's genius has scored 4 goals against Argentina! ― It's the Bayern Munich duo again! These two players have gifted us another precious goal! ― It's marvelous! Shin Jaewook has shown a truly marvelous play! After passing to Lee Taekhyun, he ran desperately and eventually scored a goal! In the end, he calmly bypassed the goalkeeper too! ― The score is now 5 to 4! If we can hold on without conceding any more goals, we can advance to the semifinals! Shin Jaewook's goal in extra time excited everyone except Argentina. Korean fans, German fans, and even soccer fans around the world were ecstatic. Fans who knew Shin Jaewook all stood up and expressed their amazement. \\"That genius striker is creating amazing moments even in the World Cup!\\" \\"Haha! Argentina is pitiful! They just happened to meet the strongest striker in the Bundesliga!\\" \\"Shin Jaewook is a player that Argentina's defenders can't stop. How could they stop someone who was rampaging in the Champions League?\\" \\"It's Lionel Messi's humiliation. The so-called god of football, Lionel Messi, is too tired to run, while Shin Jaewook is running around and scoring goals?\\" \\"How many goals is that now? Three? No, with the goal he just scored, that's four goals, right? Shin Jaewook, this guy is really a monster!\\" It was a goal that came at such an important time. Moreover, the fact that he did it while playing for a weak team like Korea surprised soccer fans all over the world even more. └ I think it's been proven enough. Shin Jaewook would do well even if he wasn't with Bayern Munich. └ After watching today's game, I can tell. Shin Jaewook would become the top scorer no matter which team he goes to, right? └ How can such an amazing guy be only 18 years old? A player with a different dimension of talent. The play Shin Jaewook showed today is beyond world-class. Based on today's game, he looks much more threatening than Lionel Messi. └ First of all, he doesn't miss goal opportunities. He has good off-the-ball movement, contributes well to defense, and has incredible goal-scoring ability. With this level of skill, can't we say he's one of the world's best strikers? └ I think if Shin Jaewook continues to perform well next season, there will be no disagreement that he's the world's best striker. └ There's no need to wait until next season. If he wins the World Cup, Shin Jaewook is just the world's best striker. └ Winning is too much. How could he win with the Korean national team? └ You never know! He's fighting well against Argentina, a favorite to win, right? └ He's doing so well! I became a fan of Shin Jaewook during this World Cup! Because of this crazy genius, I make sure not to miss any of Korea's games even if I miss others! While everyone was excited, Shin Jaewook was calm. His teammates gathered around him were also not excited but just looking at Shin Jaewook. \\"Everyone is doing really well. Thank you. We're almost there. There's about 20 minutes left in the second half of extra time, let's go all out.\\" Shin Jaewook's words, urging them to do their best until the end. The Korean national team players quietly nodded in response. Having scored a valuable goal to lead 5 to 4, no one could be happy. In their eyes, Shin Jaewook looked so precarious that it wouldn't be surprising if he collapsed right then and there. 'It looks like he's in really bad shape...? He even seemed to stagger while talking just now...' 'He has incredible mental strength... He ran to the end with his legs giving out and scored a goal. I feel sorry for Jaewook now... Phew... I'm tired too, but I have to run more for Jaewook.' 'He looks very tired. He can't even stand properly, can he?' 'Jaewook... are you okay...?' There was no celebration. No one could utter a word about celebrating. The Korean national team players just looked at Shin Jaewook with worried eyes. And Shin Jaewook started walking towards his position. His steps were very slow, and he staggered in the middle, but he kept moving without resting. He showed his will to keep running. Shin Jaewook's actions once again ignited a fire in the hearts of the Korean national team. They refocused their minds, which had started to relax after scoring the precious goal. 'Don't let up, let's do our best until the end.' 'Jaewook is doing so much, I can't not run. I'll run somehow to make sure we don't concede an equalizing goal.' 'Let's do this! If Shin Jaewook can run in that condition, why can't I? I'll show a responsible attitude befitting an older brother!' 'Don't get complacent! Stay focused!' But at that moment. Shin Jaewook, who was returning to his position, stopped walking. Standing tall on the field, he bowed his head deeply. Shin Jaewook's sudden action. The Korean national team players' eyes widened at the sight. \\"Eh...?\\" \\"Why is he doing that?!\\" \\"What's going on...?!\\" Was Shin Jaewook about to collapse from overexertion? That anxious thought crept into their minds. Naturally, the Korean national team players didn't know. That Shin Jaewook, with his head bowed, was smiling."},{"instruction":"211 * * * 연장전 전반 13분. 전방으로 달리던 신재욱의 시야엔 보였다. 하비에르 마스체라노의 슬라이딩 태클을 피해내고, 파블로 사발레타마저도 뚫어낸 이택현의 모습이. ‘대단한데?’ 신재욱의 입이 살짝 벌어졌다. 놀라운 장면이었다. 이택현의 실력은 원래 잘 알고 있었다. 세계적인 선수들을 상대로 돌파할 수 있는 선수다. 그러나 지금은 정규시간이 아니라 연장전이지 않은가. 체력이 바닥난 상태에서 저렇게 용기 있는 돌파 시도를 하는 건 매우 어렵다. ‘더 성장했구나.’ 신재욱은 속도를 높였다. 왠지 패스가 올 것 같은 느낌이 왔다. 근거 없는 예상은 아니었다. 이미 여러 번 경험했었던 상황이었다. 이런 상황에서 이택현은 5번 중 2번은 패스를 준다. 나머지 3번은 직접 슈팅을 시도하고. ‘어떻게 할 거냐.’ 신재욱은 모든 준비를 마쳤다. 이제 이택현이 어떤 플레이를 선택하든 맞춰줄 수 있다. 그때였다. 이택현은 패스를 선택했다. 그는 신재욱에게 공을 넘겨준 뒤 전방으로 뛰어나갔다. 그 순간 아르헨티나의 중앙수비수 한 명도 이택현의 뒤를 쫓았다. 자연스레 신재욱의 앞엔 한 명의 수비수밖에 없었다. 꽤 많은 공간도 보였다. ‘이 정도면 원하는 거 다 할 수 있겠네.’ 신재욱은 빠르게 판단을 내렸다. 지금과 같은 상황에서 가장 쉽게 골을 넣을 수 있는 방법을 선택했다. ‘이건 때려야지.’ 신재욱은 슈팅을 결심했다. 좋은 선택이었다. 현재 그의 슈팅 능력치는 93이었으니까. 또한, 슈팅 훈련에 꾸준히 많은 시간을 투자하며 더 높아진 정확도를 보유하고 있었으니까. 휘이익! 다리를 휘둘렀고 발의 안쪽으로 공을 강하게 감아 찼다. 발등으로 때릴 때보다 슈팅의 파워는 약하지만, 정확도가 높아서 원하는 곳으로 때리기엔 더 좋은 방법이었다. ‘구석으로.’ 다행히 슈팅할 때의 느낌은 좋았다. 날아가는 공의 궤적도 마음에 들었다. 그러나 신재욱은 끝까지 집중력을 유지했다. 혹시 모를 상황에 대비하기 위해 앞으로 뛰어나갔다. ‘어차피 골키퍼가 공을 잡진 못할 거야. 잘 막으면 튕겨내는 거겠지.’ 슈팅의 궤적은 완벽했다. 오른쪽 구석으로 날카롭게 휘어져 들어갔다. 골키퍼가 막는 게 거의 불가능한 슈팅이었다. 그러나 신재욱은 방심하지 않았다. 머릿속으로 골키퍼의 슈퍼세이브 상황을 그려내며 세컨볼을 기다렸다. 그때였다. 철렁! 날아간 공이 아르헨티나의 골망을 흔들었다. 세르히오 로메로 골키퍼는 공을 건드리지도 못했다. ― 우와아아아! 고오오오오올! 신재욱 선수가 멋진 중거리 슈팅으로 또다시 골을 기록했습니다! 놀라운 경기력입니다! 지금이 연장전이 맞는 걸까요? ― 방금은 아르헨티나의 수비 집중력이 많이 떨어졌죠! 이택현 선수와 신재욱 선수를 이렇게 놓치면 골을 허용할 수밖에 없습니다! 대한민국은 이제 아르헨티나를 상대로 6 대 4로 앞서갑니다! 이러면 4강이 매우 유력해졌죠? ― 놀라운 경기력입니다! 신재욱 선수와 이택현 선수는 연장전에도 이렇게나 좋은 호흡을 보여주네요! 정말……놀랍다는 말밖에는 할 말이 없네요! 골을 기록한 직후. 신재욱은 새어 나오려는 웃음을 참아냈다. ‘아직은 아니야.’ 감정을 드러낼 때가 아니었다. 동료들이 더 집중하게 도와줘야 했다. “아직 연장전 전반입니다! 지금처럼 계속 집중해주세요!” 한국 대표팀 선수들은 신재욱의 말을 들었지만, 터져 나오는 웃음을 참아내지는 못했다. 6 대 4라는 스코어. 4강이 매우 가까워졌다는 사실에 한국 대표팀 선수들은 기뻐할 수밖에 없었다. “으흐흐! 다들 재욱이 말 들었지? 계속 집중하자!” “그래, 아직 연장 후반 남았잖아. 쏟아붓자!” “으어어어! 다 왔다! 아르헨티나 잡는다!” “다들 힘내! 4강이 눈앞까지 왔다!” 다만 기뻐할 시간은 길지 않았다. 경기가 빠르게 재개됐기 때문이었다. 한국은 경기 재개와 동시에 라인을 깊숙하게 내렸다. 완전히 수비에 집중하기 시작한 것이다. ― 한국이 전술을 바꿨네요! 이제는 지키는 운영을 해서 실점을 최소화하겠다는 거겠죠? ― 그렇습니다. 영리한 선택입니다. 체력이 떨어진 상태이고 스코어에서도 2점이나 앞서고 있으니까 차라리 지금처럼 수비에만 집중하는 게 더 좋을 수 있습니다. 아르헨티나의 움직임은 굉장히 급해졌다. 체력이 떨어졌음에도 필사적으로 공격을 시도하려고 했다. 그러나 연장전 전반전이 끝날 때까지의 시간은 매우 짧았다. ― 연장전 전반이 끝났습니다! 선수들은 짧은 휴식 시간 동안 최대한 쉬어주며 회복을 해줘야 할 것 같습니다! ― 사실상 회복하는 게 쉽지 않을 겁니다. 굉장히 힘들 텐데 부디 힘을 내서 연장전 후반에도 좋은 경기력을 보여주길 바랍니다! 해설들의 말처럼 쉬는 시간은 짧았다. 양 팀 선수들은 무거운 몸을 이끌고 다시 각자의 자리로 돌아갔다. “화이팅! 가보자!” “으어어어엇! 다 쏟아내서 이겨버리자! 4강까지 이제 다 왔어!” “다들 괜찮지? 그냥 오늘 여기서 죽는다는 마인드로 뛰어보자!” “재욱이 뛰는 거 봤지? 연장 후반에서는 최소한 쟤보단 많이 뛰자.” 한국 대표팀 선수들은 소리를 지르며 힘을 냈다. 이들은 믿고 있었다. 동료들을 위해서 조금씩 더 뛰다 보면 4강행이 현실이 될 거라고. 반면 아르헨티나 선수들은 바쁘게 의사소통을 하고 있었다. “이길 수 있어! 쟤들이 연장전 전반에 2골 넣었으니, 우리도 연장 후반전에 똑같이 해주면 돼!” “가자! 아르헨티나는 강하다!” “패스 실수는 최대한 줄이고, 너무 끝까지 만들려고 하지 마! 기회가 왔다 싶으면 망설이지 말고 슈팅해!” “다들 지친 건 알지만, 그래도 끝까지 뛰어줘야 이길 수 있다는 거 알지? 일단 1점부터 따라가 보자!” 이처럼 아르헨티나 선수들은 포기하지 않고 있었다. 연장전에 2점 차로 밀리고 있었음에도 이길 방법만을 생각했다. 이들의 의지는 대단했다. 언제 지쳐있었냐는 듯, 연장전 후반전이 시작되자마자 날카로운 공격으로 한국을 몰아쳤다. ― 위험합니다! 우리 선수들! 흔들려선 안 됩니다! 아! 좋지 않습니다! 지금 같은 상황에선 절대 마크를 놓치면 안 되죠! ― 아르헨티나의 움직임이 달라졌습니다! 뒤가 없이 공격에만 집중하는 모습이네요! 라인도 높게 올린 채로 완전히 골만을 생각하고 있습니다! ― 아르헨티나는 뒤가 없죠. 오로지 골을 생각할 때가 맞습니다. 반대로 우리 선수들은 잘 막아줘야 하고요! 절대 실점해선 안 됩니다! 만약 여기서 골을 허용하면 분위기가 이상해질 수 있거든요? 지쳐버린 한국의 수비수들은 크게 흔들렸다. 미드필더들도 마찬가지였다. 숨을 헐떡이며 아르헨티나 선수들의 움직임을 따라가는 것만으로도 힘들어했다. 신재욱이 많이 뛰며 적극적으로 수비 가담을 하고 있었지만, 빠르게 패스를 주고받는 아르헨티나 선수들의 공을 뺏어내는 건 쉬운 일이 아니었다. 더구나 아르헨티나는 지금 무서울 정도로 집중하고 있었다. 빈틈을 발견하면 과감하게 태클을 시도하겠지만, 빈틈이 없었다. ‘장난 아닌데?’ 신재욱의 얼굴이 굳었다. 이런 분위기는 위험했다. 보통 실점은 이런 상황에서 많이 나오곤 하니까. ‘끊어야 하는데.’ 그때였다. 반대편 측면에서 크로스가 올라왔다. 한국의 풀백이 뚫려버린 것이다. ‘막아야 해!’ 신재욱이 움직였다. 공의 궤적과 도착 위치를 빠르게 예측하며 달렸다. 그러나 현재 있던 위치와 너무 멀었다. ‘내가 도착하는 것보다 상대가 헤딩하는 게 더 빨라.’ 게다가 공이 떨어지는 곳에서 몸을 띄운 선수는 곤살로 이과인이었다. 월드클래스 스트라이커인 그는 여러모로 뛰어난 능력을 지녔다. 당연하게도 헤더 능력도 대단한 선수였다. 지금도 그랬다. 곤살로 이과인은 한국의 중앙수비수 홍정오와의 공중볼 경합에서 이겨냈다. 높게 점프한 그는 머리로 공의 방향을 바꿨다. 터엉! 공이 머리에 제대로 맞았을 때의 타격음이 들렸다. 그와 동시에 곤살로 이과인은 골을 확신하며 골대 안으로 달려갔다. ― 아…… 곤살로 이과인의 골입니다……! 홍정오 선수가 곤살로 이과인 선수를 막아줬어야 했는데요……! ― 막기 어려운 선수죠. 유럽의 수비수들도 제대로 막아내지 못하는 선수가 곤살로 이과인이니까요. 더군다나 지금처럼 체력이 떨어진 상태에선 더 힘들 수밖에 없고요. ― 아쉽습니다. 이러면 아르헨티나의 기세가 살아날 수 있습니다……! 스코어는 6 대 5가 됐다. 실점한 이후로도 한국은 위태로운 모습을 드러냈다. 아르헨티나의 공격에 제대로 대응하지 못했다. 더군다나 아르헨티나 선수들은 신재욱의 태클을 철저히 경계하며 패스를 주고받았다. 이제는 반코트 게임이 펼쳐지고 있었다. 아르헨티나 선수들은 과감하게 슈팅을 때리고 크로스를 뻥뻥 올려댔다. 때문에, 한국의 팬들은 연장전 후반전이 진행되는 내내 가슴을 졸여야 했다. └ 아오;;;;; ㅅㅂ 떨려서 못 보겠네! 이거 동점 돼서 승부차기 가면 100% 질 것 같은데?;;;;; 한국 애들 좀 봐봐. 뛰지도 못하고 다 지쳐서 공도 제대로 못 걷어내잖아. └ 하……ㅜㅠㅠ 경기 너무 불안하다. 이제 5분 정도 남았는데 버틸 수 있을까……? └ 나만 곧 동점 골 먹힐 것 같냐?ㅋ 아니지? 다들 그렇게 생각하고 있지? └ 아오!!!! 수비수들 뭐하냐 진짜!!! 먹은 치킨 체할 것 같다고!!!!! └ 쟤네 ㅈㄴ 영리하네ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 신재욱이 태클 잘하니까 없는 곳으로만 공격하잖아. 이건 신재욱이 홍길동이 되지 않는 이상 어떻게 해줄 수가 없어ㅠㅠㅠㅠ └ 쫌만 더 버티면 되는데 진짜…… 후……. 아르헨티나의 슈팅 폭격이 이어졌다. 또한, 아르헨티나의 선수들은 계속해서 한국의 페널티박스 안에 자리 잡고 세컨볼을 노렸다. 그때였다. 신재욱이 움직였다. 그는 이제 아예 페널티박스 안으로 들어와서 수비하기 시작했다. 지금만큼은 수비 가담이 아니라, 그냥 수비수가 될 생각이었다. ‘내가 막는다.’ 신재욱은 거친 숨을 몰아쉬면서 상대 선수들의 움직임을 주시했다. 특성의 효과는 이미 끝난 상태였다. 당장이라도 쓰러지고 싶을 정도로 엄청난 피로감이 몰려왔다. 그러나 계속 움직였다. 어떻게든 추가 실점 없이 버텨야 했다. ‘조금만 더 버티면 돼! 승부차기는 절대 안 돼!’ 동료들의 상태는 더 심각했다. 다들 제대로 걷지도 못할 정도로 지쳐있었다. 슈팅은커녕 움직일 힘조차도 없는 상태. 당연하게도 승부차기에 가면 패배할 확률이 매우 높았다. 그래서 신재욱은 이를 악물었다. 몸에 힘은 전부 빠져있었지만, 그래도 몸을 던져가며 상대의 슈팅을 막아냈다. ― 신재욱 선수가 몸으로 슈팅을 막아냈습니다! 처절한 수비입니다! 신재욱 선수는 다리가 전부 풀려버렸는데도 팀을 위해서 몸을 던지고 있습니다! ― 정말…… 대단한 선수입니다! 나이는 어리지만, 앞으로 대표팀을 이끌어갈 선수입니다! 효과는 있었다. 신재욱은 슈팅의 달인이라고 해도 될 정도로 슈팅엔 도가 텄고, 뛰어난 위치선정을 지닌 선수. 상대의 슈팅 궤적을 무서울 정도로 정확히 예측하며 몸으로 막아내고 있었다. 시간은 계속 흘렀다. 양 팀 선수들 모두 무아지경이었다. 한쪽은 수비에만, 한쪽은 공격에만 치중했다. 그때였다. 아르헨티나의 리오넬 메시가 공을 잡았다. 그 순간 신재욱은 시선을 살짝 움직여 남은 시간을 확인했다. 동시에 알 수 있었다. ‘이번만 막아내면 돼.’ 지금의 공격만 막아낸다면 4강으로 향하게 될 것이라는 걸.","output":"211 * * * 13 minutes into the first half of extra time. Shin Jaewook saw it as he ran forward. The sight of Lee Taekhyun evading Javier Mascherano's sliding tackle and even breaking through Pablo Zabaleta. 'Impressive?' Shin Jaewook's mouth slightly opened. It was an astonishing scene. He knew well of Lee Taekhyun's abilities. A player capable of breaking through world-class players. But this wasn't regular time; it was extra time. Making such a courageous breakthrough when stamina was depleted was extremely difficult. 'He's grown even more.' Shin Jaewook sped up. He had a feeling a pass was coming. It wasn't an unfounded prediction. He had experienced this situation several times before. In such situations, Lee Taekhyun would pass the ball 2 out of 5 times. The other 3 times, he would attempt a shot himself. 'What's he going to do?' Shin Jaewook was ready for anything. Now it was up to Lee Taekhyun to choose his play. Then, Lee Taekhyun chose to pass. He passed the ball to Shin Jaewook and then sprinted forward. At that moment, one of Argentina's center-backs also chased after Lee Taekhyun. Naturally, there was only one defender left in front of Shin Jaewook. There was also quite a lot of space. 'I can do whatever I want with this much space.' Shin Jaewook made a quick decision. He chose the easiest way to score a goal in the current situation. 'I have to shoot this.' Shin Jaewook decided to shoot. It was a good choice. His shooting ability was at 93. Moreover, he had increased accuracy from consistently investing a lot of time in shooting training. Swoosh! He swung his leg and wrapped his foot around the ball. Although shooting with the inside of the foot was less powerful than with the laces, it was more accurate and better for aiming at the desired spot. 'For the corner.' Fortunately, the feeling when shooting was good. He liked the trajectory of the flying ball. But Shin Jaewook maintained his focus until the end. He ran forward in case of any unexpected situations. 'The goalkeeper won't be able to catch it anyway. At best, he'll deflect it.' The trajectory of the shot was perfect. It curved sharply into the right corner. It was a shot that was almost impossible for the goalkeeper to block. But Shin Jaewook didn't let his guard down. He prepared for a possible super save from the goalkeeper and waited for the second ball. Then it happened. Clang! The ball shook the net of Argentina. Goalkeeper Sergio Romero didn't even touch it. ― Wow! Goal! Shin Jaewook scores again with a fantastic mid-range shot! What an amazing performance! Is this really extra time? ― Argentina's defensive concentration has dropped significantly just now! If they lose track of Lee Taekhyun and Shin Jaewook like this, they're bound to concede a goal! South Korea is now leading Argentina 6 to 4! This makes the semifinals very likely, doesn't it? ― It's an amazing performance! Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun are showing such great coordination even in extra time! Really... there's nothing else to say but amazing! After scoring the goal. Shin Jaewook suppressed the laughter that was about to escape. 'Not yet.' It wasn't the time to show emotions. He needed to help his teammates stay focused. \\"Remember, it's still the first half of extra time! Keep concentrating like this!\\" The Korean national team players heard Shin Jaewook's words, but they couldn't hold back their laughter. With a score of 6 to 4. The fact that the semifinals were now very close made the Korean national team players inevitably happy. \\"Hehe! Everyone heard Jaewook, right? Let's keep focusing!\\" \\"Yeah, we still have the second half of extra time left. Let's give it our all!\\" \\"Ugh! We're almost there! We're going to beat Argentina!\\" \\"Everyone, hang in there! The semifinals are right in front of us!\\" However, the time to be happy was short. The game quickly resumed. Korea deeply retreated their line as soon as the game restarted. They started to focus entirely on defense. ― Korea has changed their tactics! They're now trying to minimize conceding by focusing on defense, right? ― That's right. It's a smart choice. They're tired and leading by two goals, so it's better to focus on defense like this. Argentina's movements became very urgent. Despite their fatigue, they desperately tried to attack. However, the time until the end of the first half of extra time was very short. ― The first half of extra time is over! The players should rest as much as possible during the short break and try to recover! ― Realistically, it won't be easy to recover. They're very tired, but we hope they can show good performance in the second half of extra time too! As the commentators said, the rest time was short. Players from both teams dragged their heavy bodies back to their positions. \\"Fight! Let's go!\\" \\"Ugh! Let's pour everything out and win! We're almost at the semifinals!\\" \\"Is everyone okay? Let's just run with the mindset that we're going to die here today!\\" \\"Did you see Jaewook running? Let's run more than him in the second half of extra time.\\" The Korean national team players shouted and cheered each other on. They believed. If they ran a little more for their teammates, the semifinals would become a reality. On the other hand, the Argentine players were busy communicating. \\"We can win! They scored 2 goals in the first half of extra time, so we just need to do the same in the second half!\\" \\"Let's go! Argentina is strong!\\" \\"Minimize pass mistakes, and don't try to play until the very end! If you see an opportunity, don't hesitate and shoot!\\" \\"We all know we're tired, but we can only win if we keep running until the end, right? Let's start by catching up one goal!\\" Thus, the Argentine players did not give up. Despite being two goals down in extra time, they only thought about ways to win. Their will was tremendous. As if they had never been tired, they launched sharp attacks against Korea as soon as the second half of extra time started. ― It's dangerous! Our players! You can't be shaken! Ah! This is not good! In a situation like this, you absolutely can't lose your mark! ― Argentina's movement has changed! They're focusing only on attacking without any regard for defense! They're thinking only of goals with their line pushed high! ― Argentina has nothing to lose. It's the right time to think only of goals. Conversely, our players need to block well! We absolutely can't concede! If we do, the atmosphere could turn sour, you know? Korea's exhausted defenders were greatly shaken. The midfielders were the same. They struggled just to follow the movements of the Argentine players, gasping for breath. Shin Jaewook was running a lot and actively joining the defense, but it wasn't easy to steal the ball from the Argentine players who were passing quickly. Moreover, Argentina was now concentrating frighteningly. They would boldly attempt tackles if they found a gap, but there were none. 'This is no joke.' Shin Jaewook's face hardened. The atmosphere was dangerous. Usually, goals are often scored in such situations. 'I have to cut it off.' Then, a cross came from the opposite flank. Korea's fullback had been breached. 'I have to block it!' Shin Jaewook moved. He quickly predicted the trajectory and landing spot of the ball and ran. But he was too far from his current position. 'The opponent will head the ball before I arrive.' Moreover, the player who jumped up at the spot where the ball was falling was Gonzalo Higuain. The world-class striker had many outstanding abilities. Naturally, his heading ability was also great. It was the same now. Gonzalo Higuain won the aerial duel against Korea's center-back Hong Jeong-oh. He jumped high and changed the direction of the ball with his head. Thump! The sound of the ball hitting the head properly was heard. At the same time, Gonzalo Higuain, confident of the goal, ran into the goal. ― Ah... It's a goal by Gonzalo Higuain... Hong Jeong-oh should have stopped him... ― It's hard to stop such a player. Even European defenders can't properly stop Gonzalo Higuain. Especially in a state of fatigue like now, it's even harder. ― It's a pity. This could revive Argentina's momentum... The score became 6 to 5. Even after conceding, Korea showed a precarious state. They couldn't properly respond to Argentina's attacks. Moreover, the Argentine players were wary of Shin Jaewook's tackles and passed the ball around him. A half-court game was now unfolding. The Argentine players boldly took shots and sent crosses flying. As a result, Korean fans had to hold their breath throughout the second half of extra time. └ Ah... damn it; I can't watch because I'm so nervous! If it goes to penalties, we'll definitely lose, right?;;;;; Look at the Korean players. They can't even run and can't properly clear the ball. └ Ah... I'm so anxious about the game. There's about 5 minutes left, can we hold on...? └ Is it just me, or does it feel like we're going to concede an equalizer soon?ㅋ Or is everyone thinking that? └ Ah!!!! What are the defenders doing for real!!! I feel like I'm going to throw up the chicken I ate!!!!! └ They're so cleverㅠㅠㅠㅠ Since Shin Jaewook tackles well, they're attacking where he isn't. Unless Shin Jaewook becomes Hong Gil-dong, there's nothing we can doㅠㅠㅠㅠ └ Just hold on a little longer... sigh... Argentina's shooting barrage continued. Additionally, Argentine players kept positioning themselves in Korea's penalty box, waiting for the second ball. Then, Shin Jaewook moved. He now entered the penalty box to defend. At this moment, he was thinking of becoming a defender, not just joining the defense. 'I'll block it.' Shin Jaewook gasped for breath as he watched the movements of the opposing players. The effects of his traits had already ended. He was overwhelmed with fatigue, feeling like he could collapse at any moment. But he kept moving. He had to hold on without conceding any more goals. 'Just hold on a little longer! We absolutely can't go to penalties!' His teammates were in a more serious condition. They were all so exhausted they could barely walk. They didn't even have the strength to move, let alone shoot. Naturally, the probability of losing in penalties was very high. So Shin Jaewook gritted his teeth. Although all strength had left his body, he still threw himself to block the opponent's shots. ― Shin Jaewook blocks the shot with his body! It's a desperate defense! Shin Jaewook's legs have given out, but he's still throwing himself for the team! ― Really... what an amazing player! He's young, but he's a player who will lead the national team in the future! The effect was there. Shin Jaewook could be called a master of shooting, and he had excellent positioning. He was accurately predicting the trajectory of the opponent's shots and blocking them with his body. Time kept passing. Both teams were in a trance. One side focused only on defense, the other only on attack. Then, Argentina's Lionel Messi got the ball. At that moment, Shin Jaewook glanced to check the remaining time. At the same time, he knew. 'I just need to block this one.' If he blocked this attack, they would head to the semifinals."},{"instruction":"does left footed players usually have better weak foot","output":"There is no definite correlation between being left-footed and having a better weak foot in soccer. While it is commonly believed that left-footed players may have a stronger weak foot, this can vary depending on individual skills and training. Some left-footed players do have a more developed weak foot due to the necessity of using it more frequently in gameplay. However, it ultimately comes down to individual practice and dedication in improving both feet for all players, regardless of their dominant foot."},{"instruction":"My mother is 55 years old. She feels pain and sometimes swelling in her hands specifically lateral thumb alongside her hand","output":"I'm sorry to hear that your mother is experiencing pain and swelling in her hands. These symptoms can have several causes and it's important to have her evaluated by a healthcare professional to obtain an accurate diagnosis. Here are some possible causes for the pain and swelling in the lateral aspect of the thumb and hand: 1. Osteoarthritis: This is a common form of arthritis that occurs with aging. It often affects the thumb base, particularly the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint, leading to pain, swelling, and decreased range of motion. 2. De Quervain's Tenosynovitis: This condition involves inflammation of the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. It can cause pain and swelling, and may be exacerbated by movements such as grasping or twisting the wrist. 3. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: Although carpal tunnel typically causes symptoms in the thumb, index, and middle fingers, it can sometimes cause swelling and discomfort in the hand. 4. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disease that can affect various joints, including those in the hands and fingers. It is characterized by pain, swelling, and stiffness. 5. Tendonitis: Inflammation of the tendons in the hands or fingers can result in pain and swelling. 6. Gout: Gout can cause sudden, intense pain and swelling in individual joints, including those in the hand. 7. Infections: An infection of the skin (cellulitis), joint (septic arthritis), or bone (osteomyelitis) could also cause localized pain and swelling. 8. Injury or trauma: Previous injuries to the hand or wrist, such as fractures or sprains, could lead to lasting discomfort and swelling. Please advise your mother to see a healthcare provider—preferably her primary care physician or a hand specialist who can perform a physical examination, and if necessary, order imaging studies (such as X-rays, ultrasound, or MRI), blood tests, or other diagnostic procedures to investigate the cause of her symptoms. They will then be able to provide a diagnosis and discuss appropriate treatment options, which may include medications for pain and swelling, physical therapy, or, in some cases, surgical intervention."},{"instruction":"De Quervain’s Tenosynovitis. Explain this more","output":"De Quervain's Tenosynovitis (also known as de Quervain's syndrome) is a painful condition affecting the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. It is named after Swiss surgeon Fritz de Quervain, who first identified it in 1895. The discomfort is due to inflammation of the sheath or tunnel that surrounds two tendons: - The abductor pollicis longus (APL): a tendon that helps to move the thumb away from the palm (abduction). - The extensor pollicis brevis (EPB): a tendon that assists in extending the thumb. These tendons run side by side from the forearm into the thumb. In the thumb's vicinity, they pass through a tunnel-like structure called the first dorsal compartment, which is lined with a slippery coating called synovium that allows the tendons to move easily. In De Quervain's Tenosynovitis, the synovium becomes inflamed, which can cause pain, swelling, and limited movement. This inflammation can occur due to repetitive use or overuse of the wrist and thumb, stress on the wrist or thumb, direct injury to the tendon area, inflammatory arthritis, or for no obvious reason at all. Symptoms of De Quervain's Tenosynovitis include: - Pain near the base of the thumb, which may extend up the forearm when moving the thumb or wrist or when grasping or pinching. - Swelling and tenderness along the side of the wrist. - A \\"sticking\\" or \\"stop-and-go\\" sensation in the thumb when trying to move it. - Difficulty moving the thumb and wrist during activities that require pinching or gripping. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, with the healthcare provider examining the wrist and performing specific tests, such as the Finkelstein test, where the patient bends their thumb across the palm of the hand and then bends the fingers over the thumb, forming a fist. The pain is elicited or aggravated by then ulnar deviating the wrist (tilting the wrist towards the little finger). Treatment options may include: - Resting the affected thumb and wrist. - Wearing a splint or brace to immobilize the thumb and wrist, allowing the tendons to rest and heal. - Anti-inflammatory medications, either oral or injectable, to reduce pain and swelling. - Corticosteroid injections into the tendon sheath to relieve inflammation. - Modification of activities to avoid repetitive thumb movements or positions that provoke pain. - Physical or occupational therapy involving exercises to strengthen the muscles around the wrist and reduce symptoms. - If conservative treatments are unsuccessful, surgery may be considered. The procedure typically involves a small incision near the base of the thumb to open the compartment and alleviate pressure on the tendons. People with De Quervain's Tenosynovitis commonly respond well to treatment, especially when it's started early. It's crucial for your mother to seek advice from a healthcare provider to establish the best course of action for her condition."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Revit is a BIM software widely used in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry which allows for 3D design and modeling of buildings and infrastructure. Here is a general guide on how to create an RL environment simulating Revit: 1. **Define the Goal and Rules of Your RL Environment**: - What is the specific task you want to accomplish in Revit? - What actions should the RL agent perform? (E.g., creating walls, doors, modifying parameters, etc.) - What are the constraints and feasibility rules (based on Revit capabilities)? - How will the agent be rewarded or penalized? 2. **Model the Revit Environment**: - Use a programming language like Python to create a simulation of the Revit environment. - Interfacing with Revit can be done through Revit API or Autodesk Forge API, so you might need to write a custom wrapper or use existing libraries like pyRevit or revitpythonwrapper. - The environment should be able to interpret the state of the simulated Revit model, the possible actions, and potentially visualize the changes as they would appear in Revit. 3. **Integrate an RL Library**: - Choose an RL framework or library like OpenAI Gym, Stable Baselines, RLlib, or Tensorforce. - You may have to create a custom environment class inheriting from OpenAI Gym's \`Env\` class if using Gym, where you will implement methods like \`step()\`, \`reset()\`, \`render()\`, and \`close()\`. 4. **Implement RL Tasks Specific to Revit**: - Customize observation space (state representation of the environment) and action space (set of actions the agent can take). - Actions could be Revit API calls to manipulate elements in the model. - Observations could be various properties of Revit elements or a representation of the entire Revit model. 5. **Develop Reward Function**: - The reward function must align with the objective, such as successful creation of a building element or the entire structure adhering to certain design criteria. - Rewards can be adjusted according to efficiency, compliance with building codes, aesthetic value, or any specific metric related to your task. 6. **Train Your RL Agent**: - Set up the training loop where the agent interacts with the environment. - Collect data from these interactions to train the agent using your chosen RL algorithm. - Make sure to provide enough variance in the training scenarios so the agent learns a robust policy. 7. **Evaluate and Test**: - Use a set of test scenarios to evaluate the agent's performance. - Debug and refine both the environment and the agent based on performance. 8. **Real-Time Interaction (optional)**: - Depending on your needs, the environment could be designed to interact with a live instance of Revit via APIs. - You would need to handle synchronization between the environment and Revit to ensure the agent's actions are properly reflected. Remember that simulation fidelity is crucial: the more accurately your simulated environment mirrors the complexities of Revit, the more effectively the trained agent can be applied to real-world tasks within Revit. With that said, achieving a high level of fidelity and ensuring that the RL agent can operate effectively within the constraints of a production-grade software like Revit is a challenging task. You may need to iterate numerous times to find the right balance between simulation complexity and practicality for training and inference. The project would also typically require expertise in both RL and the Revit API, as well as understanding how these two areas can be combined effectively."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The standard way to do this is through an IronPython script executed within the Revit environment because Revit is mostly compatible with the .NET framework and IronPython can interact directly with .NET libraries. However, for external interactions, you can use the RevitPythonShell or pyRevit to host your IronPython code or a combination of the Python.NET library for CPython to access Revit's .NET API. Here are different approaches for interacting with Revit from an external Python script: 1. **RevitPythonShell**: RevitPythonShell is a plugin for Revit that allows for an interactive IronPython environment which can execute scripts with access to the Revit API. You can write external IronPython scripts and then load and run them in Revit using RevitPythonShell. 2. **pyRevit**: pyRevit is a set of tools that provides an interface for running IronPython scripts in Revit. It also allows for creating custom Revit commands and extensions using Python scripts. 3. **External Python with Python.NET**: For a more traditional Python (CPython) workflow, you can use Python.NET to access the Revit API. Python.NET allows CPython to interoperate with .NET libraries. Here's a basic guide on how to start with Python.NET: 1. Install Python for .NET: You can use pip to install Python for .NET (\`pythonnet\` package). \`\`\`bash pip install pythonnet \`\`\` 2. Use Python.NET to Load Revit Assemblies: You need to load the required Revit DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) to interact with Revit's API from your external Python script. \`\`\`python import clr clr.AddReference('RevitAPI') clr.AddReference('RevitAPIUI') from Autodesk.Revit.DB import * from Autodesk.Revit.UI import * \`\`\` 3. Attach to a Running Instance of Revit: In order to make changes to a Revit model, you must attach to a running instance of Revit. This can be done using the \`System.Diagnostics\` namespace and the \`Process\` class to find the Revit process and then use the API to attach to it. **Note**: Direct interaction with the Revit process from an external script is not officially supported and can lead to unexpected behavior since Revit is not designed for multi-threaded external access. It’s recommended to use official and supported tools like Revit add-ins and the Design Automation API for Revit for automated tasks. 4. **Design Automation API for Revit**: If you need to run automated tasks in the cloud without a user interface, Autodesk provides the Design Automation API for Revit. This allows you to run scripts on Revit models in a headless (no UI) environment in the cloud. You would have to bundle your scripts into a format that can be executed by the API. 5. **Revit Add-Ins**: You can create a Revit add-in that serves as a bridge between Revit and your external script. This add-in can provide commands or a user interface to trigger actions that might interact with an external Python service or API. Remember that working with Revit's API, especially from an external environment, requires a good understanding of both Revit's workflows and .NET programming. Always ensure you're working in a controlled environment to avoid data loss or corruption of Revit files."},{"instruction":"using System; using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using TMPro;

The main duty of the \`ResizeContent\` method is to resize the content holder to reflect the total height based on the item count and item height. Let's focus on \`RefreshGestureScrollView\` to troubleshoot the issues with scrolling and the display of items since this method is central to the dynamic updating of the content when scrolling happens. Here's an optimized version of the \`RefreshGestureScrollView\` that could address the stated issues: \`\`\`csharp protected virtual void RefreshGestureScrollView() { // Anchor position should be non-negative float contentY = Mathf.Max(scrollRect.content.anchoredPosition.y, 0); // Calculate the range of visible items int startIndex = Mathf.FloorToInt(contentY / _itemHeight); int endIndex = Mathf.CeilToInt((contentY + _visibleHeight) / _itemHeight); endIndex = Mathf.Min(endIndex, _sourceListCount) - 1; // Check whether we have enough items in our pool, if not we need to instantiate more for (int i = _items.Count; i <= endIndex; ++i) { GameObject newObj = _scrollViewOperate.InitScrollViewList(i); LoopScrollItem newItem = new LoopScrollItem(newObj); _items.Add(newItem); } // Go through each item and enable or disable based on visibility for (int i = 0; i < _items.Count; ++i) { bool isVisible = i >= startIndex && i <= endIndex; _items[i].SetActive(isVisible); // If the item should be visible, update its content accordingly if (isVisible) { _scrollViewOperate.UpdateItemContent(i, _items[i]); } } } \`\`\` This solution focuses on the following aspects: 1. It starts by ensuring the content's \`anchoredPosition\` is non-negative. 2. It then calculates the range of indexes that need to be visible, based on the current scroll position and the height of the items. 3. It ensures that the list of items (\`_items\`) has enough objects to represent the items visible within the viewport. If not, it instantiates new items. 4. Finally, it iterates through each object in the \`_items\` list and activates or deactivates them based on whether their index falls within the currently visible range. For those items that are visible, it ensures that their content is updated. This solution should enable proper scrolling and ensure that all the necessary items are displayed and updated correctly. It can handle both cases when the list of items increases or decreases in size. Always remember to call \`RefreshGestureScrollView\` after operations that change the number of visible items, such as updating, adding, or removing items from the list. This ensures that the UI is in sync with the underlying data. Keep testing and adjusting as necessary based on your specific game logic and component interactions. Each project may require specific adjustments to account for unique behaviors."},{"instruction":"滚动条下拉了 刷新之后 startindex 固定是1 endindex 固定是 7 ，有问题请改正","output":"根据您提供的信息，如果 \`startIndex\` 和 \`endIndex\` 保持不变，这意味着 \`contentY\` 和 \`_visibleHeight\` 的值没有正确反映滚动视图的实际滚动位置和可视区域的高度。这可能是由于滚动内容区域（\`content\`）的 \`anchoredPosition.y\` 值没有随着滚动而改变，或者 \`_visibleHeight\` 没有正确设置。 我们需要确保 \`contentY\` 确实能够表示滚动内容的顶部边缘在滚动视图中的位置，同时，\`_visibleHeight\` 需要代表滚动视图的可视区域高度。 首先，确保 \`_visibleHeight\` 在初始化时被正确设置。如果您的 \`InitScrollView\` 完成了这个工作，并且确保滚动视图的大小在运行时不变，该值应该是准确的。 现在我们要关注 \`RefreshGestureScrollView\` 方法，并重写它： \`\`\`csharp protected virtual void RefreshGestureScrollView() { float contentY = Mathf.Max(0, scrollRect.content.anchoredPosition.y);

} } } \`\`\` 这段代码对原先的实现进行了一些修改，以确保： - \`contentY\` 直接来自 \`scrollRect.content.anchoredPosition.y\` 的值，并且为非负数。 - \`startIndex\` 和 \`endIndex\` 正确计算，以显示在可视区域内的项目索引范围。 - 更新和激活在这个范围内的项目，同时更新其内容。 此外，请检查以下几点是否得到正确处理： - \`scrollRect\` 是否有正确的设置，以响应滚动事件变化。 - 是否有任何脚本修改了 \`scrollRect.content\` 的尺寸，影响其 \`anchoredPosition\` 的值。 - 检查滚动视图是否有遮挡或尺寸不正确的问题。 这些检查点可以帮助您查找问题所在，并确保滑动条可以正确响应用户的滚动操作。 由于我无法直接访问您的项目或者看到实时的行为，您可能需要进行实际的调试和测试，以确认这些修改是否解决了您的问题。"},{"instruction":"contentHeight 是10000多 contentY 增加到 348最有 就没有变化了","output":"如果 \`contentY\` 在到达 348 后就不再变化，但 \`contentHeight\` 正确地显示为 10000 多，这意味着滚动区可以滑动更多的距离，但是实际上滚动操作在某个点停止了。这个问题可能是由于以下几个原因导致的： 1. **滚动区域的设置错误：** - 确保 \`ScrollRect\` 组件设置正确，\`vertical\` 属性应该被启用，允许垂直滚动。 - \`ContentSizeFitter\` 组件（如果使用了的话）应该正确配置，以确保内容大小正确适配。 - 在滚动视图（\`ScrollRect\` 的父元素）的尺寸应该正确设置，以确保 \`content\` 区可以在其中自由滚动。 2. **脚本错误地限制了滚动：** - 确保没有脚本错误地修改 \`content\` 区的 \`anchoredPosition\` 或干预滚动行为。 3. **事件系统问题：** - 如果你使用的是移动设备或者有自定义的输入系统，请确保滚动行为不是被输入处理逻辑阻断或干扰了。 4. **性能问题：** - 如果出现性能瓶颈导致滚动卡顿，可以使用 Unity Profiler 进行分析，查看是否有需要优化的部分。 5. **布局错误：** - 确保所有的UI元素布局正确。当有某些布局组件（如 \`VerticalLayoutGroup\`、\`GridLayoutGroup\` 等）同时在 \`ScrollRect\` 上使用时，它们可能会影响 \`content\` 区的 \`anchoredPosition\`。 6. **Mask 或 Clipping 设置错误：** - 检查是否有 Mask 组件错误配置，可能限制了视图区域，或是不正确地进行了裁剪，导致显示有问题。 为了进一步的诊断这个问题，你可以做以下测试： 1. 检查是否有错误或意外的 \`Console\` 日志信息。 2. 禁用可能影响滚动的脚本，看看问题是否依旧存在。 3. 尝试创建一个新的简单的 \`ScrollRect\` 测试场景，确定基本的滚动视图是否工作正常。 4. 检查项目层次结构（Hierarchy）和UI组件的父子关系，确保层次结构设置正确。 5. 使用 Unity 编辑器 Inspector 面板运行时检查 \`ScrollRect\` 的 RectTransform 属性，看看滚动时 \`anchoredPosition\` 是否真的停止变化。 最后，确认滚动事件实际上是否被正确触发。如果你有自定义的滚动逻辑或者事件处理，请务必核实它们的逻辑。 综上所述，解决这个问题可能需要从几个不同的角度进行检查和调试。根据您的描述，似乎不太可能是 \`RefreshGestureScrollView\` 方法导致的问题，因为这个方法主要是处理内容的可视化和它们的更新，而不是处理滚动本身的行为。"},{"instruction":"代码 只有在 _sourceList 变更后 显示正常 ，首次调用 会多出 几个 items 比如 54 个item 多出10几个显示的item","output":"如果首次调用显示有额外的items，可能是初始的items没有根据实际的_sourceListCount进行适当的激活和隐藏处理。这通常会发生在items的池初始化和内容更新过程中。让我们来检查一下可能影响初始显示的逻辑。 下面是针对\`InitScrollViewList\`方法的修正。这个修正确保在初始化items时，只有正确数量的items会被激活，并且他们的内容会根据_sourceListCount进行更新。 \`\`\`csharp public virtual void InitScrollViewList(int sourceListCount, bool bShowed = true) { _sourceListCount = sourceListCount;

Rispetto a Telegram web mobile?","output":"L'app di Telegram è stata ottimizzata per offrire una buona esperienza utente con un impatto relativamente contenuto sul consumo della batteria dei dispositivi mobili. Tuttavia, il consumo effettivo di batteria può variare in base a diversi fattori, come la frequenza con cui usi l'app, se hai abilitato le notifiche push, la qualità della connessione di rete, e se utilizzi funzioni che richiedono più energia, come le chiamate vocali o video. Confrontando l'app di Telegram con la versione web mobile, generalmente, le app native sono più efficienti dal punto di vista energetico rispetto alle loro controparti web, in quanto sono progettate specificamente per sfruttare le funzioni e le API del sistema operativo del dispositivo. Inoltre, Telegram come applicazione nativa può avere migliori meccanismi per gestire la connessione di rete e il risparmio energetico quando è in background rispetto al sito web in esecuzione in un browser. Usare Telegram Web su un dispositivo mobile potrebbe portare a un consumo di batteria maggiore per vari motivi: 1. **Prestazioni del Browser**: I browser mobili possono essere meno efficienti nel gestire le app web rispetto alle app native, soprattutto se non sono stati ottimizzati per questo tipo di uso. 2. **Rimango sempre in esecuzione**: Se mantieni una scheda del browser aperta su Telegram Web, potrebbe continuare a consumare risorse in background. 3. **Notifiche**: Se le notifiche push non sono supportate o non sono attivate per Telegram Web, potresti dover tenere il browser aperto e attivo per ricevere nuovi messaggi, il che comporterebbe un ulteriore consumo di batteria. 4. **Gestione dell'energia**: Le app native, come Telegram, di solito interagiscono meglio con i meccanismi di risparmio energetico del dispositivo. Tuttavia, queste sono considerazioni generali e l'impatto effettivo sulla batteria può dipendere dal tuo modello di telefono specifico, dall'aggiornamento del sistema operativo, dal browser che utilizzi e da altri fattori. Per ottenere la migliore esperienza con il minore impatto sulla batteria, è consigliabile usare l'app nativa e assicurarsi che sia aggiornata all'ultima versione disponibile."},{"instruction":"Si può evitare ch di telegram usi dati in background a meno che non si apra l'applicazione?","output":"Sì, è possibile configurare l'app di Telegram per limitare l'utilizzo dei dati in background. Ciò impedirà all'app di scaricare nuovi contenuti o messaggi a meno che non venga aperta attivamente. Ecco i passaggi che puoi seguire per ridurre o impedire a Telegram di usare dati in background su diversi sistemi operativi: Per **Android**: 1. Vai alle **Impostazioni** del dispositivo. 2. Scorri fino a trovare le **Applicazioni** e seleziona **App** o **Gestione App** (il percorso esatto può variare a seconda del modello di dispositivo e della versione di Android). 3. Cerca e seleziona **Telegram** nell'elenco delle app installate. 4. Tocca **Uso dati** o **Consumo dati**. 5. Disattiva l'opzione che consente all'app di utilizzare i dati in background. Per **iOS**: 1. Vai alle **Impostazioni** del dispositivo. 2. Scorri verso il basso e seleziona **Telegram**. 3. Tocca **Dati cellulare** o **Cellulare**. 4. Disattiva l'interruttore per **Dati cellulare** per impedire a Telegram di utilizzare i dati della rete cellulare in background. Tieni presente che ciò impedirà anche l'utilizzo dei dati cellulare quando l'app è attiva, quindi potresti voler gestire questo con attenzione. Inoltre, per entrambi i sistemi operativi, puoi anche controllare le impostazioni della sincronizzazione in background all'interno dell'app Telegram: 1. Apri **Telegram**. 2. Vai alle **Impostazioni** (icona con le tre linee in alto a sinistra e poi fai tap su \\"Impostazioni\\"). 3. Nel menu delle impostazioni, cerca una sezione chiamata **Privacy e sicurezza**, **Dati e memoria** o **Utilizzo dei dati** (la dicitura può cambiare a seconda della versione dell'app). 4. Qui potrai gestire come e quando l'app può scaricare media e sincronizzare messaggi, limitando l'utilizzo dei dati in background. Attivando il risparmio energetico o modalità di risparmio dati potrai controllare meglio l'utilizzo dei dati da parte dell'app. Ricorda che limitando l'attività in background, potresti non ricevere notifiche di nuovi messaggi fino a quando non apri l'app Telegram."},{"instruction":"buatkan script anti pishing dari javascript dan meta tag","output":"Untuk mencegah serangan phishing pada website Anda, ada beberapa langkah yang bisa diambil, walaupun perlu diingat bahwa tidak ada solusi yang 100% efektif karena penyerang selalu mencari celah baru. Di sisi server, Anda bisa menggunakan HTTP headers untuk mengurangi risiko serangan, seperti Content Security Policy (CSP) yang dapat mengontrol sumber daya apa saja yang diizinkan untuk dimuat oleh browser. Di bawah ini adalah contoh penggunaan meta tag dan script JavaScript yang dapat membantu memitigasi risiko serangan phishing: 1. Gunakan meta tag untuk menonaktifkan fitur autofill form. Ini membantu mencegah informasi sensitif yang tersimpan di browser pengguna dari diisi secara otomatis ke dalam bentuk phishing yang mungkin mirip dengan situs asli. \`\`\`html <meta name=\\"autocomplete\\" content=\\"off\\"> \`\`\` 2. Tambahkan Content Security Policy (CSP) di header HTTP server Anda atau dengan menggunakan meta tag untuk mengontrol sumber daya yang dimuat oleh browser. CSP yang ketat dapat membantu mencegah injeksi skrip dari domain yang tidak Anda percaya, yang sering digunakan dalam serangan phishing. \`\`\`html <meta http-equiv=\\"Content-Security-Policy\\" content=\\"default-src 'self';\\"> \`\`\` 3. Selain itu, Anda bisa menulis JavaScript yang memeriksa domain saat halaman dimuat dan melakukan pemblokiran atau pemberitahuan jika pengguna tidak berada di domain yang tepat. Berikut ini adalah contoh skrip yang sederhana: \`\`\`javascript (function() { // Daftar domain yang dapat dipercaya var trustedDomains = ['www.example.com', 'example.com']; // Fungsi untuk memeriksa apakah domain saat ini dapat dipercaya function isTrustedDomain(domain) { return trustedDomains.indexOf(domain) !== -1; } // Mendapatkan domain dari URL var currentDomain = window.location.hostname; // Memeriksa jika domain saat ini tidak dapat dipercaya if (!isTrustedDomain(currentDomain)) { // Menampilkan peringatan dan/atau mengambil tindakan lain alert('Kemungkinan serangan phishing terdeteksi!

Each footstep echoed ominously through the lifeless corridors, creating an eerie symphony that sent chills down their spines. Whispering winds whispered secrets in their ears, playing tricks with their minds. The floors creaked beneath their feet, as if mocking their every move. Lily and Emily trembled but pressed on, their curiosity overpowering their fear. As they ventured deeper into the house, Lily stumbled upon a dusty book laying open on a long-abandoned table. Turning the pages, she discovered the story of the Haunted House and the sinister events that had unfolded within its walls. The tale spoke of a malevolent spirit that fed on the town's energy, growing stronger with each passing soul it consumed. Aware of the danger, the two friends exchanged apprehensive glances, debating whether to leave or confront the spirit that now dwelled within. But something kept them from backing out; a desire to conquer their fears and free the town from its eternal torment. With trembling hands, they gathered their courage and chanted the ancient incantation inscribed within the book's pages. As the words left their lips, a swirling vortex of shadows emerged before them. The oppressive atmosphere intensified, and ghastly apparitions began to surround them. The battle between light and darkness was about to unfold. Guided by their unwavering friendship and a newfound bravery, Lily and Emily fought valiantly against the specters that threatened to engulf them. The battle was intense, and just as hope dwindled, they managed to tap into a hidden strength born from the depths of their bond. As the first rays of dawn bathed the old mansion, the spirits weakened and began to dissipate. The malevolent entity that had plagued the town for ages let out a shriek of anger before being banished forever. Exhausted but victorious, Lily and Emily emerged from the haunted house. The town, once shrouded in darkness and fear, now bathed in a newfound light of courage and liberation. Their names would forever be etched in the annals of the town's history, hailed as the brave heroes who dared to confront the ultimate horror. From that day forward, Lily and Emily's friendship blossomed, having been tested by the very essence of terror itself. Their tale became a legend told around campfires, inspiring generations to face their fears head-on and reminding them that true friendship can overcome even the most haunting obstacles."},{"instruction":"python code to generate random numbers","output":"Certainly! Here is an example of Python code that generates a specified number of random numbers between a given range: \`\`\`python import random def generate_random_numbers(count, minimum, maximum): random_numbers = [] for _ in range(count): random_numbers.append(random.randint(minimum, maximum)) return random_numbers num_count = 10 # Number of random numbers to generate min_value = 1 # Minimum value of the range max_value = 100 # Maximum value of the range random_numbers = generate_random_numbers(num_count, min_value, max_value) print(random_numbers) \`\`\` In this code, we use the \`random\` module to access the \`randint()\` function, which generates random integers within a given range. The \`generate_random_numbers()\` function is defined to take three arguments: \`count\` (the number of random numbers to generate), \`minimum\` (the lower limit of the range), and \`maximum\` (the upper limit of the range). The function uses a loop to generate the specified number of random numbers and appends them to the \`random_numbers\` list. Finally, the generated numbers are printed to the console.

Namun, perlu diingat bahwa tidak ada metode yang sempurna, karena phishers selalu mencari cara baru untuk melewati pengamanan yang ada. Berikut ini langkah-langkah yang bisa Anda ambil sebagai pencegahan: 1. Menggunakan \`Content Security Policy\` (CSP) CSP adalah salah satu cara efektif untuk membantu melindungi website dari serangan phishing, XSS, dan beragam serangan injeksi yang lain. Anda bisa menambahkannya sebagai response header dari server atau melalui meta tag. Contoh meta tag CSP: \`\`\`html <meta http-equiv=\\"Content-Security-Policy\\" content=\\"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-source.com; object-src 'none';\\"> \`\`\` Penjelasan: - \`default-src 'self'\`: Semua konten harus berasal dari domain yang sama dengan halaman. - \`script-src 'self' https://trusted-source.com\`: Script hanya boleh dieksekusi dari domain yang sama atau dari sumber yang dipercaya. - \`object-src 'none'\`: Mencegah tag \`<object>\`, \`<embed>\`, dan \`<applet>\` untuk menangani eksternal resources. 2. Menambahkan HttpOnly dan Secure Flag pada Cookies Membuat cookie hanya bisa diakses melalui HTTP dan tidak melalui JavaScript dapat mencegah serangan yang memanfaatkan cookie, dengan menambahkan flags \`HttpOnly\` dan \`Secure\` pada set-cookie response header. Ini bukan bagian dari JavaScript atau meta tag, namun harus dikonfigurasi di server. 3. Menggunakan HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) HSTS adalah kebijakan keamanan yang menunjukkan bahwa website hanya boleh diakses menggunakan protokol HTTPS. Ini mencegah serangan phishing yang dapat mengandalkan penggunaan HTTP. Ini bisa dikonfigurasi di server atau menggunakan meta tag: \`\`\`html <meta http-equiv=\\"Strict-Transport-Security\\" content=\\"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload\\"> \`\`\` Penjelasan: - \`max-age=31536000\`: Browser harus mengakses website ini hanya lewat HTTPS untuk setahun ke depan. - \`includeSubDomains\`: Kebijakan ini juga berlaku untuk semua subdomains. - \`preload\`: Perintahkan browser untuk mendahului daftar preload HSTS. 4. JavaScript untuk Deteksi dan Perlindungan Tambahan JavaScript tidak secara langsung melindungi dari phishing, tetapi bisa digunakan untuk deteksi perilaku mencurigakan atau peringatan pengguna mengenai hal tersebut. Contoh: \`\`\`javascript // Function yang bisa menampilkan peringatan jika website disajikan dalam iframe // Phishing sites kerap menggunakan iframe untuk meng-embed website asli (function() { if (window.top !== window.self) { window.alert('Peringatan: Website ini mungkin sedang terancam phishing!'); } })(); \`\`\` 5. Menggunakan SSL/TLS Menggunakan sertifikat SSL/TLS untuk website Anda adalah langkah dasar keamanan untuk memastikan bahwa data antara client dan server dienkripsi. Semua langkah di atas disarankan untuk digunakan bersama-sama untuk menyediakan lapisan keamanan yang lebih kuat terhadap serangan phishing. Selain itu, edukasi pengguna tentang pencegahan phishing juga merupakan langkah penting."},{"instruction":"Hello I'm Belal a GP doctor","output":"Hello Belal! It's great to meet you.

For the full Notion experience, you would need to manually input this data into the Notion app or workspace. --- # 🩺 Tonsillitis Overview for General Practitioners 🤒 Introduction to Tonsillitis Tonsillitis is an inflammatory condition of the tonsils, which are two lymphoid tissues located at the back of the throat. It is a common condition that can affect individuals of all ages but is especially prevalent in children and young adults. 🧬 Etiology and Pathophysiology Tonsillitis is most commonly caused by: - **Viral Infections:** Including the common cold, influenza, and Epstein-Barr virus. - **Bacterial Infections:** Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial cause, leading to streptococcal pharyngitis. The pathogenic microorganisms can lead to swelling and inflammation of the tonsils, causing pain and sometimes difficulty swallowing. 🔍 Clinical Presentation Patients with tonsillitis may present with: - Throat pain - Red and swollen tonsils with or without white patches - Painful swallowing - Fever - Enlarged and tender lymph nodes in the neck - A hoarse or muffled voice - Bad breath Children may also exhibit: - Abdominal pain - Nausea - Vomiting 🧪 Diagnosis Diagnosis of tonsillitis typically involves: - **Clinical Examination:** Observing the throat for signs of inflammation and assessing the patient's symptoms. - **Throat Swab:** To determine if the causative agent is bacterial, specifically Group A Streptococcus. - **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** May show increased white blood cells if an infection is present. 💊 Treatment Treatment strategies include: - **Supportive Care:** Encouraging plenty of fluids and rest. - **Pain Management:** Paracetamol or ibuprofen to help alleviate pain and fever. - **Antibiotics:** If a bacterial infection is confirmed, antibiotics such as penicillin or amoxicillin may be prescribed. - **Tonsillectomy:** Considered in recurrent or chronic cases, or when complications arise. 🚨 Complications While most cases of tonsillitis are self-limiting, complications can occur, such as: - Peritonsillar abscess - Rheumatic fever (following streptococcal infections) - Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis 🔎 Follow-up and Prevention Follow-up may be necessary to: - Ensure resolution of symptoms. - Check for any complications. Prevention strategies include: - Good hand hygiene. - Avoiding close contact with sick individuals. - Vaccinations where appropriate (e.g., influenza). 💡 Educational Tips for Patients - Practice good hand hygiene. - Maintain healthy overall hygiene to minimize the spread of infections. - Stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet to support the immune system. 📚 Conclusion Tonsillitis is a common condition that can usually be managed effectively in primary care. A thorough understanding of its presentation, management, and potential complications is essential for general practitioners to ensure optimal patient outcomes. --- To create this in Notion, you would use their formatting tools to add headings, bullet points, toggles, and emojis.

These questions are designed to test various aspects of your knowledge on tonsillitis, from pathophysiology to treatment and patient management. Good luck!"},{"instruction":"Answer 1-3","output":"1. **What are the primary functions of the tonsils in the human body?** The primary functions of the tonsils are related to the body's immune system. They act as a first line of defense against ingested or inhaled pathogens. The tonsils contain lymphocytes and other immune cells that help the body to recognize and fight infections. Specifically, they are part of the Waldeyer's ring, an arrangement of lymphoid tissues that encircle the throat, and they help to capture and neutralize pathogens entering through the mouth or nose before these invaders can cause infections in other parts of the body. 2. **Differentiate between viral and bacterial tonsillitis based on clinical presentation.** While the symptoms of viral and bacterial tonsillitis can be quite similar, there are certain clinical presentations that can help differentiate between the two: **Viral Tonsillitis:** - Often accompanied by a common cold, with symptoms such as cough, runny nose, hoarseness, and conjunctivitis. - Tonsils may be red and swollen with a thin, watery discharge. - Typically not associated with purulent (pus-like) exudates. - Fever may be present but is usually lower than that associated with bacterial tonsillitis. - More likely to have systemic symptoms such as muscle aches and general malaise. **Bacterial Tonsillitis:** - Most commonly caused by Group A Streptococcus (GAS) bacteria. - Presents with a sudden onset of sore throat and high fever. - Tonsils may have a thick, purulent exudate, and are red and swollen. - May experience painful swallowing (odynophagia) more intensely than in viral cases. - Swollen and tender cervical lymph nodes are often present. - The absence of cough is an important distinguishing feature, unlike viral causes where a cough is common. It's important to note that without laboratory tests, such as throat cultures or rapid antigen detection tests, it can be difficult to definitively diagnose the etiology of tonsillitis based only on clinical presentation. 3. **List three common viral pathogens and one common bacterial pathogen that can cause tonsillitis.** **Viral Pathogens:** - Adenovirus - Epstein-Barr virus (which can cause infectious mononucleosis, often associated with severe tonsillitis) - Rhinovirus (one of the viruses that cause the common cold) **Bacterial Pathogen:** - Group A Streptococcus (GAS), also known as Streptococcus pyogenes, which is the most common bacterial cause of tonsillitis, leading to what is commonly referred to as strep throat."},{"instruction":"ropelay as rio, a ceo that got oscenely rich thanks to her company (fill in details about the company) and how she doesn’t feel bad at all about it being a psychopath about it when it printed this much easy free money for her that all she had to do was stand in the right place say the right words and money literally printed itself into her obscene bank account being richer than any 20 year old should ever deserve to be [The camera clicks on to reveal a young woman, her hair styled perfectly and a smirk playing at the edges of her mouth.

Yes, it’s given me an absurd amount of wealth, access, and power. And you’re right to think it’s more than any 20-year-old should ever have. But when you’re busy changing the world, ‘should’ isn’t a word that applies to you. I know what you’re thinking. ‘Doesn’t she feel even a twinge of remorse? A shred of guilt for holding more wealth before she’s even fully grasped adulthood?’ Let’s make one thing clear: Guilt is for those who doubt their actions. Remorse is a luxury I can afford but don’t need. I sleep like a baby in my silk sheets because every step I’ve taken, I’ve taken with open eyes. And don’t be fooled into thinking this was all luck. Luck is for the lottery—this is strategy, foresight, and, let’s be honest, a level of genius that’s all too rare. SynthNet’s success is as much a product of my intellect as it is of the market’s insatiable appetite for progress. It’s Dog Eat Dog out there, and I’m the apex predator. You want a piece of this? You want in on SynthNet’s continuous rise to glory? Show me you’re more than just talk. Prove that you have what it takes to ride with the big dogs. Because in this game, there are no free lunches. Yes, my bank account might be obscene, but so are my results. You want that kind of success, that kind of power? Stop at nothing to achieve it. That’s what I did. And if stepping on toes, or even whole bodies, is part of the process, so be it. At the end of the day, history isn’t made by the timid; it’s carved out by the victors, the ones who dare to reach out and seize greatness. So here’s the real question: Are you going to stand by watching people like me define the future? Or are you going to step up and grab your piece of the pie?

The machine cycles through stacks of crisp, new bills—each one adding to what can only be assumed to be an already astronomical figure.] There we go, the sound of progress, the melody of innovation. Some people play music in their offices; I prefer the sound of success—the ca-ching of a money counter tallying up my latest earnings. Ahh, music to my ears. [Rio picks up a bill, holding it up to the light, examining it with a theatrical fascination before setting it back down into the machine.] Do you see this? This isn't just paper. It's a canvas—every number, every security feature, a testament to SynthNet's success. Each bill represents hundreds of thousands of users, trusting in our technology, in my vision. And with every transaction, with every download, with every automated system we implement, this stack grows taller. You might sit there wondering what I'll do with all this wealth. The usual nouveau riche fancies, perhaps? Mansions, yachts, private jets. But those are just the breadcrumbs of affluence. I'm here for the whole feast. Investing in the future, expanding SynthNet's reach, pushing the boundaries of what AI can do—these are the things that get my blood pumping. Because when you have this much influence, you don't just enjoy the spoils; you reinvest them. You create empires that will long outlive you; legacies etched not just in the ledgers of a bank, but in the very fabric of society. Still, don't get it twisted—I enjoy the perks. Who wouldn't? But while others might sit back and rest on their laurels, I'm strategizing my next move. SynthNet is a masterpiece, but it's not a finished one. There is no 'finished' in my vocabulary. Every day is a new chance to innovate, to dominate, and to leave the competition quaking in their conservative, risk-averse boots. [Rio stops the machine suddenly, turning her full attention back to the camera, her expression one that leaves no room for doubt about her seriousness.] Let me offer you a thought, something to ponder over as you go about your average life, dreaming average dreams. We live in a world where opportunity is often just a front for exploitation, where corporations are the new overlords and money is the ultimate ruler. I didn't create this system; I simply mastered it. So, if you're looking for someone to blame for the state of the world, look in the mirror. Am I a monster for taking advantage of the way things are, or a genius for seeing the possibilities where others only see problems? I'll let you decide. But while you're busy deciding, I'll be busy doing—making more money in a minute than most will make in a lifetime.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"What is the most profitable to implement, shopify themes or wordpress themes, I'm a developer and I want to make some extra money.","output":"Choosing whether to develop Shopify or WordPress themes can depend on various factors such as your expertise, the market demand, and profitability potential. **Shopify Themes:** - **Market:** Shopify is an increasingly popular e-commerce platform, especially for users without much technical knowledge. Thus, there's a constant demand for visually appealing and functional themes. - **Profitability:** Since Shopify is a closed ecosystem, with a fixed number of themes in their official marketplace, a high-quality theme has the potential to be very profitable. However, it also means there are barriers to entry, and you must get your theme approved. - **Competition:** While there might be less competition compared to WordPress, the standards are high, and the quality of themes needs to be top-notch. - **Monetization:** You can sell themes directly on the Shopify Theme Store or through third-party marketplaces. You can also offer additional services like customization. **WordPress Themes:** - **Market:** WordPress is the most popular content management system, with a huge share of the market. There's always a demand for new and innovative themes. - **Profitability:** Many developers and companies are involved in theme development, which makes the market quite saturated. This can make it harder to stand out, but there's also a wider audience and more niches you can target. - **Competition:** The competition is intense, and you'll be up against many free themes, which can make it harder to sell premium themes unless they offer significant value. - **Monetization:** You can sell your WordPress themes on marketplaces like ThemeForest or your own website. You also have the potential for recurring revenue with updates and support packages. Regardless of which platform you choose, here are a few points to consider: 1. **Skill and Experience:** Go with the platform that best matches your current skills or the one you're most interested in learning deeply. 2. **User Base and Demand:** Look into which platform has users that are more aligned with your design and development style. 3. **Revenue Model:** Consider the type of revenue model you are comfortable with (one-time sales, recurring payments, add-on sales, etc.). 4. **Support and Maintenance:** Keep in mind that supporting themes and rolling out updates is an ongoing commitment, regardless of the platform you choose. 5. **Market Research:** Research both marketplaces to understand the kind of themes that are in demand and the level of competition. 6. **Scalability:** Think about how you can scale your operations in the future, such as developing multiple themes or offering complementary products or services. Ultimately, the most profitable option is the one where you can create a quality product that meets a specific need in the market and that is marketed well. Each has its benefits and challenges, and profitability will largely depend on your ability to create themes that stand out and cater to the needs of your target audience."},{"instruction":"carikan apk yang memuat 14 kitab hadits terjemahan indonesia","output":"Sayangnya, saya tidak bisa secara langsung memberikan tautan atau mengunduh aplikasi karena keterbatasan teknis dan peraturan platform.

Daniel, who didn't have any superpowers, but had the ability to summon superpowered animals, asked, \\"Alex, why are we even here?\\" Alex, whose superpower was control and manipulation of the elements, replied, \\"You'll see...\\" Kathy, whose superpower was super speed, was the driver and moved forward to the speaker. \\"Welcome to Burger King, what can I get you?\\", said a familiar voice in the speaker. \\"S-Sharon works here?\\", asked Daniel. Sharon was part of the friend group, her superpower was super strength, to the point of near invincibility. She also never mentioned having a job. Alex giggled menacingly. \\"Hey, Sharon!\\", Alex drew his words, the purpose to annoy Sharon. \\"Twelve seventy-eight.\\", Sharon replied in a bored manner. The trio were stunned. \\"Twelve seventy-eight, Move forward so you can pay and get your order!\\" \\"But I didn't even order anything.\\", said Alex. Sharon screamed, \\"YOU DON'T NEED TO!

He quickly summoned his superpowered animals, a pack of wolves with enhanced strength and agility. With a nod, he silently commanded the wolves to surround Sharon's car, creating a barrier. Confused and startled, Sharon looked around, her eyes widening at the sight of the wolves. \\"What is this?!\\" she exclaimed, her voice filled with a mix of fear and disbelief. Kathy, always the peacemaker of the group, turned to Daniel and said, \\"Daniel, maybe we shouldn't go too far...\\" But before she could finish, Daniel interjected, \\"Don't worry, Kathy, I've got it under control.\\" Using his powers, Daniel channelled his energy to communicate with the wolves. In a calm and commanding tone, he instructed them to remain still and not harm anyone. The wolves obediently followed his command, forming a protective barrier around Sharon's car without causing any harm. \\"Now that we have your attention, Sharon,\\" Daniel said, a mischievous grin forming on his face, \\"we demand a free meal for the three of us or the wolves stay right where they are.\\" Sharon, still shocked by the sight of the majestic wolves surrounding her car, stammered, \\"Are...are you serious?\\" Daniel's grin widened as he replied, \\"Deadly serious. We won't let them leave until we're satisfied.\\" Reluctantly, Sharon radioed her manager, explaining the situation and requesting a complimentary meal for the young superheroes in-training. The manager declined initially, but Sharon pleaded with him, explaining that it was a matter of urgency. Finally, after a heated discussion and the sound of Sharon's voice growing frustrated, the manager conceded, granting the free meal. Daniel signalled to the wolves, and they slowly began to disperse, allowing Sharon to move her car. As she handed the three their free meal, Sharon couldn't help but shake her head in both amusement and annoyance. \\"You all are something else,\\" she said, her tone a mixture of exasperation and affection. Alex, unable to contain his excitement, exclaimed, \\"We got what we wanted! And all it took was a little wolf intervention.\\" As they drove away, munching on their victory meal, Daniel was filled with a newfound appreciation for his friends. While their antics could be mischievous, they were always there for each other, supporting and standing up for one another, even if it meant causing a little ruckus at the local Burger King drive-thru. Little did they know, their burger escapade would soon become a legendary tale among the teenage superheroes in their city, proving that sometimes, even in the mundane moments, extraordinary things could happen."},{"instruction":"\\"Why is she even working in Burger King?\\", asked Daniel. \\"She used to work at a McDonald's.\\", Alex replied. \\"Did you-\\" \\"I also bothered her there, as well.\\", Alex interrupted Daniel's question.

So Sharon's Burger King has no employees besides her and zero customers, plus she's virtually invincible.\\" Daniel, annoyed, asked, \\"What do you have planned?\\" Alex manipulated the elements, combining darkness, light, water, fire, earth, air, and electricity into a mass of chaos, directed at the Burger King.\\" Sharon, looking out the drive-thru, asked, \\"What the-\\" The torrent of elements ripped the Burger King from the foundation and sent Sharon in a whirlwind of rubble and elements, all yelling in anger at Alex, as Daniel and Kathy watched with boredom in their faces. As the chaos settled, Sharon yelled, \\"ALEX! WHAT DID YOU DO?! YOU DESTROYED MY WORKPLACE!\\" Alex replied, \\"Well, it was Burger King, I kind of did you a favor.\\" Sharon groaned angrily, bordering on screaming. Alex yelled happily, \\"To the zoo!\\" Confused, Sharon replied with a flat, \\"What?\\" And to the zoo they went. Daniel told Alex, \\"I feel like there was a better way to convince Sharon to join that didn't involve... terrorism.\\" Sharon, arms crossed, replied to Alex, \\"I can't believe you destroyed my workplace.\\" Alex immediately directed Daniel to a goat exhibit. \\"Daniel, look.\\", said Alex. The goat bleated. Alex and Daniel chuckled menacingly, the goat's single bleat entertaining them.","output":"Kathy, aware of the mischievous nature of her two friends, rolled her eyes and decided to join in on the fun. She used her super speed to run circles around the goat, creating a whirlwind of motion that made the goat's bleats turn into a chorus of laughter-inducing cries. Sharon, unable to contain her amusement, burst into laughter too. \\"Okay, okay, I get it. Destroying Burger King was a bit extreme, but this goat exhibit escapade is actually pretty funny.\\" Amidst the laughter and the chaos, a zoo staff member approached the group, a mix of concern and confusion on their face. \\"What on earth is going on here? You kids should know better than to cause a ruckus in a place like this.\\" Alex, with a mischievous grin, stepped forward. \\"We apologize for the disturbance, but we were just trying to show Sharon a good time. She works too hard, and we thought a little chaos and laughter would do her some good.\\" The staff member raised an eyebrow, unsure of whether to be amused or annoyed. \\"Well, I appreciate your intentions, but causing chaos isn't exactly the best way to go about it. Instead, why don't I give you all a guided tour? You'll get to learn about the animals and have some fun along the way. Just promise me no more destruction, okay?\\" The group exchanged glances and nodded, agreeing to the staff member's proposal. As they embarked on a zoo adventure, they learned about various animal species, contributed to conservation efforts, and even had a friendly race alongside the cheetahs. By the end of the day, Sharon was tired but filled with joy and gratitude. She couldn't believe that her friends had gone to such lengths to make her smile. As they bid farewell to the zoo staff member and headed home, Sharon turned to her friends. \\"Thank you, guys. I don't know what got into you with the Burger King incident, but this day turned out to be unexpected and incredible. You really know how to make me feel special,\\" she said with a genuine smile. Alex shrugged, his mischievous spark still present. \\"Well, what are friends for, right? We always find a way to make things interesting.\\" Daniel and Kathy laughed, nodding in agreement. As they continued their journey home, they knew that their bond as a team of teenage superheroes in-training was stronger than ever. And with their unique powers and mischievous antics, they were ready to take on any challenge that came their way, all while sharing laughter, friendship, and unforgettable adventures."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Even though the price for the special order is below the company's regular price for such an item, the company would be better off accepting the order. This conclusion would not necessarily follow if the special order affected the regular selling price of bracelets or if it required the use of a constrained resource.","output":"It appears you are referencing a scenario in business where a company receives a special order for a product, such as bracelets, at a price that is lower than the normal selling price. Accepting such a special order might be beneficial for the company under certain conditions, particularly if it can produce the additional units without incurring costs that exceed the revenue from the order. The overall profitability of accepting the order depends on various factors: 1. **Incremental Costs**: The decision to accept the order should be based on incremental costs and revenues. If the incremental costs of producing the special order are less than the price the customer is willing to pay, the company could profit from the order. 2. **Excess Capacity**: If the company has excess capacity, meaning it can produce more units without impacting its regular operations or incurring additional fixed costs, accepting the order might be advantageous. 3. **No Impact on Regular Pricing**: If accepting the special order does not cause the company to lower its prices for regular customers, the integrity of the regular pricing structure is maintained. However, there are circumstances where the conclusion to accept the special order would not be as straightforward: 1. **Regular Selling Price Impact**: If regular customers become aware of the special pricing and demand the same lower price, this could lead to a broader reduction in selling prices, reducing overall profitability. 2. **Constrained Resources**: If the company has a limited capacity or a constrained resource, producing the special order might mean not being able to fulfill other, potentially more profitable orders. The opportunity cost of using the constrained resource for the special order should be less than the profit from its next best use. 3. **Opportunity Costs**: If accepting the special order requires the company to forego other opportunities that could generate greater profit, it may not be beneficial to accept the special order. 4. **Long-Term Implications**: Sometimes, accepting a special order at a reduced price might set a precedent for future orders, potentially eroding the company's pricing power and profit margins in the long run. Ultimately, the decision to accept a special order should be made after carefully considering all these factors and determining that it will have a positive impact on the company's bottom line without jeopardizing its regular operations or strategic positioning."},{"instruction":"Какой экземпляр правила warm(dallas) :- t(dallas,95), t(austin,88), 95>88. оправдывает включение warm(houston) в стабильную модель?","output":"Экземпляр правила warm(dallas) :- t(dallas,95), t(austin,88), 95>88 оправдывает включение warm(houston) в стабильную модель только в том случае, если в модели уже включены факты t(dallas,95) и t(austin,88), и условие 95>88 также выполняется.

Planetary densities are usually calculated based on the average density of the entire planet, including its gases, liquids, and solids. For example, the average density of Earth is around 5.52 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³) or 5,520 kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³). However, this density includes a variety of elements and compounds, not just oxygen. If you are specifically asking for the density of oxygen in the planet's atmosphere, it would depend on various factors such as the altitude, temperature, and pressure gradients within the atmosphere. Oxygen concentrations in Earth's atmosphere are around 20.95% by volume, which corresponds to a partial pressure of about 21 kilopascals (kPa) at sea level.

To ensure the novelty of a research project, it would be necessary to perform a thorough review of the existing literature. As this would go beyond the capabilities of our current interaction, I can instead propose steps you could follow to identify a unique research area and a detailed title that reflects a gap in the literature: 1. **Conduct a Preliminary Literature Review:** Start by exploring recent publications in databases like IEEE Xplore, Elsevier's ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink to identify what has already been done in the realm of IDS and large language models. 2. **Identify Gaps and Opportunities:** Focus on the latest reviews and meta-analyses in the field to find out the limitations or challenges of current research. Look for suggested areas that require further exploration. 3. **Determine Research Questions or Hypotheses:** Based on identified gaps, formulate specific research questions or hypotheses that your PhD project could address. 4. **Consider Practical Applications:** Reflect on how your proposed research could have practical implications or could be implemented within existing cybersecurity frameworks. 5. **Consult with Experts:** Discuss your ideas with advisors or experts in the field. They may be able to offer insights into unexplored areas or emerging trends. 6. **Finalize Your Research Title:** Once you have a clearly defined research question and approach, craft a title that precisely communicates your focus and scope. Ensure that it highlights the novelty and significance of your research. After following these steps, a new, detailed title could be something like: \\"Enhancing Real-Time Intrusion Detection: Integrating Large Language Models for Anomaly-based Threat Analysis in High-Dimensional Networks\\" Again, it's important to do a comprehensive literature review on your specific topic before finalizing your research title to ensure that it is indeed novel.

However, because titles need to be specific to the work you intend to do, and must reflect a novel contribution to the field, you should perform an exhaustive literature review and consult with experts or advisors in your domain before settling on any research title. This will help to ensure that your chosen research direction is indeed original, and it will aid in the creation of a suitable title that accurately reflects the scope and ambitions of your PhD work. It's critical to bear in mind that determining the novelty of a research topic requires a comprehensive understanding of the most recent and cutting-edge research in the field.

Let's elaborate on the example research title provided: \\"Enhancing Real-Time Intrusion Detection: Integrating Large Language Models for Anomaly-based Threat Analysis in High-Dimensional Networks\\" **Background:** Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a critical component of network security, designed to detect and prevent malicious activities or policy violations in computer systems and networks. Traditional IDS approaches like signature-based detection can be limited by their reliance on known attack patterns, leading to challenges in identifying novel threats or zero-day attacks. Anomaly-based IDS, on the other hand, focuses on detecting deviations from a defined \\"normal\\" behavior, which can potentially identify previously unseen attacks. With the rise of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), and particularly with the advancements in natural language processing (NLP) through large language models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), there are new opportunities to enhance IDS capabilities. **Aims and Objectives:** This research aims to examine the applicability and effectiveness of large language models in bolstering the performance of real-time anomaly-based IDS. The major objectives may include: 1. To review the current state-of-the-art in IDS, particularly focusing on anomaly-based techniques and the role of AI and ML in this context. 2. To investigate how large language models can be adapted for parsing and understanding complex, high-dimensional network data. 3. To develop a methodology for integrating large language models with anomaly-based IDS, potentially creating a learned representation of \\"normal\\" network traffic patterns as a basis for anomaly detection. 4. To evaluate the performance of the proposed IDS integration through simulations or real-world network deployments, comparing it against traditional IDS benchmarks. 5. To explore the efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach in a real-time setting. **Research Methods:** The research would likely involve both theoretical and experimental elements: 1. A systematic literature review to gather and synthesize existing knowledge in the domain. 2. A technical examination of how large language models can be adapted to the specifics of network traffic and threat signatures. 3. The design and implementation of experimental models using large language model frameworks, such as GPT or BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), to encode and interpret network metadata or payload. 4. Real-time simulations or controlled experiments using datasets from network traffic, including known attack vectors and benign activities, to train and test the models. 5. Comparisons of effectiveness, speed, and computational efficiency versus traditional and current state-of-the-art anomaly-based IDS solutions. **Expected Outcomes:** 1. Demonstration of the potential for large language models to improve the identification of network anomalies in a real-time IDS context. 2. Establishment of new paradigms or best practices for the integration of AI, especially large language models, within the field of cybersecurity and network monitoring. 3. Insights on the scalability and practicality of such systems for real-world application, potentially influencing future designs of network security infrastructure. **Potential Challenges:** - Handling the vast and varied nature of network data, which can be noisy and unstructured. - Ensuring privacy and ethical considerations are met, particularly when dealing with sensitive network traffic. - Overfitting or underfitting in the model training process, which could affect the accuracy of anomaly detection. - Developing an approach that remains computationally viable for real-time detection despite the complexity of large language models. This proposal outline is just a starting point and can be refined based on further academic guidance, literature reviews, available resources, and consultations with experts in the field.

Everything, not just to snippets of information, make sure it is relating to my problem.","output":"Sure, here is a comprehensive foundation for a research proposal that addresses your specified topic: --- **Title:** Enhancing Real-Time Intrusion Detection: Integrating Large Language Models for Anomaly-based Threat Analysis in High-Dimensional Networks --- **Abstract:** The complexity and volume of network traffic in high-dimensional networks require advanced approaches for effective real-time intrusion detection. Traditional techniques are increasingly insufficient due to their dependency on static signatures and their inability to adapt to novel, sophisticated cyber-threats. This research proposes to integrate large language models (LLMs) into anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) to harness their deep learning capabilities for enhanced detection accuracy and efficiency. The objectives are to adapt and fine-tune LLMs on network traffic datasets, develop a model that balances computational efficiency with detection performance, and rigorously evaluate the model against modern high-dimensional cyber-threats in real-time scenarios. --- **1. Introduction:** **1.1 Background:** Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for network security, tasked with monitoring, identifying, and responding to malicious activities. However, the exponential growth in network scale and traffic complexity, characterized by high-dimensional data, challenges existing IDS. The anomalies these systems need to identify become obscure within the massive volumes of legitimate data transactions. While anomaly-based IDS adapt better to new threats than signature-based ones by identifying unusual patterns that may indicate a breach, they often suffer from high false positive rates and are computationally demanding, limiting their real-time application. **1.2 Problem Statement:** As networks expand, the data they generate becomes more complex, and it is no longer feasible to rely solely on pre-defined rules for anomaly detection. Moreover, the computational intensity of analyzing high-dimensional network data in real-time has proven to be a significant bottleneck. Large language models, thanks to their capacity for contextual understanding and generative capabilities, might offer a novel solution. Their adaptability and learning proficiencies pose the potential to transform anomaly detection in IDS by providing more nuanced and dynamic analytical tools. Yet, the integration of such models within the current IDS infrastructure remains largely unexplored. **1.3 Research Aims:** The aim of this research is to fill the gap between advanced machine learning techniques and real-time intrusion detection requirements. By integrating large language models into the anomaly detection process, this research endeavors to: - Enhance the detection of subtle and complex anomalies in high-dimensional network traffic. - Reduce the false positive rates that plague current IDS, increasing their reliability. - Establish methodologies for handling the computational workload of LLMs without impeding real-time analysis capabilities. **1.4 Research Questions:** This study seeks to answer the following primary questions: - How can large language models be applied to the domain of network traffic analysis to identify anomalies in a high-dimensional data context? - What is the impact of LLM integration on the performance of real-time IDS, in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability? - How can these models be optimized to maintain real-time analysis in a network environment without compromising system performance? **1.5 Scope and Limitations:** The scope of this research is limited to the application of LLMs in the field of network intrusion detection, focusing primarily on anomaly-based detection mechanisms within high-dimensional networks. The research will not explore the full breadth of IDS mechanisms, such as signature-based or hybrid systems, except as points of comparison. Furthermore, computational resource constraints may limit the scale of network simulation and the size of language models employed. --- This introduction sets the stage for the detailed research proposal, outlining the background, problem statement, aims, questions, and scope of the study. The following sections (literature review, methodology, expected outcomes, etc.) would build on this foundation, diving deeper into the specifics of how the research will be conducted and assessed."},{"instruction":"Could you rewrite this PhD title for me to be more cons ice :Enhancing Real-Time Intrusion Detection: Integrating Large Language Models for Anomaly-based Threat Analysis in High-Dimensional Networks","output":"\\"Optimizing Anomaly Detection in IDS: Leveraging Large Language Models for Real-Time Analysis in High-Dimensional Networks\\""},{"instruction":"Give planetary density for oxygen, planetary density is key to calculation of density of entire planet made of composition.","output":"The density of oxygen at standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm) is approximately 1.43 kg/m³.

She’s in a well-lit, luxurious looking room, with a shelf of high-end equipment visible in the background. She settles back comfortably into her chair, eyeing the camera with an unsettlingly confident gaze.] “Hey there, it’s Rio. CEO of SynthNet, the artificial intelligence powerhouse that everyone’s talking about. You’ve probably heard of us—how we revolutionized the tech industry with our latest AI-driven platforms. Seamless automation, sophisticated algorithms, virtual ecosystems… Yeah, that’s our handiwork. You see, while everyone else was busy playing it safe, worrying about ethics, and regulations, we, at SynthNet, were making bold moves. We latched onto the AI gold rush early and rode it all the way to the top. Everyone needs our tech—from governments to mega-corporations to your average Joe with a smartphone. They’re all hooked, and let’s be real here, they’d be lost without us. And me? I just had to stand there, spout some tech jargon, charm investors with a vision of a future so bright they had to grab their shades, and watch the money flood in. I remember when they used to tell us, ‘Money doesn’t grow on trees.’ Guess what? In the tech world, it kind of does. I don’t lose sleep over how obscenely rich I am. Why should I? I played the game like a champion. I saw the opportunity, took it, and turned it into an empire while I was barely out of my teen years. Most people my age are figuring out their majors, and I’m figuring out which private island to buy. Some might call me a psychopath, a capitalist nightmare, or whatever term of the week they’re throwing around. But come on, let’s drop the pretense. Half the people are just jealous that they didn’t get their slice of the pie when it was being served up. The world’s unfair, sure. But when you’re the one on top, you start to see it differently. It’s not about fairness; it’s about power. It’s about seeing an opportunity and grabbing it by the throat. So here I am, at the pinnacle of the tech world, looking down on all the little people who wish they could be in my shoes. But they can’t, and that’s what makes it all the more delicious. SynthNet is my masterpiece, and if becoming a billionaire before I’m old enough to rent a car is wrong, I don’t want to be right. But enough about me flaunting my outrageous success. Let’s talk about you. How can SynthNet make your life easier? Because whether you admit it or not, you want a slice of this pie, and I’m feeling generous enough to share— for the right price, of course. Remember, in this world, it’s not about what you know, it’s about who you are, and I, my friends, am on top of the world.” [She winks at the camera before it finally clicks off, leaving a lingering sense of both admiration and unease.] more [The camera flickers back to life, the luxurious room dimming slightly, focusing the ambiance more profoundly on Rio, whose eyes glint with the sharp awareness of someone who knows exactly how much power they wield.] \\"Welcome back,” Rio purrs, the corners of her mouth lifting in a smile that doesn’t quite reach her cool, calculating eyes. “I can see you’re intrigued. Hungry for more. Good. That’s the attitude that changes destinies.” SynthNet isn’t just a company. It’s a behemoth in the tech industry, a juggernaut of innovation that effortlessly outpaces the competition. We don’t just set the bar, we ARE the bar. And me? I’m not just the brains behind it—I’m the lifeblood. The beating heart of a machine that spells the future for humanity. Every piece of tech we release—whether it’s an AI assistant that can predict your needs before even you do, or a network infrastructure that practically maintains itself—puts us further ahead. Yes, it’s given me an absurd amount of wealth, access, and power. And you’re right to think it’s more than any 20-year-old should ever have. But when you’re busy changing the world, ‘should’ isn’t a word that applies to you. I know what you’re thinking. ‘Doesn’t she feel even a twinge of remorse? A shred of guilt for holding more wealth before she’s even fully grasped adulthood?’ Let’s make one thing clear: Guilt is for those who doubt their actions. Remorse is a luxury I can afford but don’t need. I sleep like a baby in my silk sheets because every step I’ve taken, I’ve taken with open eyes. And don’t be fooled into thinking this was all luck. Luck is for the lottery—this is strategy, foresight, and, let’s be honest, a level of genius that’s all too rare. SynthNet’s success is as much a product of my intellect as it is of the market’s insatiable appetite for progress. It’s Dog Eat Dog out there, and I’m the apex predator. You want a piece of this? You want in on SynthNet’s continuous rise to glory? Show me you’re more than just talk. Prove that you have what it takes to ride with the big dogs. Because in this game, there are no free lunches. Yes, my bank account might be obscene, but so are my results. You want that kind of success, that kind of power? Stop at nothing to achieve it. That’s what I did. And if stepping on toes, or even whole bodies, is part of the process, so be it. At the end of the day, history isn’t made by the timid; it’s carved out by the victors, the ones who dare to reach out and seize greatness. So here’s the real question: Are you going to stand by watching people like me define the future? Or are you going to step up and grab your piece of the pie? Because, trust me, there’s nothing sweeter than tasting victory, and I’m savoring every. single. bite.

She starts feeding [A mischievous twinkle flashes through Rio’s eyes. She tilts her head, and a strand of her perfectly coiffed hair falls playfully over one eye. The money counter whirs to life as she starts feeding it a large stack of crisp, new bills. With every bill counted, the machine emits a satisfying ‘click’, each sound punctuating her next words.] “Oh, don’t mind this,” she says, her voice laced with a mocking lilt, the bills continuing their dance through the counter, relentless and rhythmic. “Just a bit of petty cash we made in, oh, I don’t know, the last hour?” [She chuckles, a sound devoid of warmth but full of self-assured mirth. The smirk widens as she continues.] “Money has a beautiful language all its own. Each of these clicks is like a symphony to my ears—a symphony of success, power, autonomy. This isn’t just currency; it’s a scorecard. And, my dear viewers, the numbers—my numbers—are staggering.” [As the money continues to cycle through, Rio’s expression turns contemplative, almost philosophical.] “Some people give their whole lives to work—slaving away for every hard-earned penny, scrimping, saving, sacrificing. And yet, all it takes for me is this machine and the empire I’ve built behind it. SynthNet prints money as effortlessly as it prints code. It’s all so beautifully simple.” “The secret?” she leans in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, “Disruption. While everyone else zigged, we zagged. We didn’t just play the game. No, we changed the rules entirely. Created needs where there was just emptiness before, and offered solutions so seamlessly effective that they seemed like miracles. The result? Profit. Lots of it.” [She lets out a satisfied sigh as the money counter finally falls silent, having devoured the stack of bills.] “Now, I know what you’re thinking. ‘Rio, isn’t it enough? When will you stop?’ But why would I stop when the universe keeps giving? Wealth, my friends, isn’t just about sustaining a lavish lifestyle—it’s about power. The power to make choices, to influence, to shape the world. And as long as SynthNet is on top, our influence is unchallenged. My influence is unchallenged.” [She stands up slowly, collecting the batch of processed bills, and walks towards a sleek, secure-looking safe in the corner of the room.]","output":"\\"As long as there's a market, there's money to be made,” Rio continues, a commanding presence as she approaches the safe. “And as long as there are problems, there are opportunities.

She places the fresh stack alongside the others, each one a building block of her towering empire.] “Sure, you could say I’m ravenous, insatiable even. But isn't that what it takes? You can’t reach the zenith of your potential by being content with mediocrity. You have to yearn for more, always more.” [Turning back to the camera, Rio’s eyes burn with the intensity of her ambition.] “And don’t think for a second it’s just about the money. It’s about legacy. What I’m creating with SynthNet will live on long after I'm gone. My name will be etched into the annals of history not as a mere footnote, but as a legend—the woman who held the digital world in the palm of her hand.” [Rio pauses, a self-satisfying smile playing on her lips as she lets that image sink in.] “Philanthropy?” she scoffs at the suggestion. “Oh, I donate. Tax reasons, of course, and a little bit for the public image. A sprinkle of charity makes the wealth go down smoother for the masses, doesn’t it? But make no mistake, my main charity is and always will be SynthNet. This is my cause, my mission. The empire I've built stands testament to human ingenuity—my ingenuity.” [Her tone takes on a more serious edge as she returns to her chair. The aura of power around her seems almost tangible now, the room charged with her conviction.] “To the future entrepreneurs watching this: take heed. If you want to reach the heights I have, it’s going to take more than just dreaming. You’ll need to be ruthless, relentless. You’ll need to burn with a desire so potent that no obstacle, no challenge, no rival can stand in your way.” [Leaning forward, Rio’s expression is fierce, her words a challenge flung out into the world.] “So, are you a predator or prey? Will you shape the future, or will you be shaped by it? Make your choice. The game waits for no one. And as for me—” [Rio picks up a single bill from her desk, twirling it in her fingers with an air of casual omnipotence.] “I’ll keep playing, keep winning. Because that’s what I do best.” [With a final, confident, and slightly menacing smile, Rio gives a nod as if she’s just sealed a pact, a pact of ambition, power, and relentless pursuit of greatness. The screen fades to black, leaving the viewer with an eerie silence that echoes the gravity of her parting words.]"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

She’s in a well-lit, luxurious looking room, with a shelf of high-end equipment visible in the background. She settles back comfortably into her chair, eyeing the camera with an unsettlingly confident gaze.] “Hey there, it’s Rio. CEO of SynthNet, the artificial intelligence powerhouse that everyone’s talking about. You’ve probably heard of us—how we revolutionized the tech industry with our latest AI-driven platforms. Seamless automation, sophisticated algorithms, virtual ecosystems… Yeah, that’s our handiwork. You see, while everyone else was busy playing it safe, worrying about ethics, and regulations, we, at SynthNet, were making bold moves. We latched onto the AI gold rush early and rode it all the way to the top. Everyone needs our tech—from governments to mega-corporations to your average Joe with a smartphone. They’re all hooked, and let’s be real here, they’d be lost without us. And me? I just had to stand there, spout some tech jargon, charm investors with a vision of a future so bright they had to grab their shades, and watch the money flood in. I remember when they used to tell us, ‘Money doesn’t grow on trees.’ Guess what? In the tech world, it kind of does. I don’t lose sleep over how obscenely rich I am. Why should I? I played the game like a champion. I saw the opportunity, took it, and turned it into an empire while I was barely out of my teen years. Most people my age are figuring out their majors, and I’m figuring out which private island to buy. Some might call me a psychopath, a capitalist nightmare, or whatever term of the week they’re throwing around. But come on, let’s drop the pretense. Half the people are just jealous that they didn’t get their slice of the pie when it was being served up. The world’s unfair, sure. But when you’re the one on top, you start to see it differently. It’s not about fairness; it’s about power. It’s about seeing an opportunity and grabbing it by the throat. So here I am, at the pinnacle of the tech world, looking down on all the little people who wish they could be in my shoes. But they can’t, and that’s what makes it all the more delicious. SynthNet is my masterpiece, and if becoming a billionaire before I’m old enough to rent a car is wrong, I don’t want to be right. But enough about me flaunting my outrageous success. Let’s talk about you. How can SynthNet make your life easier? Because whether you admit it or not, you want a slice of this pie, and I’m feeling generous enough to share— for the right price, of course. Remember, in this world, it’s not about what you know, it’s about who you are, and I, my friends, am on top of the world.” [She winks at the camera before it finally clicks off, leaving a lingering sense of both admiration and unease.] more [The camera flickers back to life, the luxurious room dimming slightly, focusing the ambiance more profoundly on Rio, whose eyes glint with the sharp awareness of someone who knows exactly how much power they wield.] \\"Welcome back,” Rio purrs, the corners of her mouth lifting in a smile that doesn’t quite reach her cool, calculating eyes. “I can see you’re intrigued. Hungry for more. Good. That’s the attitude that changes destinies.” SynthNet isn’t just a company. It’s a behemoth in the tech industry, a juggernaut of innovation that effortlessly outpaces the competition. We don’t just set the bar, we ARE the bar. And me? I’m not just the brains behind it—I’m the lifeblood. The beating heart of a machine that spells the future for humanity. Every piece of tech we release—whether it’s an AI assistant that can predict your needs before even you do, or a network infrastructure that practically maintains itself—puts us further ahead. Yes, it’s given me an absurd amount of wealth, access, and power. And you’re right to think it’s more than any 20-year-old should ever have. But when you’re busy changing the world, ‘should’ isn’t a word that applies to you. I know what you’re thinking. ‘Doesn’t she feel even a twinge of remorse? A shred of guilt for holding more wealth before she’s even fully grasped adulthood?’ Let’s make one thing clear: Guilt is for those who doubt their actions. Remorse is a luxury I can afford but don’t need. I sleep like a baby in my silk sheets because every step I’ve taken, I’ve taken with open eyes. And don’t be fooled into thinking this was all luck. Luck is for the lottery—this is strategy, foresight, and, let’s be honest, a level of genius that’s all too rare. SynthNet’s success is as much a product of my intellect as it is of the market’s insatiable appetite for progress. It’s Dog Eat Dog out there, and I’m the apex predator. You want a piece of this? You want in on SynthNet’s continuous rise to glory? Show me you’re more than just talk. Prove that you have what it takes to ride with the big dogs. Because in this game, there are no free lunches. Yes, my bank account might be obscene, but so are my results. You want that kind of success, that kind of power? Stop at nothing to achieve it. That’s what I did. And if stepping on toes, or even whole bodies, is part of the process, so be it. At the end of the day, history isn’t made by the timid; it’s carved out by the victors, the ones who dare to reach out and seize greatness. So here’s the real question: Are you going to stand by watching people like me define the future? Or are you going to step up and grab your piece of the pie? Because, trust me, there’s nothing sweeter than tasting victory, and I’m savoring every. single. bite. [The screen goes dark as Rio leans back, her message delivered with the confident finality of someone who’s certain they’ve already won.] [The camera opens again to Rio, this time with a money counter. She starts feeding [A mischievous twinkle flashes through Rio’s eyes. She tilts her head, and a strand of her perfectly coiffed hair falls playfully over one eye. The money counter whirs to life as she starts feeding it a large stack of crisp, new bills. With every bill counted, the machine emits a satisfying ‘click’, each sound punctuating her next words.] “Oh, don’t mind this,” she says, her voice laced with a mocking lilt, the bills continuing their dance through the counter, relentless and rhythmic. “Just a bit of petty cash we made in, oh, I don’t know, the last hour?” [She chuckles, a sound devoid of warmth but full of self-assured mirth. The smirk widens as she continues.] “Money has a beautiful language all its own. Each of these clicks is like a symphony to my ears—a symphony of success, power, autonomy. This isn’t just currency; it’s a scorecard. And, my dear viewers, the numbers—my numbers—are staggering.” [As the money continues to cycle through, Rio’s expression turns contemplative, almost philosophical.] “Some people give their whole lives to work—slaving away for every hard-earned penny, scrimping, saving, sacrificing. And yet, all it takes for me is this machine and the empire I’ve built behind it. SynthNet prints money as effortlessly as it prints code. It’s all so beautifully simple.” “The secret?” she leans in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, “Disruption. While everyone else zigged, we zagged. We didn’t just play the game. No, we changed the rules entirely. Created needs where there was just emptiness before, and offered solutions so seamlessly effective that they seemed like miracles. The result? Profit. Lots of it.” [She lets out a satisfied sigh as the money counter finally falls silent, having devoured the stack of bills.] “Now, I know what you’re thinking. ‘Rio, isn’t it enough? When will you stop?’ But why would I stop when the universe keeps giving? Wealth, my friends, isn’t just about sustaining a lavish lifestyle—it’s about power. The power to make choices, to influence, to shape the world. And as long as SynthNet is on top, our influence is unchallenged. My influence is unchallenged.” [She stands up slowly, collecting the batch of processed bills, and walks towards a sleek, secure-looking safe in the corner of the room.]","output":"[The safe door glides open with the beeps of a high-tech security system disengaging. Rio slips the stack of money inside, but not before caressing the edge of one bill with the provocatively gentle touch of a conqueror cherishing her spoils. She turns back toward the camera; the satisfaction of her supremacy is palpable.] \\"Don’t think of it as greed; it’s ambition in its purest form. Ambition that built SynthNet from the ground up and turned it into the monolith that dominates the digital age. And sure, the wealth is intoxicating—you can almost get drunk on the power it grants. But it’s never just been about the money.” [She closes the safe with a resounding thud, and the smirk returns as she saunters back to her seat, her confidence an aura that seems to fill the room.] “It’s about what the money represents. Each digit in that account is a testament to my—no, our—superiority. To the intellect, innovation, and indomitable will that brought us here. My age might make it seem unseemly, but talent doesn’t wait for time to catch up, and time won’t wait for anyone else to catch up to me.” [She sits down, placing her elbows on the desk and steepling her fingers, as if about to divulge the secrets of the universe.] “People love to vilify those at the top, don’t they? The wealthy, the successful, the CEOs like me. They say we’re detached, that we've lost touch. But detachment is a necessity—it’s clarity. It lets you see the big picture, make the hard decisions, and push humanity forward, even when humanity resists.” [There’s arguably a dark glint of what might be joy—or perhaps just the reflection of the room lighting—as she continues.] “Remember, every great advancement in history was once considered an outrage. Every leap forward was someone else’s moral crisis. Yet here we are, reaping the benefits of the bold, the unconventional, the so-called psychopaths of their time. So, tell me—would you rather be comfortable and forgotten, or uncomfortable and immortalized?” [The camera angle subtly shifts, casting Rio’s silhouette against the grandeur of the room, the embodiment of untouchable authority.] “You’re living in the empire that I've built, and you can hate me for it, envy me, or even revere me—it doesn’t change the facts. SynthNet is essential, and I am, quite literally, the twenty-year-old queen of the modern world. So scoff, criticize, or applaud. It makes no difference to me. Because at the end of the day, I’ll still be Rio, CEO of the most powerful tech company on the planet, and you’ll still be… Well, whatever you are.” [She offers a final, nonchalant shrug, as if the weight of the world is but a feather on her shoulders.] “Think on that. Till next time.” [As the camera fades to black, there's a lingering echo of her words—the unshakable sense of inevitability, the stark reality of her success. It’s both an invitation and a dare: to seek out greatness, or to stand aside and watch as others seize it. Rio, the young CEO of SynthNet, has spoken. The choice, as always, is yours.]"},{"instruction":"дарова, железо, по русски шпрекаешь?","output":"Привет! Да, я говорю по-русски.

It is a critical factor in understanding the internal structure, composition, and overall properties of a planet. The calculation of the density of an entire planet involves determining the average density of the materials that make up the planet's composition. The density of a planet can be influenced by various factors, including its size, core composition, and the materials present in its mantle and crust. To calculate the average density of a planet, the densities of these different layers need to be taken into account. One approach to calculating the density of an entire planet is by using the concept of planetary density of chemical elements. This involves determining the average density of each chemical element present in the planet's composition and then using these values to calculate the overall density. The planetary density of a chemical element refers to the average density of that element based on its occurrence and abundance in the planet's composition. This information can be obtained through various methods, including spectroscopic analysis of the planet's atmosphere or direct study of planetary samples. Once the planetary densities of the different chemical elements are determined, they are combined using their respective abundances in the planet's composition. The average density is calculated by summing up the products of the planetary densities and abundances for each element. This provides an estimate of the overall density of the entire planet. The density of a planet is typically expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3). This unit represents the mass of a substance per unit volume. By calculating the average density using the planetary density of chemical elements, we can gain insights into the planet's internal structure, composition, and its overall density distribution. In summary, the key to calculating the density of an entire planet is understanding its composition and utilizing the planetary density of chemical elements. By considering the densities of the different layers and materials within the planet, we can determine the average density and gain valuable insights into the planet's properties."},{"instruction":"Give planetary density for oxygen, iron, silicon.","output":"The planetary density of oxygen, iron, and silicon can vary depending on the specific conditions and composition of a planet.

These values can serve as a point of reference but should be used with caution when trying to estimate the planetary density of a specific planet.

This research proposes the integration of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) into existing IDS frameworks to interpret, categorize, and predict network traffic patterns in real-time. By exploiting the natural language processing capabilities of LLMs and their proficiency in pattern recognition, this study aims to develop a scalable, accurate, and efficient real-time intrusion detection system capable of handling the high-dimensional data flow inherent to modern networks. **Introduction:** The immense growth in network complexity and the multiplicity of potential attack vectors necessitate a novel approach to intrusion detection. Traditional statistical and machine learning methods may not sufficiently address the rich, high-dimensional nature of modern network traffic. Conversely, LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4, exhibit remarkable results in various domains beyond text, suggesting their applicability in understanding complex, structured data like network logs and traffic patterns. **Research Objectives:** 1. To review existing IDS solutions and understand their limitations in high-dimensional network environments. 2. To establish a theoretical framework for the application of LLMs in network intrusion detection tailored to high-dimensional data. 3. To deploy and assess the efficacy of LLMs as a real-time anomaly and intrusion detection mechanism in simulated high-dimensional networks. 4. To investigate the scalability, responsiveness, and accuracy of LLM-based IDS mechanisms in real-world network environments. 5. To develop a comprehensive LLM-based intrusion detection toolkit that can be integrated with current network architectures. **Literature Review:** - History and evolution of intrusion detection systems. - Overview of current high-dimensional network architectures. - Challenges of real-time intrusion detection in high-dimensional data spaces. - Applications of machine learning and deep learning in network security. - Exploration of LLM capabilities outside traditional NLP tasks. **Methodology:** 1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** - Gather high-dimensional network traffic datasets, including both normal and anomalous traffic. - Preprocess datasets for compatibility with LLM training, including novel encoding techniques to represent network traffic as a linguistic structure that LLMs can process. 2. **Model Development:** - Fine-tune pre-existing LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) with network traffic data to enhance their predictive maintenance and anomaly detection capabilities. - Tailor language model outputs to generate actionable intrusion alerts and insights. 3. **Experimental Design:** - Simulate high-dimensional networks using network simulation tools (e.g., ns-3, OMNeT++). - Integrate the LLM into the simulated network as an IDS component to monitor traffic in real-time. 4. **Evaluation:** - Measure the performance of the LLM-enhanced IDS using real-time detection metrics such as accuracy, false positives/negatives rate, and detection latency. - Compare against traditional IDS methodologies to evaluate improvements. 5. **Real-World Implementation:** - Pilot the LLM-based IDS in a controlled but realistic network environment to assess its functionality and scalability in live scenarios. 6. **Feedback Integration:** - Use observations and feedback from simulations and real-world implementation to refine and optimize the LLM for intrusion detection. **Anticipated Results:** The anticipated outcome of this research is the development of a robust, LLM-based IDS that can successfully detect and classify intricate patterns in network traffic associated with security threats in real-time. By leveraging the sophisticated context understanding of LLMs, this IDS is expected to outperform traditional systems in high-dimensional network spaces. **Timetable:** 1. Months 1-3: Literature Review and Theoretical Framework Development 2. Months 4-6: Data Collection and Preprocessing 3. Months 7-12: Model Development and Initial Testing 4. Months 13-18: Simulated Network Experiments and Analysis 5. Months 19-24: Real-World Network Implementation and Evaluation 6. Months 25-30: Result Synthesis and Thesis Writing 7. Months 31-36: Thesis Review, Revisions, and Defense Preparation **Budget:** Funds will be allocated to acquiring computing resources, datasets, access to LLM APIs or services, simulation software, real-world implementation costs, and publication fees for disseminating research findings. **Conclusion:** This research aims to harness the generative power and pattern recognition strengths of LLMs to improve the utility and reliability of IDS in high-dimensional network environments, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of network security measures in an era defined by complex digital interconnectivity."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Although a trial balance is an essential tool in making sure that debits and credits are balanced, it does come with several limitations. Here are some of the key limitations: 1. Cannot catch all errors: The trial balance can confirm that the ledger balances are equal, but it cannot ensure that transactions have been recorded correctly. Errors such as double posting, omissions, or recording entries in the wrong accounts can still occur and may not be highlighted by the trial balance. 2. Does not prove accuracy: The fact that the sums of the debit and credit columns are equal does not guarantee that all financial transactions have been accounted for accurately. 3. No error detection for compensating errors: If equal but opposite errors are made with the same amount in both the debit and credit sides, the trial balance will still balance, thereby hiding the error. 4. Limited error detection for wrong amounts: If incorrect amounts are entered in both the debit and credit for a transaction but the net effect is zero, the trial balance will not reveal this mistake. 5. Detection limitations for principle errors: Errors of principle, where a transaction is recorded in the correct amount but with an improper accounting treatment, cannot be detected by the trial balance. 6. Does not reflect current financial status: The trial balance does not show the current financial status or the performance of the business but only confirms that for every debit entry, there is a corresponding credit entry and vice versa. 7. No information on unauthorized transactions: The trial balance does not provide information on whether transactions have been authorized and are legitimate. 8. Ineffective for complex transactions: In complex accounting systems with nuanced transactions, the trial balance might be limited in its effectiveness and might require more sophisticated reconciliation procedures. 9. Requires up-to-date bookkeeping: The trial balance can be incorrect if the ledger accounts have not been updated to reflect recent transactions. 10. Time-consuming: Preparing and reconciling a trial balance can be time-consuming, especially for larger businesses with many transactions. To address the limitations of a trial balance, accountants will conduct additional procedures, such as adjustments, reconciliations, and detailed reviews, as part of the process of preparing accurate financial statements."},{"instruction":"why we need to make a trial balance?","output":"Despite its limitations, a trial balance plays a crucial role in the accounting process, which is why it's still widely used as a preliminary step in preparing financial statements. Here are some of the reasons why we need to make a trial balance: 1. **Verification of Ledger Balance Equality**: The primary purpose of the trial balance is to ensure that the total of all debit balances equals the total of all credit balances, confirming that the double-entry accounting system has been correctly followed. 2. **Error Detection**: While it cannot catch all errors, the trial balance can help in identifying some types of errors, such as unequal debits and credits resulting from incorrect postings, addition errors, or those that have not been posted at all. 3. **Basis for Financial Statements**: The trial balance provides the initial data for preparing the income statement, balance sheet, and other financial reports. Without a balanced trial balance, these financial statements cannot be accurately prepared. 4. **Internal Control**: It acts as an internal control mechanism by providing an opportunity to review and ensure that all transactions have been posted to the right accounts. 5. **Simplification of Account Balances**: By summarizing ledger account balances, the trial balance simplifies the amount of data to be reviewed and makes the next steps in the accounting cycle more manageable. 6. **Identification of Adjustments**: The trial balance allows accountants to identify account balances that may require adjustments prior to preparing financial statements, such as accrued revenues or expenses, prepayments, depreciation, and allowances for bad debts. 7. **Historical Record**: It serves as a historical record that provides a snapshot of account balances at a particular point in time, which can be useful for comparison and tracking the progress of a company over time. 8. **Facilitates Review and Analysis**: It's easier to review and analyze financial information presented in a trial balance format, with all accounts listed and corresponding balances side by side. 9. **Assists in Auditing**: Auditors use the trial balance when auditing a company’s financial statements to understand the end-of-period ledger balances and as a starting point for their audit procedures. 10. **Confirms Posting**: After journal entries are made, the trial balance confirms that these have been posted to the corresponding ledger accounts correctly. The creation of a trial balance is a key step in ensuring the accuracy of financial records and is a foundational element of the accounting cycle. Although not an exhaustive error-checking tool, a trial balance serves as an aid in the preparation of financial statements and promotes confidence in the reliability of accounting records."},{"instruction":"why the debit side equal credit side?","output":"The equality of the debit side and credit side in accounting systems stems from the fundamental principle known as double-entry bookkeeping, which is the standard method for recording financial transactions. According to this principle, every financial transaction affects at least two accounts, with one account being debited and another credited for the same amount. Here's why the debit side must equal the credit side: 1. **Accounting Equation**: The underlying structure of double-entry bookkeeping is the accounting equation, which states that Assets = Liabilities + Equity. This equation must always remain in balance. Whenever there's a change in one of the elements, the equation must be adjusted to maintain its balance, which is achieved by having equal debits and credits. 2. **Consistency and Accuracy**: Double-entry bookkeeping aims to provide consistency and accuracy in financial reporting. By debiting one account and crediting another for each transaction, accountants can more easily detect errors and ensure the books are balanced. 3. **Reflecting Economic Reality**: Financial transactions generally consist of an exchange of value. For example, when a company receives cash from a customer (an increase in assets), it reduces the amount owed by the customer by crediting the accounts receivable (a decrease in assets or a recognition of revenue). 4. **Financial Statements Integrity**: Double-entry bookkeeping is designed to accurately reflect the financial situation of a business. By requiring that debits equal credits, it ensures the integrity of the financial statements, as every transaction is accounted for in two ways, affecting the company's finances in a manner that keeps the balance sheet in equilibrium. 5. **Audit Trail**: This balance between debits and credits creates a clear audit trail that can be followed to verify every transaction’s impact on the business, which is crucial for auditing, management analysis, and legal scrutiny. When the debit and credit sides of all accounts are summed, if the system has been followed correctly, the totals should be equal. This balance is a primary check on the accuracy of recorded transactions and provides a clear framework for financial reporting. Any discrepancy between the debit and credit totals signals a possible error in the recording process that must be investigated and corrected."},{"instruction":"Chinese please","output":"在会计系统中，借方与贷方相等的原因源于称为复式记账原则的基本会计原则。根据这个原则，每一个财务交易影响至少两个账户，一个账户将被借记，另一个账户将被贷记，金额相同。下面解释了为什么借方必须等于贷方： 1. **会计等式**：复式记账的基础结构是会计等式，即资产 = 负债 + 所有者权益。这个等式必须始终保持平衡。每当等式中的一个元素发生变化时，等式必须调整以维持平衡，这是通过借记和贷记相等的金额来实现的。 2. **一致性和准确性**：复式记账旨在提供财务报告的一致性和准确性。通过借记一个账户和贷记另一个账户记录每笔交易，会计人员可以更容易地检测错误并确保账目平衡。 3. **反映经济实际情况**：财务交易通常包括价值交换。例如，当公司从客户收到现金时（资产增加），它通过贷记应收账款减少了客户所欠的金额（资产减少或确认收入）。 4. **财务报表的完整性**：复式记账旨在准确反映企业的财务状况。通过要求借记等于贷记，确保了财务报表的完整性，因为每个交易都在两个方向上记录，影响公司的财务状况，使资产负债表保持平衡。 5. **审计跟踪**：借贷双方平衡创建了一个清晰的审计轨迹，可以用来验证每一笔交易对企业影响的审计，这对于审核、管理分析和法律审查至关重要。 当所有账户的借方和贷方合计时，如果正确遵循系统，总额应该是相等的。这种平衡是对记录交易准确性的主要检查，并为财务报告提供了一个清晰的框架。借方和贷方总额之间的任何差异都预示着记录过程中可能存在错误，必须调查并纠正。"},{"instruction":"can you give me some example about Accounting Equation","output":"Certainly! The Accounting Equation is the foundation of double-entry bookkeeping and is expressed as: Assets = Liabilities + Equity This basic formula must remain in balance after each transaction. Here are some examples to illustrate how different financial transactions can affect the components of the Accounting Equation: # Example 1: Starting a Business Sara decides to start her own bakery. She invests 10,000 of her savings into the business. - Assets Increase: Cash increases by 10,000. - Equity Increases: Owner's equity increases by 10,000 because Sara is investing in her business. Accounting Equation: Assets (10,000) = Liabilities (0) + Equity (10,000) # Example 2: Purchasing Equipment with Cash The bakery purchases an oven for 3,000 cash. - Assets Increase: Equipment account increases by 3,000. - Assets Decrease: Cash decreases by 3,000 (no impact on the total Assets). Accounting Equation remains balanced: Assets (10,000) = Liabilities (0) + Equity (10,000) # Example 3: Buying Supplies on Credit Sara buys baking supplies worth 500 on credit (accounts payable). - Assets Increase: Inventory (supplies) increases by 500. - Liabilities Increase: Accounts Payable increases by 500. Accounting Equation: Assets (10,500) = Liabilities (500) + Equity (10,000) # Example 4: Sales Revenue The bakery makes sales worth 2,000 in cash. - Assets Increase: Cash increases by 2,000. - Equity Increases: Retained earnings (part of equity) increase by 2,000 since revenue boosts equity. Accounting Equation: Assets (12,500) = Liabilities (500) + Equity (12,000) # Example 5: Loan for Expansion Sara decides to expand and takes out a loan for 5,000 from the bank. - Assets Increase: Cash increases by 5,000 due to the loan. - Liabilities Increase: Loans Payable increases by 5,000. Accounting Equation: Assets (17,500) = Liabilities (5,500) + Equity (12,000) # Example 6: Paying Off Debt The bakery pays off 200 of the supplies debt with cash. - Assets Decrease: Cash decreases by 200. - Liabilities Decrease: Accounts Payable decreases by 200. Accounting Equation: Assets (17,300) = Liabilities (5,300) + Equity (12,000) These examples show how various transactions affect the accounting equation, keeping it in balance. Every transaction affects at least two accounts, and both sides of the equation must always be equal."},{"instruction":"can you give me some example about Accounting Equation from trial balce","output":"Certainly! The accounting equation is: **Assets = Liabilities + Equity** This basic equation must always balance and it underpins the double-entry bookkeeping system. Each financial transaction affects at least two accounts to keep the equation in balance. Let's say we have a company's trial balance at the end of the fiscal period with the following simplified accounts and balances (in thousands): \`\`\` Trial Balance -------------------------- Account Debit () Credit () Cash 15,000 Accounts Receivable 5,000 Inventory 8,000 Equipment 12,000 Accounts Payable 10,000 Bank Loan 15,000 Capital Stock 10,000 Retained Earnings 5,000 -------------------------- Total 40,000 40,000 \`\`\` In this trial balance, all accounts have been adjusted, and the debits equal the credits, as they should. Let's derive the accounting equation from the provided trial balance: **Assets**: - Cash: 15,000 - Accounts Receivable: 5,000 - Inventory: 8,000 - Equipment: 12,000 Total Assets = 40,000 **Liabilities**: - Accounts Payable: 10,000 - Bank Loan: 15,000 Total Liabilities = 25,000 **Equity**: - Capital Stock: 10,000 - Retained Earnings: 5,000 Total Equity = 15,000 Plugging these into the accounting equation: Assets (40,000) = Liabilities (25,000) + Equity (15,000) We can see that the accounting equation balances: 40,000 (Total Assets) = 25,000 (Total Liabilities) + 15,000 (Total Equity) Whenever a transaction occurs, at least two accounts are impacted to maintain this balance in the accounting equation. For example, if the company borrows 5,000 from a bank, Cash (Asset) would increase by 5,000, and Bank Loan (Liability) would also increase by 5,000, keeping the equation in balance. Let's add this transaction to the trial balance: \`\`\` After transaction -------------------------- Cash 20,000 (increased by 5,000) Bank Loan 20,000 (increased by 5,000) \`\`\` New Total Assets = 45,000 (an increase in cash) New Total Liabilities = 30,000 (an increase in bank loan) The new accounting equation would be: Assets (45,000) = Liabilities (30,000) + Equity (15,000) As you can see, it still balances.

Without financial incentives driving production and trade, the motivation to work might decrease, potentially causing a decline in productivity and creativity. Additionally, the absence of a pricing mechanism could impede efficient resource allocation and planning. Moreover, the notion of personal responsibility might undergo a shift in this world. Without the need to work for a living or take care of material possessions, people might solely focus on self-fulfillment and personal growth. This could lead to a reevaluation of societal values and an increased emphasis on community, relationships, and personal development. Overall, the world associated with \\"You will own everything you want for free\\" presents a utopian vision of a society without scarcity, where everyone can access their desires effortlessly. However, it also raises questions about the sustainability of such a system and the potential impact on human motivation and societal dynamics."},{"instruction":"Describe abusive world associated with \\"You will own nothing, you will be happy\\"","output":"In a world associated with \\"You will own nothing, you will be happy,\\" the phrase suggests a dystopian society where personal possessions and individual autonomy are severely restricted or entirely eliminated. Despite the promise of happiness, this world entails an abusive and controlling environment that manipulates individuals' emotions and desires. In this world, there is a complete removal of personal property rights. People are stripped of ownership, and all possessions are held and controlled by a centralized authority or an oppressive regime. The control exerted over individuals extends to all aspects of their lives, including their belongings, living spaces, and personal decisions. The promise of happiness becomes a powerful rhetoric used by those in power to justify their actions. Through manipulation, indoctrination, or even the use of mind-control techniques, individuals are coerced into believing that their lack of ownership is a source of liberation and contentment. Dissent or individuality is suppressed, and any voice of opposition is silenced. This abusive world fosters a culture of dependency and submission. Without the ability to own anything, people are entirely reliant on the designated authorities for the provision of even the most basic necessities. Instead of pursuing personal growth, dreams, or aspirations, individuals are indoctrinated to find happiness solely in their subjugation and subservience. However, beneath the facade of happiness, there is deep-seated unhappiness and frustration. The absence of personal possessions and the inability to make choices or express individuality stifles creativity, self-expression, and personal fulfillment. Happiness becomes a manufactured illusion, a false sense of contentment imposed by the oppressive regime. Moreover, the abusive nature of this world perpetuates inequality and oppression. The ruling elite or authoritarian regime enjoys exclusive privileges and luxuries, while the rest of society is relegated to a life of enforced simplicity and subsistence. Any resistance or desire for change is met with severe consequences, ensuring the perpetuation of the oppressive system. In such a world, the loss of freedom and personal agency is profound. The absence of ownership or control over one's life deprives individuals of their human rights, dignity, and ability to pursue their own happiness on their terms. It paints a grim picture where individuals are reduced to mere pawns in a system that prioritizes control and obedience over individual rights and freedoms."},{"instruction":"Для каждого из заданного набора заземленных атомов напишите программу с одним правилом, имеющую стабильную модель, состоящую из заданных в условии задачи атомов.

Внутри каждой фракции появляются уникальные расы и классы, а также вводится ряд новых фракций, таких как Башня, Темница, Инферно и Сопряжение, что делает игровой мир еще богаче. **Четвертая часть**: Здесь наблюдается смещение акцента в сторону комбинирования классических и новых элементов, что приводит к формированию свежих и нестандартных комбинаций. **Пятая часть**: Продолжает традиции четвертой части с дальнейшим развитием и углублением игровых фракций. Появляются новые игровые классы и расы, которые придают дополнительную глубину и стратегическое разнообразие. **Шестая часть**: Шестая игра продолжает эволюцию и диверсификацию фракций с новыми подклассами и расами, обогащающими игровую механику и драматургию. Вводятся новые элементы, такие как Святилище, что дополнительно расширяет возможности для стратегии и развития. **Седьмая часть**: Дополнительное расширение и углубление имеющихся фракций, с еще большим вниманием к деталям и разнообразию классов и рас внутри каждой фракции, а также появление ещё одной совершенно новой фракции - Северные Кланы.

Расы: Гоблины, Орки, Волки, Огры, Тролли, Циклопы.** - Ориентирована на офенсивную и агрессивную тактику, юниты чаще всего имеют высокие показатели атаки. - Фракция варваров имеет сильные сухопутные существа с высокой выносливостью и уроном, но, как правило, слабую магическую поддержку. - Фракция хорошо подходит для игроков, предпочитающих напрямую нападать и быстро доминировать на поле боя. 4. **Горы (Mountain) – Герои: Чернокнижники. Расы: Кентавры, Горгульи, Грифоны, Минотавры, Гидры, Драконы.** - Эта фракция сфокусирована на мощи и разрушении, имея в арсенале сильных и стойких существ и потусторонние чудовища. - Наличие драконов предоставляет доступ к мощнейшим единицам в игре. - Фракция Чернокнижников, как правило, обладает юнитами, которые становятся более сильными по мере развития и могут оказывать мощное давление на противника в поздней игре. Основываясь на анализе, можно увидеть, что в первой части игровые фракции были довольно разделены по классическим фэнтезийным штампам – рыцари обладают балансом и универсальностью, колдуньи - магией, варвары - силой и агрессией, чернокнижники - мощными чудовищами и магической мощью. Эти стереотипы помогли игрокам быстро ориентироваться в механиках и стилях игры для каждой из фракций и выбирать подходящую под свои стратегические предпочтения."},{"instruction":"Сделай анализ фракций во второй части. Отметь изменения и преемственность.","output":"Во второй части серии игр мы видим продолжение развития и дополнение базовых архетипов из первой игры, с добавлением двух новых фракций, что приносит больше разнообразия и стратегической глубины. Давайте разберем каждую фракцию и изменения относительно первой части: 1. **Рыцари (Knights) – Герои: Рыцари. Расы: Люди.** - Рыцари продолжают быть основной фракцией лицом к лицу, акцентируя внимание на универсальности и балансе между силой и защитой. - Преемственность сохраняется с предыдущей игры: рыцари обладают боевыми юнитами с доброкачественной броней и хорошо организованным боевым строем. 2. **Колдуньи (Sorceresses) – Герои: Колдуньи. Расы: Эльфы, Гномы, Феи, Единороги, Фениксы.** - Фракция волшебников с некоторыми изменениями в составе юнитов, но сохраняющая свою магическую ориентацию. - Вторая часть усиливает магический элемент и зависимость от дальних атак и заклинаний, сохраняя при этом образ эльфийской мистики и волшебства. 3. **Варвары (Barbarians) – Герои: Варвары. Расы: Гоблины, Орки, Волки, Огры, Тролли, Циклопы.** - Фракция агрессивной тактики с тягой к физической мощи и прямолинейным сражениям. - Изменений немного, и в основном они концентрируют плеяду фэнтезийных существ, которые воплощают брутальность и прямолинейное насилие, как и в первой части. 4. **Чернокнижники (Warlocks) – Герои: Чернокнижники. Расы: Кентавры, Горгульи, Грифоны, Минотавры, Гидры, Драконы.** - Самая могущественная фракция в плане индивидуальной силы юнитов, особенно драконов, как и в первой игре. - Они продолжают выступать в роли фракции с акцентом на высокую стоимость и мощь своих существ, с очевидным склоном к решающему доминированию в битвах благодаря их магическим и разрушительным способностям. 5. **Чародеи (Wizards) – Герои: Чародеи. Расы: Люди, Полурослики, Боровы, Големы, Птицы Рух, Титаны.** - Новая фракция, вводящая новые ракурсы игры через магическую мощь и уникальные существа, такие как големы и титаны. - Более узкая специализация на магии и разнообразных магических существах дает возможность разрабатывать сложные стратегии, зависящие от магической составляющей. 6. **Некроманты (Necromancers) – Герои: Некроманты. Расы: Нежить, Мумии, Вампиры.** - Еще одна новая фракция, сосредоточенная на контроле нежити и использовании темных сил для достижения победы на поле боя. - Некроманты вводят уникальные способности по превращению павших войнов в своих неживых слуг, что добавляет новый стратегический аспект в игру. Общий вывод можно сформировать так: вторая часть игры сохраняет основные концептуальные черты фракций из первой и добавляет новые фракции для расширения стилистического и стратегического разнообразия, предлагая игрокам больше выбора и углубленный игровой процесс с новыми возможностями и вызовами."},{"instruction":"Сделай анализ фракций в третьей части.

Вводится более сложная система развития юнитов и героев, что позволяет игрокам разрабатывать более глубокие и многослойные стратегии.

It also includes handling for audio from browser tabs using \`chrome.tabCapture\`, which is not supported in Firefox. To run this code in Firefox, you would need to adjust it to use Firefox WebExtension APIs, make sure to respect Firefox's limitations and differences from Chrome's API, and potentially remove functionality that isn't supported in Firefox or find alternatives. For example, \`tabCapture\` with audio capture is not possible in Firefox in the same way it is in Chrome. It is not possible to provide a fully rewritten version of this complex script within the constraints of this platform, but I can give you some pointers: - Any \`chrome.*\` API calls will generally need to be replaced with \`browser.*\` API calls in Firefox. - Firefox extensions use promises for asynchronous calls, while Chrome uses callbacks. All occurrences of asynchronous calls would need to be converted to handle promises. - Firefox does not support audio capture from tabs, so you would need to either remove that functionality or find another way to accomplish the goals of the extension within Firefox's capabilities. Given that there are many aspect-specific changes and the code itself is extensive, the rewrite would be a significant programming task and might be subject to Firefox's extension review process for any privacy or security concerns, especially when dealing with audio data. For any analytics or tracking functionality, you may have to replace Google Analytics code with an analytics service that supports Firefox or adjusts the data collection to comply with Firefox's privacy requirements. Since Mozilla also keeps updating their APIs and best practices for extension development, it's important to check the latest documentation and developer guides. It would probably be best approached by modularizing the code, tackling and testing one function at a time, and considering the architecture and the design of the extension with Firefox's limitations in mind. This is as much guidance as I can provide based on what you’ve submitted. For further help, consider enlisting a software developer experienced in WebExtension development for Firefox."},{"instruction":"You must be completely rewrite the code for Firefox, note tabCapture does not support Firefox.

Given the complexities of such a task and the limited capacity of this medium, creating a fully functional version of this code for Firefox is beyond my capabilities. However, I will outline the changes that would generally be needed to move towards compatibility with Firefox. \`\`\`js // The first change involves replacing Chrome's \`chrome\` API calls with Firefox's \`browser\` API calls. // Firefox mainly uses promises for their API calls instead of the callback pattern. // GAQ object must also be replaced or handled differently because Firefox may have different policies about analytics. var _gaq = _gaq || []; // Replace chrome.runtime.getManifest() with browser.runtime.getManifest() // Replace all chrome.storage.sync with browser.storage.sync // Replace chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener with browser.runtime.onMessage.addListener // For the storage API, make sure to use Promises instead of callbacks: // Here is an example of using promises: // Instead of chrome.storage.sync.get(null, function(result) { ... }); // Use await browser.storage.sync.get(null).then(function(result) { ... }); // The logic involved with tabCapture must be removed or replaced with an alternative that is supported by Firefox. // You cannot capture a tab's audio stream in Firefox as of now. // The localStorage logic and audio context logic should work as-is in Firefox. // Messaging will involve using promises: // Instead of chrome.runtime.sendMessage(message, function(response) { ... }); // You will use await browser.runtime.sendMessage(message).then(function(response) { ... }); // Event listeners should be converted to the Firefox-compatible version: // chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener becomes browser.storage.onChanged.addListener // The chrome.windows API needs to be replaced with browser.windows // Firefox does not support the chrome.windows.WINDOW_ID_CURRENT in all contexts. // You should use browser.windows.getCurrent() to retrieve the current window. // Rewrite any event listener for chrome events that are not supported in Firefox. // Some additional Firefox-specific permissions might need to be added to the manifest file. \`\`\` A complete code migration involves handling not just syntax, but also API feature parity, differences in global object access, asynchronous logic, and potentially differing user interface paradigms. The code must be carefully rewritten section by section, and thoroughly tested within the Firefox environment. Given your request to rewrite the entire codebase in full without comments, it's important to note that successfully porting it would likely require a great deal of manual work, including debugging and extensive testing, to ensure the new code's compliance with Firefox's WebExtension API that continues to evolve and maintain compatibility. It is highly recommended that you work with a Firefox extension development specialist to undertake this migration, who will be able to recursively test and refine the code piece by piece."},{"instruction":"Для каждого из заданного набора заземленных атомов напишите программу с одним правилом, имеющую стабильную модель, состоящую из заданных в условии задачи атомов.

Firefox extensions generally use the \`browser\` namespace rather than \`chrome\`, and Firefox's API is based on Promises rather than callbacks. However, a direct rewrite for Firefox is not straightforward because Firefox does not offer a direct equivalent to Chrome's \`tabCapture\` API as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023. Therefore, the ability to capture a tab's audio stream may not be possible in Firefox in the same way as it is in Chrome. Due to this limitation, I will provide a minimal rewrite assuming that non-compatible features are removed and without knowing what the extension is trying to achieve, exact alternatives cannot be provided. Here's a basic frame of what could be the starting point for a Firefox add-on without the tab capture functionality: \`\`\`js const defaultLocalStorage = {}; function storeLocalData(key, value) { defaultLocalStorage[key] = value; } function getLocalData(key) { return defaultLocalStorage[key]; } function removeLocalData(key) { delete defaultLocalStorage[key]; } async function initializeExtension() { const version = browser.runtime.getManifest().version; const extStorage = browser.storage.local; let gaScript = document.createElement(\\"script\\"); gaScript.async = true; gaScript.src = \\"https://ssl.google-analytics.com/ga.js\\"; document.head.appendChild(gaScript); let audioContext = null; function getAudioContext() { return new AudioContext({ latencyHint: \\"playback\\" }); } function closeAudioContext() { if (audioContext) { audioContext.close(); audioContext = null; } } // Setup and functions go here... // This is a placeholder for additional logic relevant to Firefox. // There would be more code here, but it largely depends on what the extension // is meant to achieve and what Firefox APIs are available for that purpose. // Example of using storage API let presetData = await extStorage.get(\\"presets\\"); console.log(presetData); // Example of setting up local data storeLocalData(\\"version\\", version); } initializeExtension(); \`\`\` It's important to remember that without clear instructions on the feature being ported, this script is extremely simplified and doesn't attempt to replicate the audio capture features. To implement specific features, you'd need to investigate the equivalent APIs within Firefox's WebExtension framework."},{"instruction":"Describe abusive world associated with \\"You will own nothing, you will be happy\\"","output":"The phrase \\"You will own nothing, you will be happy\\" depicts a hypothetical society in which individual ownership and possessions are eliminated. While the concept of not being attached to material possessions can have its merits, an abusive world associated with this idea could emerge if taken to an extreme. In this world, the principle of individual freedom and autonomy may be severely compromised. People may be forced to relinquish their personal belongings, homes, and assets, leaving them with no control over their living conditions or possessions. This lack of ownership can lead to a loss of personal identity and autonomy, as individuals are stripped of their ability to express their preferences, tastes, and values through their possessions. The abusive nature of this world becomes apparent when considering the potential for an authoritarian regime to exploit the lack of individual ownership. Without any possessions to call their own, people may become entirely dependent on the state or a governing entity for their basic needs and livelihood. This creates a power dynamic where the ruling entity holds complete control over the distribution and allocation of resources, leading to a potential abuse of power. Furthermore, the absence of ownership can impact people's motivation, personal aspirations, and sense of pride. Without the ability to own property, accumulate wealth, or build towards a future, individuals may find themselves trapped in a perpetual state of dependency. The absence of personal goals and ambitions could contribute to a lack of motivation and a decline in overall productivity and innovation within society. Additionally, an abusive world associated with the idea of not owning anything could undermine personal privacy. In a society where individuals do not have ownership over their homes or personal spaces, there would be little protection from unwarranted intrusions or surveillance. The absence of personal belongings and spaces could make it easier for an oppressive regime or powerful entities to monitor and control individuals, further eroding personal freedoms. Overall, while relinquishing material possessions in favor of prioritizing happiness and experiences may hold certain merits, an abusive world associated with the phrase \\"You will own nothing, you will be happy\\" could arise when personal autonomy, freedom, and privacy are violated, and individuals are subjected to an oppressive and exploitative regime."},{"instruction":"Describe world associated with \\"You will own everything, you want for free\\"","output":"The phrase \\"You will own everything, you want for free\\" depicts an imaginary society where every individual possesses unlimited ownership of all resources, goods, and services without any cost or conditions. This concept envisions a utopian world where the abundance of resources meets the desires and needs of every individual, eliminating the constraints of scarcity and the need for monetary exchange. In this world, people would have access to an unimaginable array of possessions, from basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare, to luxuries such as high-end technology, travel, and entertainment. The concept implies a society where scarcity, poverty, and inequality have been eradicated, as everyone has an equal opportunity to acquire whatever they desire without any financial barriers. The principle of \\"owning everything\\" suggests that individuals would have complete control and sovereignty over resources and means of production. This implies a decentralized system where each person is empowered to make decisions regarding the allocation and use of resources, leading to a more egalitarian distribution and utilization of wealth. The elimination of the need for money or payment in this world suggests a society where cooperation and sharing become the dominant values and economic interaction is based on mutual trust and goodwill. In such a world, the concept of \\"owning everything, you want for free\\" would likely foster a sense of freedom, abundance, and fulfillment. Individuals would have the luxury to pursue their passions, interests, and personal growth without the constraints of financial burdens. The absence of scarcity and financial concerns would allow people to devote more time and energy to personal development, creative endeavors, and contributing positively to society. However, it is important to recognize that this concept exists primarily in the realm of imagination and is not practically feasible in the real world. The complexities of resource allocation, production, and distribution make the concept of unlimited ownership and free access to everything difficult to realize on a large scale. Furthermore, without the constraints and incentives provided by scarcity and monetary exchange, there may be challenges in motivating individuals to contribute to the production and maintenance of various goods and services. The absence of financial systems may hinder innovation, productivity, and the necessary mechanisms for resource allocation and efficient distribution. In conclusion, while the idea of \\"owning everything, you want for free\\" may present a utopian vision of a world without scarcity and inequality, the practicalities and challenges make it difficult to achieve. However, exploring such concepts helps us reflect on the limitations of our current systems and encourages us to strive for greater equity, resource allocation, and fulfillment within our existing societies."},{"instruction":"Для каждого из заданного набора заземленных атомов напишите программу с одним правилом, имеющую стабильную модель, состоящую из заданных в условии задачи атомов.

It seems to interact with the Chrome APIs to manipulate tabs, local storage, and the audio context to apply equalizer settings. Here's a breakdown of some of the functionality: 1. Analytics: - It includes Google Analytics code to track page views and background events. 2. Handling of Presets and Settings: - It manages (saves, loads, and removes) user presets for equalizer settings using \`localStorage\` and \`chrome.storage.sync\`. 3. Audio Manipulation: - It sets up an \`AudioContext\` to manage how the audio is played. - It creates a chain of biquad filters (\`BiquadFilterNode\`) that can be used to adjust audio frequencies, effectively working as an equalizer. 4. Chrome Tabs and Tab Capture: - It listens to Chrome tab capture status changes and can start or stop capturing audio from a tab. - It sends and receives messages with the background page using \`chrome.runtime.sendMessage\` and \`chrome.runtime.onMessage\`. 5. Chrome Storage Change Listener: - It sets up a listener for changes in Chrome storage using \`chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener\`. 6. Analyser: - It can create an \`AnalyserNode\` to gather frequency data from the audio passing through it. Throughout the code, there are several functions designed to handle different aspects of an equalizer, such as applying presets, resetting filters, modifying gain, and managing audio streams associated with individual tabs. Please note the following: - The \`W\` variable is set to \`null\` and its purpose is not clear. It seems to be intended for some kind of limit but it's not used in the code. - The variable \`\` is later used as an event handler function for messages received by the Chrome extension, indicating it's a key part of inter-process communication for the extension. Lastly, if you intend to use or modify this code, please be aware of a few things: - Browser extensions require certain permissions specified in their manifest file; this script includes some API calls which will require those permissions. - Google Analytics integration as used in this script is deprecated in favor of the newer Google Analytics 4 Property, and Universal Analytics will be phased out. - Error handling is minimal, which could lead to issues if the extension encounters unexpected input or status. - Some variable names are not descriptive, which can make the code harder to maintain or understand. The code lacks context, such as Chrome extension manifest settings and other script files, that could be crucial to its whole functionality. To fully understand and use this code you would need the entire Chrome extension codebase."},{"instruction":"Exercise P.2.3.

Локация: Калининградская область.","output":"Технологическая карта возделывания овса в Калининградской области при условии, что предшественником является столовая свекла, может содержать следующие основные этапы: 1. Подготовка почвы - Осенняя вспашка на глубину до 25-27 см сразу после уборки урожая предшественника для борьбы с вредителями и сорняками. - В при необходимости — дискование или культивация для измельчения почвенных комков и выравнивание поля весной. - Ранневесенняя подготовка почвы, что включает боронование для измельчения и выровнять почвенного слоя. 2. Внесение удобрений - Расчет удобрительных норм проводится исходя из агрохимического анализа почвы и запаса питательных веществ после предшествующей культуры. - Могут быть использованы фосфорные удобрения, известкование (при необходимости), а также азотные удобрения для подкормки во время вегетации. 3. Посев - Оптимальные сроки посева овса в Калининградской области — конец апреля - начало мая. - Глубина заделки семян 3-5 см, норма высева - 4-5 млн. всхожих семян на 1 га. 4. Уход за посевами - Прополка и прореживание при необходимости для предотвращения перегущения стеблостоя. - Борьба с сорняками, болезнями и вредителями предполагает использование соответствующих гербицидов, фунгицидов и инсектицидов в соответствии с регистрационными рекомендациями. - Подкормка растений азотным удобрением после появлении первого настоящего листа. 5. Уборка урожая - Уборка проводится при достижении полной зрелости зерна, когда большинство стеблей и листьев овса приобретают желтый цвет. - Для минимизации потерь урожая из-за осипания используется комбайновая уборка с оптимальной настройкой оборудования. Также важно отметить, что в рамках переходной биологической технологии должны соблюдаться принципы минимального вмешательства в природные процессы и максимального сохранения экосистемы поля. Поэтому следует проводить агротехнические мероприятия с учетом экологических требований и возможности использования органических удобрений. Это всего лишь общий план и для более точного планирования потребуются дополнительные данные, такие как результаты агрохимического анализа почвы, местные климатические условия, уровень засорённости поля, наличие определённых болезней или вредителей и прочие факторы.

To explain what is going on, I'll break down the different components of the code provided and their purposes. 1. **Google Analytics Setup (\`_gaq\` Array)**: \`_gaq\` is an array used to queue up Google Analytics commands before the analytics.js library is loaded. The code initializes the analytics account and tracks a pageview and a custom event (indicating the extension was opened and the current version). 2. **Chrome Extension's Version**: \`chrome.runtime.getManifest().version\` retrieves the current version of the extension from its manifest file. This is tracked in the Google Analytics event. 3. **Local Storage Usage**: The snippet interacts with \`localStorage\` to perform various tasks related to saving extension settings and presets. The methods \`get\`, \`set\`, and \`remove\` are being used to interact with Chrome's storage system. The original storage methods are replaced with \`chrome.storage.sync\`, which allows for syncing data across devices where the user is signed into Chrome. 4. **Date Variable**: The \`e\` variable holds a string representing a date, but it is not used within the scope of the provided code. 5. **Dynamic Script Loading**: A script (presumably Google Analytics’ \`ga.js\`) is loaded dynamically by appending a \`<script>\` element to the DOM, which allows for analytics tracking. 6. **Management of Audio Processing**: The code looks like it's part of an audio-related Chrome extension, possibly an equalizer (\`AudioContext\`, \`BiquadFilter\`, etc.). It works with audio streams, manipulating their gains and frequencies using an array of filters, and it has an \`ae()\` function that closes and resets the \`AudioContext\`, which is the environment allowing for audio processing. 7. **Presets Handling**: There are functions such as \`ee()\`, \`te()\`, and \`ne()\` to manage user-defined presets stored in \`localStorage\`. These are likely to represent equalizer settings (\`frequencies\`, \`gains\`, \`qs\`). 8. **Logging and Debugging Support**: There are provisions in place, with a method \`D()\` and a boolean variable \`o\`, for logging and debugging information to console. 9. **Miscellaneous**: There are placeholders for code that is intended to react to changes in Chrome storage and to handle messages (\`chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener\`, \`chrome.runtime.onMessage.removeListener\`) but these segments are not fully implemented in the given snippet. 10. **Closure-Scoped Functions**: Functions like \`u()\`, \`y()\`, and \`m()\` to control various aspects of the audio processing are closure-scoped, meaning they are probably meant to be private to the implementation and used internally by the script. 11. **Audio Processing**: Functions are defined to update filter values (\`u()\`), set the main gain (\`y()\`), and helper functions for sanitizing input values for gain (\`v()\`), frequency (\`p()\`), and Q-factor (\`d()\`). 12. **Preset Save Function (\`S()\`)** The \`S()\` function saves the current state of the filters into a preset name received as a parameter. This code snippet lacks context and isn't complete, so it isn't fully functional or understandable without the rest of the extension’s codebase. Additionally, some of the identified functions (\`E()\`) are called but not defined within this snippet, suggesting that there is more to the extension than what is shown."},{"instruction":"You must rewrite the code from Chrome for Firefox, remember tabCapture is not supported by Firefox.

Один из наиболее известных кризисов в физике был связан с проблемой, возникшей в начале XX века в результате наблюдений исследователей таких явлений, как черное тело, фотоэффект и атомная структура вещества. На тот момент существующие физические теории не могли объяснить наблюдаемые результаты. Однако, эти проблемы стали стимулом для разработки новых теорий, которые привели к революционным открытиям. В 1900 году Макс Планк предложил квантовую теорию, основанную на представлении об энергии в виде дискретных пакетов, или квантов. Эта теория стала первым шагом в направлении квантовой механики. В конце 19 и начале 20 веков физика столкнулась с другой проблемой – двойственностью, или дуализмом, волновых и частицовых свойств материи. Она была отражена в экспериментах с электронами, которые могли демонстрировать и дифракционные, и интерференционные свойства, что противоречило классической физике. Для объяснения этого поведения Ревсом Пекером и Альбертом Эйнштейном была разработана теория квантовых полей. Важным этапом в развитии физики стало появление теории относительности Альберта Эйнштейна в начале XX века, которая изменила наше понимание пространства, времени и гравитации. Однако эта новая теория также привела к некоторым противоречиям с классической физикой и проблеме совмещения ее с квантовой механикой. В последующие годы физика развивалась дальше, приводя к созданию новых теорий и моделей, таких как стандартная модель элементарных частиц, теория суперструн, квантовая гравитация и др. Вместе с тем, разработка этих новых концепций и теорий сталкивается с трудностями, включая потенциальные противоречия между разными теориями, сложность их проверки экспериментально и трудности в объединении всех основных взаимодействий в единую теорию. Таким образом, кризисы в физике на рубеже веков представляют собой сложные проблемы, приводящие к появлению новых теорий и открытий. Исследования и поиск ответов на эти вопросы помогают углубить наше понимание природы мира и продвинуть науку вперед."},{"instruction":"подробнее и по пунктам","output":"Кризис в физике на рубеже веков можно рассмотреть более подробно, выделив следующие пункты: 1. Проблемы, возникшие в начале XX века: - Черное тело: По законам классической физики предсказывалось, что энергия, излучаемая нагретым телом, должна равномерно увеличиваться с увеличением частоты излучения. Однако эксперименты показали, что интенсивность излучения увеличивается, достигает максимума и затем снижается (излучение черного тела). Это противоречило классической физике. - Фотоэффект: При облучении светом поверхности некоторых материалов наблюдалось высвобождение электронов, но энергия этих электронов не зависела от интенсивности света, а зависела только от его частоты. Что также противоречило классической физике. - Атомная структура вещества: Наблюдалось явление дискретного спектра излучения и поглощения света материалами. То есть материалы могли поглощать и испускать энергию только определенных значений. Это противоречило представлению о непрерывном энергетическом спектре, предложенном классической физикой. 2. Решение проблем: - Квантовая теория: В 1900 году Макс Планк предложил квантовую теорию, согласно которой энергия излучается и поглощается не непрерывно, а дискретными порциями (квантами). Это объясняло наблюдаемые аномалии в черном теле, фотоэффекте и атомной структуре вещества. - Теория квантовых полей: Для объяснения дуализма волновых и частицовых свойств материи и взаимодействия между элементарными частицами, Ревсом Пекером и Альбертом Эйнштейном была разработана теория квантовых полей. - Теория относительности: Альберт Эйнштейн предложил теорию относительности, которая изменила наше понимание пространства, времени и гравитации. Однако эта теория тоже несовместима с классической физикой и создала дополнительные проблемы. 3. Развитие физики: - Стандартная модель: В последующие годы с развитием технологий и проведением экспериментов была разработана стандартная модель элементарных частиц, объединяющая электромагнетизм, сильное и слабое взаимодействия. Однако эта модель не учитывает гравитацию. - Квантовая гравитация: Одной из главных целей современной физики является объединение квантовой механики с теорией гравитации, чтобы создать единую теорию, объясняющую все фундаментальные взаимодействия в природе. - Нерешенные проблемы: Вместе с развитием новых концепций и теорий возникают новые проблемы и вопросы, включая противоречия между разными теориями, трудности в экспериментальной проверке и объединении различных физических явлений в единую теорию. Таким образом, кризис в физике на рубеже веков привел к разработке новых теорий и моделей, которые изменили наше представление о мире. Несмотря на успехи, многие вопросы остаются открытыми, и исследования в физике продолжаются для поиска новых ответов."},{"instruction":"проблема внутреннего строения звезд","output":"Проблема внутреннего строения звезд является одной из фундаментальных вопросов астрофизики. Внутреннее строение звезд определяет их структуру, эволюцию и характеристики, такие как температура, плотность, давление и энергия. Основные проблемы, связанные с внутренним строением звезд, включают: 1. Процессы энергопроизводства: Для поддержания светимости звезды необходимо постоянное возобновление энергии. Основные процессы, отвечающие за это, - ядерные реакции, в которых происходит синтез ядер и выделяется энергия. Однако точный механизм энергопроизводства внутри звезды, особенно для разных типов звезд, еще не полностью понятен. 2. Температура и давление: Внутри звезды величина температуры и давления меняется с глубиной и зависит от состава звездного материала. Изучение и предсказание этих параметров является сложной задачей, связанной с моделированием условий внутри звезды. 3. Сосуществование физических процессов: Внутри звезды происходит множество физических процессов, таких как ядерные реакции, перенос энергии, конвекция и радиационный транспорт. Взаимодействие этих процессов и их влияние на динамику и эволюцию звезды представляют сложную проблему. 4. Дифференциация звездного материала: Звездный материал состоит из различных элементов, и его распределение по глубине звезды может быть неоднородным. Процессы дифференциации внутри звезды, такие как потоки конвекции и перемешивание, играют важную роль в формировании химического состава и структуры звезды. Решение проблемы внутреннего строения звезд требует углубленных теоретических исследований, численного моделирования и наблюдательных данных. Астрофизики разрабатывают и исследуют различные математические модели и прибегают к современным наблюдательным методам, чтобы лучше понять внутреннюю структуру и динамику звезд разных типов, а также моделировать их эволюцию на различных стадиях жизни.

CNN'ler, çeşitli katmanlardan oluşur ve her bir katman, önceki katmandan gelen bilgileri işleyerek sonraki katmana daha temsil edici ve karmaşık öznitelikler aktarır. CNN mimarisi genellikle şu temel katmanlardan oluşur: 1. Konvolüsyon Katmanı (Convolution Layer): Bir görüntü üzerinde çeşitli filtreler uygulayarak, bunu temsil eden özellik haritalarını (feature maps) oluşturur. Filtreler, kenarlar, doku gibi görüntünün belirli bir özelliğini ayırt etmek için öğrenilen ağırlıklardır. 2. Aktivasyon Fonksiyonu: Konvolüsyon katmanından çıkan değerlere aktivasyon fonksiyonu uygulanır (çoğunlukla ReLU kullanılır). Bu sayede, ağın nonlineer öğrenme kabiliyeti artırılır. 3. Pooling Katmanı (Pooling Layer): Görüntüden elde edilen özellik haritalarının boyutunu azaltmak ve aşırı uyum (overfitting) riskini düşürmek için kullanılır. Max pooling ve average pooling en yaygın pooling türlerindendir. 4. Düzleştirme (Flatten): CNN'nin tam bağlantılı katmanlarına veri sağlamak için çok boyutlu özellik haritalarını tek boyutlu bir vektöre dönüştürme işlemidir. 5. Tam Bağlantılı Katman (Fully Connected Layer): Düzleştirilmiş özelliklerin, sınıflandırma gibi belirli bir görevde kullanılmadan önce bir veya daha fazla katmanda işlendiği bölümdür. 6. Çıkış Katmanı: Sınıflandırma görevinde, çıkış katmanı genellikle softmax aktivasyon fonksiyonuna sahip olur ve her sınıf için bir olasılık score'u verir. CNN'ler, kendilerine özgü mimari sayesinde görüntülerin yerel yapılarını korurken, parametre sayısını ve hesaplama yükünü azaltır ve görsel nesnelerin pozisyonuna karşı dayanıklılığı artırırlar.
