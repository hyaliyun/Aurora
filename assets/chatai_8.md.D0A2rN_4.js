The study, published in the Journal of Nutrition, conducted by researchers from the University of California, links the excessive consumption of phosphates to an increased risk of age-related health problems. Phosphates, a form of phosphorus, are added to food products to enhance their flavor and texture, and also to increase their shelf life. They are commonly present in processed meats, baked goods, and soft drinks. The study shows that people who consume high levels of phosphates have a greater risk of developing kidney disease, heart disease, and frailty in old age. The researchers analyzed data from more than 2,000 healthy adults, aged 70 or older, over a period of several years. They found that people who consumed higher levels of phosphates were more likely to develop chronic health problems as they aged. This correlation was stronger in people who had a history of heart disease or kidney problems. Dr. Alex Chang, lead author of the study, cautions that the results don't necessarily show cause and effect. \\"It's possible that people who eat high levels of phosphates also have other unhealthy habits that contribute to their health problems,\\" he says. \\"But the findings do suggest that it might be worth limiting your intake of phosphates, especially if you have a history of heart or kidney disease.\\" The study adds to a growing body of research that suggests that processed foods and additives may have harmful effects on health. Public health experts have long argued that a diet based on whole, unprocessed foods is healthier than one that relies on processed snacks and meals. In conclusion, the study shows that a regular consumption of snacks that are high in phosphates can lead to health problems later in life. Therefore, it is important to limit the intake of processed foods that contain high levels of this ingredient to ensure a healthy aging process."},{"instruction":"Take a trip to Middle Earth with The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.

Transport for London (TfL), the regulatory body that oversees transportation in the city, said that it would not be renewing the Uber’s license because of safety concerns. Uber was also accused of failing to report sexual assaults on passengers, and of allowing unlicensed and uninsured drivers to work on the platform. Uber said it would appeal the decision.","output":"The British government has pledged to introduce new laws following a decision by Transport for London (TfL) to deny Uber a license to operate in the city. TfL, which oversees transport in London, cited serious concerns over the safety of passengers and drivers as the reason for the decision. The regulatory body also accused Uber of failing to report sexual assaults on passengers and of allowing unlicensed and uninsured drivers to work for the platform. In response, Uber has said that it will appeal the decision. The company, which has been operating in London since 2012 and has around 45,000 drivers in the city, has previously had its license revoked in 2017 over safety concerns, but it was later granted a renewal on a probationary basis. The decision has been met with mixed reactions. While some have applauded TfL's decision as a necessary step to ensure passenger safety, others have criticized the move as being unfair to drivers who rely on the platform for their livelihoods. The UK government has now promised to introduce new legislation around ride-sharing companies, including measures to ensure passenger safety and a level playing field for all operators. In a statement, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that the safety of passengers and drivers must be a top priority, and that the government will work closely with regulators to ensure that the necessary measures are in place. The decision to deny Uber a license in London is also likely to have wider implications for the ride-sharing industry in the UK and beyond. Other companies, such as Bolt and Ola, have already started to fill the gap left by Uber and are likely to see an increase in demand in the coming weeks and months. Overall, the decision by TfL to deny Uber a license in London has highlighted the challenges facing the ride-sharing industry, particularly around safety and regulation. It remains to be seen what impact this will have on the industry as a whole, but it is likely that we will see further developments in the coming months as regulators and operators work to find a way forward."},{"instruction":"The teacher wrote on the whiteboard.

The new planet is named Ross 128b and is located just 11 light-years from Earth, relatively close in astronomical terms! Scientists at the European Southern Observatory in Chile discovered the planet while observing a red dwarf star that Ross 128b orbits. Ross 128b is situated in the star's \\"habitable zone,\\" which refers to the range of distance where it's neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water to exist on the planet's surface. The planet is believed to have a similar temperature to Earth and may have a rocky surface, making it an ideal candidate for supporting life. It's also substantial enough to have what scientists say is a good chance of having a breathable atmosphere. The discovery of Ross 128b is the closest astronomers have gotten to finding a planet that resembles Earth in terms of its size, temperature and the possibility of water on its surface. Being within relative proximity to Earth, Ross 128b presents an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to study the planet in greater detail than any exoplanet discovered before it. In time, scientists hope to use these findings to understand how planets like Earth form, what conditions are necessary for life to thrive and how we can potentially detect them elsewhere in the universe. With the challenging living conditions on our planet Earth, the potential of a planet like Ross 128b not only opens doors to possibilities of extra-terrestrial colonies but also provides an exciting opportunity for scientists to study and understand the universe beyond.

In anticipation of potential unrest, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard.

Despite the potential for unrest, Brown's family has pleaded with protesters to remain calm. They have stated that they will accept whatever decision the grand jury makes. The family emphasized the importance of non-violent protest, stating that it is the most powerful way to bring about the changes they seek.

Now, we need to express ( g ) in a form similar to ( f ). We know that ( f ) is composed of a linear part ( kx ) and a periodic part ( h(x) ). We need to find a similar decomposition for ( g ). 5. Consider the periodicity of ( h(x) ). Let ( d ) be the period of ( h(x) ), so ( h(x + d) = h(x) ). Then:    [    f(x + d) = k(x + d) + h(x + d) = kx + kd + h(x) = f(x) + kd.    ]    This implies that ( f(x) ) is shifted by ( kd ) when ( x ) is increased by ( d ). 6. Since ( g ) is the inverse of ( f ), it must \\"undo\\" the effect of ( f ). Therefore, if ( f(x) ) is shifted by ( kd ), ( g ) must shift back by ( kd ). This suggests that ( g ) has a periodic component with period ( kd ). 7. Let us write ( g(y) ) as:    [    g(y) = frac{1}{k}y + p(y),    ]    where ( p(y) ) is a periodic function. To verify this form, we substitute ( f(x) = kx + h(x) ) into ( g(f(x)) = x ):    [    g(kx + h(x)) = frac{1}{k}(kx + h(x)) + p(kx + h(x)) = x.    ] 8. Simplifying the above equation:    [    frac{1}{k}kx + frac{1}{k}h(x) + p(kx + h(x)) = x.    ]    [    x + frac{1}{k}h(x) + p(kx + h(x)) = x.    ]    [    frac{1}{k}h(x) + p(kx + h(x)) = 0.    ] 9. Since ( h(x) ) is periodic, ( frac{1}{k}h(x) ) is also periodic. Therefore, ( p(kx + h(x)) ) must be the negative of ( frac{1}{k}h(x) ), which is also periodic. 10. Thus, ( g(y) ) can indeed be written as the sum of a linear function ( frac{1}{k}y ) and a periodic function ( p(y) ).

By setting y = -x, we get f(x - x) = f(x) + f(-x) - 1. Knowing that f(0) must be the function evaluated at zero (which is a number that, when added to any number, doesn't change it), we can determine f(0) by setting x = y = 0, yielding f(0 + 0) = f(0) + f(0) - 1. This simplifies to f(0) = 1.  Therefore, with f(0) = 1, we can revisit the previous equation:  f(0) = f(x) + f(-x) - 1  1 = f(x) + f(-x) - 1  f(-x) - 1 = -(f(x) - 1)  This confirms that f(x) - 1 is an odd function, as changing x to -x results in the negation of the function minus one, which is the definition of an odd function. ii) To determine the monotonicity of f(x), let x_1, x_2 in mathbb{R} and x_1 < x_2. Considering the functional equation, replacing x with x_2 and y with x_1 gives f(x_2 + x_1) = f(x_2) + f(x_1) - 1. We know that x_2 + x_1 is just x_2 (since we are considering x_2-x_1), which simplifies our expression to f(x_2) - f(x_1) = f(x_2 - x_1) - 1. Since x_1 < x_2, it holds that x_2 - x_1 > 0, and thus f(x_2 - x_1) > 1 by the given condition for negative arguments. Therefore, f(x_2 - x_1) - 1 > 0, which implies that f(x_2) - f(x_1) > 0. This means that f(x) is monotonically decreasing over mathbb{R}. iii) Given the solution set of the inequality f(a^2-2a-7) + frac{1}{2} > 0 is {a mid -2 < a < 4}, we are to find f(5).

Here, a^2-2a-7 < m must be satisfied, and from the inequality provided, we determine that m = 1. Thus, we get f(1) = -frac{1}{2}. Next, from the functional equation, when y = 0, then f(x) = f(x) + f(0) - 1, implying f(0) = 1. Using the equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) - 1, we compute f(2) and f(4) in the following steps:  f(2) = f(1 + 1) = f(1) + f(1) - 1 = -frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2} - 1 = -2  Then,  f(4) = f(2 + 2) = f(2) + f(2) - 1 = -2 - 2 - 1 = -5  Finally, we find f(5):  f(5) = f(4 + 1) = f(4) + f(1) - 1 = -5 - frac{1}{2} - 1 = -frac{13}{2}  [ boxed{f(5) = -frac{13}{2}} ]"},{"instruction":"Vertex E of rightisosceles triangle{ABE} is inside unit square ABCD, with hypotenuse AB.

A prime  p  is said to be *orange* if for every integer  a  there exists an integer  r  such that  r^q equiv a  (mod  p ).  Prove that there are infinitely many *orange* primes.","output":"1. **Dirichlet's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions**: According to Dirichlet's theorem, there are infinitely many primes in any arithmetic progression of the form (a + kn) where (a) and (n) are coprime. In this problem, we consider the arithmetic progression (2 + kq) where (q) is a fixed odd prime. Since (2) and (q) are coprime, there are infinitely many primes (p) such that (p equiv 2 pmod{q}). 2. **Injectivity of the Map**: We need to show that for any prime (p) such that (p equiv 2 pmod{q}), the map (f: mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z} to mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z}) defined by (f(x) = x^q) is injective. Assume (a^q equiv b^q pmod{p}) for some integers (a) and (b) in (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z}). This implies:    [    a^q equiv b^q pmod{p}    ]    Since (p) is a prime, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any integer (x), (x^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p}) if (x) is not divisible by (p). Therefore, we have:    [    a^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} quad text{and} quad b^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p}    ]    Given (a^q equiv b^q pmod{p}), we can write:    [    (a cdot b^{-1})^q equiv 1 pmod{p}    ]    Since (p equiv 2 pmod{q}), (q) does not divide (p-1). Therefore, the order of any element in ((mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^*) must divide (p-1), which is not a multiple of (q). Hence, the only solution to ((a cdot b^{-1})^q equiv 1 pmod{p}) is (a equiv b pmod{p}). This shows that the map (x mapsto x^q) is injective. 3. **Surjectivity of the Map**: Since (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z}) is a finite set and the map (x mapsto x^q) is injective, it must also be surjective. This is a property of finite sets: an injective map from a finite set to itself is necessarily bijective. 4. **Conclusion**: Since the map (x mapsto x^q) is surjective, for every integer (a) in (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z}), there exists an integer (r) such that (r^q equiv a pmod{p}). Therefore, (p) is an *orange* prime. Since there are infinitely many primes (p) such that (p equiv 2 pmod{q}), we conclude that there are infinitely many *orange* primes.

To find the probability that the driver can always give change immediately to passengers paying with a 100-ruble bill at any point in time, let's proceed as follows: 1. **Model the problem as a random walk:**     - Initially, the driver has 0 coins.     - Every passenger either:         - Pays with a 100-ruble bill, in which case the driver needs to give out 25 rubles in change, or         - Pays exactly 75 rubles (50 ruble bill + 25 rubles in coins), adding up no additional coins. 2. **Steps of the random walk:**     - Up case: When a passenger pays 75 rubles exactly (driver gains a 25-ruble coin).     - Down case: When a passenger pays with a 100-ruble bill (driver loses a 25-ruble coin). 3. **Define the random variable path:**     - Each step can be viewed as (+1) (gain of 25 rubles coin) or (-1) (loss of 25 rubles coin) with equal probability (0.5). 4. **Ensuring change ability:**     - We need the probability that the number of coins never goes negative at any time during the 15 steps (passengers). 5. **Reframe the question:**     - Calculate the probability that, starting from zero, the walk never goes below zero. As concluded by the random walk theory, the number of such walks is given by Catalan numbers. Using the problem details, the probability calculation involves symmetries and pairings, formalized in combinatorial methods for non-decreasing (non-negative) subsequences. Number of non-negative (\\"good\\") paths from (0) to (1) that do not descend below zero is given by symmetrical properties over forbidden paths. 6. **Calculate the required probability:** [ text{Number of valid trajectories} = C_{15}^{8} = frac{15!}{8!7!} = 6435 ] [ text{Total possible trajectories} = 2^{15} = 32768 ] Thus, the probability: [ text{Probability} = frac{6435}{32768} approx 0.196 ] **Conclusion:** (boxed{0.196})  Part (b) 1. **Precondition:**     - To ensure with a probability of at least 0.95 that the driver can make immediate change every time, we need to find the starting number of coins ((k)). 2. **Using combinatorial arguments:**     - Sum up paths to ensure we achieve at least 0.95, considering any downward path must be countered by available coins. 3. **Required Calculation:**     - Using Pascals triangle and probability additions for valid sequences:    Using the binomial distribution properties and summing these combinatorial counts: (boxed{275 text{ rubles}}) This entails: [ k = 11 text{ coins}] Simplified to exactly (275) ruble coins might be needed for near-certain immediate change distribution. **Conclusion:**  - Part a: Probability the driver can give change - (boxed{0.196}) - Part b: Amount in coins driver should start with - (boxed{275 text{ rubles}}) (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Based on the chart provided, what was the average daily temperature considering both high and low temperatures in Addington from September 15th, 2008 through September 21th, 2008, inclusive?

Each boy watered an equal number of trees, and since 2 trees were left over, the total number of trees that were watered by the boys is 29 - 2 = 27 trees. Since each boy watered an equal number of trees, the number of trees each boy watered must be a factor of 27. The factors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. Since we're looking for the number of boys, and it's unlikely that there was only 1 boy (because then there wouldn't be any trees left over), we can consider the other factors. If there were 3 boys, each would water 9 trees (3 boys * 9 trees/boy = 27 trees). If there were 9 boys, each would water 3 trees (9 boys * 3 trees/boy = 27 trees). If there were 27 boys, each would water 1 tree (27 boys * 1 tree/boy = 27 trees).

Substituting the given condition into this equation, we get 2angle C = 180^{circ}, which simplifies to angle C = 90^{circ}.

For parallelograms, this central point is the intersection of the diagonals, which equally bisect each other, confirming the central symmetry. - **Statement ③**: Any diagonal of a parallelogram can divide the parallelogram into two congruent triangles.

(b) Considering the logic and justification from point (a), provide at least two different cashback options that would allow banks to partially avoid the problems they face in the situation described in point (a).","output":"(a) Why offering cashback via loyalty programs might be unprofitable for banks 1. **High Financial Literacy Among Customers:**    - Banks that create various loyalty programs, including cashback, often target the average consumer in a specific category of cardholders.    - These programs are designed with the expectation that the average percentage of returned funds in the form of cashback will not be substantial.    - However, financially literate customers often exploit these programs to maximize their benefits. These customers might possess multiple cashback cards for different expenditure categories (possibly even from different banks).     - For example:      - One card could be used exclusively for restaurant payments.      - Another card might cover supermarket purchases.      - A third card might be used for fuel at gas stations.    - Customers then use each card to pay for the category of goods or services that provides the highest cashback. This strategy can significantly reduce the profitability of such programs for banks.       2. **Preferential Card Usage:**    - Another unfavorable scenario for banks is when a customer uses a cashback card solely for specific categories where the cashback is highest. For other transactions, the customer prefers cash payments or uses another non-cashback card.    - For instance, a customer might heavily use a card for a category like 'groceries' if the cashback is higher in that category but might avoid using the card for any other categories. Conclusion: - These strategies can cause banks to lose more money on cashback payments than they anticipated. As a result, banks might lose interest in offering cashback incentives to customers due to their reduced profitability.   blacksquare   (b) Two Different Ways to Calculate  Cashback for Banks to Partially Avoid Issues Described in (a) 1. **Monthly Cashback Cap:**    - **Implementation:**      - A bank might declare a 10% cashback on purchases in a specific category, such as fuel. However, they also set a monthly cap on the cashback amount.      - For instance, irrespective of how much a customer spends in a month, they can only receive up to 2000 rubles in cashback from fuel purchases.    - **Benefit:**      - This cap helps limit the bank's expenses on cashback payments and curbs potential misuse by those looking to maximize cashbacks strategically.     2. **Variable Cashback Percentage:**    - **Implementation:**      - Banks can offer variable cashback rates based on transaction activity.      - Example: The bank might provide a lower cashback percentage in categories where frequent high cashback claims are made or stop offering cashback in specific categories if it appears that customers are using those purely as a source of income.    - **Benefit:**      - This method helps manage and mitigate excessive cashback payouts while adjusting to the customer usage patterns to preserve the profitability of the cashback program. 3. **Non-Monetary Cashback Rewards:**    - **Implementation:**      - Instead of offering cashback in money, banks reward customers with points, bonuses, or miles.      - These points can later be redeemed for rewards rather than direct monetary benefits.    - **Benefit:**      - Points and non-cash rewards often come with restrictions and are less liquid than cash. The conversion of points or miles into cash equivalents can be at a lower value, thus helping banks save on direct cash outflows and maintaining customer engagement. Conclusion: - By employing these strategies, banks can scale down their payout expenses on cashback and manage the customer's exploitative strategies while still maintaining the attraction of cashback or loyalty programs.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Find four positive integers such that the sums of the numbers taken three at a time are 6, 7, 8, and 9.","output":"1. **Define Variables and Set Equations**:    Let the four positive integers be denoted by ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ), where ( a < b < c < d ).

Since angle ABC = 54^circ, we find that angle ACB = 54^circ. Hence, angle BAC = 180^circ - 54^circ - 54^circ = 72^circ. Since BD bisects angle ABC, angle ABD = angle DBC = 54^circ / 2 = 27^circ. Triangle ABD is isosceles at AB = AD since angle ABD = angle BAD = 27^circ due to angle bisector. Looking at triangle BDC, angle BDC = 180^circ - angle DBA - angle DBC = 180^circ - 27^circ - 27^circ = 126^circ. Hence, angle BCD = 54^circ, and BC = BD indicating isosceles triangle BDC.

Prove that one of these colors and n+1 vertices can be chosen such that from any of these vertices it is possible to reach any other chosen vertex through edges of the specified color.","output":"To prove the stated problem, we will use mathematical induction on n.  Base Case: For n = 1, the graph has 2n+1 = 3 vertices. Suppose the edges are colored with three colors. We can select any two vertices, and since there are three edges among three vertices, at least one color will connect these vertices. Hence, for n=1 the statement holds.  Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for n=k. Now we need to prove it for n=k+1. 1. **Selection of a Subset:**    Choose a subset X of n = k vertices such that all these vertices are connected by edges of the first color (let’s call it color C_1). 2. **Removing and Adding Vertices:**    Remove one vertex from this subset X. We are left with k-1 vertices. Now select another set Y consisting of k vertices connected by edges of a single color. We consider two cases:     3. **Case 1:**    If the new color Y is the same as C_1:    - Note that since X and Y do not intersect, the remaining vertex A is connected to these 2k+1 vertices only by edges of the second and third colors.    - Consequently, there will be at least k edges of one of these two remaining colors connecting A to the vertices, forming a desired set of k+1 vertices connected by edges of that color. 4. **Case 2:**    If the new color Y is different from C_1:    - Suppose the color is the second color C_2.    - All vertices can be divided into two sets: vertices in the union of X and Y, and the remaining vertices.    - Each subset, except one trivial variant, can be split such that vertices in different parts of the set are connected only by the edges of the third color (or the original second).    - Therefore, in one of these segments there will be at least k+1 vertices connected exclusively by the third color. 5. **Conclusion:**    By induction, we have shown that the statement holds for n=k+1. Hence, by the principle of induction, the statement is true for all n geq 1. Therefore, there exists at least one color and n+1 vertices such that among every pair of these vertices, there is an edge of that color connecting them.

So, the tax on the excess income is: 20% of 16,000 = 0.20 * 16,000 = 3,200 Now, we know that the total tax is 8,000, and we've just calculated that 3,200 of that comes from the income in excess of 40,000.

Therefore, the relative speed (Vr) in km/hr is: Vr = V1 + V2 We need to convert the relative speed to m/s to match the units of the lengths of the trains and the time taken to cross each other. To convert km/hr to m/s, we multiply by (1000 m / 1 km) and divide by (3600 s / 1 hr): Vr (in m/s) = Vr (in km/hr) * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hr) Now, the total distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths: Distance = Length of the first train + Length of the second train Distance = 280 m + 220.04 m Distance = 500.04 m The time taken to cross each other is given as 9 seconds (t = 9 s). We can use the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time: Vr (in m/s) = Distance / Time Vr (in m/s) = 500.04 m / 9 s Vr (in m/s) ≈ 55.56 m/s Now we convert this relative speed back to km/hr: Vr (in km/hr) = Vr (in m/s) * (3600 s / 1 hr) / (1000 m / 1 km) Vr (in km/hr) ≈ 55.56 m/s * (3600 s / 1 hr) / (1000 m / 1 km) Vr (in km/hr) ≈ 200.016 km/hr Now we know the relative speed in km/hr and the speed of the second train, so we can find the speed of the first train: V1 + V2 = Vr V1 + 80 km/hr = 200.016 km/hr V1 = 200.016 km/hr - 80 km/hr V1 = 120.016 km/hr Therefore, the speed of the first train is approximately boxed{120.016}  km/hr."},{"instruction":"Prove that the difference between the cube of a natural number and the number itself is divisible by 6.","output":"# Решение: Мы хотим доказать, что разность между кубом натурального числа (n) и самим числом делится на 6, то есть ((n^3 - n)) делится на 6. 1.

The final answer is ( boxed{ x = y = z = sqrt{frac{1}{3} left(5 + sqrt[3]{frac{61}{2} - frac{9sqrt{29}}{2}} + sqrt[3]{frac{1}{2}(61 + 9sqrt{29})}right)} } )"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},N={key:0,class:"empty-state"},G=["disabled"],_={key:0},H={key:1};function E(i,e,h,p,n,s){const f=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),w(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,m)=>(a(),k(f,{key:m,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",N,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
