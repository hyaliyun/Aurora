The CIA's senior management saw problems with the armed Predator as well, problems that Clarke and even Black and Allen were inclined to minimize. One (which also applied to reconnaissance flights) was money. A Predator cost about 3 million. If the CIA flew Predators for its own reconnaissance or covert action purposes, it might be able to borrow them from the Air Force, but it was not clear that the Air Force would bear the cost if a vehicle went down. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz took the position that the CIA should have to pay for it; the CIA disagreed. Second, Tenet in particular questioned whether he, as Director of Central Intelligence, should operate an armed Predator.\\" This was new ground,\\"he told us. Tenet ticked off key questions: What is the chain of command? Who takes the shot? Are America's leaders comfortable with the CIA doing this, going outside of normal military command and control? Charlie Allen told us that when these questions were discussed at the CIA, he and the Agency's executive director, A. B.\\" Buzzy\\" Krongard, had said that either one of them would be happy to pull the trigger, but Tenet was appalled, telling them that they had no authority to do it, nor did he. Third, the Hellfire warhead carried by the Predator needed work. It had been built to hit tanks, not people. It needed to be designed to explode in a different way, and even then had to be targeted with extreme precision. In the configuration planned by the Air Force through mid-2001, the Predator's missile would not be able to hit a moving vehicle. White House officials had seen the Predator video of the \\"man in white.\\" On July 11, Hadley tried to hurry along preparation of the armed system. He directed McLaughlin, Wolfowitz, and Joint Chiefs Vice Chairman Richard Myers to deploy Predators capable of being armed no later than September 1.

The tenements of the Old Town and the Georgian buildings of the New Town are still in residential use, which means they have not been condemned and are being maintained for people to live in. Moreover, not only are these old buildings serving as residences, but they also support a bustling community, as a range of stores, restaurants, pubs, and theaters are open to cater to the needs and interests of the population. This further demonstrates that these historical structures continue to be functional and valuable to the people living there today. Rather than being condemned, it seems that the Old Town and New Town have managed to preserve their architectural heritage and charm while accommodating modern lifestyles and providing essential services and amenities to their residents.

Context: One day after a mass shooting killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his support for a plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire Monday, Trump promised his supporters that, if elected, he would use the executive powers to \\"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\\" Although the suspected Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was an American citizen, Trump suggested immigrants from the Middle East can come to the U.S. and radicalize people who are already here, or work to convince them online. \\"The media talks about homegrown terrorism,\\" Trump said. \\"But Islamic radicalism ... and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or don't like it.\\" Refugees and immigrants from conflict ridden Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya could \\"be a better, bigger more horrible version than the legendary Trojan horse ever was,\\" Trump said. But a recent Brookings Institution survey found Americans are far more welcoming of refugees than the billionaire candidate. Of those surveyed, 59 percent support accepting refugees, while 41 percent oppose it. Those views are split right down party lines, with just 38 percent of Republicans supporting taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared to 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. The Obama administration has set a goal of admitting as many as 10,000 Syrian refugees to the United States by the fall.Respondents of the surveys also were sharply divided on whether they would be willing to accept refugees from Syria in particular, with 61 percent of Republicans saying the U.S. should not accept Syrian refugees, compared to 27 percent of Democrats. Trump supporters again... Question: After the end of the story, Trump probably does what with immigration? Answer: Answer:","output":"After the end of the story, Trump probably limits severely immigration from Muslim countries. In the context provided, Trump expresses support for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and aims to suspend immigration from areas with a proven history of terrorism against the U.S., Europe, or its allies. He suggests that immigrants from the Middle East can potentially radicalize people who are already in the U.S. or convince them through online networks.

A:","output":"A: Marks and Spencer, also known as M&S, first opened on September 28, 1884. The company was founded by Michael Marks, a Polish-born immigrant, who initially set up a small market stall in Kirkgate Market, Leeds, United Kingdom. At the time, he mainly sold household goods, such as soap, curtain rings, and cleaning products. In 1894, Michael Marks and Thomas Spencer, a bookkeeper, became business partners, and the name Marks and Spencer was created. They opened their first store in a covered arcade in Leeds called the Cross Arcade, positioning the business as a penny bazaar. It was a small store that aimed to serve the needs of ordinary families, offering a wide range of merchandise, from clothing and haberdashery products to tinware and cutlery, all at a low price point. The store was founded with the slogan \\"Don't ask the price, it's a penny,\\" summarizing their commitment to affordability. The partnership between Marks and Spencer proved successful as the business expanded throughout the early 20th century. They opened new stores, not only in different parts of the United Kingdom but also in Ireland and overseas, with their first international store opening in Paris in 1928. At the same time, the company introduced new products such as food, which eventually became one of their biggest revenue sources. Marks and Spencer also pioneered several innovative concepts in retail throughout their growth, such as the introduction of pre-packed perishable food along with the cash and carry service in the 1930s. This innovativeness continued into the 1950s when they became one of the first retailers to offer high-quality, ready-to-wear clothes with their \\"St Michael\\" brand. They embraced various other up-and-coming ideas like self-service, in-store cafeterias, and the first escalators in a British shop, all of which contributed to making M&S the successful retail brand it is today. To this day, Marks and Spencer remains one of the leading retail chains in the United Kingdom, with an extensive range of products, including clothing, food, and homeware. The company has evolved over the years, embracing e-commerce and expanding its presence around the globe, all while maintaining its dedication to quality and affordable products for its customers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Following growing pressure from the anti-apartheid movement both domestically and internationally, in 1990 State President Frederik Willem de Klerk reversed the ban on the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organisations, and announced that Mandela would shortly be released from prison. Mandela was released in February 1990. He persuaded Makeba to return to South Africa, which she did, using her French passport, on 10 June 1990. Makeba, Gillespie, Simone, and Masekela recorded and released her studio album, Eyes on Tomorrow, in 1991. It combined jazz, R&B, pop, and traditional African music, and was a hit across Africa. Makeba and Gillespie then toured the world together to promote it. In November she made a guest appearance on a US sitcom, The Cosby Show. In 1992, she starred in the film Sarafina!, which centred on students involved in the 1976 Soweto uprising. Makeba portrayed the title character's mother, Angelina, a role which The New York Times described as having been performed with \\"immense dignity\\".On 16 October 1999, Makeba was named a Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In January 2000, her album, Homeland, produced by the New York City based record label Putumayo World Music, was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best World Music Album category. She worked closely with Graça Machel-Mandela, the South African first lady, advocating for children suffering from HIV/AIDS, child soldiers, and the physically handicapped. She established the Makeba Centre for Girls, a home for orphans, described in an obituary as her most personal project. She also took part in the 2002 documentary Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony, which examined the struggles of black South Africans against apartheid through the music of the period. Makeba's second autobiography, Makeba: The Miriam Makeba Story, was published in 2004. In 2005 she announced that she would retire and began a farewell tour, but despite having osteoarthritis, continued to perform...

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Kids Context: In mid-90s Manhattan, the nihilistic Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) is busy deflowering virgins. He doesn't just enjoy the sex and act of taking young girl's virginity though -- he believes that he can avoid STDs this way. After finishing with his latest conquest (Sarah Henderson), Telly bums around town with his friend Casper (Justin Pierce) looking for some kind of distraction .One of Telly's former sex partners, Jennie (Chloë Sevigny), and her friend Ruby (Rosario Dawson) receive mixed news at a public health clinic. The promiscuous Ruby is clean, but Jennie (who has only had sex once, with Telly) is HIV positive. The news devastates Jennie, who will spend much of the film searching for the wandering Telly.Telly & Casper have several adventures: buying weed in the park, shoplifting a \\"40\\" of malt liquor from a Korean Guy (Johnathan Staci Kim) of whom they make fun of, beating up a man who \\"disses\\" them, and finally winding up at a teen party that night. Eventually we find that Telly has seduced a thirteen year old girl, and is busy deflowering her. Jennie (who took a strange drug earlier) arrives and passes out on a couch. A drunken Casper takes advantage of the situation to rape Jennie, perpetuating the HIV cycle.The audience can hear Telly's voice-over explaining that without sex, his life has no purpose. The film finishes with Casper waking up the following morning and asking to no-one in particular, \\"Jesus Christ, what has happened?\\" Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Kids,\\" Jennie, played by Chloë Sevigny, tests positive for HIV after only having had sex once, with Telly. She is devastated by the news and spends most of the film trying to find Telly. The implication is that Telly, who believes he can avoid STDs by only having sex with virgins, unknowingly transmitted the HIV virus to Jennie during their encounter."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: The virus \\"Ebola\\" is named after the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That's where the virus was discovered in 1976. A person can only get Ebola through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, for example, sweat or spit. Additionally, the virus can get into your body through your eyes and mouth if those areas come into contact with something that contains the bodily fluids of an infected person. That's why health care workers are supposed to keep themselves completely covered while treating patients. The deadliest Ebola outbreak is spreading fast in Western Africa, taking over 900 lives so far. The health systems in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are severely lacking in resources, and health care workers may not have access to adequate protective clothing when working in rural clinics, where the proper protections are lacking. Since Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia share a border; it's easier for people to move from one country to another, increasing the risk for disease spread. For now, all doctors can do is treat the symptoms and provide supportive care like monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing while making sure the patients' fluids are supplied. Sometimes patients are given antibiotics  to treat other possible infections. The hope is to make the patient pull through the infection so their immune system can eventually clear the virus. The people who survive Ebola have created enough antibodies to kill it. There are several promising drugs and vaccines in development, but since Ebola is less common--and research about it is not well funded -- there is no drug or vaccine that has been approved for use in humans. Many of the other drugs and vaccines have not yet been tested in humans. The WHO (World Health Organization) is meeting next week to discuss whether experimental treatments should be used during this outbreak. Question: Why have there been no cures used for Ebola in humans so far? Options: A: There are not enough drugs for the infected people. B: Ebola is rare and its research money is lacking. C: The people have enough antibodies to kill Ebola. D: The WHO has decided not to use them. A:","output":"The best answer is B: Ebola is rare and its research money is lacking. The text mentions that there are several promising drugs and vaccines in development for Ebola; however, due to a lack of funding, these experimental treatments have not yet been approved for use in humans. The scarcity of the disease also likely contributes to the lack of investment in research. This option is directly supported by the text making it the most accurate answer. Although other options might also be indirectly derived from the text, Option B is the most accurate reflection of the content in the article."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For extra texture, use puff paint which dries in a bubble-like form above the surface of the bead. To make your beads sparkly, use glitter glue or loose glitter over the surface of the paper. Add the glitter before your final coat of varnish to keep it from rubbing off as a result of wear and tear. Try adding several coats of glitter in different colors for a lovely rainbow effect.

In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\\" he said.

In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, \\"He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart.\\" When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's \\"I'm Eighteen\\" on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon.Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: Early Seventies Britain was a very depressing place. It was completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike.

The UK is high up in the list of places that the Chinese want to visit. There is a sense of mystery about the UK; it's often the images of England's green parks, countryside and Victorian houses that people point to as an alternative to polluted, overcrowded cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou. The capital is viewed as modern and dynamic, while being filled deep with history. When asked what other images are thought of by the UK, the reply is often \\"the Queen, tea and Oxbridge\\". So what's stopping them actually coming? Sebastian Wood ,the British ambassador in Beijing, has described the UK as a _ , and while this is perhaps an exaggeration ,Britain does have a reputation as a country that is harder to access. The main problem for Chinese tourists is obvious. Although visa applications are now completed online, visitors are still required to visit one of 12 UK centers across the country for a face-to-face interview and fingerprinting. If you don't live near one of these enters already, you'd have to travel some distance to get there. Another problem is also to be mentioned. If travelers from China visit the UK, they also want to cover as much ground as possible. But the UK is not included in the Schengen visa, which allows access to a host of 26 European countries such as France and Germany. So it makes the former seem a less worth it. There is also the issue of cost: PS47 for a Schengen visa, PS82 for the UK. On top of this, the UK is viewed as stricter in its handing of visas compared with the rest of Europe, fed by urban legends of rejected applications. In the end, the decision comes down to one question: Is Britain worth a visit? What is the writer's attitude towards visiting the UK? A) He really supports Chinese people to visit the UK. B) He suggests Chinese people visit London strongly. C) He thinks it is troublesome to visit the UK. D) He believes everyone should go to see the Queen and Oxbridge. The answer is:","output":"C) He thinks it is troublesome to visit the UK.  Step-by-step justification: 1. Analyze the question: The question asks about the writer's attitude towards visiting the UK. 2. Read the passage carefully: The passage describes the UK as an attractive destination for Chinese tourists, but it also mentions several barriers that make visiting the UK more difficult. 3. Identify relevant details: The text outlines the visa application process, the additional effort required by Chinese visitors compared to visiting other European countries, the higher cost of the UK visa, and the perception of stricter visa approval. 4. Compare the answer choices:     A) He really supports Chinese people to visit the UK. - This answer is not accurate, as the writer highlights the difficulties and challenges of visiting the UK.        B) He suggests Chinese people visit London strongly. - This answer is too specific and does not convey the writer's overall attitude.        C) He thinks it is troublesome to visit the UK. - This answer reflects the writer's attitude by mentioning the challenges and difficulties Chinese visitors may face when planning a trip to the UK.        D) He believes everyone should go to see the Queen and Oxbridge. - This answer is irrelevant to the writer's attitude towards visiting the UK. 5.

Possible answers: very helping, like she wasn't wanted, like her efforts were wasted","output":"Based on the context given, it is not explicitly stated how Jan would feel afterwards. However, by making certain inferences, it is most likely that she would feel tired but fulfilled and satisfied for having given her all to assist her team. She had “played hard” which probably indicates that she put her heart and soul into her efforts to make a positive impact on her team. Such dedication and commitment typically inspire feelings of accomplishment. This is because she intended to \\"help her team out,\\" and even if they didn’t win, she has the satisfaction of knowing she did her best. Therefore, it's very unlikely she feels ‘like she wasn't wanted’ or that ‘her efforts were wasted’. These feelings are generally associated with a lack of acknowledgment or appreciation of one’s efforts, which the given context doesn't suggest. We had zero input that hints towards a lack of appreciation or acknowledgment towards Jan. Hence, neither of these two options seems to be a possibility. So, feelings such as being 'very helping' would probably be closest to what Jan might be experiencing. However, the more suitable word to use here would be ‘helpful’. 'Helping' is generally not used to describe feelings. But regardless of semantics, the overarching feeling for Jan, in this case, is likely one of satisfaction and fulfillment derived from her perceived contribution to her team. In summary, Jan, having worked hard to support her team, would most likely feel exhausted but satisfied, knowing she had made a considerable effort to assist her team. This sense of fulfillment may also be coupled with feelings of being helpful and accomplished. It’s important to note that these are inferences drawn from the presented context, and Jan’s actual feelings could depend on a multitude of factors including her personality, the team's reaction, and the outcome of whatever situation they were in."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? over his head","output":"To determine the sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"over his head,\\" we must first analyze its meaning within the context it was likely used and then make an educated judgment on whether it implies a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The phrase \\"over his head\\" typically means that the person is unable to handle or comprehend the situation, task, or responsibility due to its complexity or difficulty. When used in the context of a movie review, this phrase could refer to an actor giving a performance where they appear to be overwhelmed or out of their depth in a particular role. It could also refer to a director being unable to manage the different aspects of a film, ultimately leading to a less-than-stellar outcome. Considering the general interpretation of the phrase, it's safe to assume that \\"over his head\\" is most likely conveying a negative sentiment. This is because the reviewer must have felt that the actor or director was struggling to deliver a credible work in their respective roles. Their inability to manage and fulfill the tasks at hand must have dampened the viewer's enjoyment or appreciation of the film. However, it's essential to note that the overall sentiment of the statement could be influenced by the remainder of the review. For instance, if other aspects of the movie are praised, the sentiment may be slightly more positive, despite the negativity conveyed by the phrase \\"over his head.\\" In conclusion, the movie review sentence \\"over his head,\\" when analyzed within its likely context, implies a primarily negative sentiment. This is due to the notion that the actor or director was unable to handle the complexity or requirements of their role, which led to a diminished experience for the viewer. However, the overall sentiment could be modified by the rest of the review, as other positive aspects of the movie might still be present."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sean Patrick Hannity was born in New York City, New York, the son of Lillian (Flynn) and Hugh Hannity. Lillian worked as a stenographer and a corrections officer at a county jail, while Hugh was a family-court officer. He is the youngest of four siblings. All of his grandparents immigrated to the United States from Ireland. Hannity hosted his first talk radio show in 1989 at the volunteer college station at UC Santa Barbara, KCSB-FM, while working as a general contractor. The show aired for 40 hours of air time. Regarding his first show, he said, \\"I wasn't good at it. I was terrible.\\" Hannity's weekly show on KCSB was canceled after less than a year. This was after two shows featuring the book The AIDS Coverup: The Real and Alarming Facts about AIDS by Gene Antonio; among other remarks made during the broadcast, Hannity told a lesbian caller, \\"I feel sorry for your child.\\" The university board that governed the station later reversed its decision due to a campaign conducted on Hannity's behalf by the Santa Barbara chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued that the station had discriminated against Hannity's First Amendment rights. When the station refused to give him a public apology and more airtime, Hannity decided against returning to KCSB.  After leaving KCSB, Hannity placed an ad in radio publications presenting himself as \\"the most talked about college radio host in America.\\" Radio station WVNN in Athens, Alabama (part of the Huntsville market), then hired him to be the afternoon talk show host. From Huntsville, he moved to WGST in Atlanta in 1992, filling the slot vacated by Neal Boortz, who had moved to competing station WSB. In September 1996, Fox News co-founder Roger Ailes hired the then relatively unknown Hannity to host a television program under the working title Hannity and LTBD (\\"liberal to be determined\\"). Alan Colmes was then hired to co-host and the show debuted as Hannity & Colmes.  Later that year, Hannity left WGST for New York, where WABC had him substitute for their afternoon drive time host during Christmas week. In January 1997, WABC put Hannity on the air full-time, giving him the late night time slot. WABC then moved Hannity to the same drive time slot he had filled temporarily a little more than a year earlier. Hannity was on WABC's afternoon time slot from January 1998 until the end of 2013. Since January 2014, Hannity has hosted the 3-6 p.m. time slot on WOR in New York City.  In their 2007 book Common Ground: How to Stop the Partisan War That Is Destroying America, conservative Cal Thomas and liberal Bob Beckel describe Hannity as a leader of the pack among broadcasting political polarizers, which following James Q.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Who disagreed with Reagan's proposed changes to Executive Order 11246?\\" is in \\"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B.

Writing out each step when solving a problem is also a way to help you understand each part of the process required. Writing out steps is a good habit to pick up and maintain. Also, when you’re doing practice problems or taking notes, write out each step. You’ll be glad you did when it comes time for applying steps on the test! Give problem sets careful attention, and do more for practice, if you need it. Even when you’ve found the solution to a math problem, you may not be finished. Take the solution and plug it back into the original problem to see if it’s the correct answer. Word problems are applied math, where you’re given a situation and have to find the right way to solve an associated problem. Since you have to both understand the situation and the necessary math concepts, this type of problem can be especially tricky.  Read through the entire problem before you begin to solve it. Make sure you understand the situation and what math techniques you’ll need to use. Some problems may have associated graphs, charts, or tables. Make sure to read those carefully, too. Select the numbers you’ll need to use to solve the problem. Keep in mind that some word problems might have unneeded details designed to make you use your understanding of what you need to solve it. After you’ve solved the problem, make sure to check your work steps and see whether your answer makes sense in its size and is in the correct units, etc. Your teacher assigns a certain number of problems for homework, but if you don’t feel like you fully understand, you might need to study more problems. Look for extra practice sets in your textbook or online, and try some of those until you feel more confident.  Often times, the answers to all the odd-numbered problems are in the back of the book.  Do the odd-numbered problem, check your answer, and, once you're confident you know how to do it, then do the even-numbered problem next to it. If you’re anxious about taking an exam, do one or more practice ones ahead of time. Try to recreate the test environment--keep your study room quiet, and avoid interruptions. Check your work after taking the practice test, and study more if you need it. Ask your teacher if there are practice versions of tests you can use for study.

For some reason today hes very curious about the things that he sees. He looks around as hes driving and the street lights catch his attention. He realizes that he's never seen someone changing the bulbs in a street light. He also wonders if its a film on the light that makes them have that color or something inside.  Given a vapor light and a regular light bulb, which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb?  Hint: A vapor light produces visible light by electroluminescence. The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like these streetlights, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. Vapor lights are very bright and energy efficient. The bulbs are also long lasting.

Individual donors typically include small donors and major donors, with some political campaigns also leveraging online fundraising platforms for easier contribution. Additionally, candidates can receive in-kind donations, which are non-monetary contributions like goods and services. In the United States, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulates campaign finance rules and ensures transparency in funding sources.

He hides his journal in a shrine to the Virgin Mary outside the castle and descends into the crypt, where he finds Dracula and the vampire woman resting in their coffins. Armed with a stake, he impales the woman, who, as he looks on, immediately ages from young to old.

Let's break down the premise and hypothesis into smaller components and analyze them to understand why. First, let's consider the premise: \\"A group of people sit on and in front of a graffiti covered wall.\\" This statement provides us with three key pieces of information: 1. There is a group of people. 2. The wall is covered with graffiti. 3. The people are sitting either on or in front of the wall. Next, let's look at the hypothesis: \\"A group of people sit around a painted wall.\\" This statement also provides three key pieces of information: 1. There is a group of people. 2. The wall is painted. 3. The people are sitting around the wall. Comparing the details provided by the premise and the hypothesis, we can identify the following overlaps and discrepancies: 1. Both the premise and the hypothesis mention a group of people. This fact is consistent in both statements. 2. When considering the state of the wall, the premise mentions the wall is covered with graffiti, while the hypothesis states the wall is painted. While it is plausible to infer that graffiti is a form of paint, the intent behind the two descriptions may not be the same. Graffiti typically refers to drawings, writings, or designs that are done illicitly on a wall, whereas a painted wall could refer to a legally-painted, intended design, or even a plain painted wall. So, while it is possible that the graffiti-covered wall mentioned in the premise and the painted wall mentioned in the hypothesis could be referring to the same wall, we cannot confirm this with certainty based on the given information. 3. The premise states that the people are sitting either on or in front of the wall, while the hypothesis suggests that the people are sitting around the wall. Sitting \\"around\\" a wall could imply that the people are not only sitting in front of the wall but also possibly behind or to the sides of the wall. The difference in the description of where the people are sitting further complicates the ability to confirm or deny the hypothesis based on the premise provided. In conclusion, although there is some overlap between the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot definitively determine the truth of the hypothesis based solely on the premise. The information provided in the premise does not give us enough clarity about the state of the wall and the exact positioning of the people to confirm or reject the hypothesis as true or false."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The legal action is aiming to establish the drivers with worker status, rather than as self-employed customers or partners - which is how Uber sees them. The first four cases were lodged last week, arguing the company is breaching its duty on basic rights. Uber says most of its drivers want the flexibility its approach offers. Drivers pay a fee to use the Uber technology. When a job comes up the nearest driver is offered it, otherwise it goes to the next person. For this, Uber takes a fee of 20%, soon to rise to 25% for new drivers. Employment lawyer Nigel Mackay, who is representing the drivers, said Uber was not complying with employment law. Watch Jim Reed's film about Uber here. \\"What we want to do is try and ensure these drivers get workers' rights, the rights that anyone who works is entitled to. Things like minimum wage, the right to paid holiday,\\" he said. He added that the ways in which Uber controlled its drivers - including the provision of initial training, guides as to which routes to take and requirements for minimum hours - meant they were not just self-employed. Mr Mackay said there were also serious health and safety issues as currently Uber did not ensure its drivers take rest breaks or work a maximum number of hours per week. \\"A lot of these workers work 50, 60, 70 hours per week - they should be entitled to paid time off for doing that work,\\" he said. \\"I think it's true that there's a real risk to health and safety if drivers are being pushed by circumstance to drive these long hours - because they are not sitting in an office, it is a potentially dangerous job.\\" James Farrar has worked for Uber since last December. \\"I joined because I was working on a start-up so I needed the flexibility to work when I wanted, while having the remainder free for research and writing. The flexibility with Uber is really great. \\"The only problem is that when you're not working you're not earning and your earnings are so much lower than I expected. It's really starting to bite now. \\"It's more difficult to make money than six months ago. There's a certain amount of money [I want to be earning] each day and I just need to stay out longer and longer to earn it. \\"My average pay in July was £5.03 an hour, well below the minimum wage. So if you want to cover your costs and keep the family afloat, you've got to work a lot of hours. \\"I wouldn't want to be picked up myself by somebody who has worked 18 hours a day. Since we are self-employed, Uber does not take responsibility for that occupational risk. \\"I could get another job, but Uber has so aggressively come into the market, the chances of working for other operators are rapidly evaporating.\\" GMB, the union that represents professional drivers, has instructed Leigh Day to take the action on behalf of its members driving for Uber. The first cases were submitted to the London Central Employment Tribunal. The law firm says it will be submitting further claims and will be asking the tribunal to hear them all together. Uber describes itself as a \\"fully licenced\\" service that connects potential passengers with a background-checked private driver and takes a cut - typically 20% - of the fee. It currently operates in 10 cities in the UK. It had 7,000 drivers in London in 2014, a number which has risen to 20,000 this year. Uber says the drivers are self-employed not workers and therefore and therefore they do not have to guarantee them a minimum wage. Uber's regional general manager, Jo Bertram, said most of its drivers had moved from traditional jobs with prescribed shifts as they wanted the flexibility Uber's approach offered. \\"The fact you can work literally whenever you want, spend time with kids, you can build business on the side. That's the flexibility the majority of Uber drivers are looking for,\\" she said. She added the company looked at how much money the drivers took home very carefully. \\"What we find is drivers using the app actually take home around £15 or £16 an hour. Obviously their costs vary hugely depending on whether they rent or own and a number of other factors, but the majority are actually making around £10/12 per hour even after costs.\\" The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel. This article was about:","output":"The article talks about a potential legal action against the ridesharing company Uber, concerning the employment status of its drivers. The legal action aims to categorize Uber drivers as workers, contrasting with Uber’s characterization of their drivers as self-employed customers or partners. The first four cases have already been filed, with the claim that Uber is failing to uphold the fundamental rights of its drivers.  Uber asserts that its drivers prefer the flexibility it provides. The drivers pay a fee to access Uber's technology, and for every job completed, Uber takes a fee of 20%, which is soon set to increase to 25% for new drivers. The drivers are represented by employment attorney Nigel Mackay, who argues that Uber is out of compliance with employment law. Among other things, he asserts that due to the level of control exerted by Uber over its drivers – including trainings, route suggestions, and setting minimum hours – the drivers should be seen as something more than just self-employed. Mr. Mackay also raises safety concerns, as he alleges that Uber does not mandate its drivers to take breaks or restrict their working hours. He warns of the potential hazards associated with this, saying that many drivers end up working over 50 hours a week without rest. James Farrar, an Uber driver since the previous December, also expresses his dissatisfaction with the pay, stating that earnings have been significantly lower than anticipated. In July, his average pay was £5.03/hour, which is significantly below the minimum wage. The GMB Union, which represents professional drivers, has directed the law firm Leigh Day to address these concerns on behalf of Uber drivers. Initial claims have been filed with the London Central Employment Tribunal. The law firm plans to submit further claims and request for their collective adjudication. Uber, however, contends that its drivers are self-employed and not workers, and hence it isn't obligated to assure them a minimum wage. Jo Bertram, Uber's Regional General Manager, says that most of their drivers appreciate the flexibility Uber offers. In an attempt to mitigate criticisms about the drivers’ earnings, she adds that on average, drivers earn around £15 or £16 per hour before costs.

After the photo of Weiner's crotch went public, Lee said, \\"he asked me to lie\\" about the relationship. She said she issued a three-sentence statement at Weiner's request.      On June 2, Lee said Weiner called her and told her to avoid the media. According to Lee, Weiner believed if they both said nothing the story would calm down and die. Now Lee wants Weiner to resign.      \\"I think that Anthony Weiner should resign, because he lied. He lied to the public and the press for more than a week,\\" she said. \\"If he lied about this, I can't have much faith in him about anything else.\\"      House Democrats and President Obama have all urged the congressman to step down.      Weiner, who has taken a two-week leave from the House, is currently at an undisclosed location seeking treatment for an undisclosed disorder. His wife, Huma Abedin, aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, returned from a trip to Africa with Clinton this morning.      The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| Amid all the chaos and confusion of Rep. Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal, somehow Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred got connected with one of the New York Democrat's female electronic correspondents.      And today, the pair opted to call a news conference in New York to announce that they would really like to avoid publicity and get on with their private lives.      Because Weiner has refrained from publicly texting his whereabouts and desires the last couple of days, times were slow on the power/sex news front. So, fewer than several hundred news media showed up at the Friars Club to watch the shy women enter down a spiral staircase.      Weiner's texting partner is a Tennessean known as Ginger Lee. She is a former porn actress and what Allred calls a \\"featured dancer,\\" who is studying to become a real estate agent and likes long walks on the beac h. We made up that last part.      Lee carefully read a written statement (see video below).      Mainly, in her attempt to duck publicity, Lee said she had not responded in kind to Weiner's suggestive sexts but had continued exchanging maybe 100 messages since March, mostly about politics, she said. And especially about the managed care opt-out for certain states that obtain healthcare waivers by the deadline set out in Section 14 (v). We made up that last part again.      Lee said the married Democrat would often steer their political exchanges toward sexual subjects, one time proudly texting her: \\"I have wardrobe demands too. I need to highlight my package.\\" We did not make up that last part.      Lee also said that Weiner, who apparently got her phone number somehow, called when the scandal began to urge her to lie about their relationship.      She said she became disturbed when she saw the New York representative lie on national television about the photo of a brief-covered package that Weiner originally said was sent from his Twitter account by a hacker.      Lee said she wanted to get on with her regular life. Somehow, shortly after the news conference, word leaked that Lee was off the unemployment line and would be uncovering her package tonight at an Atlanta strip club.      Weiner has since admitted lying about the hacker and numerous other things during these three years of explicit online exchanges with a half-dozen women who are not his wife.      Wife Huma Abedin returned from a lengthy Africa trip with her boss, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, early today.      The 46-year-old Weiner is on a two-week leave of absence allegedly receiving some kind of treatment for something and consulting with his wife on growing demands for his resignation after seven terms in the House.      Even BlackBerry addict President Obama has weighed in on the titilating distractions of shower photos and explicit texts between a man and women he's never met.      When asked about the fellow Democrat by NBC's Ann Curry, Obama said if he were in Weiner's towel, he would resign.

If I tell you that Solar panels absorb sunlight. , and ask you the question \\"what absorbs sunlight? \\", is the correct answer \\"organic molecules\\"?","output":"While organic molecules can absorb sunlight, the correct answer based on the statement you provided – \\"Solar panels absorb sunlight.\\" – would be \\"solar panels.\\" However, I can provide more context on both solar panels and organic molecules to help you better understand their roles in absorbing sunlight.  Solar Panels: Solar panels, also known as photovoltaic (PV) panels, absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity. They are made up of solar cells, which contain semiconductor materials, typically silicon. When sunlight strikes the solar cell, the photons in sunlight transfer their energy to the atoms inside the semiconductor materials. This process, called the photovoltaic effect, causes the electrons in the semiconductor to move, creating an electric current. Organic Molecules: Organic molecules, meanwhile, are compounds that consist of carbon and hydrogen atoms bonded together and may include other elements such as nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur. Both natural (e.g., chlorophyll in plants) and synthetic (e.g., organic solar cells) organic molecules are capable of absorbing sunlight. In the process of photosynthesis, chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and converts it to chemical energy that sustains plant growth and development. Organic solar cells, also called organic photovoltaics (OPVs), are an emerging type of solar cell technology made from organic materials. These cells have several benefits, including being flexible, lightweight, and relatively inexpensive to manufacture. Organic solar cells work by using organic molecules as the active layer that absorbs sunlight, generating electric currents through a process called exciton diffusion. However, their efficiency is currently lower than that of silicon-based solar cells. In summary, while organic molecules are indeed capable of absorbing sunlight, the correct answer based on your initial statement would be that \\"solar panels\\" absorb sunlight. Solar panels utilize silicon-based solar cells, whereas organic molecules can absorb sunlight in different contexts such as photosynthesis or organic photovoltaics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Bloody Mama Context: Young Kate Barker (Lisa Jill) is brutalized by her father and older brothers, who rape her. Thirty-five years later, the middle-aged Kate 'Ma' Barker (Shelley Winters) now brutalizes innocent people herself, while indulging her monstrous sexual appetites. She lives by robbing banks with her four sons; the pragmatic Arthur (Clint Kimbrough), the sadistic Herman (Don Stroud), the bisexual Fred (Robert Walden), and the loyal, drug-addicted Lloyd (Robert De Niro). It all begins in the late 1920s when Ma leaves her husband, George, and her Arkansas home and embarks on her own with her four sons on a robbery-murder spree to make her own fortune, while keeping them under a tight leash. When Herman and Fred are arrested and imprisoned for petty theft charges, Ma takes over the group and leads Arthur and Lloyd on a bank robbery spree to gain enough money to get her sons out of jail. The gang is joined by a gunman named Kevin (Bruce Dern) who was Fred's cellmate during his incarceration (and his strongly implied lover). The group is also joined by a local prostitute named Mona Gibson, whom Herman frequented before his imprisonment. The gang resorts to more violent action and robberies. While hiding out at a cabin in Kentucky, Lloyd comes across a young woman swimming at a nearby lake whom he sexually assaults. Not wanting the woman to report them to the police, the Barkers hold her captive and Ma eventually kills her by drowning her, despite the protests of her sons. Some time later, the gang arrives in Tennessee where they abduct a wealthy businessman named Sam Pendlebury (Pat Hingle). Holding him for a 300,000 ransom, the sons, particularly Herman, bond with their captive whom they see as the sympathetic father figure they never had. When Herman and Mona go to collect the ransom, they are chased by a pair of FBI agents and barely escape. When they find that the ransom is only half of what they originally demanded, Ma orders her sons to kill Sam rather than let him go. But none of them can bring themselves to do it... Answer:","output":"Ma leaves her husband, George, and her Arkansas home in the late 1920s.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The European space agency has unveiled the full image sequence of Philae's historic descent on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. The probe made its dramatic touchdown on 12 November while the comet was travelling at an incredible 34,000 mph (55,000 km per hour). This series of 19 images tracks the probe's seven hour journey as it fell 14 miles (22.5km) towards the comet's icy surface. Scroll down for video. The latest images were taken from Rosetta’s Osiris camera with the timestamp marked in GMT. Only a few frames of this image series had been made public previously. When Philae first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. While its precise location still remains unknown, early images suggest the probe landed with two legs on the ground and one pointing into space, which is severely limiting its access to sunlight. Since then the search has been on to identify it in higher-resolution images, but now that Rosetta has moved to a different orbit, and is further away from the comet, the chances of observing the lander are less. Previously, only a few frames of this image series had been made public. The latest images were taken from Rosetta’s Osiris camera with the timestamp marked in GMT. While its precise location still remains unknown, early images suggest the probe landed with two legs on the ground and one pointing into space, which is severely limiting its access to sunlight. It is shown here during the fifth stage of its descent. Controllers have now said they will simply wait for Philae to make contact with its mothership. Rosetta engineers in Darmstadt, Germany, will begin to monitor the feed in a few weeks' time and say there could be a chance the communication will be established in May or June. During these months, improved lighting conditions at the probe's assumed location could provide enough power to run the onboard radio transmitter. Radio tests on the probe just before it lost power have narrowed down its location to somewhere in a strip of terrain roughly 350m by 30m. Rosetta camera's scoured this location in early December, and each of its images were scanned by mission controllers to see if they could spot any pixels that were brighter than the rest. But Philae still couldn't be found. If Philae gets its power back, it would resume all science observations, which could take place in August, just when the comet is at its most active phase, according to a report by the BBC. In the meantime, the scientific haul from the comet continues as Rosetta continues its orbit around the icy body - and now illustrations have revealed amazing new details of the comet. An array of colours and diagrams highlight the gravitational field of the comet, thermal energy trapped between its cliffs and organic compounds on its surface. Scientists are hoping to answer many questions about this and other comets, including its formation, structure and evolution over time. Controllers have now said they will wait for Philae to make contact with its mothership. Philae is seen here on its seven-hour descent. When Philae first made contact, a few hours after this image was taken, it failed to fire harpoons causing it to bounce twice before landing. Using data from the Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System (Osiris) and the Radio Science Investigation instrument, scientists have now been able to calculate the comet’s gravitational field. They have found that the gravitational force at the ‘lobes’ - the two ends of the comet - is about six times stronger than at the neck - the narrower area connecting the two lobes. It is still unknown whether the two-lobed shape of the comet is the result of two smaller bodies coming together, or if the neck has been ‘eaten’ away over time - like the core of an apple. Currently the latter theory is becoming the preferred explanation, as it appears the two lobes have similar structures – indicating they have the same origin. From this gravitational data scientists also found that comet’s density is about half that of water. Dr Holger Sierks from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, who was involved in the studies, told MailOnline that they now had a greater understanding of the comet's interior. Pictured is the current lander search area. Now that Rosetta has moved to a different orbit, and is further away from the comet, the chances of observing the lander are less, Rosetta engineers have said. The blurry image captures the rapid motion in which Philae was launched back out into space. The probe was launched to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) and then to a much lower height of 65ft (20 metres) before coming to rest. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is showing signs of waking up early as it streaks towards the Sun at  47,800 mph (76,900 km/h). As it approaches the sun, the rubber duck-shaped lump of ice, dust and rock is expected to heat up and release more gas and water vapour from its interior. Comets are most active when they reach perihelion, the point in their orbit when they are closest to the Sun. But even at a distance of more than 200 million miles (320 million km), comet 67P is beginning to stir in dramatic fashion. Dr Dennis Bodewits, from the University of Maryland, US, who led one of several teams reporting latest findings from the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission in the journal Science, said: 'We are already seeing more activity. 'Jets are sprouting up everywhere. We've been surprised to see how active it is. It already has more jets than many other comets do at perihelion.' He said the interior is now thought to be analogous to 'ash, cigarette ash or super-dry powder snow.' Data from several instruments, meanwhile, has shown that the comet’s neck is the source of most of the dust and gas it is ejecting. The reason for this is quite interesting. Based on data, the Rosetta team found that the neck receives less energy than the rest of the comet because it is shaded. However, the two lobes either side trap radiation, with energy being ‘bounced’ between cliffs, causing the neck to be move active. The low gravitational pull of the neck also means that less force is needed to blow its dust and gas away than at the lobes. From the images and data, five basic - but diverse - categories of terrain type have been determined: dust-covered; brittle materials with pits and circular structures; large-scale depressions; smooth terrains; and more ‘rock-like’ surfaces. Much of the comet also appears to be covered in dust, as a result of dust that is dragged along by the comet falling to the surface over time. One prominent and intriguing feature is a 1,640ft (500m) long crack seen roughly parallel to the neck of the comet, running between its two larger lobes at either end. The biggest question remaining about the comet, though, is how it formed. Two predominant theories remain: either it is the result of two smaller bodies ‘sticking’ together, forming a single comet, or its central neck has been eaten away over time like the core of an apple. Rosetta is essentially living with the comet as it moves towards the sun along its orbit, learning how its behaviour changes on a daily basis and, over longer timescales, how its activity increases, how its surface may evolve, and how it interacts with the solar wind,’ said Esa Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor. ‘We have already learned a lot in the few months we have been alongside the comet, but as more and more data are collected and analysed from this close study of the comet we hope to answer many key questions about its origin and evolution.’ This graphic reveals the sequence of huge bounces before the Philae probe came to its final, unknown resting spot in November.

Philae had some trouble landing because its harpoons did not keep it attached to the comet, causing it to bounce before landing on the surface. Scientists are still trying to find Philae's exact location on the comet, and they hope it will make contact with its mothership, Rosetta.

Each friend took on a task to help prepare the party, like making snacks, blowing up balloons, and creating fun activities. On the day of the party, the sun was shining brightly and the skies were blue. As the guests arrived, they were amazed by the beautiful decorations and the delicious smell of the food. Everyone couldn't wait to join in the fun! There were lots of activities for everyone to enjoy. They played games like musical chairs and hide-and-seek, laughed at funny jokes, and sang their favorite songs together. Whenever someone felt tired, they could sit down and have some yummy treats, like cupcakes, fruit, and lemonade. As the sun began to set, the friends gathered around a big table to enjoy the feast they had prepared. They shared stories about their adventures and laughed at their favorite memories. The friends felt happy and grateful to have each other in their lives. Finally, it was time for the party to come to an end. As the friends said their goodbyes, they all agreed that the day had been perfect. They couldn't have asked for a better time together.

Finalement, la Cour a jugé que la notification de la sentence ou la déclaration d'exequatur dans le pays où la sentence avait été rendue n'était pas exigée pour la reconnaissance et l'exécution selon l'article 1061 du Code allemand de procédure civile (“ZPO”). Translate to English","output":"In the end, the Court ruled that notification of the judgment or the declaration of enforceability in the country where the judgment had been rendered was not required for recognition and enforcement under Article 1061 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (\\"ZPO\\"). This decision by the Court essentially means that, in this particular case, the parties involved did not need to take additional steps to have the judgment recognized and enforced in the country where it was initially delivered. Article 1061 of the German Code of Civil Procedure outlines the specific requirements and procedures necessary for a foreign judgment to be recognized and enforced within Germany. With this ruling, the Court has indicated that the notification and declaration of enforceability in the originating country is not a mandatory requirement under these rules. In making this determination, the Court may have considered factors such as the nature of the judgment, the relevant laws of the countries involved, and any potential impact on international comity or public policy. By clarifying the interpretation of Article 1061, the Court has provided guidance not only for the parties involved in the case, but also for future parties dealing with similar cross-border recognition and enforcement matters. This ruling may encourage a more streamlined and efficient approach to international dispute resolution, as it simplifies the process for obtaining recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment. This could lead to faster resolution of disputes, reduced legal costs for the parties involved, and stronger cross-border legal cooperation. However, it is important to note that this is an interpretation of a specific provision within the German Code of Civil Procedure and may not necessarily apply universally or in other jurisdictions. For parties seeking recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments, it is crucial to consult with experienced legal counsel who can navigate the complex web of international law and provide tailored guidance based on the unique circumstances of each case."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Уникальность системы – в отделении главного сервера, управляющего системой, от сервера показов , что означает отсутствие необходимости постоянного соединения между главным управляющим модулем и браузерами пользователей. Translate to English English:","output":"The uniqueness of the system lies in the separation of the main server, which manages the system, from the display server, which means there is no need for a constant connection between the main control module and the users' browsers. In more detail, this unique system architecture offers a number of advantages that can improve efficiency, performance, and user experience. First and foremost, by separating the main server and the display server, the system can distribute the workload more effectively. The main server handles the administrative, management, and control-level tasks, while the display server focuses on delivering content to the end users' browsers. This division of labor allows for smoother system operations and reduces the likelihood of server crashes or slowdowns due to workload overload. Additionally, this separation minimizes the need for continuous communication between the main control module and users' browsers. As a result, the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and memory usage of the main server can be optimized. In turn, this can lead to improved system performance, faster response times, and an overall better user experience. Moreover, this unique system design enhances security by creating an additional layer of protection between the main server and the users' browsers. With the display server acting as a buffer, potential cyber threats and attacks are less likely to penetrate the main server. This design can then minimize system vulnerability and safeguard sensitive data and system integrity. Furthermore, a separate display server can potentially offer more flexibility in terms of content delivery, as it allows updates, modifications, and optimizations to be performed on the front-end without requiring the main server to be modified or taken offline. This could result in fewer service interruptions for users and a more seamless content delivery experience. In conclusion, the uniqueness of this system lies in its separation of the main server and the display server. This design not only contributes to improved performance, efficiency, and user experience, but it also supports enhanced security and flexibility within the system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Previously known as Pilot, The Pride and Snowfield, the band currently consists of Tom Smith (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Russell Leetch (bass guitar, synthesizer, backing vocals), Ed Lay (drums, percussion, backing vocals), Justin Lockey (lead guitar), and Elliott Williams (keys, synthesizers, guitars, and backing vocals). Editors have so far released two platinum studio albums, and six in total, with several million combined sales. Their debut album After supporting bands such as Puressence and Oceansize, Editors released debut single \\"Bullets\\" recorded with producer Gavin Monaghan as a limited edition of 1000 copies on Kitchenware Records on 24 January 2005. The song had previously been played by BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Zane Lowe, where it earned the honour of 'Single of the Week'. The limited run then sold out on the day of its release, with copies famously then sold later in the week for more than PS30 on eBay.  The release of \\"Munich\\" followed in April of that year and gave the band their first Top 25 hit, another sold out UK tour and a place on MTV's Spanking New Music show in Manchester. At this point, due to the band's increasing popularity, Editors and Kitchenware signed an exclusive distribution deal with Sony BMG. \\"Blood\\" was released two months later, reaching number 18 in the UK Singles Chart in its first week, selling 5,286 copies. With these releases their fanbase continued to grow and on 25 July 2005 their debut album The Back Room was released to critical acclaim and commercial success. In its first week, the album entered the charts at number 13, selling 17,627 copies. After re-issuing \\"Bullets\\" and achieving another Top 30 hit, Editors gained a high-profile support slot, supporting Franz Ferdinand in arenas across the UK and Europe.  Editors then re-issued \\"Munich\\" in January 2006, selling one and half thousand more copies than the last time it was released. The song gave Editors their first Top 10 single and an appearance on Top of the Pops. With the single release, The Back Room also rose back up the album charts, peaking at number 2. It sold an additional 40,000 copies in the week of \\"Munich\\"'s release and went platinum in the process. A joint North American tour with Stellastarr* coincided with the American release of The Back Room in March 2006. It was released by Fader Label and sold 35,000 albums after 20 weeks. The band went on to play influential American festivals in 2006 such as Coachella and Lollapalooza. Editors proceeded to perform \\"Munich\\" on the American television show Late Night with Conan O'Brien.  At the end of March, Editors released \\"All Sparks\\" as a single in the United Kingdom, achieving a position of 21 in the singles chart. After a European tour which included three successive nights at Brixton Academy, Editors re-issued a limited edition of \\"Blood\\". It entered the Top 40, pushing the album up the chart 45 places. Shortly after this, The Back Room hit the million mark in sales worldwide and was also nominated for the 2006 Mercury Prize.

Information:  - A papal bull is a particular type of public decree, letters patent, or charter issued by a pope of the Roman Catholic Church. It is named after the lead seal (\\"bulla\\") that was traditionally appended to the end in order to authenticate it.  - The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem was a crusader state established in the Southern Levant in 1099 after the First Crusade. The kingdom lasted nearly two hundred years, from 1099 until 1291 when the last remaining possession, Acre, was destroyed by the Mamluks, but its history is divided into two distinct periods. The sometimes so-called First Kingdom of Jerusalem lasted from 1099 to 1187, when it was almost entirely overrun by Saladin. After the subsequent Third Crusade, the kingdom was re-established in Acre in 1192, and lasted until that city's destruction in 1291. This second kingdom is sometimes called the Second Kingdom of Jerusalem or the Kingdom of Acre, after its new capital.  - An-Nasir Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (/ ALA-LC: \\"al ad-Dn Ysuf ibn Ayyb\\"; / ALC-LC: \\"Selahedînê Eyûbî\\"), known as Saladin (1137  4 March 1193), was the first sultan of Egypt and Syria and the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. A Sunni Muslim of Kurdish origin, Saladin led the Muslim military campaign against the Crusader states in the Levant. At the height of his power, his sultanate included Egypt, Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, the Hejaz, Yemen and other parts of North Africa.  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God.  - The Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem was a Roman Catholic military order founded by crusaders around 1119 at a leper hospital in Jerusalem , Kingdom of Jerusalem , whose care became its original purpose , named after patron saint Lazarus . It was recognised by King Fulk of Jerusalem in 1142 and canonically recognised as hospitaller and military order of chivalry under the rule of Saint Augustine in the Papal bull Cum a Nobis Petitur of Pope Alexander IV in 1255 . The titular seat was successively situated at Jerusalem , Saint - Jean - d'Acre and - after the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem - the Château Royal de Boigny - sur - Bionne in France . After several centuries , the order went into decline and ceased to perform its original functions after the French Revolution . In 1489 , Pope Innocent VIII attempted to merge the order and its land holdings with the Sovereign Military Order of Malta . This was resisted by the order in most countries where it still retained its premises . In 1572 , the Order of Saint Lazarus in Italy was merged with the Order of Saint Maurice under the Royal House of Savoy to form the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus , which still exists until today . In 1609 , King Henry IV of France linked it administratively to the Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel to form the Royal Military and Hospitaller Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem united , which remained listed as of royal protection in the French Royal Almanac until 1830 . Its last living member admitted before the turmoil of the French Revolution died in 1856 . Notwithstanding , the revived Order of Saint Lazarus ( statuted 1910 ) claims legacy from the suppressed French branch under spiritual protection of the Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church , disputed by officials of the Roman Catholic Church .  - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world.  - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  - The First Crusade (10951099) was the first of a number of crusades that attempted to capture the Holy Land, called by Pope Urban II in 1095. It started as a widespread pilgrimage in western Christendom and ended as a military expedition by Roman Catholic Europe to regain the Holy Land taken in the Muslim conquests of the Levant (632661), ultimately resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099.   - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - Abrahamic religions, emphasizing and tracing their common origin to the tribal patriarch Abraham or recognizing a spiritual tradition identified with him, are one of the major divisions in comparative religion (along with Indian, Iranian, and East Asian religions). Judaism, Christianity and Islam are the largest Abrahamic religions in terms of numbers of adherents.  - Mamluk (Arabic: \\"mamlk\\" (singular), \\"mamlk\\" (plural), meaning \\"property\\" , also transliterated as \\"mamlouk\\", \\"mamluq\\", \\"mamluke\\", \\"mameluk\\", \\"mameluke\\", \\"mamaluke\\" or \\"marmeluke\\") is an Arabic designation for slaves. The term is most commonly used to refer to Muslim slave soldiers and Muslim rulers of slave origin.  - Abraham (Avraham), originally Abram, is the first of the three patriarchs of Judaism. His story features in the holy texts of all the Abrahamic religions and Abraham plays a prominent role as an example of faith in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  - A patron saint, patroness saint, patron hallow or heavenly protector is a saint who in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy is regarded as the heavenly advocate of a nation, place, craft, activity, class, clan, family or person.

Early performances of the song \\"Hurt\\", for example, were accompanied by a projected montage of clouds, charred bodies, mushroom clouds, maggots, and war refugees, a performance of which is featured in the song's music video.  Recent performances of the song, however, have featured less lighting effects. Since 1999, the visual presentation of Nine Inch Nails live shows have been directed by Rob Sheridan, while Bill Viola designed a large triptych display for the Fragility tour.  The images displayed on the triptych focused on storm and water imagery.  And All That Could Have Been features an audio commentary track by Viola describing the display and his inspirations for it.For the Live: With Teeth tour, Roy Bennett and Martin Phillips were responsible for the lighting design and stage design respectively.  Bennett explained in a 2005 interview that much of the lighting was done using a series of LED lights arranged in \\"stalactites or stalagmites [formations] to tie in to the album artwork\\".  DLP projectors were also used to project images onto a gauze screen in front of the stage.

(Associated Press)      Robert Durst, far right, photographed through fencing, is escorted into Orleans Parish Criminal District Court through a tunnel entrance, in New Orleans, Monday, March 16, 2015. Durst waived extradition... (Associated Press)      Analysis linking a letter Durst wrote to his friend Susan Berman a year before her death with one he said \\"only the killer could have written\\" to point police to her body was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation into the 2000 killing, the official not authorized to speak publicly told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.      Durst, 71, was charged Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Berman, the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime.      He waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him late Monday with being a felon in possession of a gun because he had a revolver when he was arrested there Saturday. It was not clear how soon he would be returned to California.      Attorney Dick DeGuerin said outside court that Durst didn't kill Berman, and is \\"ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial.\\"      Presented with the two letters in the finale of \\"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst\\" that aired Sunday on HBO, the eccentric heir blinked, burped oddly, pulled his ear and briefly put his head in his hands before denying he was the killer.      Then he stepped away from the tense interview and went to the bathroom, still wearing the live microphone that recorded what he said next.      \\"There it is. You're caught!\\" Durst whispered before the sound of running water is heard. \\"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\\"      That moment didn't just make for a captivating ending to the documentary on the eccentric life of an heir to a New York real estate fortune, it could also provide additional evidence for prosecutors.      The official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the bathroom recording was not presented to prosecutors before charges were filed because detectives were still trying to determine if the recording was tampered with in any way.      But legal experts said the audio and other parts of the interview could become key evidence.      \\"Any statement that the defendant makes that they want to use against him, they can use against him,\\" said Andrea Roth, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \\"Even if it's sketchy, and only in context appears to make him look guilty.\\"      Kerry Lawrence, a defense attorney in Westchester County, New York, said Durst's lawyers will have to try to explain away his comments, perhaps dismissing them as a joke.      \\"Prosecutors would argue it was a candid moment of self-reflection, and I assume will argue that he knew he was still being recorded, and this was either said in jest or he was being facetious or sarcastic or was being provocative,\\" Lawrence said. \\"I don't think it's quite the smoking gun.\\"      Durst — still worth millions despite his estrangement from his family, whose New York real estate empire is worth about 4 billion — has maintained his innocence in three killings in as many states.      When Durst approached the filmmakers and agreed to go on camera, against the advice of his lawyers, he had already weathered one murder case, winning an acquittal in a gory Galveston, Texas, dismemberment case by claiming he shot his neighbor in self-defense.      He was still suspected in the killing of Berman, whose father was a Las Vegas mobster associated with Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky, and the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, who was declared dead long after she vanished in New York in 1982.      Berman, 55, was shot once in the back of the head at her home near Beverly Hills shortly before New York investigators planned to question her about Kathleen Durst's disappearance.      The documentary showed filmmaker Andrew Jarecki confronting Durst with a copy of an anonymous letter that alerted Beverly Hills police to look for a \\"cadaver\\" at Berman's address.      Durst offered that whoever sent it was \\"taking a big risk. You're sending a letter to police that only the killer could have written.\\"      Then, in the final episode, Jarecki revealed another envelope, which Durst acknowledged mailing to Berman, that has similar writing in block letters and also misspelled the address as \\"Beverley.\\"      \\"I wrote this one but I did not write the cadaver one,\\" Durst said. But when shown an enlargement of both copies, Durst couldn't distinguish them.      New York defense lawyer Michael Devorkin said the surprising thing was that police never unearthed the letter to Berman that filmmakers got their hands on.      \\"Even if Durst wasn't the prime suspect, you would think they would have been looking through all her papers to see if the person who killed her had ever written her a letter,\\" Devorkin said. \\"Finding the letter was pure good fortune.\\"      With the bathroom recording immediately following the confrontation over the two handwriting samples, prosecutors have strong evidence, said Devorkin, who handles white-collar criminal cases.      \\"How often do you have a Perry Mason moment to end your documentary?\\" he said.      ___      Melley and Tami Abdollah reported from Los Angeles.

Tomales Bay hunting season protested The winter migration of waterfowl over Tomales Bay is in full swing, and so is the squabble over duck hunting on a state-owned reserve at the estuary's southern end near the town of Point Reyes Station. The Tomales Bay Ecological Reserve is 483 acres of salt marsh and tidal flats that attract flights of local and migratory ducks and geese to an area that has been hunted by West Marin shotgunners for more than a century. But the sport is being challenged by animal rights advocates and some residents who are fed up with being awakened at dawn as hunters blast away in a place they think should be reserved for bird watching, not bird shooting. \\"It's not the same place as it was when they hunted years ago,\\" said Pat Healy, who has lived for more than 40 years in Point Reyes Station, population about 900. \\"It's past its time as a hunting ground.\\" It's another case of one group's established tradition colliding with another group's push for change. And both sides are aggressively collecting signatures on petitions supporting their views. In the middle is the state Department of Fish and Game, which owns the reserve and allows waterfowl hunting from mid-October to late January - a privilege opponents want rescinded. Healy is among a dozen or so homeowners who in recent weeks have gathered outside of the downtown Post Office and collected hundreds of signatures from locals and visitors. Their petition asserts that hunting \\"negatively impacts wildlife in the area, creates an unacceptable noise disturbance for our bayside communities and puts recreational users of the bay at risk.\\" Hunters, however, say the complaints are unfounded and dismiss them as attempts to infringe on a way of life that lifelong residents such as Robert Arndt of Inverness trace to their ancestors. \\"I am the fourth generation hunting on Tomales Bay. ... My kids will be the fifth and, if I'm lucky, my grandkids will be the sixth,\\" said Arndt, 46, who runs a local construction company. Like others who grew up in the area, Arndt learned to hunt in the reserve as a youngster with his father and grandfather. He is among the hunters who regularly set out their blinds and decoys and say they are \\"trying to preserve something for the next generation\\" in a county where public hunting areas are limited to two other sites - on San Pablo Bay and the Petaluma Marsh. \\"It's not just about me,\\" he said. \\"If we take this away, then the young people who are coming up in our society will not get a chance to experience what I experience.\\" Retired Marin County deputy sheriff Skip Richardson agreed. \\"It's part of our ancestry,\\" said Richardson, who remembered hunting lessons from his dad and granddad during overcast days spent in the bay, and the many subsequent outings he spent there with his children. \\"But I resent the fact that people with no standing come in here and try to take a way a God-given right every resident has had for several hundred years,\\" he added. Homeowners who live near the bay, such as Sylvia Timbers, see it differently and complain they are awakened on weekends by the sound of shotguns targeting waterfowl in the wetlands. \\"It's not just hearing the gunshots,\\" said Timbers, an author whose hillside home in Inverness overlooks a part of the reserve a quarter mile away. She said she is offended that hunters use blinds, decoys and duck calls to lure birds away from a nearby sanctuary, where hunting is outlawed. \\"We invite these birds to a party and hunters shoot them when they get there - it's just awful.\\" That sanctuary is the 560-acre Giacomini Wetlands, once a sprawling dairy pasture created from reclaimed marsh and tidal land by a prominent ranching family. It was purchased in 2008 by the National Park Service as a restoration site to help return Tomales Bay to its natural state. Hunting is outlawed there, but the property abuts the Fish and Game reserve, where hunting is allowed. Hunting near what conservationists agree is a haven for wildlife is seen by Susan Prince and other animal rights activists as an \\"ecological trap.\\" \\"Ethically, (hunting is) just the wrong thing to do,\\" said Prince, who has lived for 15 years in Point Reyes Station. \\"It's for the enjoyment of a few people and has an adverse affect on many more.\\" Timbers, who has lived in the area for more than 15 years, started an online advocacy group last year after she was awakened by \\"40 to 50\\" gunshots. The group, called Action Tomales Bay, is meant to draw attention to what Timbers said is an increasing level of hunting that has distressed a growing number of homeowners each season. Meanwhile, nearly 600 hunters and other supporters from across the region have signed an online petition on www.change.org, a Web site that Scott McMorrow of Inverness set up to keep the reserve open to hunting. McMorrow, who seldom hunts, said he believes hunters should have a platform to help protect their sport. Both sides plan to present petitions in May to the California Fish and Game Commission, which adopts and oversees policies of the Department of Fish and Game. John Krause, a wildlife biologist for Fish and Game, said the reserve is patrolled by game wardens who enforce hunting regulations that include a daily bag of seven ducks and eight geese per hunter. Hunting is permitted in the reserve between sunrise and sunset. \\"If hunters are within the reserve and they're not trespassing,\\" Krause said, \\"they're totally legal.\\" The disparate views that for years have shaped hunting into a contentious issue in West Marin are acknowledged by Craig Allen, who traveled one recent weekend to the reserve from his Santa Rosa home in Sonoma County, where he said public hunting spots are too crowded. \\"We understand what's going on out here,\\" Allen said as he emerged from the fog-shrouded reserve just after dawn with his hunting partner, ducks slung over their shoulders. \\"We're not trying to offend anyone. We're sympathetic to part of their reasoning - we understand they're sleeping.\\" But what some see as unjustifiable killing, he said, \\"I look at it as harvesting.\\" \\"The only thing I target is something that's going to go into my freezer and be consumed by my family.\\" Jacob Flannick is a freelance writer.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

This endemic canid became extinct in 1876, the first known canid to have become extinct in historical times. It was the only modern species in the genus \\"Dusicyon\\".  - The American mink (\\"Neovison vison\\") is a semiaquatic species of mustelid native to North America, though human intervention has expanded its range to many parts of Europe and South America. Because of range expansion, the American mink is classed as a least-concern species by the IUCN. Since the extinction of the sea mink, the American mink is the only extant member of the genus \\"Neovison\\". The American mink is a carnivore which feeds on rodents, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and birds. In its introduced range in Europe it has been classified as an invasive species linked to declines in European mink, Pyrenean desman, and water vole populations. It is the most frequently farmed animal for its fur, exceeding the silver fox, sable, marten, and skunk in economic importance.  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - An invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.  - The martens constitute the genus Martes within the subfamily Mustelinae, in the family Mustelidae. Martens are slender, agile animals, adapted to living in taigas, and are found in coniferous and northern deciduous forests across the Northern Hemisphere. They have bushy tails, and large paws with partially retractible claws. The fur varies from yellowish to dark brown, depending on the species, and, in many cases, is valued by fur trappers.  - Skunks are mammals known for their ability to spray a liquid with a strong odor. Different species of skunk vary in appearance from black-and-white to brown or cream colored, but all have warning coloration.  - The sea mink (\\"Neovison macrodon\\") is an extinct North American member of the family Mustelidae. It is the only mustelid, and one of only two terrestrial mammal species in the order Carnivora known to have become extinct in historic times (the other being the Falkland Islands wolf). The body of the sea mink was significantly longer than that of the closely related American mink (\\"N. vison\\"), and also bulkier, leading to a pelt that was almost twice the size of the other species. The longest specimen recorded was said to be . The sea mink produced a distinctive odor, and had fur that was said to be coarser and redder than the American mink's.  - The Mustelidae (from Latin \\"mustela\\", weasel) are a family of carnivorous mammals, including the weasel, badger, otter, marten, ferret, mink, stoat, and wolverine. Mustelids are diverse and the largest family in the order Carnivora. The internal classification is still disputed, with rival proposals containing between two and eight subfamilies. One study, published in 2008, questions the long-accepted Mustelinae subfamily, and suggests that the Mustelidae consist of four major clades and three much smaller lineages.  - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - The sable (\\"Martes zibellina\\") is a marten species, a small carnivorous mammal inhabiting forest environments, primarily in Russia from the Ural Mountains throughout Siberia, eastern Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, China, North and South Korea and Hokkaid in Japan. Its range in the wild originally extended through European Russia to Poland and Scandinavia. It has historically been hunted for its highly valued dark brown or black fur, which remains a luxury good to this day. While hunting of wild animals is still common in Russia, most fur in the market is now commercially farmed.  - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments.  - The Pyrenean desman (\\"Galemys pyrenaicus\\") is a small semiaquatic nocturnal mammal related to moles and shrews, and is one of only two surviving species of the tribe Desmanini. The range of the species centers on northwestern Spain and northern Portugal, but it is under threat due to changes to its habitat. In Portugal it's called \\"\\"toupeira-d'água\\"\\" which means \\"water mole\\".  - A vole is a small rodent; a relative of the mouse, with a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats.  - Neovison is a genus of mustelids , including the extinct sea mink and the extant American mink .  - Carnivora (from Latin \\"car\\" (stem \\"carn-\\") \\"flesh\\" and \\"vorre\\" \\"to devour\\") is a diverse order that includes over 280 species of placental mammals. Its members are formally referred to as carnivorans, whereas the word \\"carnivore\\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. Carnivorans are the most diverse in size of any mammalian order, ranging from the least weasel (\\"Mustela nivalis\\"), at as little as and , to the polar bear (\\"Ursus maritimus\\"), which can weigh up to , to the southern elephant seal (\\"Mirounga leonina\\"), whose adult males weigh up to and measure up to in length.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Q: Chemical equations need to be balanced to satisfy the law of what?    Choices:  - material of matter  - glow of matter  - speed of matter  - conservation of matter  A: A:","output":"The correct answer is - conservation of matter.  Chemical equations need to be balanced to satisfy the law of conservation of matter, also known as the conservation of mass. This fundamental principle of chemistry was articulated by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century. It states that the mass of an isolated system will remain constant, irrespective of the processes acting inside the system. In the domain of chemical reactions specifically, the law asserts that the amount of matter remains constant throughout. The role of this law becomes quite clear when we're looking at reactions at the molecular level. A chemical reaction involves the reorganization of atoms – those that made up the reactants now form the products. However, a crucial point to note is that a chemical reaction does not destroy atoms or create new ones – it merely shuffles them around. Now, when a chemical equation isn't balanced, it suggests that atoms have been lost or made in the process, implying a violation of the law of conservation of matter, meaning that mass is not conserved in that reaction. This is physically impossible; this is why equations must be balanced.  Balancing a chemical equation means ensuring that the number and types of atoms on the reactant side of the equation (before the reaction) are identical to the number and types of atoms on the product side of the equation (after the reaction). It is a way to numerically demonstrate the law of conservation of matter. Balancing an equation does not change the essence of the reaction it's representing, but makes the equation adhere to physical laws and realities. Therefore, to respect the law of conservation of matter, whenever you write a chemical equation and balance it, you need to ensure that the quantity and type of atoms in the reactants is equal to the quantity and type of atoms in the products. This allows the equations to portray accurately the reorganization happening in the molecular world during chemical reactions. Thus, the law of conservation of matter is the fundamental reason chemical equations need to be balanced.  So, it's not a matter of the material of matter, glow of matter, or speed of matter; the requirement to balance a chemical equation is firmly rooted in the concept of the conservation of matter."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have this problem: -3 - 9 = 12 * z First, let's solve the left side of the equation: -3 - 9 Imagine you have 3 apples and someone takes away 9 more apples. You don't have enough apples, right? So now you owe 12 apples to that person. That's why the result is -12. So, the equation now is: -12 = 12 * z Now, we need to find the value of 'z.' We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 12. -12 ÷ 12 = (12 * z) ÷ 12 When we do this, we see that 12 ÷ 12 is 1. So, we can remove the 12 from the right side of the equation: -12 ÷ 12 = z And -12 ÷ 12 is -1. So the final answer is: z = -1 So, the solution to the math problem is z equals -1."},{"instruction":"Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

In all the confusion of locking down the museum and capturing the robbers, Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) slips into an adjacent room and steals the painting of San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk by Monet. The insurers of the 100 million artwork send investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) to assist NYPD Detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary) in solving the crime. In reviewing video of the rooms involved in both robberies, one of which was strangely \\"blank\\", Banning follows clues to discover how both robberies are connected. She quickly comes to suspect that the wealthy financier Thomas Crown is behind the theft. Banning is intrigued at his motivations and begins a game of cat-and-mouse to recover the painting. Despite the fact that both of them intuitively know what the other is up to, the two of them continue to meet in high class locations and intimate surroundings while Banning continues to search for the painting. The constant contact, matching of wits (and the romantic pursuit of Crown), cause Banning to fall in love with him.

After a grand game of misdirection, the painting is returned and another one is stolen; one which Banning had previously expressed a desire to possess. Since the second stolen painting is insured by another company and her job is now finished, Banning's knowledge of Crown's plan allows her to meet him at a prearranged spot.

Article: Two American scientists told the people in industrial  nations that they would be much healthier if they ate more of the same kind of foods eaten by humans living more than 10,000 years ago. The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on the earth,but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in lifestyles and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \\"diseases of civilization \\".Many cancers and diseases of the blood system,including heart attacks and strokes are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted  that early stoneage people used very little alcohol  or tobacco ,probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise,but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stoneage people hunted wild animals for their meat ,which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products ,and they made very little use of grains . But today,we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stoneage people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C.  People today probably do not want to live as people thousands of years ago did,but scientists say that we would be much healthier if we ate as those ancient people did,cutting the amount of fatty,salty and sweet foods.

This means that Kinglake made the British out to be unfortunate and innocent participants in the war, who were led astray by misleading information and the deceptive actions of their diplomatic partners in France and the Ottoman Empire.  Kinglake's perspective, as presented in this sentence, presents the British as more or less passive actors in the conflict, with external factors - particularly the sensationalist media and duplicity of other nations - pushing them towards war. This view absolves the British of primary responsibility for the war, as Kinglake suggests that they were acting in response to misinformation and the deceitful maneuvers of other countries involved.

If I pick a random point on number line, what is the probability that picked point correspond to a rational number? If you picked a number at random on the number line, would it have a greater chance of being rational or irrational?","output":"Yes, these two questions are essentially asking about the same concept – the likelihood of picking a rational or irrational number when choosing a point at random on the number line. However, the first question inquires about the specific probability of picking a rational number, while the second question asks for a comparison between the chances of selecting a rational and an irrational number. It would be helpful to provide a comprehensive answer that addresses both formulations of the question. To begin with, let's define rational and irrational numbers. A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction, p/q, where p and q are integers and q is not equal to zero. Examples of rational numbers include 3 (which can be written as 3/1), -3/4, and 1/2. Irrational numbers, on the other hand, cannot be expressed as a fraction. They are typically non-repeating, non-terminating decimals, like pi or the square root of 2. Addressing the first question, it is easy to think that the probability of choosing a rational number is relatively high, given that there are infinitely many rational numbers on the number line – any two integers will form a rational number when one is divided by the other. However, it turns out that the set of irrational numbers between any two rational numbers is also infinite. This complicates the issue of determining the probability of picking a rational number. To illustrate this point, let's consider an example. If we pick two rational numbers on the number line, such as 1/2 and 3/4, we can always find an irrational number sandwiched between them (e.g., the square root of 2/2). This situation is the same for any two rational numbers regardless of how close they are to each other. As a result, there are infinitely many irrational numbers as well as rational numbers on the number line. Intuitively, it seems that there should be a way to compare these two infinite sets to determine whether one is \\"larger\\" or \\"denser\\" than the other, thus affecting the probability of choosing a rational or irrational number. However, mathematicians Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind have proven that the set of rational numbers is countable, meaning that it is possible to list all rational numbers in a way where each can be assigned a unique positive integer, whereas the set of irrational numbers is uncountable, which means they cannot be matched to a unique set of positive integers using any method; uncountable infinity is considered \\"larger\\" than countable infinity. Based on these findings, it can be inferred that the probability of picking a rational number on the number line is essentially 0. Although there are infinitely many rational numbers, the existence of uncountably infinite irrational numbers between any two rationals renders the chances of randomly selecting a rational number to be practically nonexistent. Addressing the second question, considering the nature of both rational and irrational numbers, and the fact that the set of irrational numbers is larger, denser, and uncountable versus the countable set of rational numbers, it can be concluded that the probability of choosing a number at random on the number line leans heavily towards it being an irrational number rather than a rational one. In conclusion, both questions revolve around the likelihood of choosing a rational or irrational number on the number line, but the first one specifically asks for the probability of picking a rational number, while the second focuses on comparing the probability of choosing a rational vs. an irrational number. Since irrational numbers constitute an uncountable infinity, and rational numbers are countable, the possibility of picking an irrational number at random on the number line is much greater than the chance of picking a rational number, and the probability of selecting a rational number is essentially 0."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

J.\\" Paradine Frost, and his wife, Mona (Aldrich); he had two elder sisters. While living in Gillingham, Kent, he was taught in the Bible class of the Sunday school at his father's church (Byron Road Methodist) by David Gilmore Harvey, and subsequently started training as a Methodist local preacher, which he did not complete. Frost attended Barnsole Road Primary School in Gillingham, St Hugh's School, Woodhall Spa, Gillingham Grammar School and finally - while residing in Raunds - Wellingborough Grammar School. Throughout his school years he was an avid football and cricket player, and was offered a contract with Nottingham Forest F.C. Frost was one of the \\"Famous Five\\" who launched TV-am in February 1983 but, like LWT in the late 1960s, the station began with an unsustainable \\"highbrow\\" approach. Frost remained a presenter after restructuring. Frost on Sunday began in September 1983 and continued until the station lost its franchise at the end of 1992. Frost had been part of an unsuccessful consortium, CPV-TV, with Richard Branson and other interests, which had attempted to acquire three ITV contractor franchises prior to the changes made by the Independent Television Commission in 1991. After transferring from ITV, his Sunday morning interview programme Breakfast with Frost ran on the BBC from January 1993 until 29 May 2005. For a time it ran on BSB before moving to BBC 1.  Frost hosted Through the Keyhole, which ran on several UK channels from 1987 until 2008 and also featured Loyd Grossman. Produced by his own production company, the programme was first shown in prime time and on daytime television in its later years.  Frost worked for Al Jazeera English, presenting a live weekly hour-long current affairs programme, Frost Over The World, which started when the network launched in November 2006. The programme regularly made headlines with interviewees such as Tony Blair, President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua. The programme was produced by the former Question Time editor and Independent on Sunday journalist Charlie Courtauld. Frost was one of the first to interview the man who authored the Fatwa on Terrorism, Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri.  During his career as a broadcaster Frost became one of Concorde's most frequent fliers, having flown between London and New York an average of 20 times per year for 20 years.  In 2007, Frost hosted a discussion with Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Monitor Group's involvement in the country.

No doctor or physician can tell that why this happens.","output":"Step 1: Research HELLP Syndrome To recognize and treat HELLP Syndrome in pregnancy, it is essential first to understand what the condition entails. HELLP Syndrome is a rare but serious liver disorder that occurs in some pregnant women. It stands for Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet count. Step 2: Identify Symptoms Here are some common symptoms of HELLP Syndrome:  - Fatigue or general malaise - Headaches - Nausea and vomiting - Abdominal pain, particularly in the upper right quadrant - Swelling, especially in the hands and face - Rapid weight gain - Vision changes, such as seeing spots or blurriness - High blood pressure Step 3: Consult a Healthcare Professional If you suspect that you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of HELLP Syndrome, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional, such as an obstetrician or a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, as soon as possible. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to reduce the risks and complications associated with this condition. Step 4: Treatment and Management HELLP Syndrome is typically treated by addressing the underlying conditions. Some possible treatments might include: - Blood pressure medications to control high blood pressure - Corticosteroid injections to help mature the baby's lungs, in case an early delivery is necessary - Magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures - Blood transfusions if platelet levels are dangerously low Often, the definitive treatment for HELLP Syndrome is the delivery of the baby, even if the pregnancy is not yet at term. Your healthcare provider will closely monitor the severity of the condition and determine the optimal timing for delivery.  Step 5: Post-Treatment Monitoring After HELLP Syndrome has been treated, it is important to continue monitoring both the mother and the baby. Regular check-ups and follow-ups with healthcare providers will help ensure a safe recovery for the mother and appropriate growth and development for the baby. In conclusion, recognizing and treating HELLP Syndrome in pregnancy involves being aware of the symptoms, consulting with a healthcare professional, receiving appropriate treatment and management, and undergoing post-treatment monitoring and follow-up care."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again. However, when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930, Beiderbecke did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly.

In October 1831, he wrote to Herring, and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery (later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans), published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839. Herring was an artist, but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre, who traveled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life.  He again sketched Jackson, who was by now president, as well as former president James Madison, both in July 1833. He met many of the political leaders of the day, who were impressed by his portraits.  Among these advocates was the former vice president, South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. In July 1832, Niles' Register described a Longacre engraving, \\"one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art\\".Longacre had married Eliza Stiles in 1827; between 1828, when their daughter Sarah was born, and 1840, they had three boys and two girls.  Sales of the Gallery lagged due to the Panic of 1837; Longacre was forced to declare bankruptcy and travel through the southern and midwestern states, peddling his books from town to town, with his wife and elder daughter managing shipping and finances at home.  Later in 1837, he was able to return to Philadelphia and open a banknote engraving firm with partners, Toppan, Draper, Longacre & Co.  With great demand for engraving for notes being issued by state banks, the firm prospered, and had offices at 60 Walnut Street in Philadelphia and a branch at 1 Wall Street in New York.

Both terms indicate that the subject matter or item incites a sense of eagerness or enthusiasm to learn more about it. It is important to note that what is considered interesting or fascinating can vary significantly from person to person, as individual preferences, experiences, and backgrounds shape our perceptions and interests. What one person may find particularly captivating might be less intriguing to another individual. This subjectivity is what makes human opinions diverse, leading to a rich exchange of ideas and viewpoints.

Article: What do you think of a forest, what do you see? Just trees? Or do you see many other things, such as singing birds, colorful plants and wild flowers? The forest is a whole of its own. It is full of many different living things. But even though they are all different, they have one thing in common: they all need each other in order to live on. The trees feed the forest \\"people\\" by making food in their leaves; by using sunlight to join water and minerals from the soil and air. Their deep network of roots joins the soil together and stops it from dying out, making it possible for living things to live in it. Human beings are like the living things in the forest. We need one another in order to live. We need the farmers to grow our food, railroad and truck drivers to bring it to our shops and clerks  to sell it to us. We need people to prepare our food and cook it and others to take our waste things away. Then, of course, we need doctors, nurses, government leaders, mailmen, telephone operators, and many others. We also need other human beings in another way. We need people for friendship, to talk over our problems, exchange ideas. Think how lonely and unhappy you would be if you lived all alone. Life is a matter of giving and taking. We need to help other people as much as we need other people to help us. Think what a good feeling you have when you have done something for someone else.

When Daniel's father remarried after a divorce, Daniel, who was eleven, and his little sister, Kristie, came to live with us. My husband and I were more than happy to have kids in the house again. Things were going along just fine until the diabetes   I've lived with most of my adult life started affecting my eyes, and then more seriously, my kidneys  . Then everything seemed to fall apart. Three times a week, I had to go to the hospital to be hooked up to a dialysis machine  . I was living, but I couldn't really call it a life -- it was an existence. I had no energy. I dragged myself through daily chores and slept as much as I could. My sense of humor seemed to disappear. Daniel, seventeen by then, was really affected by the change in me. He tried as hard as he could to make me laugh, to bring back the grandma who loved to clown around   with him. Even in my sorry state, Daniel could still bring a smile to my face. But things were not improving. After a year on dialysis, my condition was deteriorating   and the doctors felt that if I didn't receive a kidney transplant within six months, I would surely die. No one told Daniel this, but he knew -- he said all he had to do was look after me. To top it off, as my condition worsened, there was a chance that I would become too weak to have the transplant surgery at all, and then there would be nothing they could do for me. So we started the tense and desperate wait for a kidney. I was adamant   that I didn't want a kidney from anyone I knew. I would wait until an appropriate kidney became available, or I would literally die waiting. But Daniel had other plans. The time that he took me to my dialysis appointments, he did a little secret research on his own. Then he announced his intention to me. \\"Grandma, I'm giving you one of my kidneys.

Question: What is Flik's latest invention? Movie title: A Bug's Life Movie plot: Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, lives in a colony of ants in the middle of a dried creek. They are led by Princess Atta and her mother, the Queen. The colony is oppressed by a gang of marauding grasshoppers, led by Hopper, that arrive every season demanding food from the ants. One day, when the annual offering is accidentally knocked into a stream by Flik's latest invention, a grain-harvesting device, the grasshoppers demand twice as much food as compensation. The ants trick Flik into accepting his plan to recruit \\"warrior bugs\\" to fight off the grasshoppers. While Flik actually believes in the plan, the other ants see it as an opportunity to get rid of Flik and save themselves trouble. Making his way to the \\"big city\\" (a heap of trash under a trailer), Flik mistakes a group of circus bugs that have recently been dismissed by their money-hungry ringmaster, P.T. Flea, for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent and accept his offer to travel with him back to Ant Island. After they arrive, the circus bugs and Flik both discover their mutual misunderstandings during a welcome performance by the ants. The circus bugs then attempt to leave, but are forced back by a bird that attacks the group. They save Dot, Atta's younger sister, from the bird as they flee, gaining the ants' respect in the process. At Flik's insistence, they continue the ruse of being \\"warriors\\" so the troupe can continue to enjoy the attention and hospitality of the ants. The bird encounter inspires Flik into creating a false bird to scare away the grasshoppers. While the bird is being built, Hopper reveals to the other grasshoppers how greatly the ants outnumber them and worries that they will eventually turn on them.

The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing \\"Shine!\\" and Williams screaming \\"Hey!\\". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, \\"So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation\\" and \\"that bear with the red hat\\", as obvious references to Paddington.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Rauner's questionable term-limits drive is underway There's no question in my mind that the Committee for Legislative Reform and Term Limits, an independent arm of Republican Bruce Rauner's campaign for Illinois governor, will get the nearly 300,000 petition signatures needed to put the term-limits question on the November 2014 ballot. Rauner has very deep pockets and, as I noted recently, the idea is wildly popular with voters. It never loses when put to a referendum vote, and polls consistently show it with a 70 percent-plus approval rating. So there's also no question in my mind that the proposition will pass if it's put before the voters. But I very much question whether the Illinois Supreme Court will allow the question to be placed on the ballot, no matter how many signatures Team Rauner gathers or how dramatically opinion polling favors it. The justices blocked a similar attempt in 1994 when then-Treasurer Pat Quinn was leading the effort. Their reasoning went as follows: The power of citizens to initiate amendments to the state constitution via petition drive was limited by the framers only \\"to structural and procedural subjects contained\\" in Article IV, the one that deals with the legislature. The reason for this limit, for better or worse, was to prevent Illinois from becoming a state in which legislative questions — about taxes, marijuana, gay mar riage, abortion and so on — were routinely left up to the voters. So would term limits change the structure of the legislature? No, the majority ruled in 1994. Even with term limits, \\"The General Assembly would remain a bicameral legislature consisting of a House and Senate with a total of 177 members, and would maintain the same organization.\\" Would it change the procedures of the legislature? Again, no. \\"The process by which the General Assembly adopts a law would remain unchanged\\" with the addition of term limits, said the majority opinion. And even if the answer was \\"yes\\" to one of those questions, the constitution requires that it be \\"yes\\" to both. \\"This court is without authority to substitute 'or' for the 'and' the constitutional convention used in stating 'structural and procedural,'\\" noted the opinion. So why do supporters of Rauner's political action committee expect a different result this time? First, because the 1994 decision was narrowly decided — 4-3 — and there are now six new justices on the court (though the one remaining justice, Charles Freeman, was part of the majority). The dissent in 1994 argued that \\"Democracy should be permitted to take its course\\" and that the nitpicky linguistic parsing of the majority resulted in \\"a fiction that venerates the power of our incumbent legislators and demeans the intelligence of their constituents.\\" And second, because the Committee for Legislative Reform and Term Limits has larded onto its petition two other proposals. One of them changes the structure of the legislature by increasing the size of the House and shrinking the Senate. The other changes the procedures of the legislature by raising the requirement to override a governor's veto to a two-thirds vote of the legislature from the current three-fifths. If, earlier this week when Rauner's proposal was formally unveiled, you wondered why it included this pair of off-the-radar-screen ideas, now you know: It's an effort to create a plausible reason for the Supreme Court to give the OK. \\"These are three interrelated reforms,\\" said Mike Schrimpf, a spokesman for Rauner and the term-limits effort. \\"Taken all together, they make the legislature more responsive to the citizens and they make elections more competitive.\\" He pointed to an earlier state Supreme Court ruling that allowed on the ballot the multipart referendum that shrank the legislature, created single-member districts and eliminated cumulative voting. But it's a stretch. Clearly, term limits is a separate and separable issue from veto thresholds and the size of the legislative chambers. And, equally clearly, it's the sort of question that doesn't pass the constitutional test for citizen initiatives, no matter how many other gaudy, distracting questions you surround it with. But will the Supreme Court have the courage once again to buck public opinion and give term limits the heave-ho?","output":"A man named Bruce Rauner wants to change some rules for the people who make laws in Illinois. He is trying to get enough people to agree so that everyone can vote on it. It is called term limits, which means people can only be in charge for a certain amount of time. Many people like this idea, but some think it might not be allowed. In the past, a similar idea was stopped because it didn't follow the rules for how to change things. This time, Rauner added more changes to his idea, hoping it will be allowed. We will have to wait and see if the important judges let people vote on it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The worst earthquake in 40 years shook South Asia on Sunday, starting with horrible waves that swept entire villages into the sea. At least 20,000 people in six countries were killed in the disaster, and millions were left homeless. The quake shook deep beneath the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It was felt more than 3000 miles away in East Africa, where heavy tides kept fishermen at home and resorts closed. It was as if the sea had struck the land. Residents of Sri Lanka, a small island country off the coast of India, ran to the hills to find safety from the tsunami. Many took their radios, televisions, and other valuables with them. The disaster hit Sri Lanka hardest.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: After a nervous first-half display, the Republic raised the tempo after the break and Jeff Hendrick's fine run set up Walters's 69th-minute winner. The Republic stay third in Group D but they have a four-point cushion over Scotland after Germany won in Glasgow. Poland remain second after routing Gibraltar 8-1 in Warsaw. The Republic are still four points behind group leaders Germany but, with two matches remaining, they are now in position to clinch at least a play-off spot. However, those are two tough games as they first host Germany in Dublin on 8 October before concluding their campaign in Poland. That said, one win would guarantee Martin O'Neill's side one of the eight play-off places. And a win in Warsaw would clinch an automatic qualifying spot for the Irish if Scotland beat Poland in Glasgow three days earlier. The one downside from the Republic's win was the bookings picked up by Glenn Whelan and James McClean, which will rule them out of the Germany contest. Hendrick's stunning run and cross as he jinked past three attempted challenges before setting up Walters to stab home dramatically changed the contest at the Aviva Stadium. Media playback is not supported on this device The Republic had looked jittery in the first period as Georgia striker Levan Mchedlidze twice went close after being set up by impressive playmaker Tornike Okriashvili. But boosted by the half-time introduction of Shane Long for the ineffective Robbie Keane, the Republic lifted the pace in the second half as the busy Glenn Whelan and Hendrick tested keeper Nukri Revishvili. Yet, the Georgians still looked largely comfortable until Hendrick's bit of magic set up Walters's winner. For that delightful piece of skill alone, the Derby midfielder has to be the man of the match. Despite lifting the pace after half-time, the Republic were still showing little sign of breaking down the Georgia defence until Hendrick's moment of inspiration. Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill: \\"That was very tense. We didn't play well in the first half. We were very tentative. You might even say nervous. \\"But in the second half there was a great turnaround, with great effort and application and we found a way to win. Jeff Hendrick was absolutely magnificent for the goal. He has the ability to do that. He just needs a wee bit more encouragement. \\"And it was great to see Jon Walters, who has had a fantastic tournament for us, get the goal. He's got a great, great heart.\\" Republic of Ireland goalscorer Jon Walters: \\"It was all about the result tonight. It was tough but we knew it was going to be that. \\"We managed a 1-0 (win) and we couldn't have asked for any more. Fair play to Jeff Hendrick. He made the goal for me. He's got that ability. He's a top quality player. \\"We are still a million miles away from qualifying.

If you can't purchase it directly from the roaster within a week or so of it being roasted, opt for a vacuum-sealed bag from a reputable national coffee-bean roaster.  Purchase your own coffee grinder, or grind it in the store.","output":"Step 1: Grind the coffee beans Grind the freshly roasted whole bean coffee using your coffee grinder. The grind size should be medium-fine for drip coffee makers or coarse for a French press. This step is crucial as freshly ground coffee provides a better flavor and aroma compared to pre-ground coffee. Step 2: Measure the coffee and water For a standard cup of black coffee (8 ounces), measure 0.35 ounces (about 2 tablespoons) of ground coffee. Measure 8 ounces of fresh, cold water for each cup of coffee you want to brew. Step 3: Boil the water Bring the measured water to a boil using a kettle or saucepan. If using an electric kettle with temperature settings, set it to around 200°F (93°C). If you don't have a temperature-controlled kettle, let the water sit off the heat for about 30 seconds after it reaches boiling. Step 4: Prepare your brewing equipment If using a drip coffee maker, place a coffee filter in the filter basket. Pour the ground coffee into the filter and make sure it's evenly distributed. If using a French press, place the ground coffee directly into the press. Step 5: Brew the coffee In a drip coffee maker, pour the hot water into the water reservoir and start the machine. The water will pass through the coffee grounds and into the carafe, making black coffee. For a French press, pour the hot water over the coffee grounds, ensuring they are all saturated. Place the lid on the press and let it steep for four minutes. After steeping, slowly press down the plunger, allowing the coffee to pass through the filter and retaining the grounds in the bottom. Pour the black coffee into a cup. Step 6: Serve and enjoy Pour the freshly brewed black coffee into your cup and enjoy it! If desired, you can add sugar, milk, or any other preferred additions, but black coffee is traditionally served plain. Enjoy your coffee while it's hot and fresh for maximum flavor and aroma."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Choices:  - effective  - unusual  - positive  - negative  A: The answer is:","output":"Negative. Electrons are subatomic particles that orbit the nucleus of an atom. They are a fundamental component of matter, and their behavior plays a crucial role in understanding the nature of chemical reactions and interactions between atoms. Electrons possess a specific kind of charge, which influences their behavior when interacting with other charged particles – such as other electrons, or the protons found in the nucleus of an atom. The charge of an electron is negative. To provide more context and insight into this property, it is necessary to understand the broader concept of electric charge. Charge is a fundamental property of certain subatomic particles (like electrons and protons) that dictates how they interact with one another through electromagnetic force. There are two types of electric charge: positive and negative. In an atom, protons carry a positive charge, while electrons carry a negative charge. It is a convention that the charge of a proton is considered to be +1, while the charge of an electron is considered to be -1. These charges cause interactions between particles – opposite charges attract (a negatively charged electron will be attracted to a positively charged proton), while like charges repel (two negatively charged electrons will repel each other). The other choices provided, \\"effective\\" and \\"unusual,\\" are not pertinent to the type of charge that electrons possess. The term \\"effective\\" usually refers to something having a practical result or being productive, while the term \\"unusual\\" suggests that something is not common or typical. These terms can be applied to various contexts, but they do not accurately describe the type of charge carried by electrons. In summary, electrons carry a negative charge. Understanding this property is essential in the study of atomic structure, chemical bonding, and various other aspects of chemistry and physics. The charged nature of electrons plays a central role in how atoms interact and form molecules, as well as essential phenomena such as electricity and magnetism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

London used fossil fuels, while Edmonton use entirely hydro power to generate energy.  Which city causes less acid rain? A:","output":"The city producing less acid rain would be Edmonton.  Step 1: Identify the causes of acid rain: Acid rain is caused by sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) released into the atmosphere. Most of these pollutants are produced from combustion of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. Step 2: Compare the source of energy for both cities: London uses fossil fuels, which during combustion, releases gases like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. These gases react in the atmosphere with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form various acidic compounds, causing acid rain. Edmonton, on the other hand, uses hydro power which is a clean, non-polluting source of energy. Hydroelectric generation does not emit any of the gases that cause acid rain. Step 3: Draw Conclusion: Since Edmonton uses hydropower for electricity generation, which does not produce SO2 or NOx (the contributors to acid rain), it can be concluded that Edmonton causes less acid rain than London."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Here is a news article: ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek officials say human bones found in a resplendent ancient tomb excavated last year in northern Greece belong to at least five individuals, including an elderly woman and a baby.      The high-profile excavation at ancient Amphipolis uncovered a large, vaulted tomb decorated with marble statues of sphinxes and young women, as well as a remarkable mosaic pavement.      A Culture Ministry statement Monday said bones found in the grave belong to a woman over 60, a newborn, two men aged 35-45 and another adult.      The tomb has been dated to between 325 B.C. — two years before the death of ancient Greek warrior-king Alexander the Great — and 300 B.C. Experts speculated it could have been built for a general or a relative of Alexander's, who himself was buried in Egypt. ||||| ATHENS A vast ancient tomb once thought to possibly house the remains of Alexander the Great contains bones of a woman, a newborn baby and two men and fragments of a cremated person, the Greek culture ministry said on Monday.      Speculation that the limestone grave in the Amphipolis tomb site might belong to the legendary Alexander, to one of his generals or to family members reached fever pitch in recent months as archeologist kept unearthing tantalizing finds.      The Amphipolis site, believed to be the largest ancient tomb to have been discovered in Greece, dates back to Alexander's era, around 300-325 B.C.      The ancient conqueror died in Babylonia - in present day Iraq - in 323 B.C. after a military campaign across the Middle East out to present-day Pakistan. His burial site is not known but historians place it in the Egyptian city of Alexandria.      The culture ministry said research on the tomb's bones showed the buried woman was over 60 years old and about 1.57 meters tall while the two men were aged 35 to 45 years old.      One of the men had cut marks in his left chest that were most likely from mortal injuries inflicted by a knife or small sword, the ministry said. The men had an estimated height of 1.62 to 1.68 meters.      The few burned bone remains of the fifth interred person, who was cremated, could not reveal the person's gender and authorities said further testing would be carried out.      Further analysis will also be done on the bones of the woman and two men to determine if they were related.      \\"Part of the analysis will look into a possible blood relationship ... but the lack of teeth and cranial parts that are used in ancient DNA analysis may not allow for a successful identification,\\" the ministry said.      Excavations at the site near Greece's second city of Thessaloniki began in 2012 and captured global attention last August when archaeologists announced the discovery of a vast tomb guarded by two sphinxes and circled by a 497-metre marble wall.      Since then the tomb has also yielded a colorful floor mosaic depicting the abduction of Persephone, the daughter of Zeus, the supreme deity of ancient Greece, as well as two sculpted female figures known as Caryatids.      (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos; Editing by Tom Heneghan) ||||| Athens (AFP) - Bones from at least five people, including a baby and an elderly woman, were identified in a massive tomb in Greece dating back to the era of Alexander the Great, the culture ministry said Monday.      \\"A minimum number of five people have been identified from bone remains, four of whom were buried and one of whom was burned,\\" the ministry said in a statement.      \\"The dead are a woman, two middle-aged men and a newborn\\" and a fifth person whose sex could not be verified, it said.      The woman was estimated to be aged over 60, and the two men between 35 and 45 years old, officials said. No other details were immediately available on the baby and the fifth person.      The excavation of the tomb in Amphipolis, northern Greece -- the largest ever unearthed in the country -- made global headlines this summer amid speculation that a member of Alexander the Great's entourage had been buried there.      The ministry had originally thought that a single skeleton lay in the tomb, but on Monday said that out of 550 bone fragments found, 157 had been matched to specific bodies so far.      View gallery Picture provided by the Greek Ministry of Culture on November 12, 2014 shows a grave found in the to …      Other bones were those of animals, including a horse.      The tomb, measuring 500 metres (1,640 feet) in circumference and dug into a 30-metre hill -- was found to contain sculptures of sphinxes and caryatids, intricate mosaics and coins featuring the face of Alexander the Great.      Before the announcements, it was thought that the tomb could contain Alexander's Bactrian wife Roxana, the king's mother Olympias, or one of his generals.      The tomb's location was known in antiquity, and it is believed to have been repeatedly looted following the conquest of the ancient Macedonian kingdom by Rome in the second century BC.      Few relics were found, and the culture ministry confirmed on Monday that even the grave inside the tomb had been searched.      \\"The condition in which the bones were found indicates that they had been disturbed,\\" it said.      In December, the ministry dismissed as \\"unfounded\\" claims on Greek websites that the bones were those of a 54-year-old woman, and is therefore likely to be Olympias.      Historians say it is also highly unlikely to have been Alexander himself, who conquered the Persian empire and much of the known world before his death at the age of 32 in 323 BC.      Additional research will determine whether the dead were related, the ministry said. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The ancient tomb discovered in Amphipolis, Greece, dating back to the era of Alexander the Great, contains the remains of at least five individuals.

While none of the provided answer choices precisely depicts the functions of potassium in an animal, the closest choice would be \\"Helps it survive.\\" However, to understand the importance of potassium in an animal's survival, we should explore its specific functions further. Here are some key roles that potassium plays in an animal's body: 1. Fluid balance: Potassium helps maintain the balance of fluids inside and outside the cells. This balance is critical for various physiological processes, including waste removal, nutrient transport, and osmotic pressure regulation. 2. Nerve function: Potassium plays a central role in nerve signal transmission by maintaining the resting membrane potential of nerve cells. This allows nerve cells to transmit electrical signals efficiently, facilitating communication between different parts of the body and helping to control essential functions like muscle movement and sensory perception. 3. Muscle function: Potassium is vital for proper muscle function, including contraction and relaxation. Adequate potassium levels are essential for maintaining muscle strength, flexibility, and overall health. 4. Heart function: As an electrolyte, potassium is crucial for maintaining the electrical activity of the heart. It helps regulate heart rhythm, ensuring that the heart beats at a steady and appropriate rate. 5. Acid-base balance: Potassium contributes to the maintenance of the acid-base balance in the body, helping to regulate the pH levels of body fluids, which is essential for numerous metabolic processes. 6. Regulates blood pressure: Potassium plays a role in regulating blood pressure by helping control the balance of fluids and minerals within blood vessels. A balanced potassium level can aid in the prevention of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. 7. Nutrient metabolism: Potassium is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and proteins, aiding in the conversion of nutrients into energy. In summary, potassium plays a vital role in an animal's survival by contributing to numerous critical physiological processes such as fluid balance, nerve and muscle function, heart function, acid-base balance, blood pressure regulation, and nutrient metabolism. Although potassium does not primarily provide food, shelter, or other protective functions, its presence is essential for maintaining the overall health and survival of animals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What does the chief of Tahiti convince the HMS Bounty's captain to do? ?  One night in Portsmouth, England in 1787, a press gang breaks into a local tavern and presses all of the men drinking there into naval service.  One of the men inquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him that it is HMS Bounty. Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is William Bligh and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The Bounty leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. Fletcher Christian, the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian. During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of Tahiti, where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take to the West Indies, as intended, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island, living with the island chief, Hitihiti, and his daughter, Tehani, and compiling an English dictionary of the Tahitian language. Hitihiti persuades Bligh to allow Christian a day pass on the island. Bligh agrees but quickly repeals the pass out of spite.

How will a Muslim astronaut observe the Ramadan's fasting while being stationed in the International Space Station? I will answer this question: As the International Space Station orbits Earth every 90 minutes, a Muslim astronaut would experience multiple sunrises and sunsets during a 24-hour period. This makes it challenging to follow traditional fasting times based on their home country's schedule. Muslim scholars have suggested different solutions for this. One approach is for Muslim astronauts to follow the time of the home country, or the country from which they launched. Another approach is to observe the schedule of a country that is closer to the Equator, where daylight hours remain relatively stable throughout the year. Ultimately, the decision comes down to the astronaut and their interpretation of Islamic teachings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Now, imagine the sensation a perfectly-crafted viral video wedding proposal could create for you and your significant other! In this day of social media, an epic proposal can not only leave a lasting impression on your partner but also capture the hearts of people around the world. How, you ask? Here are some valuable tips to help you nail your viral video wedding proposal. 1. Do Your Homework The first step in planning any wedding proposal is understanding your partner and what they truly value. Reflect upon their likes, dislikes, hobbies, and dreams. List down all the possible settings, themes, and storylines that resonate with your partner. You might also want to consult with their close friends and family for additional insights and ideas. 2. Think Outside the Box The more unique an idea is, the better the chances it has to go viral. Be imaginative and brainstorm innovative proposals that haven't been seen before. Explore creative themes, surprising locations, and original concepts that both represent your relationship and offer something new. 3. Personalize the Experience Your proposal should tell the story of your relationship. It shouldn't be a generic experience; make it personal and customized. Incorporate inside jokes, shared experiences, and meaningful moments that define your bond. Personalization sets the foundation for a truly unforgettable proposal. 4. Engage Professionals Considering that you're aiming to go viral with your wedding proposal, it's vital to involve experts who can help to bring your vision to life. Connect with a reputable event planning agency or a professional videographer with prior experience in proposals or viral content. Remember that the production quality of your video is just as important as the proposal concept itself. 5. Embrace the Element of Surprise Though your partner might be expecting a proposal at some point, surprising them with an unexpected or disguised proposal can make the moment even more special. Think of ways to throw them off the track or create an entirely new context to maintain the element of surprise. 6. Invite Friends and Family Involving close friends and family can add an emotional and memorable touch to your proposal. Besides, they can help you execute your surprise or even play a part in the proposal itself. However, be cautious not to overcrowd the moment or overshadow the intimacy between you and your significant other. 7. Practice, Practice, Practice Nerves and excitement can sometimes throw plans off course; hence, it's essential to practice your lines or actions multiple times to get it just right. This will help you build confidence and ensure that your viral video proposal goes as smoothly as possible. 8. Capture the Moment Great videography and editing play a critical role in creating a viral video. Ensure that your video proposal has a clear and captivating narrative that tugs at the heartstrings of viewers. Work closely with a skilled videographer to ensure that important moments and angles are captured and skillfully edited for maximum impact. 9. Be Prepared to Handle Reactions If your video does go viral, be prepared for a wide range of reactions. While most people will appreciate and applaud your effort, there might be some who may criticize as well. Stay positive and don't let the negativity diminish the beauty of your special moment. 10. Share the Video on Multiple Platforms To increase the chances of your proposal video going viral, share it across multiple social media platforms and apps. Ask your friends and family to help by sharing and reposting; ensuring that the video reaches diverse audiences around the world. Conclusion A viral video wedding proposal requires time, creativity, and dedication. However, if executed effectively, it can result in an unforgettable experience not just for you and your partner, but for millions of viewers as well. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the planning process and start crafting the perfect proposal masterpiece. Good luck!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: I live in a new town with my family. There are lots of tall buildings in the town. The streets are busy and the traffic is heavy, but the pollution is not very serious . In our town, more than half of the buildings have fifteen to thirty floors. Most of the people live in such tall buildings, but they don't have to climb the stairs. They use lifts to go up and down. Many restaurants, supermarkets, cinemas and theatres are in very tall buildings. They are big, bright and modern. So people enjoy eating, shopping, seeing films and watching plays in them. The streets in our town are wide, but because there are too many cars, they are still very busy. Sometimes when you come to the street crossing, you have to wait for the green lights for a long time. The people in our town never put _ everywhere or put dirty water into the river, so you cannot see much pollution in our town. I hope you'll come to visit our town if you like.

Solve this math problem Solve -478*w - 146*w = 85*w + 11344 for w.","output":"To solve the equation -478*w - 146*w = 85*w + 11344 for w, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the terms with w on both sides of the equation. The left side of the equation has two terms containing w: -478*w and -146*w. The right side of the equation has one term containing w: 85*w. Combining the terms with w on the left side yields: (-478 - 146) * w = 85 * w + 11344 (-624) * w = 85 * w + 11344 Step 2: Move all terms with w to one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 85 * w from both sides of the equation: -624 * w - 85 * w = 11344 Combining the terms with w on the left side gives: -709 * w = 11344 Step 3: Solve the equation for w. To solve for w, we can divide both sides of the equation by -709: w = 11344 / (-709) Using a calculator, we find that: w ≈ -16 So, the solution to the equation -478 * w - 146 * w = 85 * w + 11344 is w ≈ -16."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: what did dada artists think of art in past museums I found the following answer on Google: Another theory says that the name \\"Dada\\" came during a meeting of the group when a paper knife stuck into a French-German dictionary happened to point to 'dada', a French word for 'hobbyhorse'. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"The answer you found on Google is related to the origin of the term \\"Dada\\" and its emergence as an art movement but does not directly answer the question about what Dada artists thought of art in past museums. So, the answer is \\"no,\\" it's not the correct answer to the specific question asked.  To address the initial question, we must first understand the context and principles of the Dada movement to infer their perspectives on art in past museums.  Dada was an avant-garde art movement that started around 1916 in Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and lasted until the early 1920s. It was a reaction against the traditional cultural and aesthetic values of that time. Dada artists believed that the art world, much like the society responsible for the devastating war, was illogical, corrupt, and out of touch with the reality faced by people. The movement's primary objective was to question and ridicule artistic norms, which they believed conformed more to societal standards than genuine creativity. Dadaists sought to challenge and disrupt notions of art by emphasizing absurdity, irrationality, and spontaneity. They employed various artistic mediums such as collage, photomontage, assemblage, readymade sculptures, and even performance art. This diverse range of expressions allowed Dada artists to explore new dimensions of creativity, with the ultimate aim to break free from the conventional principles of art. Given their unconventional approach and disdain for the traditional art world, it's safe to assume that Dada artists would have had a critical perspective on art displayed in past museums. They would have considered these works as reflections of a stale and conventional culture that catered to the elite and upheld the status quo. The art found in museums, in their view, would have represented the very ideas they were rebelling against—formality, hierarchy, and mainstream cultural values. In conclusion, Dada artists likely had a negative opinion of art in past museums, as they perceived it to enforce traditional norms and aesthetic values they sought to challenge and upend. The answer you found on Google highlighted the origin of the term \\"Dada\\" but did not address the artists' views on art in past museums. By understanding the context of the Dada movement and their opposition to conventional artistic principles, we can infer their critical stance on the artworks displayed in the museums of their time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.  - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency.  - John James Sykes (born 29 July 1959) is an English rock guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter who has played with Streetfighter, Tygers of Pan Tang, John Sloman's Badlands, Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake, and Blue Murder. Sykes co-wrote the majority of the songs on Whitesnake's 1987 self-titled album with David Coverdale. Sykes is also a successful solo artist.  - Century Media Records is a heavy metal record label with offices in the United States, Germany and London. In August 2015, Century Media was acquired by Sony Music Entertainment for US 17 million.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Thin Lizzy are a rock band formed in Dublin, Ireland in 1969. Two of the founding members, drummer Brian Downey and bass guitarist and lead vocalist Phil Lynott, met while still in school. Lynott led the group throughout their recording career of twelve studio albums, writing most of the material. Thin Lizzy's most successful songs, \\"Whiskey in the Jar\\" (a traditional Irish ballad), \\"Jailbreak\\" and \\"The Boys Are Back in Town\\", were all major international hits. After Lynott's death in 1986, various incarnations of the band emerged over the years based initially around guitarists Scott Gorham and John Sykes, though Sykes left the band in 2009. Gorham later continued with a new line-up including Downey.  - \\"Whiskey in the Jar\\" is a well-known Irish traditional song, set in the southern mountains of Ireland, often with specific mention of counties Cork and Kerry, as well as Fenit, a village in County Kerry. The song is about a Rapparee (Highwayman), who is betrayed by his wife or lover, and is one of the most widely performed traditional Irish songs. It has been recorded by numerous professional artists since the 1950s.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America.

The song was originally released in 1976 on their album \\"Jailbreak\\".  - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.  - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe.

Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars. Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by singing or playing the harmonica.  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - Philip Parris \\"Phil\\" Lynott (20 August 1949  4 January 1986) was an Irish musician, singer and songwriter. His most commercially successful group was Thin Lizzy, of which he was a founding member, the principal songwriter, lead vocalist and bassist.

Gorham remained with Thin Lizzy until the band's breakup in 1984. He and guitarist Brian Robertson, both hired at the same time, marked the beginning of the band's most critically successful period, and together developed Thin Lizzy's twin lead guitar style while contributing dual backing vocals as well. Gorham is the band member with the longest membership after founders Brian Downey (drummer) and frontman and bass guitarist, Phil Lynott.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe.

Please answer the following question: This article: The Acra was not the first Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem. Sources indicate that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic Baris, had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts. Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the Antonia Fortress. The Baris fell to Antiochus III at the turn of the 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt. Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege. These factors, coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an acra, have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure. Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case. Antiquities of the Jews 12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the \\"impious or wicked\\" had \\"remained\\" rather than \\"dwelt\\" in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.Koen Decoster proposes that Josephus wrote of \\"a citadel in the lower part of the city\\" to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, \\"a citadel in the lower city\\" could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra.Opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it. But, if I hadn't been so angry I would never have attempted it at all. Life is full of little lessons. Pay attention to them and learn. If you have to lash out, lash at solving the situation you are in instead the person who caused it. It is significantly more productive that way.

To clarify further, let's break down the meaning of these sentences. 1. \\"In 1995 , Bret Hart accused Lawler of being a racist to create problems between Hart and the Japanese wrestler Hakushi.\\" This sentence states that Bret Hart accused Lawler of racism in 1995. The purpose of this accusation was to cause problems between Bret Hart and Hakushi, a Japanese wrestler. 2. \\"Lawler accused Bret Hart in 1995 of being a racist to create problems between Hart and the Japanese wrestler Hakushi.\\" This sentence also indicates that Lawler accused Bret Hart of racism in 1995, with the intention of instigating issues between Hart and Hakushi, the Japanese wrestler. Both sentences essentially communicate the same message; the only notable distinctions are their arrangement of words and the order in which the information is presented. In the first sentence, we learn when the accusation occurred before discovering the antagonist, while the second sentence introduces the accuser before mentioning the time frame of the defamation.

And the answer is...","output":"Step 1: Identify the equation to be solved. The equation given is 21 = 13*a + 47, and we need to solve for the variable 'a'. Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable. To do this, we need to get rid of the constant term on the right side of the equation. We find that a 47 is added to the right side, so we will subtract 47 from both sides to isolate the term with the variable. 21 - 47 = 13*a + 47 - 47 Step 3: Simplify the equation. -26 = 13*a Step 4: Solve for the variable. Now, we need to find the value of 'a'. Currently, it is multiplied by 13. To isolate 'a', we need to divide by 13 on both sides of the equation. -26 ÷ 13 = (13*a) ÷ 13 -2 = a Step 5: State the solution.

Washington (CNN) -- The United States is beefing up its firepower in Afghanistan by employing heavily armored tanks in Afghanistan for the first time in the nine-year war, a military spokesman said Friday. The U.S. Marine Corps plans to use a company of M1A1 Abrams tanks in restive Helmand province by early spring, Marine Maj. Gabrielle Chapin said. The M1A1 tank is the fastest and most deadly ground combat weapons system available. It will allow for more aggressive missions while mitigating risks to U.S. forces, the military said. The tanks were used successfully by U.S. forces to battle insurgents in Iraq's Anbar province, Chapin said. The company of 115","output":"M1A1 Abrams tanks will be deployed to the volatile region of Helmand province, an area fraught with supply chain difficulties, mountainous terrain, and a strong Taliban presence. This move demonstrates the U.S. military's commitment to achieving strategic and tactical dominance in the region, as well as to support Afghan forces in their ongoing counter-insurgency efforts. The M1A1 Abrams, with its high-speed mobility, advanced targeting systems, and impressive firepower, represents a substantial escalation in capabilities for U.S. and Afghan forces and may prove to be a psychological blow to insurgents in the area. As part of the overall counter-insurgency strategy, the tanks will not only target enemy strongholds and assets but will be used to protect civilian populations, establish secure zones, and deter insurgent attacks on newly constructed infrastructure projects. While the use of tanks in Afghanistan has faced criticism due to potential risks for civilian casualties, the U.S. military has weighed this concern against the possible benefits of deploying the tanks. The M1A1 Abrams has a proven track record of success in recent conflicts, including Iraq, where its strong armor proved invaluable in protecting crew members from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). Its 120mm smoothbore main gun and advanced fire control system give it the ability to engage targets accurately at long ranges and with great precision, while its gas turbine engine allows for rapid movement across various terrains. These capabilities give the U.S. military the advantage in both stand-off engagements and close-quarters combat situations. However, the decision to deploy the M1A1 Abrams tanks in Afghanistan has not come without concerns. Operating and maintaining the tanks in such a hostile environment can be challenging, given the harsh climate, dust, and logistical issues that characterize the region. Fueling the gas turbine engines requires a significant and sustained logistics chain, and spare parts may need to be flown in due to the region's remoteness. Furthermore, the size and weight of the tanks can limit their mobility in the narrow roads and mountain passes of Afghanistan, possibly requiring extra engineering support to establish and maintain supply routes. Despite these challenges, U.S. military commanders seem confident that the benefits of using the M1A1 Abrams tanks in Afghanistan far outweigh the potential drawbacks. They are seen as a force multiplier, enabling not only increased lethality, but also better force protection and intimidation of enemy fighters, helping to disrupt and degrade the insurgents' ability to launch effective attacks and regroup. In conclusion, this deployment of M1A1 Abrams tanks in Afghanistan, though not without challenges, signifies a determination by the U.S military to ramp up its presence and capabilities in the region. It represents an important shift in strategy that may help to turn the tide in the fight against insurgency, ultimately contributing to the stabilization and security of Afghanistan and the surrounding regions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At the time of its founding, women were underrepresented and often faced challenges in pursuing educational and extracurricular activities in a male-dominated academic environment. The proud claim to fame of the young women who formed Kappa Alpha Theta would be their status as trailblazers in creating an organization that provided support, connection, and empowerment for women in higher education. They blazed a path for other women in academia, promoting the importance of female representation, sisterhood, and leadership development. Today, Kappa Alpha Theta continues to uphold these values and actively works towards fostering the growth and development of its members in various fields. Membership in the organization provides a sense of belonging and shared values based on academic excellence, personal growth, and mutual respect. Moreover, Kappa Alpha Theta has contributed to the personal and professional development of numerous accomplished women since its establishment, including former First Lady Laura Bush, actress and singer Ashley Judd, and U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, among many others.

Instead, the presumptive Republican nominee unflinchingly defended the tweet on Saturday targeting Hillary Clinton, saying his staff \\"shouldn't have\\" deleted it. Later Wednesday evening, Trump tweeted a picture of a Disney movie sticker book for \\"Frozen\\" that featured a six-pointed star.      \\"Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also? Dishonest media!\\" Trump tweeted.      Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also? Dishonest media! #Frozen pic.twitter.com/4LJBpSm8xa      Trump's comments on Wednesday revived a controversy that appeared to be quickly fading under the weight of the news that Hillary Clinton's private emails included classified information, and that she will not face charges. On a day when Clinton's controversies dominated the airwaves, Trump resurrected his own.      Reached Wednesday night about Trump's latest tweet, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Jonathan Greenblatt, was baffled.      He said there was no comparison between the star on the \\"Frozen\\" book and \\"a Jewish star superimposed on money talking about calling a candidate being corrupt.\\"      \\"Just so we're clear the image originated with a white supremacist -- not with Disney animators in Burbank,\\" Greenblatt said of Trump's since-deleted tweet.      Greenblatt said Trump needed to \\"simply acknowledge that millions of people were offended\\" and make it clear that anti-Semitic and racist views \\"don't have a place in the campaign.\\"      Clinton's campaign also quickly jumped on the opportunity to go back on the attack, tweeting: \\"Do you want to build a strawman?\\"      Do you want to build a strawman? https://t.co/AoeNTJOGpo — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 7, 2016      On Monday, the Clinton campaign knocked Trump for using a \\"blatantly anti-Semitic image\\" and criticized the de facto GOP nominee for refusing to apologize for the tweet.      At his rally, Trump also repeatedly slammed the media -- including CNN -- for its coverage of the controversy during a rally with thousands of supporters in the battleground state of Ohio and accused the media of having \\"racist tendencies.\\"      \\"Actually they're racially profiling. They're racially profiling. Not us. Why do they bring this up?\\" Trump said. \\"These people are sick.\\"      Critics of Trump's tweet pointed out that the graphic, which featured Clinton and the star on a bed of money with the words \\"most corrupt candidate ever,\\" evoked common anti-Semitic imagery.      Then, the Anti-Defamation League, a leading group in the U.S. combating anti-Semitism and bigotry, slammed Trump's use of the image and Greenblatt told CNN he had no doubt the imagery was anti-Semitic and said it was \\"the classic trope of Jews and money.\\"      Trump said he was not at all mad at his social media director, Dan Scavino, who posted the tweet. Trump pointed out that Scavino's wife is Jewish.      Trump also doubled down on his comments about the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, a human rights abuser whom Trump praised Tuesday night for his efficient killing of terrorists.      \\"I don't love Saddam Hussein. I hate Saddam Hussein. But he was damn good at killing terrorists,\\" Trump said Wednesday.      Trump also praised former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is being vetted as a potential vice presidential pick and joined him at the rally.      \\"And I'm not saying anything, and I'm not telling you it's Newt or anything. But I can tell you, in one form or another, Newt Gingrich is going to be involved with our government, that I can tell you,\\" Trump said. \\"He's smart, he's tough, he gets it.\\"      Gingrich, who ran in for president in 2012, spoke before Trump, hammering the Justice Department's decision to not charge Clinton over her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state.      \\"I cannot imagine more vivid proof of corruption,\\" Gingrich said, pointing in particular to former President Bill Clinton's impromptu meeting with U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on an airport tarmac last week.      Trump repeatedly referenced Gingrich after taking over the podium.      \\"I'm not saying it's Newt, but if it's Newt, nobody is going to be beating him in those debates,\\" Trump said.      The businessman also plugged the candidacy of a fellow Republican facing a tough re-election fight, urging his supporters at the top of his speech and in closing to \\"go out and vote for Rob Portman,\\" while slamming the Ohio senator's Democratic rival, former Ohio Gov.

From a greasy-fry-up and strong coffee to 'hair of the dog' and a dose of painkillers, Britons have long sought after the perfect hangover cure.

There are no cures for a hangover. There are tips for avoiding hangovers and for easing the symptoms. 'The best way to avoid a hangover is not to drink.' With millions preparing for a New Year knees-up on Wednesday evening, the official advice from the health service adds that drinkers should consider eating pasta or rice before they go out. The hangover guide also suggests drinking 'water or non-fizzy soft drinks in between each alcoholic drink', and drinking a pint of water before bed. The patronising tips page adds: 'If you wake up the next morning feeling terrible, you probably didn't follow this advice.'

Its main advantage is that it's easy for a fragile stomach to digest,' the health experts say.

In a final piece of advice, webpage suggests waiting 48 hours after a hangover before drinking again. 'Sometimes, of course, a hangover makes that advice easier to follow,' the guide adds. Experts agree drinking water before you go to bed will help stave off some of the damaging effects of dehydration, which contributes to a hangover. But migraine specialist Andy Dowson recommends milk before bed instead.‘Drinking milk will combat many symptoms,’ he says. ‘Hangovers are thought to be triggered by low blood sugar and dehydration, both of which are potent triggers for migraine — so if you can stomach it, drink milk before sleeping. 'This will give you the volume of fluid as well as help get your blood sugar levels back up.‘Milk is also an anti-diuretic (stopping kidneys producing urine).’ This should mean fewer trips to the loo, minimising sleep disruption. The fact that milk is alkaline might also counteract any inflammation of the stomach caused by excess acidity. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

We can classify the sentiment into categories: positive, negative, and neutral. In this case, the sentiment appears to be mostly negative, with a hint of surprise. Let's break it down further. 1. Emotional aspect: The user seems to be experiencing negative emotions such as hurt or sadness. The words \\"mean\\" and the exclamation point at the end convey a sense of shock or disappointment, suggesting that the user is taken aback or upset by this statement from their mother. 2. Psychological aspect: In this tweet, the user could be seeking comfort or validation from their followers. It's possible that the user is asking for reassurance, hoping that others may offer support or contradict their mother's statement. 3. Social aspect: The relationship between the user and their mother plays a crucial role in the sentiment of the tweet. It showcases a potentially strained or tense relationship between the two. This may lead to sympathy from the followers, who might empathize with the user's situation. 4. Linguistic aspect: The phrasing of the tweet suggests that the user is relaying information rather than stating their own opinion, using third-person narration (\\"My mother just told me\\"). This might indicate that the user is looking to distance themselves from the hurtful comment, or it can be an effort to be objective in presenting the situation. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet is primarily negative. The user appears to be experiencing unpleasant emotions, particularly hurt or disappointment, because they have been called \\"mean\\" by their mother. However, there is also a hint of surprise and a request for reassurance or support from their followers. The tweet showcases a potentially strained relationship between the user and their mother, which may evoke sympathy and empathy from the audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Women teachers are holding back boy students by blaming them for typically male behavior, according to a new study. Women teachers are always saying that boys are \\"silly\\" in class. They refuse to \\"sit nicely like girls\\" and are more likely to be addicted to \\"schoolboy tricks\\".Women teachers may also keep low expectations of boys' academic achievement and encourage girls to work harder by letting them think they are cleverer than boys. The study suggests that under-performance among boys in most national exams could be linked to lower expectations of their women teachers. The researchers did their research mainly on women teachers, since nearly 90 percent of primary school teachers are female. According to the research, women teachers said they often found boys' play in the classroom or in the playground, such as playing with toy guns. The researcher also found that boys were often punished and urged to follow a more feminine style of play instead of being taught how to play responsibly with their favorite toys by their women teachers. Bonny Hartley, the study's lead author, said, \\"By seven or eight years old, children of both boys and girls believe that boys are less focused, less able, and less successful than girls -- and think that adults admit this idea. There are signs that these expectations have the potential to become self-fulfilling in influencing children's achievement. Boys are really held back by their women teachers.\\" Question: What is the women teachers' attitude towards the boys? Options: A: They encourage boys to work harder at their lessons. B: They keep the same expectations of boys and girls. C: They are always thinking that boys are silly in class. D: They think boys are cleverer than girls in their studies.

Article: From strikers to center-backs, everyone needs to know individual defending. So get a partner and start playing 1v1, working on handling your man and pressuring him effectively. When defending one on one, remember to:  Stay slightly crouched and on the balls of your feet.  Your knees should be bent in an athletic position, allowing you to react quickly. Angle your body, with one foot ahead of the other, so that you invite the attacker to go to one side. Force them to the sideline, or to your other defenders, instead of standing straight up and letting them choose your direction. Watch a player's hips to avoid getting tricked. Your hips are your center of gravity, and they generally telegraph where a player is going unless they're Lionel Messi. It is almost impossible to quickly change your hips direction, and you can use this to your advantage as a defender. Great players are always scanning the field, especially when they have the ball. This takes practice, as it's harder to control a ball you can't see. But learning to use the bottom of your eyesight while scanning the field is an essential skill to become a smarter, and thus better, player. Use practices to work on keeping your head up. Turn the ball over now, not in games, and you'll quickly see improvement. Great players are always talking: \\"Open man,\\" \\"I've got the ball,\\" \\"I need some help,\\" and much, much more is constantly being shouted on the field, and there is a good reason. Soccer is a team game, and intelligent players know the team must be on the same page for all 90 minutes to get the most out of the game. Be a team leader and start chattering every game and practice. Essential things to talk about throughout the game include:   Defensive Marks: let your team know who you're covering if you want to challenge the ball, and if there are any unmarked defenders who need to be covered.  Advice to the player dribbling: don't shout tons of info at them, but don't leave them in the dark. Tell them when they have time and when there is a \\"man on.\\"  Making Runs: Tell your teammate you're \\"overlapping!\\" or that \\"you can play it back\\" if they need. When you make a big run, don't assume they will always see you, especially if their head is down. Note where the players are not just when they have the ball, but off of it. What runs are people in your position making? When do they move up to attack and when do they peel back. Don't be afraid to be a bit of a critic -- use these games to learn new ideas and break down why certain things didn't work. How would you play differently, and how would you like to emulate your favorite players?  Burgeoning players can also check out tutorials, clips, and highlights on YouTube, which can help fill in gaps if you're unsure what techniques the pros are using on shots or passes. Find a team or league you love and become a fan -- the more you watch the better your play will be. A big part of soccer intelligence is learning how to work as a team. While each team has specific strategies that they must develop together, there are some tactics that hold true no matter what team you're on:   Contract on defense, expand on offense. This is the basis of all strategies -- you want to take away space on defense and create space when attacking. So, on defense, you come together near the center of the field, forming a unified base and moving together to prevent offensive threats. On offense, you try to make them break this base by stretching out to defend you and your team.  Follow up all shots, forcing the defense to react. Even decent shots can turn into goals if your team is crashing the goal on shots and crosses. This sort of pressure can upend defenses, as defenders will face their own goal on a rebound and have a very hard time clearing it safely.  Keep your shape defensively. Even if you're not playing an offside trap, the defense should be on a horizontal line, holding shape. When defenses lose this shape, they create gaps and holes between themselves. If you play in the back, always look left and right and keep everyone in a mostly even line. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of individual defending in soccer and offers tips for improving one's defensive skills. It advises players to adopt an athletic stance, angle their bodies, and observe their opponents' hips to anticipate their next move. Additionally, the article highlights the significance of communication, team tactics, and learning from watching professional games. It suggests practicing with a partner in a 1v1 setting, noting the roles of both teammates and opponents, and maintaining a good team shape on the field. The article also encourages players to watch soccer matches and tutorials to develop a better understanding of the game and enhance their performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.  After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.  Which country would have lower labor supply in response to their taxation? A:","output":"Based on the Laffer curve and the post-World War II taxation policies implemented by Germany and France, it is likely that France would have a lower labor supply in response to their taxation. After the war, Germany (then West Germany) mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. These governments implemented tax rates below the critical rate suggested by the Laffer curve. This approach would generally encourage labor supply growth as people are more willing to work when the tax burden is relatively low. By taxing below the critical rate, government revenue would increase as a result of an expanding labor supply due to the fact that taxes don't significantly cut into workers' earnings. On the other hand, France had mostly pro-socialist governments during the same period. These governments opted for tax rates above the critical rate. According to the Laffer curve, higher tax rates beyond the critical rate lead to lower labor supply and, in turn, a decrease in government revenue. Workers could be discouraged from entering or remaining in the labor market because a larger portion of their earnings is taken away as taxes. This is particularly true if the tax rate is perceived as prohibitively high or if other government policies also reduce the incentives to work (e.g., extensive welfare programs, early retirement policies, etc.). Furthermore, businesses operating in these countries would need to make informed decisions based on the tax environment. In Germany, the lower tax rates foster an environment more favorable to business development and growth. This, in turn, increases demand for labor. Conversely, in France, businesses may face higher costs associated with the higher tax rates and could be more reluctant to expand or invest in new ventures, indirectly affecting labor supply. Additionally, businesses may choose to relocate to countries where the tax environment is more conducive to growth, further depressing the labor supply in France. It is essential to note that other factors may impact labor supply in these countries as well (e.g., demographic trends, social policies, labor market regulations). Nonetheless, based on the principles of the Laffer curve and the post-World War II taxation policies of Germany and France, we can infer that France would likely have a lower labor supply in response to their taxation policies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the river next to the factories have more hazardous waste or less hazardous waste??    Assuming that:  Nations that have more industry produce more hazardous waste.","output":"To determine whether the river next to the factories will have more hazardous waste or less hazardous waste, let's think step by step: Step 1: Identifying the assumption The assumption given is that nations with more industry produce more hazardous waste. Step 2: Connecting the assumption to the situation  In the given situation, a small nation has decided to ramp up its production capabilities by building several large factories, which would increase the industrial activity in the nation. Step 3: Applying the assumption to the situation As the industrial activity is increased due to the construction of the new factories, based on the given assumption (more industry -> more hazardous waste), the hazardous waste produced in the nation would also be expected to increase. Step 4: Estimating the impact on the river Now, we need to determine if the hazardous waste generated would affect the river next to the factories. If these factories contribute to the production of hazardous waste and if the waste management practices are not adequate, there is a risk that the hazardous waste generated would contaminate the river. Conclusion: Based on the assumption provided and the increase in industrial activity, it can be inferred that the river next to the factories would likely have more hazardous waste if proper waste management practices are not in place to prevent contamination."},{"instruction":"Article: Regrowth Poetry Competition is open to all published and unpublished, UK and non-UK based male and female writers over 16 years of age.

Summarize the following: A therapist can be helpful whether or not your vaginismus is caused by emotional or psychological issues. This is because awareness of the condition itself often produces fear and anxiety before intercourse, starting a vicious cycle that exacerbates symptoms. Feelings of depression, isolation, and lower self-esteem are also common effects of the stigma of sexual dysfunction.  Treatment outcomes are much more positive when the woman and her sexual partner are motivated, cooperative, and resolve to lessen relationship conflicts. So, a couple's psychological evaluation is a great beginning to treatment.  If your vaginismus is connected to anxiety issues or past sexual trauma, a therapist can help you deal with these issues so you can start to move forward. One particular type of therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can be especially helpful to some women. CBT focuses on the relationship between thoughts and behaviors, and a cognitive behavioral therapist can help you change your thoughts and behaviors regarding avoidance of sexual intercourse. One treatment for vaginismus is called exposure therapy, or flooding, and it involves gradual desensitization to penetration. Therapist-aided exposure to penetration is an effective treatment, even for women with lifelong vaginismus. The techniques for exposure usually involve vaginal penetration exercises using dilators. This is the same method used for self-treatment, with the addition of a guide who can help you continue on your own with confidence and success. Ask your doctor to refer you to a physical therapist who has experience dealing with vaginismus and other forms of female sexual dysfunction. Because the muscles of the pelvic floor play such a major role in vaginismus, physical therapy is one of the best treatment options. Your physical therapist might:  teach you breathing and relaxation techniques help you learn pelvic floor muscle contraction to control your pelvic floor muscles Kegel exercises are designed to help you control the muscles of your pelvic floor. To do a Kegel exercise, you simply contract the muscles you would use to stop the flow of urine, hold for a few seconds, then relax. Aim to do about 20 contractions at a time, as many times a day as you can. Some doctors recommend doing Kegel exercises with a finger inserted into your vagina (you can work up to three fingers). Using your finger allows you to feel the muscle contracting in order to better control its movements. Your doctor may recommend vaginal dilators to use at home. These are cone-shaped instruments that are placed in the vagina. They get progressively larger, enabling the muscles of your vagina to stretch and become accustomed to penetration.  To begin, bear down as you would when having a bowel movement. This helps enlarge the vaginal opening. Then, insert fingers (not the dilators yet) into your vagina, continuing to push or bear down. When you begin using the dilators, leave them in for 10 to 15 minutes. The vaginal muscles will become used to the pressure.  If you have a spouse or partner, you may want to ask this person to help you insert the dilators. Women with vaginismus need to be patient and try treatment options before jumping into sexual intercourse. If you try to become sexually active right away, you may experience pain or discomfort, and this sets you up for a cycle of pain and anxiety that worsens vaginismus. It is vital that you have a patient, supportive partner.  When you do try to have sex, go very slowly, use plenty of lubricant, and experiment to find the most comfortable positions. Doctors typically suggest that women hold the penetrative object and place it partially or completely in their vagina as they have done with vaginal dilators. This applies equally to penises, dildos, and vibrators.","output":"A therapist can help with a problem called vaginismus, which makes it hard for a woman to let anything go into her private area. This problem can make a woman feel scared, sad, and alone. The therapist will help the woman and her partner understand and solve any issues they have. There are different ways a therapist can help, like teaching them to relax, control their muscles down there, and use special tools called dilators to make it easier. The woman should be patient and not rush into having private time with her partner until she feels ready. Having a caring partner and trying different ways to be comfortable can help too."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The word evangelical (German: evangelisch), which refers to the gospel, was much more widely used for those involved in the religious movement. Nowadays, this word is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations, above all the ones in the German-speaking area such as the EKD. The German word evangelisch means Protestant, and is different from the German evangelikal, which refers to churches shaped by Evangelicalism. The English word evangelical usually refers to Evangelical Protestant churches, and therefore not to Protestantism as a whole. It traces its roots back to the Puritans in England, where Evangelicalism originated, and then was brought to the United States.

And the answer is?","output":"The answer to the trivia question is Charlie Brown.  Charlie Brown is the main character in the long-running comic strip \\"Peanuts,\\" created by Charles M. Schulz. The strip was first published on October 2, 1950, and continued until February 13, 2000. It remains one of the most popular and influential comic strips in history, touching the hearts of millions of readers with its humor, wisdom, and iconic characters. One of the enduring storylines in the comic strip is Charlie Brown's unrequited love for a character known as the Little Red-Haired Girl. She is referred to as such because her real name is never revealed, and she is never actually shown in the comic strip itself. Schulz intentionally kept her out of the strip as a symbol of unattainable love and the idealized object of affection. Charlie Brown's crush on the Little Red-Haired Girl is a central aspect of his character, which demonstrates his vulnerability, insecurity, and shyness. Throughout the comic strip, he often daydreams about her, pines for her from afar, and expresses his feelings to his friends, particularly Linus van Pelt, who provides moral support and encouragement.  Despite his love for her, Charlie Brown can never muster up the courage to talk to the Little Red-Haired Girl. His attempts to confess his feelings for her or interact with her usually end in failure, often due to comedic mishaps or his own insecurities. This enduring theme resonates with many readers who have experienced unrequited love in their lives and can relate to Charlie Brown's longing for connection and understanding. Over time, the Little Red-Haired Girl became more than just a love interest for Charlie Brown. She came to symbolize the idea of hope, ambition, and the pursuit of happiness that often seems out of reach. The character demonstrates that it is natural to strive for something that seems unattainable, and it is okay to feel vulnerable or afraid in the face of such challenges. In conclusion, the Peanuts character who is in love with the never-seen Little Red-Haired Girl is Charlie Brown, the comic strip's main character. His ongoing passion for her is a recurring theme within the stories, reflecting feelings of vulnerability, uncertainty, and hope, which has resonated with readers for generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The four-chambered mammalian heart can pump blood in two different directions. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen. The left side of the heart pumps blood containing oxygen to the rest of the body. Because of the dual pumping action of the heart, all of the blood going to body cells is rich in oxygen.   Q: How many chambers does a mammalian heart have?   A: Answer:","output":"A mammalian heart has four chambers. This complex structure allows for dual pumping action, which is essential for efficient blood circulation throughout the body. The four chambers are divided into two atria and two ventricles. The right atrium and right ventricle make up the right side of the heart, while the left atrium and left ventricle comprise the left side of the heart.  This structural configuration enables the mammalian heart to pump blood in two different directions. The right side is responsible for pumping blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen through the exchange of gases that occur during respiration. Once oxygenated, the blood returns to the left side of the heart, where the left atrium collects it and subsequently passes it to the left ventricle. The left ventricle then pumps this oxygenated blood to the rest of the body, providing the essential component required for cellular respiration and, ultimately, the survival of the organism's tissues and cells. In summary, the four-chambered configuration of the mammalian heart enables efficient circulation of oxygen-rich blood throughout the body, contributing to the effective functioning of the cardiovascular system and overall well-being of the organism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.  and the situation: David was visiting the natural history museum. He noticed two charts that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two time periods, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's overall climate in the sixteenth century when there were less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And time B showed earth's overall climate in the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. David found some interesting differences between these two charts.  Answer the following question: Which period would see more trapped terrestrial radiation, time A or time B? Answer:","output":"Time B would see more trapped terrestrial radiation, as there are more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in the present century compared to the sixteenth century (time A).

It is hoped that the new type of phone will encourage users to recycle. Scientists have come up with a new material over the last five years. It looks like any other plastic and can be hard or soft, and able to change shape. Overtime it can also break down into the soil without giving out any poisonous chemicals. British researchers used the new material to develop a phone cover that includes a sunflower seed .When this new type of cover turns into waste, it forms nitrates  . These feed the seed and help the flower grow. Engineers have designed a small transparent   window to hold the seed. They have made sure it only grows when the phone is thrown away. \\"We've only put sunflower seeds into the cover so far. But we are working with scientists to find out which flowers would perform best. Maybe we could put roses in next time.\\" said one scientist.

Article: Speech--the act of uttering sounds to convey meaning--is a kind of human action. Like any other constantly repeated action, speaking has to be learned, but once it is learned, it becomes a generally unconscious and apparently automatic process. As far as we can determine, human beings do not need to be forced to speak; most babies seem to possess a sort of instinctive drive to produce speech like noises. How to speak and what to say are another matter altogetner. There actions are learned from the particular society into which the baby is born; so that, like all conduct that is learned from a society--from the people around us--speech is a patterned activity. The meandering babble and chatter of a young child are eventually channeled by imitation into a few orderly grooves that represent the pattern accepted as meaningful by the people around him.

During the interwar period, the new capital of Thuringia saw a population boom, which led to 65,000 inhabitants in 1940. Since that time, the population levels have stagnated. The years 2009 to 2012 brought a moderate growth of approximately 0.35% p. a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Weimar. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders. How many more people did Weimar have in 1800 than they had in 1750?","output":"In 1800, Weimar had a population of 7,000 inhabitants. In 1750, the population was 6,000 inhabitants. To find out how many more people Weimar had in 1800 compared to 1750, we need to subtract the population in 1750 from that of 1800. 7,000 (population in 1800) - 6,000 (population in 1750) = 1,000 Therefore, Weimar had 1,000 more inhabitants in 1800 than it had in 1750."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: MIT researchers have created a camera which can take images so fast - one trillion of them in just a second - that it can capture light as it travels across objects. Nothing can go faster than the speed of light, which thanks to the work of scientific legends such as Leon Foucault and Einstein, we know to be 299,792,458 metres per second in a vacuum. But developers at MIT have managed to catch up, with their camera taking so many images that, when you play them in sequence at super-low-speed, you can see a light beam as it travels from A to B. The fascinating video below was demonstrated at a TED technology conference in Edinburgh. It shows a burst of light traveling the length of a one-litre Coke bottle, bouncing off the cap, before then reflecting back to the bottle’s bottom. Scroll down for video:. What is this? It is the first micro-micro-micro second of light photons travelling into a Coca Cola bottle. The small beam of light - just a millimetre in length - travels further up the bottle, seen thanks to the trillion-exposure camera. While it is not an advert for Coca Cola, there is something very majestic as the famous slogan comes into focus thanks to the tiny light beam. The light scatters now it is inside the bottle, and illuminates the plastic from within. Specific: The video even shows the specific moment that the cap gets illuminated. Brief illumination: The bottle begins to darken again as the light scatters onwards. First of all pointing out that Coca Cola did not sponsor this experiment, Media Lab Associate Professor Ramesh Raskar explained the physics behind the experiment to the TED crowd in Edinburgh. The team used a laser, flicking it on and off in the space of a femtosecond - or a millionth of a billionth of a second. TED Talk: Media Lab Associate Professor Ramesh Raskar during his presentation. In order to get a grip on how short this time is, an oft-quoted example is that a femtosecond is to a second what a second is to about 32 million years. The laser, turned on and off, sends out a small beam of light, measuring in length just a millimetre. The light is directed at a Coca Cola bottle in a darkened room, and the camera then film the light as it (relatively) slowly enters the bottle through the plastic bottom, moves to the far end while scattering light within the bottle, and then bounces off the bottle cap. This is the first time light has publicly been filmed moving, and could have huge repercussions in everything from photography to medical revolutions to shopping. If the technology can become cheap to produce commercially, people could carry scanners to the supermarket and check the ripeness of their fruit and vegetable, as the scanner can beam light into, say, a tomato. If a tomato is ripe, light will be absorbed into the fruit and bounce around, causing a 'glow' in a super-slow video. Unripe or old fruit would not absorb the light. Media Lab postdoc Andreas Velten, one of the system’s developers, called the camera it the 'ultimate' in slow motion. He said: 'There’s nothing in the universe that looks fast to this camera,'. See the TED video here:. The system relies on a recent technology called a streak camera, deployed in a totally unexpected way. The aperture of the streak camera is a narrow slit. Particles of. light - photons - enter the camera through the slit and are converted. into electrons, which pass through an electric field that deflects them. in a direction perpendicular to the slit. Because the electric field is changing very rapidly, it deflects the. electrons corresponding to late-arriving photons more than it does those. corresponding to early arriving ones. The image produced by the camera is thus two-dimensional, but only. one of the dimensions — the one corresponding to the direction of the. slit — is spatial. The other dimension, corresponding to the degree of. deflection, is time. The image thus represents the time of arrival of. photons passing through a one-dimensional slice of space. The camera was intended for use in experiments where light passes. through or is emitted by a chemical sample. Since chemists are chiefly. interested in the wavelengths of light that a sample absorbs, or in how. the intensity of the emitted light changes over time, the fact that the. camera registers only one spatial dimension is irrelevant. But it’s a serious drawback in a video camera. How it works: A tiny laser pulse is fired towards an object, such as a coke bottle or a brick wall. Explanation: The tiny beam of light (pictured center) travels towards the wall. When the light hits an object, in this case a wall, it scatters in a thousand directions. To produce their super-slow-mo videos, Velten, Media Lab Associate. Professor Ramesh Raskar and Moungi Bawendi, the Lester Wolfe Professor. of Chemistry, must perform the same experiment - such as passing a light. pulse through a bottle - over and over, continually repositioning the. streak camera to gradually build up a two-dimensional image. Synchronising the camera and the laser that generates the pulse, so. that the timing of every exposure is the same, requires a battery of. sophisticated optical equipment and exquisite mechanical control. It takes only a nanosecond - a billionth of a second - for light to. scatter through a bottle, but it takes about an hour to collect all the. data necessary for the final video. For that reason, Raskar calls the new system 'the world’s slowest fastest camera.' After an hour, the researchers accumulate hundreds of thousands of. data sets, each of which plots the one-dimensional positions of photons. against their times of arrival. Raskar, Velten and other members of. Raskar’s Camera Culture group at the Media Lab developed algorithms that. can stitch that raw data into a set of sequential two-dimensional. images.","output":"1.

Given the two facts above, what requires either insects or wind.? A:","output":"Given the two facts presented above, the process of pollination requires either insects or wind to be effectively accomplished for most plant species. To provide a detailed and long answer, we will delve into the significance of pollination and the roles played by insects and wind in this process. Pollination is an essential process in the sexual reproduction of plants, involving the transfer of pollen from male structures (anthers) to female structures (stigmas) within flowers or between different flowers. This transfer allows fertilization to occur, leading to the formation of seeds and fruit, which are crucial for the reproduction and perpetuation of plant species. Effective pollination helps plants maintain genetic diversity and adaptability to environmental changes. There are several types of pollination, but we will focus on the two most common: insect pollination (entomophily) and wind pollination (anemophily), as mentioned in the facts provided. 1. Insect Pollination (Entomophily): Insect pollination is a type of biotic pollination that relies on the activity of insects like bees, butterflies, moths, beetles, and flies visiting flowers. These insects are usually attracted to flowers by various factors such as the color, shape, scent, and nectar or pollen rewards offered by the plants. In the process of feeding on or collecting these rewards, the insects inadvertently transfer pollen from one flower to another. Some plants have evolved highly specialized features to ensure their pollination by specific insect species, forming symbiotic relationships. Insect pollination is highly efficient, as insects tend to visit many flowers during their foraging activities, which maximizes the chances of pollen being transferred to compatible flowers and facilitates outcrossing and genetic diversity. In addition, many agricultural crops rely on insect pollination to produce the fruits and seeds that constitute a significant portion of the human diet. 2. Wind Pollination (Anemophily): Wind pollination is an abiotic form of pollination that depends on air currents to facilitate the transfer of pollen between flowers. Plants adapted to wind pollination often produce large quantities of lightweight, dry, and smooth pollen grains, which can easily be carried by the wind. They may also have small, inconspicuous flowers with stamens and stigmas that protrude outside to maximize the chances of pollen release and capture. Anemophily is prevalent in grasses, conifers, and some deciduous trees, which produce a significant amount of pollen during their flowering season. While wind pollination is less precise and can result in considerable pollen waste, it enables plant species to reproduce effectively in the absence of insect pollinator populations. In conclusion, given the facts provided, it is evident that the process of pollination, specifically for most plant species, requires either insects or wind. These two modes of pollination undoubtedly play crucial roles in ensuring the continuity and diversity of plant ecosystems, as well as the availability of food resources for humans and wildlife."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My friend loved her laptop a lot more than her computer, because the","output":"laptop offered unparalleled convenience, portability, and versatility that significantly enhanced her overall computing experience. There are several reasons why my friend preferred her laptop over her computer, which can also be referred to as a desktop computer in this context. These reasons, which are not limited to but include the following, effectively contributed to her propensity for using her trusty laptop: 1. Portability: One of the primary advantages of a laptop is its portability. Unlike desktop computers, which are often large, bulky, and tethered to a specific location, laptops can be easily transported from one place to another. This enabled my friend to not only work from the comfort of her own home but also make use of her laptop during her commute, at coffee shops, and even on vacation. The ease with which she could take her laptop with her made it a far more attractive option compared to her computer, which remained stationary at all times. 2. Versatility: Laptops are designed to be versatile devices that can be used in various environments and circumstances. My friend appreciated the fact that she could use her laptop for work, study, gaming, and entertainment purposes. The built-in webcam and microphone, for example, allowed her to easily participate in video conferences or online classes without the need for additional accessories. Additionally, the laptop's diverse array of available software made it possible for her to complete tasks with ease, which would have been cumbersome or time-consuming on her computer. 3. Space-saving design: The compact nature of a laptop is beneficial, particularly for individuals who live in small homes or shared spaces. My friend valued the fact that her laptop occupied significantly less space than her computer. It didn't require an elaborate set-up, including a separate monitor, mouse, keyboard, and a range of cables and wires. This not only reduced clutter but also provided her with more room to work and live comfortably. 4. Energy efficiency: Generally speaking, laptops tend to consume less power than desktop computers. This factor was important to my friend, as it allowed her to save on energy costs while also reducing her carbon footprint. As an environmentally conscious individual, it made sense for her to choose a laptop over her computer, whenever possible. 5. All-in-one package: Laptops come equipped with a screen, keyboard, trackpad, and a multitude of essential components, such as memory, storage, and processing power. My friend appreciated the all-in-one nature of her laptop, as it consolidated her computing needs into one neat package without sacrificing functionality. In summary, my friend's preference for her laptop over her computer can be attributed to the device's portability, versatility, space-saving design, energy efficiency, and all-in-one convenience. These factors combined to make her laptop an indispensable tool that greatly contributed to a seamless and enjoyable computing experience, far surpassing what her computer could offer."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: What is Trent's profession? Movie title: Days of Darkness Movie plot: After a comet passes near the earth, most of the population becomes cannibalistic zombies. Survivors gather at a military complex, where they discover that an alien parasite borne of the comet infects the zombies. The group includes Trent, a preacher, and his infected brother, Herbert; Simon, a gay man; Steve and Mimi, a young couple; Chad, a man who has been bitten on the arm; an ex-porn star and her daughter; a rancher; and several soldiers. As the infection worsens, the parasite causes men's genitals to fall off and virgin births among the females. After an unsuccessful attempt to forage for supplies that results in the deaths of several people, Steve attempts to save Mimi from the infection. As he anesthetizes her with alcohol prior to operating on her, the alien organism flees from her body. Realizing that alcohol can save them, they become drunk and use the rancher's whiskey supplies to destroy the zombies.

In versions of the Renaissance , Ogier travels to the Avalon ruled by Morgan le Fay and eventually becomes King Arthur 'apos ; Parade . In versions of the Renaissance , Ogier travels to the Avalon governed by King Arthur and eventually becomes Morgan le Fay 's Paramour . OPT:  a). no.  b). yes.","output":"a). no. These two sentences convey different meanings, though they share similarities in their overall structure: 1. In versions of the Renaissance, Ogier travels to the Avalon ruled by Morgan le Fay and eventually becomes King Arthur's Parade. 2. In versions of the Renaissance, Ogier travels to the Avalon governed by King Arthur and eventually becomes Morgan le Fay's Paramour. Taking a closer look, we can see that the differences are as follows: 1. The first sentence mentions that Avalon is ruled by Morgan le Fay in this version of the story. The role that Ogier assumes in this situation is becoming \\"King Arthur's Parade.\\" The word 'Parade' seems to be out of context here and may potentially be a typo or a misuse. It might be meant to represent a position or role in relation to King Arthur. 2. The second sentence presents an alternate narrative. In this case, Avalon is governed by King Arthur rather than Morgan le Fay. Ogier's ultimate role is not related to King Arthur but instead involves becoming Morgan le Fay's paramour, which means a lover, especially one who engages in a secret or illicit romantic affair. In conclusion, although both sentences involve Renaissance versions of the legendary figure Ogier and the realm of Avalon, the main differences lie in who governs Avalon (Morgan le Fay in the first sentence, King Arthur in the second) and the role Ogier assumes (King Arthur's 'Parade' in the first sentence, Morgan le Fay's paramour in the second)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two sexually active men are currently at the doctor getting checked for sexually transmitted diseases. Before performing the actual tests, the doctor takes a brief physical examination of the men. The doctor notices that Jake's heart is beating irregularly and his arm appears to have a rash on it. While examining Scully, the doctor takes note of how yellow Scully's eyes are, and Scully also reports to the doctor that he has been throwing up lately. After the physical, the doctor has the men both pee into a cup so that he can run a standard STD test for them.  and a hint : Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis B.  Please answer this question : Does Scully have a higher or lower chance than Jake of contracting liver cancer? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided and the symptoms exhibited by both individuals, Scully has a higher chance of contracting liver cancer than Jake. The reasoning behind this conclusion is as follows: 1. The hint provided mentions that Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver, which can be passed through sexual activity, and may cause vomiting and yellowing of the skin and eyes. Scully exhibits symptoms consistent with Hepatitis B, such as yellow eyes and vomiting. 2. The hint also states that people who are sick with Hepatitis B for the rest of their lives are at an increased risk of liver damage, which may lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. 3. Jake has an irregular heartbeat and a rash on his arm, but these symptoms do not seem related to Hepatitis B or liver cancer. Considering the symptoms present in Scully and the information provided about Hepatitis B, it is concluded that Scully has a higher chance of contracting liver cancer compared to Jake. Of course, the doctor would need to perform additional tests to confirm the presence of Hepatitis B in Scully and to further assess Jake's heart condition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The day after the Britain's Got Talent finals, Max Clifford, speaking for Simon Cowell, said that it was \\"quite possible\\" that Cowell would be signing some of the finalists, including Smith. Though she did not sign with Syco, Cowell's record label, she did record a duet of \\"Walking in the Air\\" with Johnston, which appeared on his debut album, One Voice, and was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. Before the release of One Voice, it was revealed that Smith and her father were finalising the details of her record deal. In November, it was announced that Smith would be performing on stage in Kettering with Sylvia Berryman, a vocal tutor who had worked with Smith prior to her appearance on Britain's Got Talent. Smith said that she was \\"really looking forward to singing locally again\\", and it was again reported that Smith hoped to soon sign her own record deal.In December 2008 the Daily Mail reported that Smith had signed a £2.3 million, multi-album deal with Universal Music Group that was the \\"most lucrative recording contract ever handed to a schoolgirl\\". Smith said \\"I'm honoured to be joining such a fantastic record company, especially since it's where [Jenkins] started.\\" Dickon Stainer, speaking on behalf of Universal, said \\"as soon as we saw Faryl, it became an ambition to sign her.\\" Universal claimed it intended to market Smith as a pop star.

Later, Mladic and his soldiers had another battle. This time, it was in a place called Srebrenica. Srebrenica was a small town with lots of people living there. Mladic was in charge of the attack, and some very bad things happened during this time.

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to center yourself in meditation  Develop your motivation and inspiration first.  Where most meditations fail is because the motivation is absent. Often people will try to meditate without motivation and it invariably stays dry and uninteresting.","output":"To truly delve deep into your meditation practice and experience its transformative potential, you must fuel your journey with a genuine sense of purpose and a burning desire for personal growth. Begin by asking yourself why you want to meditate, what you hope to achieve, and how it can positively impact your life and the lives of those around you. Identify the core reason or intention that drives you - it could be stress relief, inner peace, increased mindfulness, enhanced focus, better relationships, spiritual awakening, or any other worthwhile pursuit. Once you have a clear understanding of what drives your meditation practice, the next step is to cultivate inspiration. One way to do this is by surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals or finding a meditation group that resonates with your personal beliefs and goals. Alternatively, immerse yourself in books, podcasts, documentaries, or talks by meditation teachers and thought leaders who inspire and challenge you. These sources of knowledge will not only provide valuable wisdom and advice, but they can also rekindle your motivation and determination when it falters. With your motivation and inspiration solidly in place, you can now create a comfortable and serene environment for your meditation practice. Choose a quiet, uncluttered space where you can sit with your spine straight and feel relaxed but alert. Establishing a routine – including setting a consistent time, duration, and location for your meditation – will support your motivation and practice as well. As you begin your meditation session, focus on your breath as a means of connecting with your body and bringing your awareness to the present moment. Take deep, deliberate breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth, letting go of any mental or physical tension with each breath. Use this time to recall your motivation and inspiration for meditating, and envision how successfully integrating meditation into your daily life will help you reach your goals. Once you feel grounded and connected to the present, gently guide your awareness towards your thoughts and emotions. Pay close attention to the quality of your thoughts and observe them without judgment. The goal is to cultivate a non-reactive state of mind that allows thoughts to come and go without attachment or aversion, thus helping you build equanimity and emotional resilience over time. Remember, meditation is an ongoing journey of personal growth and discovery. As you progress, you may encounter moments of self-doubt or frustration – but these moments are simply part of the learning process. Stay connected to your motivation and inspiration, and be gentle and kind to yourself as you continue to develop your meditation practice. Over time, you will find that maintaining a centered and balanced state of mind becomes second nature, ultimately leading to greater overall well-being and a more authentic, fulfilling life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The suggestion, however, provides a statement from a study regarding the relationship between ADHD and eating disorders, which does not directly address the question about inappropriate statements. Therefore, the proposed suggestion cannot be considered as a correct answer.  When encountering a person with an eating disorder, it is essential to approach the conversation with sensitivity and empathy. Some examples of things not to say to someone with an eating disorder include: 1. Making judgments about their appearance or weight 2. Discussing your own diet or negative body image issues 3. Encouraging them to \\"just eat\\" or making comments about their food choices 4. Minimizing their struggles by saying it's \\"just a phase\\" or calling it a lifestyle choice 5. Comparing them to other people or implying that their condition isn't severe It's important to educate oneself about eating disorders and be aware of potentially triggering language or comments. Instead of the suggested statement, a more appropriate response would focus on specific things that are harmful or insensitive to say to someone with an eating disorder."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Which TV spy, who first became famous in the 60’s, did Henry Cavill play In a 2015 film?","output":"Henry Cavill portrayed the character of Napoleon Solo in the 2015 film \\"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\\" The movie, directed by Guy Ritchie, is a cinematic adaptation of the popular 1960s television series of the same name, which initially aired on NBC from 1964 to 1968. The character of Napoleon Solo, a debonair and resourceful secret agent, first gained fame through this TV series. The TV show \\"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\\" revolved around the adventures of two spies, Napoleon Solo (originally played by Robert Vaughn) and Illya Kuryakin (portrayed by David McCallum). They were agents of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement (U.N.C.L.E.), a secret international intelligence agency working to maintain global peace and order. U.N.C.L.E. agents frequently faced off against a variety of nefarious organizations, most notably T.H.R.U.S.H., a malevolent criminal group with ambitions of world domination. In Guy Ritchie's 2015 film adaptation, Henry Cavill took on the legendary role of Napoleon Solo, while Armie Hammer portrayed his partner and Russian counterpart Illya Kuryakin. The movie retained the original series' key elements, such as its spy-themed action, humor, and distinct '60s vibe. Set during the Cold War era, the film followed the duo as they teamed up to thwart a criminal organization attempting to create and sell nuclear weapons. Henry Cavill's portrayal of Napoleon Solo brought a fresh and modern take on the character to the big screen. The film capitalized on Cavill's suave charm, wit, and physicality, effectively capturing the essence and iconic status of the original 1960s TV version. Although the movie received mixed reviews from critics, many praised the chemistry between Cavill and Hammer, as well as the stylish, retro-inspired visuals and the homage paid to the TV series. In conclusion, the TV spy from the 1960s who was portrayed by Henry Cavill in a 2015 film is Napoleon Solo from \\"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\\" Having originated in the television series that ran from 1964 to 1968, the character was revitalized and reintroduced to a new generation of fans through Guy Ritchie's adaptation, with Cavill's performance being an integral element of the film's success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is also agreed that \\"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\\". But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers.

But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte).\\"?

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties.

The silence that settled between them was suddenly interrupted by a faint rumble in the distance. They both knew the volcano was slowly waking up, and it was only a matter of time before it unleashed its destructive power upon the little village and its unsuspecting inhabitants. The tension in the room was nearly as palpable as the fear and apprehension settling in the hearts of the villagers outside. \\"Why did you choose to write about the impending eruption?\\" Vimes asked, his gaze still fixed on the young journalist. \\"You could have easily focused on any number of other stories.

Instead, the Times represented hope, transparency, and a dedicated effort towards the betterment of Ankh-Morpork and its people. It was evident that every story printed within its pages, be it about the heartwarming tales of everyday heroes or a looming disaster like the volcanic eruption, was chosen with a sense of responsibility and respect for the power that accurate information carries in the wild, tangled world they inhabited. As the conversation drew to a close, the rumble from the volcano grew louder—an ominous reminder of the devastation looming over the village. William stood, preparing to leave and do what he did best: tell stories that mattered. With a newfound sense of urgency and unwavering determination, Ankh-Morpork's influential editor-in-chief walked out of Vetinari's office and into the unknown, his heart anchored by the knowledge that the pursuit of truth is always worth the danger and sacrifices it entails. As the volcano's eruption drew nearer, both William de Worde and the Times would continue to play a crucial role in understanding, documenting, and ultimately shaping the outcome of the disaster. In the midst of chaos and fear, they stood as a testament to the unyielding strength of a free press and the fundamental human right to be informed, driving home the point that even in the darkest of times, the beacon of truth will never cease to shine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Prolonged exposure to UV-B light can cause sunburn, and there are worries that damage to the ozone layer may lead to an increase in the incidence of skin cancer. Can we infer the following? UV-B light is damaging the ozone layer.","output":"From the given information, we cannot directly infer that UV-B light is damaging the ozone layer. However, we can discuss their roles and relationship.  UV (ultraviolet) light is a type of electromagnetic radiation that is divided into three categories: UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C. UV-B light, which makes up only a small fraction of the sun's rays (around 5%), is known for its adverse effects on human health, such as sunburn and skin cancer. On the other hand, the ozone layer is a stratum in the Earth's atmosphere that contains a high concentration of ozone (O3) molecules, mainly located in the lower part of the stratosphere. The ozone layer plays a vital role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun, including the vast majority of UV-B rays. In doing so, it prevents these harmful rays from reaching the Earth's surface and causing damage to living beings, including humans. It is important to note that the relationship between UV-B light and the ozone layer is not that UV-B is causing damage to the layer. Instead, it is human-made chemicals, like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that have been implicated in ozone depletion. When CFCs are released into the atmosphere due to various human activities, they react with the ozone molecules and cause a decrease in ozone concentrations. This depletion of the ozone layer leads to an increase in the amount of harmful UV-B rays reaching the Earth's surface, which, in turn, elevates the risk of skin cancer and other health issues. As concerns regarding the ozone layer depletion and its consequences have grown, steps have been taken, such as the Montreal Protocol, to mitigate the release of ozone-depleting substances and protect the ozone layer. As a result, there has been a gradual decrease in the use of CFCs, and the ozone layer has started to show signs of recovery. In conclusion, while it is true that damage to the ozone layer may lead to an increase in the incidence of skin cancer due to higher levels of UV-B radiation, the statement that UV-B light is damaging the ozone layer is inaccurate. It is the release and accumulation of human-made chemicals, like CFCs, that contribute to ozone depletion, and ultimately, the increase in harmful UV-B exposure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The design is sleek and modern, making navigation simple and hassle-free. One of the major highlights of this app is its diverse feature set. It offers multiple tools that cater to different needs, ranging from language translation and currency conversion to weather updates and travel tips. The developers have clearly put effort into making sure that the app is versatile and adaptable. Performance-wise, the com.olam app is mostly smooth and fast. Even with multiple features running simultaneously, I experience very little lag or loading time. The speedy performance allows me to switch tabs or input entries with ease. However, there's still room for improvement. The app occasionally experiences minor glitches, such as random freezing or unexpected logouts, which disrupt the otherwise seamless experience. Additionally, some features could use further refinement and updates to enhance their accuracy, particularly in terms of language translation and local information. More language options for the app interface would also be a welcome addition, catering to the global user base. Despite these minor drawbacks, the com.olam app is undeniably a valuable tool that helps me stay organized and well-informed.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. You may be able to get away before a goose becomes too aggressive if you see the warning signs of an attack. Pay attention to any potential signs of aggression when you're near a goose.  At first, a goose will bend its head back slightly. This indicates aggression. If the goose then bends its neck out straight, this shows the aggression is increasing. If a goose is about to attack, it will pump its head up and down. Geese may hiss or honk as well if they are becoming aggressive. If you notice warning signs of an attack, leave before the goose begins to chase you. If the goose sees you're backing away, it may decide you're not a threat. Back away slowly until you're a good distance from the goose and it's stopped making aggressive gestures. In the event the goose starts chasing you, back away slowly. Stay faced towards the goose and use your peripheral vision to guide your movements. Make sure to avoid anything you may trip over, as this may give the goose reason to attack. If you appear frightened or upset, a goose could take this as a sign of aggression. It's a good idea to maintain a calm, neutral demeanor when backing away from a goose. If you're struggling to remain calm, take a few deep breaths as you back away. Keep in mind that, while geese can be territorial, an actual physical attack is very rare. In the event a goose bites you or hits you with its wings, seek medical attention. Geese are strong, and can cause injury when provoked. You may require stitches or a cast if a goose attacks you. Go to the emergency room for assessment as soon as you get away. Summary:","output":"If you see a goose looking angry, it might bend its head back and then stretch its neck out straight. They may also make hissing or honking sounds. If this happens, slowly back away and try to stay calm. If a goose chases you, keep facing it and move away slowly without tripping. Don't show fear, or the goose could get madder. Getting hurt by a goose doesn't happen a lot, but if it does, go to a doctor for help."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: It what centrury did Tak'alik Ab'aj first start to flourish? is inside the article: Tak'alik Ab'aj (; Mayan pronunciation: [takˀaˈlik aˀ'ɓaχ] (listen); Spanish: [takaˈlik aˈβax]) is a pre-Columbian archaeological site in Guatemala. It was formerly known as Abaj Takalik; its ancient name may have been Kooja. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites with both Olmec and Maya features. The site flourished in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important centre of commerce, trading with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, petroglyphs and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments., can you guess it ?

Harris’ attorney, Maddox Kilgore, questioned whether the eight-count indictment — two counts of sexually exploiting children and six of disseminating harmful material to a minor — was a “calculated maneuver to inflame public opinion against Ross” just five weeks before jury selection in the murder trial. Harris, who goes on trial April 11, is charged with intentionally leaving his son, Cooper, to die in the back of a sweltering SUV in June 2014.      » Listen to Breakdown Season 2 on the Justin Ross Harris case here.      “Despite possessing Ross Harris’ cell phone for almost two years, the Cobb County district attorney has only now chosen to indict Ross for some alleged consensual electronic communications,” Kilgore said in a statement.      In the new indictment, Harris is accused of possessing lewd photographs of two underage girls, sending nude photos to those girls and one other and engaging in sexually explicit chats with all three.      Cobb District Attorney Vic Reynolds said the timing was unavoidable.      The new indictment was made possible by “advances in electronic forensic analysis in conjunction with recent interviews of newly discovered victims,” he said.      “Had the state delayed charging any further, prosecution of some of the charges would have barred by the statute of limitations,” Reynolds said.      Harris will be tried separately on the latest charges which, according to prosecutors, should not delay the murder trial.      The defense had previously moved — unsuccessfully — to separate charges related to Harris’ extramarital dalliances from the more serious counts, including malice murder, felony murder and cruelty to children. But the state argued in pretrial hearings that his sexting with other women was crucial to understanding motive.      Neither side denies Harris was actively engaged in sexual online chats with numerous women. Cobb Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified in October that Harris sent 40,000 texts using the Whisper messaging app alone.      Family was a “hurdle that stood in the way of Harris’ desire to be with as many women as possible,” Cobb Assistant District Attorney Chuck Boring said at a motions hearing in October.      Prosecutors also revealed that, just 10 minutes before he last saw his son Cooper alive, Harris responded sympathetically to a social media post written by an anonymous mother lamenting her decision to have children.      “I love my son and all,” Harris wrote on the morning of June 18, 2014. “But we both need escapes.”      Kilgore has long contended the state is trying to poison the well against his client. He repeated that charge on Friday.      “After more than a 20-month investigation into every imaginable detail of Ross Harris’ life, this new indictment alleges no acts of cruelty, no deprivation, no abuse, nor any neglect of Cooper,” Kilgore said. “The content and timing of this indictment confirms the absence of such evidence, and it signals the state’s desperation to convict Ross of the worst mistake any of us as parents could make.”      Harris pleaded not guilty to all charges in the first indictment.

Information:  - In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).  - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum.  - In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fission is either a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts (lighter nuclei). The fission process often produces free neutrons and gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay.  - In materials science, ductility is a solid material's ability to deform under tensile stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to be stretched into a wire. Malleability, a similar property, is a material's ability to deform under compressive stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to form a thin sheet by hammering or rolling. Both of these mechanical properties are aspects of plasticity, the extent to which a solid material can be plastically deformed without fracture. Also, these material properties are dependent on temperature and pressure (investigated by Percy Williams Bridgman as part of his Nobel Prize-winning work on high pressures).  - Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface, for example, the space that a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or shape occupies or contains. Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container, i. e. the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces.  - In nuclear physics, nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei come close enough to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles (neutrons and/or protons). The difference in mass between the products and reactants is manifested as the release of large amounts of energy. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic \\"binding energy\\" between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Fusion is the process that powers active or \\"main sequence\\" stars, or other high magnitude stars.  - Neutron radiation is a kind of ionizing radiation which consists of free neutrons. A result of nuclear fission or nuclear fusion, it consists of the release of free neutrons from atoms, and these free neutrons react with nuclei of other atoms to form new isotopes, which, in turn, may produce radiation.  - The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons, each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit, constitute the nucleus of an atom, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics.  - The density, or more precisely, the volumetric mass density, of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is  (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter \\"D\\" can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:  - Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number. All isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons in each atom. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots isos ( \\"equal\\") and topos ( \\"place\\"), meaning \\"the same place\\"; thus, the meaning behind the name is that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table.  - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).  - Embrittlement is a loss of ductility of a material, making it brittle. Various materials have different mechanisms of embrittlement.  - Neutron - induced swelling is the increase of volume and decrease of density of materials subjected to intense neutron radiation . Neutrons impacting the material 's lattice rearrange its atoms , causing buildup of dislocations , voids , and Wigner energy . Together with the resulting strength reduction and embrittlement , it is a major concern for materials for nuclear reactors . Materials show significant differences in their swelling resistance . See also : Radiation hardening    What entity does 'neutron-induced swelling' has the relation 'instance of' with?","output":"Neutron-induced swelling, as an occurrence or phenomenon, is an instance of the broader concept of radiation effects on materials, specifically nuclear materials. Radiation effects on materials encompass various changes that occur in materials due to exposure to radiation, particularly ionizing radiation like neutron radiation. These can include dimensional changes (like swelling), changes in material properties (like embrittlement), changes at the atomic or molecular level (like displacement of atoms and formation of voids), etc. So, the entity that 'neutron-induced swelling' has the 'instance of' relationship with is 'Radiation Effects on Materials'. This entity encompasses various phenomena related to the alteration of materials under the impact of different forms of radiation. The alterations can occur in physical, chemical, or mechanical properties of materials. Each specific effect, like neutron-induced swelling, is an instance of these radiation effects on materials. Furthermore, neutron-induced swelling also falls under the category of radiation damage, which involves the deleterious effects of radiation on materials. These negative effects can happen in any environment where there is significant radiation, but they are especially studied and observed in relation to materials used in the construction and operation of nuclear reactors. So another entity with which neutron-induced swelling may have an 'instance of' relationship could arguably be 'Radiation Damage'.

While Taker still hasn't officially announced his retirement from professional wrestling, these photos of Undertaker getting around with crutches aren't exactly reassuring: Yep, those pictures are just depressing — although to be fair, we can't say with certainty that this is Taker's current state. Perhaps the photos are a little bit older, or maybe this is an acute situation. Either way, rather than dwell on the toll Father Time has taken on the Undertaker, let's relive some of his greatest moments. After all, \\"Hell in a Cell,\\" the match Taker made famous before it became a full-fledged PPV, is just over two weeks away. There was the time in 2008 that he went toe-to-toe with Edge: Or the time Taker threw Mankind off the top of the Cell: And, of course, there was WrestleMania 32, when Shane McMahon once again jumped off of the highest point he could find, aiming for the Undertaker: As for Kane?

Article: A famous American John Muir said in 1898: \\"The Grand Canyon... as unearthly   in the color and grandeur   of its architecture as if you had found it after death on some other star.\\" Like Muir, those of us who stand along the rim are prompted to wonder about the unearthliness and the forces that created and are still changing this place. After more than 100 years of studies, many things are still mysterious. Today visitors come by the thousands -- the great and simple of the earth -- all in a spirit of wonder. Travelers come from every state of the Union, from every country in Europe and Asia. From the depths of the canyon comes welling silence. Seldom can you hear the roar of the river, for all sounds are swallowed in this gulf of space. \\"It makes one want to murmur.\\" A woman once whispered to her companion. This silence is not the silence of death; rather, it is a presence. It is like a great piece of music. But music made of man works up to a climax   and stops. Now, visitors to the South Rim alone may number 18,000 in a single day. Some of that number will travel by mule train down Bright Angel Trail to the canyon's floor, cross the raging river by a suspension bridge   and walk to the North Rim. Though the two rims face each other across only 12 miles, it is a journey of 214 miles by car from one to the other. Nor can you visit the North Rim except in summer; some 1,200 feet higher than the South Rim, it is snow covered much of the year except in July and August. But there is no day that you may not visit the South Rim and find the sun warm on your face and the air perfumed with the incense   of smoke from an Indian hearth  . No wonder an American writer and journalist said, \\"I came here an atheist  , and departed a devout  believer.\\" Question: What is it that attracts so many travelers to the Canyon? - The unearthliness and the grandeur of its architecture. - The presence of American super stars. - The saying made by American writers and journalists. - The roaring of the river in the Canyon.

A majority of working women remain in full charge of their home; they come back at night to the cleaning, washing, and cooking that constitute their second career. But more and more husbands are sharing the burden and willingly taking on chores that their fathers would have rejected as unmanly, and as too mysteriously difficult anyway. In such cases, man and wife become equal partners, both working outside, both pushing the vacuum cleaner, actually, the number of husbands who do help that way is much smaller than the number of those who accept the idea in theory.  _ .

It has been used by Winston Churchill to give driving lessons, served in the Second World War as a recovery truck and gained international fame in hit TV series The Avengers. Now, after decades rusting away in a garage, this 1923 Silver Ghost Rolls Royce has been restored to its former glory - and is thought to be worth a cool £250,000. The vintage motor is said to have served the former British Prime Minister when he used it to give driving lessons to the first female MP, Lady Astor, on a Kent estate. Just like new: Classic car restorer Charlie Tope with the 1923 Silver Ghost Rolls Royce, once used by Sir Winston Churchill, which had been deteriorating in a garage for decades. Fit for the road again: The engine of the restored Rolls Royce, which was also used in TV show The Avengers and as a recovery truck during the Second World War. During the war years, its back end was cut off to convert it into a recovery truck with a mini crane bolted on to the chassis for the auxiliary fire and ambulance service in Manchester. And in the 1960s, the Rolls appeared in 18 episodes of the Avengers as the car of choice for English gentleman character John Steed. During the series, the classic car had a steak cooked on her engine and a ladder smashed through the windscreen. But after the show the Rolls was forgotten about - and sat deteriorating in a Sussex garage until earlier this year. Proud: Mr Tope has spent the last six months painstakingly restoring the classic car. Rich heritage: The car was apparently used by Sir Winston Churchill to give Britain's first female MP driving lessons in Kent. It had been purchased for just £200 in the early 1950s by the grandfather of Tania Turner, from Sussex. He spent £2,000 on restoring the vehicle, but sadly left it in his garage for decades before passing it on to Mrs Turner and husband Andy. They enlisted the help of classic car expert Charlie Tope to return the Rolls to the open road. Mr Turner said: 'A friend had his old Alvis restored by Charlie and we thought he would be the ideal person to tackle the Rolls. She looks absolutely fantastic - better than new.' International fame: During the 1960s, the vehicle appeared in The Avengers as the car of choice for English gentleman John Steed (above) Mr Tope, from Modbury, Devon, has spent the last six months carefully restoring the vintage vehicle and is proud of the result. He said: 'It's been a wonderful project but when I took it on I don't think I realised how big a task it would be. 'She may be a car designed for only a couple of passengers but at 16ft long and 7ft wide she is more like a small lorry.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"There is an old car called Silver Ghost Rolls Royce, made in 1923, that has a very special history. Winston Churchill, an important man from the past, used it to teach a lady named Lady Astor how to drive. During a big war, the car was changed and used for helping people. It also came out in a famous TV show long time ago, where it got a little damaged. The car was left alone in a garage for many years, but a man named Charlie Tope fixed it up and made it look new again. Now, the car is shiny and can be driven on the road, and its worth a lot of money!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia.

Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Idlewild are a Scottish indie rock band that formed in Edinburgh in 1995. The band's line-up consists of Roddy Woomble (lead vocals), Rod Jones (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Newton (drums), Andrew Mitchell (bass) and Luciano Rossi (keyboards). To date, Idlewild have released seven full-length studio albums, with their latest, Everything Ever Written, released in February 2015. Initially, Idlewild's sound was faster and more dissonant than many of their 1990s indie rock contemporaries. Jones released his debut solo album, A Sentimental Education, in 2009. In 2010, Jones founded The Fruit Tree Foundation, alongside Emma Pollock (The Delgados), in order to raise awareness of mental health problems. Jones released his second solo album, A Generation Innocence, in August 2012; however, while writing for the second album, Jones encountered a hurdle at the halfway mark, as he discovered that he was not satisfied with any of the material that he had written thus far. In 2011, Jones explained, \\"I was a bit fed up with the whole folk music thing - I mean every man and his dog was doing the faux folk thing\\"--Jones then proceeded to learn the drums and eventually formed the band, The Birthday Suit, to record the material that he had created in the period following the drumming diversion.  In late 2011, Jones formed The Birthday Suit and described the band as \\"essentially a solo project ... It's an ever-changing bistro of musicians.\\" The band released its debut album, The Eleventh Hour, in October 2011. The Birthday Suit's second studio album, A Conversation Well Rehearsed was released on 3 December 2012. The album was listed in 19th place in the Clean Slate Music website's \\"Top 21 Albums of 2012\\" list, although the website wrote that the second album \\"doesn't carry the punch\\" of the band's debut album.  In 2006, Woomble worked with several musicians including Kate Rusby, his wife Ailidh Lennon, songwriter Karine Polwart (to whom he presented the Horizon Award at the BBC Folk Awards 2005, and with whom he performed at Celtic Connections) and Idlewild guitarist Rod Jones on his debut solo album My Secret is My Silence, produced by John McCusker. The album was released in July 2006, and Woomble toured the United Kingdom in support of the album's release. My Secret is my Silence reached number one in the UK Folk Charts, and a year later, on 10 July 2007, My Secret is my Silence was released in the United States on 7-10 Music. Woomble's follow-up album, Before the Ruin, written and recorded with Kris Drever and John McCusker, was released on 15 September 2008 through Navigator Records. In March 2011, Woomble released his second solo album, The Impossible Song & Other Songs.

Answer the following question: Translation reads the genetic code in mRNA and makes a protein, and every protein is a translated gene. Given these facts, what is the genetic code in mRNA that can be translated among the following options: - made  - SO2  - alleles  - water  - a gene  - carbonic acid  - genetic drift  - complex Answer:","output":"Among the given options, the correct answer is \\"a gene.\\" The genetic code in mRNA that can be translated is indeed based on the information stored in a gene. However, to provide a comprehensive understanding, let us discuss the process of translation and how it relates to the genetic code in mRNA. The genetic code is the set of rules that the cell's machinery follows to convert or translate the information encoded in the nucleotide sequence of mRNA into a corresponding amino acid sequence for protein synthesis. This code consists of a triplet code, where three nucleotides, called codons, represent one amino acid. In total, there are 64 possible codons, which code for 20 different amino acids and 3 stop signals. The process of translation can be mainly divided into three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. Here's a detailed explanation of each stage: 1. Initiation: The process begins with the formation of the initiation complex, consisting of the small ribosomal subunit, an initiator tRNA molecule carrying the first amino acid (usually methionine) and an mRNA molecule. The small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA, and the initiator tRNA binds to the mRNA's start codon (AUG). 2. Elongation: In this phase, the large ribosomal subunit attaches to the small subunit, forming a complete ribosome complex. The codons in the mRNA are read sequentially by the ribosome, attracting corresponding tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids. The amino acids are then linked through peptide bonds, gradually creating the growing polypeptide chain. 3. Termination: The process of translation ends when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) on the mRNA. This signals the termination, and the newly synthesized polypeptide chain is released from the tRNA and ribosome. The ribosome dissociates into its subunits, and the mRNA is released for potential re-use or degradation. Now, let us justify the answer based on the provided options: - made: This term is not related to the genetic code in mRNA. - SO2: This is a chemical formula for sulfur dioxide and is irrelevant to the genetic code in mRNA. - alleles: Although alleles contain genetic information, they refer to alternative forms of a gene, not the specific code in mRNA. - water: This term refers to a molecule (H2O) and has no connection to the genetic code in mRNA. - carbonic acid: This is an inorganic compound (H2CO3) and not related to the genetic code in mRNA. - genetic drift: This term refers to the random changes in allele frequencies within a population over time, not the genetic code in mRNA. - complex: This term is too general and does not refer to the genetic code in mRNA. In conclusion, the genetic code in mRNA that can be translated is based on a gene's information, which is then converted into a functional protein through the process of translation. The genetic code consists of codons, which are groups of three nucleotides that correspond to specific amino acids. These amino acids are then linked to form a polypeptide chain, eventually giving rise to a functional protein."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Researchers used high-speed cameras to show exactly how the fly positioned itself to capture a moving target in mid-air. The results are published in the journal Current Biology. Paloma Gonzalez-Bellido from Cambridge University explained that, normally, \\"when we think of hunting animals we think of excellent vision and speed, but when you're so very tiny, you have a very small brain and limited sensory capacity\\". She added: \\"We wanted to know how [this fly manages] this predatory behaviour.\\" Dr Gonzalez-Bellido and her colleagues created a miniature outdoor studio - filming the fly from two angles to capture its movement in 3D. They discovered that the fly maintained what they described as a \\"constant bearing angle\\" - keeping its prey in the centre of its field of vision. PhD student Sam Fabian explained: \\"They're not sticking to a trajectory; if the target changes direction, they compensate, so this is reactive.\\" In doing this, the insects are essentially using a very old navigation rule employed by sailors, Dr Gonzalez-Bellido explained. \\"If another vessel is not moving within your field of view, and it's getting bigger and closer, you're on a collision course,\\" she said. The team also studied the fly's eyes, revealing that part of its hunting secret was contained in its highly adapted vision. Larger lenses and a high density of extremely tiny sensors at the centre of its eyes allow it to see its prey from a distance and to accurately \\"lock on\\" as it approaches. \\"This gives this fly a resolution in this area that's the same as much larger dragonflies,\\" explained Dr Gonzalez-Bellido. \\"It's an extreme adaptation.\\" The next step for scientists is to find out exactly how Holcocephala's brain takes this visual information and turns it into a stealth hunting manoeuvre in the blink of an eye.

Start by looking in the back of your local newspaper for foreclosure auctions.","output":"Additionally, you can explore various online resources and platforms, such as websites like Zillow or Trulia, which offer information on foreclosures and pre-foreclosures in specific areas. Moreover, it may be beneficial to contact real estate agents who specialize in foreclosure properties, as they may have exclusive access to upcoming listings. Research the property's background. Before making an offer, gather as much information as possible about the property's history and current condition. Research the outstanding loan amount, possible liens, and the fair market value of comparable homes in the area. Evaluating the property's condition and location will help you make the most informed decision when negotiating the best offer. Attend open houses and viewings. Visiting the property in person is always a good idea, as pictures on a website or in a listing may not give you a full understanding of the property's condition. When attending open houses or viewings, pay attention to the building's structural integrity and note any significant repairs that may be required, such as roofing or foundation issues. Obtain pre-approval for a loan. Before you start negotiating, it is crucial that you have a pre-approval letter from a credible lender in hand. This shows the seller that you are financially capable of purchasing the property, increasing your credibility and allowing you to move quickly once you reach an agreement. Submit a competitive offer. When preparing to submit an offer, consider the property's market value, outstanding loan amount, and any necessary repairs. Prepare to provide a down payment of at least 10-20% to demonstrate your commitment and financial capability to the seller. Prepare for counteroffers and negotiations. Keep in mind that the lender or seller may not accept your initial offer. Be prepared to be flexible and responsive during negotiations, demonstrating both your willingness to compromise and your understanding of the property's realistic value. Be mindful of contingencies. When submitting an offer, you may want to include certain contingencies that protect you in case certain conditions are not met, such as a satisfactory home inspection or appraisal. However, be cautious to avoid making your offer too contingent, as this may decrease its attractiveness to the seller. Work with a real estate attorney. Hiring a real estate attorney who specializes in foreclosure properties can be beneficial throughout the negotiation process. They can help you understand the legal aspects of the transaction, draft and submit offers, and advise on potential issues that may arise. Be patient and persistent. Negotiating the best offer on a foreclosure or pre-foreclosure may take time and patience. Do not be discouraged if your initial offer is rejected, or if negotiations take longer than expected. Persistence and determination are key elements in securing the best possible deal on a distressed property. Monitor the foreclosure process. If you are interested in a pre-foreclosure property, keep a close eye on the status of the property throughout the foreclosure process. Depending on the course of the process, you may be able to submit or adjust your offer to better align with the seller's or lender's requirements. Staying up-to-date on the property's status can be critical in successfully negotiating the best deal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Process:  - Bacteria enter the body - Bacteria start to divide and grow - The uncontrolled growth takes away resources from other cells - Other cells cannot function properly - We feel unwell - The growth and division of bacteria produce toxins - Toxins harm the body - The body tries to react to the toxins - The body&#x27;s natural defenses can sometimes cause us to feel unwell.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is a need for ice for a drink happens, how will it affect MORE SEVERE disease occurring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that a change or disturbance in a system can potentially result in a more severe outcome or altered functionality of the system. In the given context, we have two separate systems: one related to bacterial infection and disease, and the other concerning the need for ice in a drink. The question is whether the perturbation of needing ice for a drink has any direct or indirect effect on the development or severity of a disease caused by bacterial infection in the body. To assess this relationship, let's first examine how the process of a bacterial infection unfolds and contributes to sickness: 1. Bacteria enter the body through various means, such as cuts, ingestion, or inhalation. 2. Once inside, bacteria begin to divide and grow, resulting in an increased number of bacterial cells. 3. The uncontrolled growth of these bacteria consumes resources that would otherwise be used by healthy cells. 4. As healthy cells are deprived of resources, they struggle to function properly, causing a decline in overall health. 5. The individual begins to feel unwell, both due to the strain on healthy cells and the effects of toxins released by the growing bacteria. 6. The body attempts to respond to the bacterial invasion and toxins by activating its natural defenses, such as the immune system, to fight off the infection. 7. In some cases, the body's response to infection may also contribute to feelings of illness or exacerbate symptoms. Now, let's consider the perturbation of needing ice for a drink and how it might relate to the above process. It is important to differentiate between needing ice merely for refreshment and using ice for therapeutic purposes. If the ice is only intended to be used in a drink for refreshment in a social setting, it is unlikely to have any direct effects on the bacterial infection and subsequent development of the disease. In this context, the need for ice remains a separate, unrelated event that does not interact with or impact the body's systems or disease progression. However, if the individual were to use ice (e.g., ice packs) for therapeutic purposes to alleviate symptoms related to the infection, there may be indirect effects on the course of the disease. For example, using ice packs can help reduce inflammation and provide temporary relief, thus allowing the body to allocate more energy and resources towards fighting the bacterial infection. However, this relief is generally short-lived and localized and would not necessarily contribute to resolving the underlying cause of the illness. In summary, the perturbation of needing ice for a drink does not have a direct effect on the development or severity of a disease caused by a bacterial infection. Under ordinary circumstances, there is no evident relationship between the two systems. However, if ice is used for therapeutic purposes, it may provide minor and temporary relief, potentially aiding the body's natural defenses somewhat. Nonetheless, the use of ice for therapeutic purposes would not significantly change the overall trajectory of the disease or its severity."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Tipuric missed out on selection for the 2011 World Cup and, like the rest of the 38-man squad, faces an anxious wait until the final 31 players are named at midday on Monday, 31 August. Gatland revealed he will name 17 forwards and 14 backs, with three hookers and three scrum-halves. \\"There are 24 or 25 players nailed down but we haven't spoken about it and haven't thought about the final make-up of the squad,\\" he added. \\"The whole focus of the past few days has been about this match and not the final squad and I have no idea who the 31 is at the moment. \\"There's going to be some unlucky players who miss out, but the message to them is just keep your head down because we're not going to go through this World Cup without picking up injuries and there's a chance of being potentially called up. \\"The hardest part of the job is when you don't select someone, you leave someone out and that's not the nicest message to give out to the players.\\" Second row Alun Wyn Jones and centre Jamie Roberts were both substituted in the win over Ireland.

So I put James King on and for them to hold out without him was really pleasing.\\" However, Wales face a tough decision over whether to take prop Samson Lee, back Liam Williams and fly-half Gareth Anscombe to the World Cup. Lee and Williams have not played since last season, while Anscombe injured an ankle during Wales training. \\"We can carry one or two players but you've got to be careful how many - already injured players - you carry into the World Cup squad,\\" Gatland said. \\"Last World Cup we had a couple and we may end up the same this time.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"In this article, it talks about a rugby player named Tipuric who did a great job in a recent match.

Everybody loves seeing pictures of themselves, and it's very easy after taking a picture to say \\"If you'd like I can email it to you\\". This can be the seed that leads to new connections. 2. Eat alone in public You might feel self-conscious eating by yourself but it has an important benefit: you are much easier to approach  when you are alone. People may be afraid of disturbing you or being rude if you talk with someone else. Bring a book or newspaper to read. Plus, having an interesting book with you will give others an excuse tostart a conversation if they've read it. 3. Join a class, sports team, or club Yoga, salsa dancing, volleyball, Toastmasters (a public speaking club), a class for work, etc. Choose a new hobby or continue an old one!

Question: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.  Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land. Tom's land was forested, while Bill's was covered with grasslands.  Which parcel of land had an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers?

The hooligans then rape Carol and savagely beat Joanna, escaping scot-free.Paul's son-in-law Jack Toby (Steven Keats) calls to tell him only that Joanna and Carol are in the hospital. After waiting impatiently, Paul is told by a doctor that his daughter is okay and that she was sedated and put to bed, but his wife has died. Devastated, he is told by police that the likelihood of catching the criminals is small since his wife is dead and his daughter, the only witness, traumatized from her ordeal of being raped, cannot speak. That night, a frustrated Paul goes out for a walk and quickly encounters a mugger who attempts to rob him with a gun. Carrying a sock full of quarters, Paul swings it at the would-be-mugger and flees, narrowly escaping from being shot.The next day, Paul's boss gives him an extended business vacation to Tucson, Arizona to meet a client, Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin), who shows him the ropes. Paul witnesses a mock gunfight at Old Tucson, a reconstructed Western frontier town used as a movie set. At a gun club, Ames is impressed when Paul shoots near bulls-eye accuracy. He reveals that he was a \\"CO\\" (conscientious objector) during the Korean War who served his country as a combat medic. Ames drops him at the airport, slipping a little going-away present into Paul's bag.Back in New York, Paul visits Jack who tells him that his daughter is catatonic and will likely never recover. At home, Paul opens his suitcase and the gift box that Ames left him to find a nickel-plated .32 Colt Police Positive...

For kids,happiness has a magical quality.Their delight at winning a race or getting a new bike is unreserved  . In the teenage years the concept of happiness changes.Suddenly it's conditional on such things as excitement,love and popularity.I can still recall the excitement of being invited to dance with the most attractive boy at the school party. In adulthood the things that bring deep joy-love,marriage,birth-also bring responsibility and the risk of loss.For adults,happiness is complicated  . My definition of happiness is \\"the capacity for enjoyment\\".The more we can enjoy what we have,the happier we are.It's easy to overlook the pleasure we get from the company of friends,the freedom to live where we please,and even good health. I experienced my little moments of pleasure yesterday.First I was overjoyed when I shut the last lunchbox and had the house to myself.Then I spent an uninterrupted morning writing,which I love.When the kids and my husband came home,I enjoyed their noise after the quiet of the day. Psychologists tell us that to be happy we need a mix of enjoyable leisure time and satisfying work.I don't think that my grandmother,who raised 14 children,had much of either.She did have a network of close friends and family,and maybe this is what satisfied her.

Review: Enormous fun for both adults and children, this film works on numerous levels: there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good (yet subtle) jokes for adults. Glenn Close is at her sublimely evil best as Cruella (\`call me Ella') De Ville. After three years in Dr. Pavlov's Behaviour Modification Clinic she is cured of her desire for fur  even the puppy-skin fur she had so intensely desired. She even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits. But it wouldn't be a Dalmatian' movie without the subterfuge and machinations of Cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification. And now she needs one extra puppy (hence 102 Dalmatians) to complete her nefarious scheme this time round. Ioan Gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the \`Second Chance' dog shelter. Though he was in \`Titanic' and in last year's television version (as Pip) of \`Great Expectations' I didn't recognize him; well, he was Fifth Officer Lowe' in \`Titanic' and I didn't see \`Great Expectations' so I am not terribly surprised. Gerard Depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrier-pawn of Cruella. He prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen  and does it well. His 'Wicked Witch of the West' homage is hilarious. Tim McInnerny is superb is Cruella's not-so-evil henchman  he was also Alonzo,' Cruella's butler, in \`101 Dalmatians' and you may also recognize him from all of the \`Black Adder' Brit-Coms. He plays his usual bumbling, good-hearted, somewhat dim-witted character to great effect. Oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film. This is unfortunate as the clothing worn by Glenn Close is amazing  it is incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when she is being released from the Behaviour Modification Clinic) and worthy of such an over-the-top character. Her clothing alone deserves at least an Oscar nomination. Animation holds a special place in my heart  but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans: it can't be done. Suffice it to say that \`102 Dalmatians' is even better than the film version of \`101 Dalmatians' that came out in 1996. There is a lot to like here: from the sight gags, the dialogue, and the costumes to the casting - it is a good film for the whole family. Now, what is this review like?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Kerry Mcdermott. PUBLISHED:. 06:44 EST, 28 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:36 EST, 28 May 2013. They are widely regarded as a safe means of making a phone call while behind the wheel. But researchers have today suggested that drivers using hands-free kits could pose almost as much of a safety risk as those illegally holding their mobile to their ear. A Canadian study found that drivers using hands-free devices were significantly more likely to make a host of potentially hazardous errors - from speeding to switching lanes without indicating - than drivers not talking on the phone. Not as safe as you think? Researchers in Canada say hands-free devices that allow people to talk at the wheel can still increase the risk of driver error. Sales of hands-free phone devices have. soared in the UK in recent years since it became against the law to use a. mobile phone normally while driving. The law banning drivers and motorcyclists from using hand-held phones or similar devices came into force ten years ago. The possible punishments for drivers or riders caught using their mobile range from a £60 fixed penalty and three penalty points, to being disqualified from driving and issued with a maximum fine of £1,000. The only instances in which drivers are allowed to use their phone are if they need to call 999 in an emergency and it is unsafe or impractical to stop, or if they are safely parked. Drivers are permitted to use hands-free kits, sat navs and two-way radios while driving or riding, but could still face a penalty should they be stopped by police who deem them to be distracted and not in control of their vehicle. It was thought that using a hands-free device significantly cut the risk of driver error, when compared to holding a phone to the ear. But the new study found that drivers using a hands-free phone made significantly more errors - such as crossing a centre line, speeding, or changing lanes without indicating first - compared to those not using a phone. A study led by Professor Yagesh Bhambhani, of the University of Alberta in Canada, showed the jump in errors also corresponded with a spike in heart rate and brain activity. Researchers looked at the brain activity of 26 participants who completed a driving course using a driving simulator. Participants were first tested in a. 'control' condition - using the simulator to drive through virtual city streets while using no telecommunications device. They. were then tested again while talking on a hands-free device. The drivers were engaged in two-minute conversations that avoided emotionally charged topics. Danger: Sales of hands-free kits soared after it became illegal to use a mobile phone in the usual way while behind the wheel. Researchers found there was a significant increase in brain activity while talking on a hands-free device compared with the control condition. Prof Bhambhani said: 'The findings also indicated that blood flow to the brain is significantly increased during hands-free telecommunication in order to meet the oxygen demands of the neurons under the \\"distracted\\" condition.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article is about a study in Canada that found hands-free phone devices might not be as safe as people think for drivers. The study saw that drivers using hands-free devices made more mistakes, like speeding or changing lanes without signaling, than drivers not talking on the phone.

Samuel has hard time to detach from family and friends but Brett has no problem as","output":"he was always a bit of a lone wolf. Both Samuel and Brett were in the process of moving out to a new city for college. This meant leaving behind their small hometown, the people they grew up with, and the familiar comforts that had always been there. Samuel had always been close to his family and had a tight-knit circle of friends, but he knew that pursuing higher education in this new city was an opportunity he couldn't pass up. As the days passed and the moving date grew closer, Samuel started to feel a mix of emotions - excitement towards his academic future, but also a deep sadness for leaving behind the ones he loved. Brett, on the other hand, saw this move as a chance to start anew. He had never felt truly connected to the people or place of their hometown. It always felt like he was searching for something more, a different kind of challenge or experience that could help him grow into the person he truly wanted to be. As the days went by, the anticipation of the move grew stronger in him, making him eager to step into the new chapter of his life. The day finally came for Samuel and Brett to bid their farewells and head for their new city. With teary eyes, Samuel hugged each of his family members tightly, trying to memorize the feeling of their warm embrace before he had to let go. His friends stood nearby, supportive smiles on their faces, although they too were saddened by the reality that Samuel would soon be miles apart from them. In contrast, Brett's goodbye was much more straightforward. He exchanged some quick hugs with his parents, promising to keep in touch, and gave a cool nod to the friends he was leaving behind. There was no sorrow in his eyes; only a steely determination that whispered that it was time to move on. As they settled into their new city and college life, Samuel found it challenging to adapt to the newfound independence and academic pressure. The absence of his family and friends amplified his feelings of loneliness and homesickness. He constantly kept in touch with those back home, craving their love and guidance to help him navigate his new surroundings. Brett, however, thrived in the new environment. He eagerly joined clubs and organizations, boosting his confidence and gaining new friends along the way. Various opportunities for internships and travel opened up to him, his potential now evident without the constraints of their old town. For Brett, life had changed for the better, and he embraced it wholeheartedly. Despite their vastly different responses to the challenges of their new life, Samuel and Brett remained connected through their shared history. Every now and then, they'd hang out together, discussing how things were back outside of the city and remembering memories of their past lives. Seeing the transformation in Brett, Samuel found inspiration in his friend's resilience and began to change his outlook on life. He started to embrace the opportunities that college and the new city had to offer, slowly discovering new passions and growing as an individual. By the end of their college journey, Samuel had not only built a new support system in the city but also gained enough confidence to face the world despite being distant from his family and friends. The distance had made him realize how important it was to stand on his own and follow the path he had chosen. Samuel and Brett, once tied by their shared experiences of their hometown, had ventured into a foreign world that transformed them for the better. Now, as they forged their own futures, they were no longer just the young men who had left that familiar town together - they had grown into confident adults, ready to take on the world, each pursuing their path, yet still connected through their unbreakable bond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Negative.  This is deduced from the reviewer's critical and disapproving tone towards different elements of the movie. To start with, the reviewer discredits the screenwriters' portrayal of military instructors, asserting an unfavorable bias present in the characterization. They use phrases such as \\"obviously\\" and \\"anti-military types,\\" suggesting an overt negative depiction of military personnel that did not ring true to their own experiences as a Vietnam veteran.  In addition, they express disappointment in the unrealistic portrayal of the private soldiers and the captain, highlighting that the depicted informal rapport \\"never happened\\" in their own time in service. The use of the word \\"never\\" further emphasizes their critical sentiment and highlights an apparent gap between portrayals in the movie and the reality of military life.  Towards the end, the reviewer states they were questioning the overall point and narrative structure of the movie, indicating dissatisfaction with its thematic focus as well as its storyline. Finally, they express relief at not having paid for the film, implying that it was not worth investing in and that they derived little to no enjoyment from it.  All these points taken together strongly suggest a negative sentiment. The reviewer offers more criticism than praise, indicating a negative experience with and perception of the film."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lure your cat out with a toy.\\" Article:","output":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Bonding with Your Feline Friend: Enticing Them with Food, Treats, and Toys Introduction As a loving cat owner, you understand that establishing a strong connection with your feline companion is a vital part of pet ownership. One of the main challenges in creating this bond is learning effective methods to communicate with and entice your cat to engage and interact with you. By calling your cat, offering them food or treats, and luring them with toys, you can create positive experiences to help foster a loving, long-lasting relationship with your furry friend. In this article, we will discuss the importance of building bonds with your cat and delve into the three main tactics to effectively interact with your kitty – calling their name, offering food or treats, and luring them with toys. With practice, patience, and understanding, these methods can be utilized to create fun, engaging, and affectionate encounters with your cat. The Importance of Bonding with Your Cat Cats are often known for their independent and seemingly aloof nature; however, they form deep and unique bonds with their human companions. An owner who has formed a strong connection with their feline friend will notice that their cat may seek out their company, exhibit affectionate behaviors, and display less stress and anxiety. A well-bonded cat is generally happier and healthier, which in turn facilitates a more harmonious home environment. By addressing your cat's emotional, social, and physical needs, you're not only enhancing their quality of life but also deepening the trust and connection between the two of you. 1. Calling Your Cat To effectively call your cat, start by consistently using their name during interactions, particularly when engaging in pleasurable activities such as petting or feeding. Over time, your cat will begin to associate their name with positive experiences, making it more likely for them to respond when you call. When calling your cat, use a gentle and upbeat tone, enunciating their name clearly. Remember, consistency is key – try to use the same tone and inflection each time you call them. It may also be helpful to reinforce their response with praise or a treat, creating a positive reinforcement loop that makes them more eager to come when called. 2. Attracting Your Cat with Food or Treats Using food or treats is a highly effective method for enticing your cat to come towards you. This not only makes it easier to establish interaction but also helps to create a positive association with you – something that is particularly beneficial when attempting to build a bond with a shy or nervous cat. Keep a stash of high-quality cat treats and offer them sparingly during your bonding sessions, being careful not to overfeed or upset their dietary balance. There are a variety of options available, from store-bought treats to homemade alternatives such as small pieces of cooked chicken or fish. When offering treats, be sure to use a consistent verbal or visual command to signal that you have something tasty available. Over time, your cat will begin to associate the command with being given a treat, making it easier to catch their attention and lure them towards you. 3. Luring Your Cat with Toys Toys play a significant role in developing trust and connection between you and your cat. Engaging in interactive play not only stimulates your cat mentally and physically but also serves as a platform for strengthening the bond between you both, as play helps to build trust and foster a sense of camaraderie. When selecting toys, consider your cat's interests and natural instincts. For example, cats tend to enjoy chasing and pouncing on prey-like toys, such as feather wands or toy mice. You can use these toys to lure your cat from hiding spots or coax them towards you for interaction. Remember to be patient and gradual in your approach, allowing your cat to become comfortable with the toy before attempting to use it as a lure. It is also crucial to consistently engage in play sessions to deepen the bond and maintain an enriching environment for your cat. Conclusion Forming a strong bond with your feline companion is an enriching and rewarding experience for both you and your cat. By practicing the methods of calling their name, offering food or treats, and luring them with toys, you can create enjoyable and affectionate encounters that foster trust, connection, and contentment for your furry friend. Remember, patience and consistency are crucial to establishing a meaningful bond with your cat. With time and effort, you'll soon build a strong, affectionate relationship with your feline companion, enriching your lives and making the joys of pet ownership all the more fulfilling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: conservatives to seek voters support for commandments Text:","output":"In an ongoing political maneuver, conservatives across the country are gearing up to seek voters' support for the introduction and enforcement of a set of commandments intended to shape the legislative priorities and create a definitive course for the future of the nation. These commandments, while still under development, align fundamentally with conservative values and ideals, focusing on a broad range of social, economic, and political policies. The initiative represents a strategic move for the conservatives, a group often characterized by their commitment to traditional values, limited government interference, and free-market capitalism. With mounting societal and political challenges, conservatives believe that these commandments will provide a clear direction for the nation. They aim to bring forth this proposal to voters, in the hope that it will resonate with their values and gain their support. The exact outline of these commandments is not yet public knowledge; however, they're expected to revolve around a few central themes. First and foremost, they're anticipated to encourage personal liberty and protect individual rights. This could involve commitments to upholding freedom of speech, religion, and defending constitutional rights that conservatives view as non-negotiable.  Secondly, the commandments will likely emphasize fiscal responsibility, with policies intended to reduce public debt and create a more sustainable economy. This could mean advocating for lower taxes, reduced public spending, and other measures aimed at creating a more business-friendly environment.  Another focus of the commandments is expected to be on maintaining law and order, supporting a robust criminal justice system and stringent immigration policies. Within this framework, one could anticipate strengthening border security, enforcing immigration laws more rigorously, and endorsing improvements within the police and defence establishments. The defense of traditional values may also be stressed, including support for the nuclear family, opposition to abortion, and advocacy for faith-based education. These are sticking points for many conservatives, who see these issues as central to preserving the country's identity and fabric. The groundwork is being laid and it is clear that the conservative bloc sees this as an opportunity to win over voters by clarifying their stand on these pressing issues and ensure a brighter future by aligning policy decisions in the light of their long-standing principles. They are well aware of the political stakes and potential backlash, preparing to face them with resilience. While it remains to be seen how the wider electorate will respond to these commandments, conservatives believe that their robust argument and commitment to upholding their principles will convince voters to rally behind their cause. Their focus is clear - they wish to reinstate their belief in a government that is limited, fiscally responsible, upholds law and order, defends traditional values, and above all, firmly safeguards personal liberties. As the commandments come into clearer focus in the coming months, conservatives across the nation will hope that their conviction will resonate with voters, thus creating a shared vision for the future of the country, in line with their long-held conservative principles."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and his lieutenant Agent Maria Hill arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent Phil Coulson explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway. In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the \\"Avengers Initiative\\". Agent Natasha Romanoff is sent to Calcutta to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract.

Radiohead began work on their ninth studio album in September 2014, joined again by Godrich. In 2015 they resumed work in the La Fabrique studio near Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France. The sessions were marred by the death of Godrich's father, and Yorke's separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. In the same year, Yorke contributed a soundtrack, Subterranea, to The Panic Office, an installation of Radiohead artwork in Sydney, Australia, and Junun, a collaboration between Greenwood, Godrich, Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur and Indian musicians, was released, accompanied by a documentary directed by Anderson. On Christmas Day 2015, Radiohead released a new song, \\"Spectre\\", on the audio streaming site SoundCloud. It had been commissioned for the 2015 James Bond film Spectre, but was rejected by the film producers as \\"too dark\\".Radiohead's ninth studio album, A Moon Shaped Pool, was released in May 2016 on Radiohead's website and online music stores, followed by retail versions in June via XL Recordings. It was promoted with music videos for the singles \\"Burn the Witch\\" and \\"Daydreaming\\", the latter directed by Anderson. The album includes several songs written years earlier, including \\"True Love Waits\\", and strings and choral vocals arranged by Jonny Greenwood and performed the London Contemporary Orchestra. It was Radiohead's sixth UK number-one album and reached number three in the US. It was the fifth Radiohead album nominated for the Mercury Prize, making Radiohead the most shortlisted act in the award's history, and was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Song (for \\"Burn the Witch\\") at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

Question 1: How do I calculate effective nuclear charge by slater's rule? Question 2: How do I wirelessly charge the electrical devices by piezoelectric effect? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are related to two different concepts. Let me explain each question to you separately. Question 1: How do I calculate effective nuclear charge by Slater's rule? Slater's rules are a set of empirical rules created by John C. Slater to estimate the effective nuclear charge (Z_eff) on an electron in an atom. The effective nuclear charge is a measure of the net positive charge experienced by an electron in a multi-electron atom, considering electron shielding. To calculate the effective nuclear charge (Z_eff) using Slater's rules, follow these steps: 1. Identify the electron for which you want to calculate Z_eff (called the test electron) and its electron configuration. 2. Group the electrons into the following sets:    - All electrons in lower-shelled orbitals (n-1, n-2, ..., 1)    - Electrons in the same shell, same type of orbital as the test electron (n, l)    - Electrons in the same shell, but different type of orbital as the test electron (n, l±1) 3. Assign a shielding constant \\"S\\" for each group:    - For each electron in a lower shell, assign a shielding value of 0.85.    - For each electron in the same shell and same type of orbital as the test electron, assign a value of 0.35.    - For each electron in the same shell but different type of orbital, assign a value of 0.40 for s & p electrons, 0.35 for d electrons, and 0.30 for f electrons. 4. Calculate the total shielding S by summing up the shielding values assigned to each electron. 5. Finally, calculate the effective nuclear charge (Z_eff) by subtracting the shielding value from the atomic number (Z):     Z_eff = Z - S Question 2: How do I wirelessly charge electrical devices by the piezoelectric effect? The piezoelectric effect is the process by which certain materials generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress. To wirelessly charge electrical devices using the piezoelectric effect, you can follow these general steps: 1. Choose a suitable piezoelectric material for your application, such as quartz, gallium phosphate, or a type of ceramic like lead zirconate titanate (PZT). The material should have good piezoelectric properties and be able to handle the amount of stress needed to generate a sufficient voltage. 2. Design and fabricate a piezoelectric transducer/energy harvester. This device converts mechanical stress applied to the piezoelectric material into electrical voltage. 3. Apply mechanical stress to the piezoelectric material, either by compression, bending or vibration. This could come from sources like footsteps, machinery vibrations, or even ambient noise. The applied stress will generate an electric charge in the material. 4. Connect the piezoelectric transducer to a rectifier circuit to convert the generated alternating current (AC) voltage to direct current (DC) voltage, which is suitable for charging electronic devices. 5. Use a power management circuit to regulate the output voltage to match the charging requirements of the target electrical device. 6. Finally, integrate a wireless charging transmitter (inductive or resonant) to transfer the stored energy to the target device's wireless charging receiver. The charging process can then take place wirelessly and without physical contact. Keep in mind that the feasibility and efficiency of this charging method depend on factors such as the size and properties of the piezoelectric material, the amplitude of the mechanical stress, and the specific power requirements of the device being charged."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: There is very little voice acting in the game, as is the case in most Zelda titles to date. Link remains silent in conversation, but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised. His emotions and responses are largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions. Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations, including laughter, surprised or fearful exclamations, and screams. The character of Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialog is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling the phonemes of English phrases[better source needed] sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto.

Answer the following question: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article:One of the crucial questions following Britain's vote to leave the European Union is what will happen to the land border separating Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland. There is widespread agreement among UK politicians that there should be no return to what they call a hard border and that the Common Travel Area (CTA) should be maintained after Brexit. These objectives have been echoed by leading European politicians, such as the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, and chief Brexit negotiator for the EU Michel Barnier. But as things stand, no party has yet put forward a workable plan for ensuring that both people and goods can continue to cross the border without checkpoints. And we still do not know what Brexit will actually look like. The exact number of individuals that cross between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland every day is difficult to quantify, but the figure is likely to be in the tens of thousands. The Centre for Cross Border Studies, which has offices in Armagh and Dublin, has estimated that between 23,000 and 30,000 people cross the border daily for work. This includes non-Irish and non-UK EU citizens living and working on different sides of the Irish land border. The figure is believed to be a conservative estimate, with many more making the journey to and from the Republic of Ireland to attend schools and hospital appointments. Speaking at a House of Lords select committee in 2016, Bernie McCrory, the head of Co-operation and Working Together (CAWT), said that the health and social care group's nurses routinely crossed the border several times a day. The days of the Troubles are gone, and the border posts between Northern Ireland and the Republic lie rusting and unused. But now the UK is getting ready to leave the EU. Hospital patients and schoolchildren and cross-border workers are among those who have to make the daily journey. How do they see the road ahead? Special report: The hardest border If the rest of the UK is not included, then Northern Ireland's biggest export market is its nearest neighbour, the Republic of Ireland. While just under one-third of its total manufactured goods - Â£2.4bn - were sold across its land border in 2016, of Northern Ireland's Â£7.7bn export total for the same period, the majority of sales - Â£4.2bn - were to the EU. The agri-food sector - trade in food and farm produce - dominates trade in goods between the north and south. A 2016 UK parliamentary report, citing the Irish Farmers' Association, says that 350,000 lambs went from north to south, 500,000 pigs from south to north, and millions of litres of milk travelled in both directions over the course of a year. Almost 30% of Northern Ireland's milk is processed in the Republic of Ireland, where it is made into butter and cheese or used in infant formula. For members of the EU, goods and produce such as these can cross borders freely. But if negotiations between the UK and the EU fail to reach a trade agreement, or if the agreement is less favourable than that enjoyed by member states, it could mean that tariffs - taxes imposed on imported items - could become costly. In the EU referendum, Northern Ireland voted to remain by a majority of 56% to 44%. Some - but not all - of the parties supported that view. Here are some details from each of the main parties' manifestos, stating their aims in terms of Brexit and the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) The DUP is in favour of Northern Ireland leaving the EU but says that Brexit does not mean \\"leaving Europe\\". It adds that it will prioritise maintaining the CTA between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Aims: DUP manifesto in full Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) The SDLP is a pro-European party that campaigned for Northern Ireland to remain part of the EU. In its manifesto, it states that Brexit will create an unprecedented situation in which one member of the CTA, the Republic of Ireland, is part of the EU while the other is not. The SDLP says it will oppose the hardening of borders, in order to protect cross-border workers, farms that straddle both sides and businesses that rely heavily on trade with the south. Aims: SDLP manifesto in full Sinn Fein The party says that the \\"only credible approach\\" to Brexit is for Northern Ireland to receive special status within the EU that will uphold the democratic vote of citizens, but will also ensure that \\"the frontier between the EU and Britain will not be on the island of Ireland\\". Aims: Sinn Fein manifesto in full Alliance Party The pro-European Alliance Party supported a Remain vote. It opposes a hard Brexit and supports a second referendum following negotiations, to allow citizens to decide whether any agreement reached is better than EU membership. The party also argues that Northern Ireland is a special case because its citizens have an automatic right to be Irish citizens and, therefore, to be citizens of the EU. Legally, Northern Ireland would, post-Brexit, have the capacity to opt back into the EU through joining a united Ireland, it says. Aims: Alliance Party manifesto in full Ulster Unionist Party The UUP's view on Brexit was that, on balance, it was beneficial for Northern Ireland to remain within the EU. The party says it has a vision to make Northern Ireland the \\"UK's Gateway to Europe\\".

However, no one has come up with a plan to make this happen after Brexit. Many people cross this border every day, and it is very important for trade. If the UK and the EU can't agree on a trade deal, it might become more expensive to move goods across the border.

Then a \\"virtual coach\\" application shows the information and can tell the user what they are doing wrong, and help to improve skill in any task with feet. The socks should be useful to athletes and weekend joggers. \\"People think running is so easy and of course everybody can do it but not necessarily safely and well,\\" Dr Davide Vigano said. A recent study showed that between 60 and 80percent of runners got hurt per year. This is pretty much more than any other human activity. Researchers say the technology can also be developed to teach people how to dance, play sports such golf, or even to help to teach women to walk better in high heels. Mr. Vigano said, \\"People could all benefit from the idea. We have had interest from all sorts of sports, like skiing, football, cycling and golf. Anything where you have to use your feet can use it. It could even be put in high heels to help women walk in them safely.\\" Socks are just the start, and the technology could be used in gloves, hats and boots.

My grandparents moved from the condo to the house, as the  Choices: *condo had enough room.; *house had enough room.;","output":"My grandparents moved from the condo to the house, as the house had enough room. The decision to make the move was not taken lightly, as they had spent many happy years enjoying the convenience of condo life. However, as their family grew and their children had their own children, it became apparent that the size of the condo was inadequate for the many family gatherings they enjoyed hosting. The house my grandparents moved to was a beautiful, old Victorian home that had once belonged to a wealthy family. Positioned in a friendly neighborhood, not too far from the condo they had previously lived in, it boasted an ample backyard and a beautiful view overlooking a nearby park. The first time my grandparents set eyes on the house, they knew it would be the perfect place to make new memories with their growing family. As they settled into their new home, my grandparents went to great lengths to make the space welcoming and comfortable for everyone. They renovated the house, respecting the original architectural elements while integrating modern amenities. The large rustic kitchen was updated with the latest appliances and a generous island perfect for cooking and gathering. The living room was adorned with comfortable furniture and a cozy fireplace, where they could spend evenings curled up with their loved ones, sharing stories and laughter. The spacious dining room, with its elongated table and ample seating, quickly became the heart of the house. It was in this room that countless family meals, holiday celebrations, and Sunday dinners would be enjoyed for years to come. The walls echoed the laughter of grandchildren as they raced around the house, their feet tapping along the polished wooden floorboards. Upstairs, guest rooms and bathrooms were carefully outfitted with everything visitors would need to feel at home. Outside, the backyard was transformed into an idyllic oasis where family and friends could gather, play, and relax. My grandparents planted fruit trees and flowers, tended to by Bee, their lovely Golden Retriever. A large lawn was the perfect spot for playing catch or setting up a badminton net, and the shady patio provided a welcoming retreat for afternoon tea or evening cocktails. Life at the house was always bustling and filled with joy. With doors seemingly always open, loved ones came and went, delighting in the warmth of happy conversations, hearty meals, and the opportunity to connect and create lasting memories. The house was a true embodiment of the love and compassion my grandparents had for their family and friends, and they knew that choosing to move from their beloved condo was the right decision. Years passed, and the family continued to grow. New generations filled the rooms of the beautifully aged Victorian house, and it became a place of comfort and solace, bridging the gap between the old and the new. It became clear that the house was more than just a home; it was a monument to the love my grandparents felt for their family, and a testament to the importance of cherishing the time spent together. And so, with the move from the condo to the house, my grandparents made a choice that would forever shape the lives of their family, nurturing relationships and creating a space where love could flourish. By choosing the house with enough room, they granted their family an enduring gift – the gift of precious time, shared experiences, and memories that will last a lifetime. Indeed, the house became a testament to the power of love to bring people together, and it will forever hold a special place in the history of our family."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Netanyahu can be in crosshairs.","output":"In light of the preceding text, the following sentence can be elaborated upon: The assertion that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might find himself in the \\"crosshairs\\" refers to the potential political backlash and public anger he might face, should he reject or fail to cooperate in peace negotiation efforts. By withholding the final payment on the \\"gift\\", President Trump aims to ensure that Israel engages in peace talks and contribute to the negotiation process in good faith. If Netanyahu and his administration remain uncooperative or intransigent, the withdrawal of the promised gift would not only thwart their expectations but also illustrate to the Israeli public and the international community that such inflexibility stems from the Israeli government's position. Consequently, the Israeli people might perceive Netanyahu as the reason for losing the gift, and thus, public anger would be directed towards him and his political allies. This, in turn, could weaken his standing with the electorate and negatively affect the vote of confidence in his leadership. In this context, the term \\"crosshairs\\" serves as a metaphor for being the target of public anger and dissatisfaction, placing Netanyahu at the receiving end of the consequences of derailing peace efforts. With political pressure heightened, Netanyahu's decision-making becomes crucial as it determines the outcome involving the gift, his own political position, and the future of peace negotiations. Therefore, the statement that \\"Netanyahu can be in the crosshairs\\" appropriately follows the overarching narrative, emphasizing the potential political ramifications faced by Israel's Prime Minister should he not actively participate in peace talks or compromises, ultimately impacting the prospects for long-term regional stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Question: who was the first one to invent medicine? Would \\"Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"While the specific statement, \\"Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy\\" is accurate to some degree in terms of formal medical education, it is not a reasonable answer to the question about who invented medicine first. The practice of medicine predates any systematic training, and the history of its invention cannot be attributed to just one individual or civilization.  The advent of medicine spans across many cultures and historical eras. While it is difficult to pinpoint the first person to invent medicine, we can trace its origins back to various ancient societies that laid the groundwork for the development and evolution of medicine as we know it today.  1. Prehistoric medicine: It is believed that prehistoric humans used basic forms of medicine, such as herbs and natural remedies, to treat injuries, ailments, and diseases. These forms of medicine were typically derived from observing the behavior of animals and relying on trial and error. 2. Traditional medicine in ancient civilizations: Medicine existed in various forms across ancient civilizations, including ancient Egypt, Sumer, China, and India. Medical practitioners in these societies used a mix of religious beliefs, traditional knowledge, and empirical observations to treat illnesses and diseases. 3. Ancient Greek medicine: The first significant source of systematic medical knowledge comes from ancient Greece, with notable names such as Hippocrates and Galen. Hippocrates (460 - 370 BCE), often referred to as the \\"Father of Medicine,\\" was one of the first to promote the idea of basing medical treatments on rational thought and observation. He is best known for creating the Hippocratic Oath, a code of ethics that still guides modern medical practice. 4. Ancient Roman medicine: The Romans adopted and adapted much of Greek medical knowledge and developed their own systems of public health, hospitals, and medical education. Galen (129 - 200 CE) was a Roman physician who made significant contributions to anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology and is considered one of the most influential figures in medical history. 5. Islamic Golden Age medicine: During the Islamic Golden Age (8th - 13th centuries), significant advancements were made in medicine and pharmacy. Key figures like Al-Razi (854 - 925 CE) and Ibn Sina (Avicenna; 980 - 1037 CE) produced encyclopedic works on medicine that became foundational texts throughout the Islamic world and Western Europe. Coming back to the statement in question, \\"Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy,\\" it is true that medical education became formalized during the Middle Ages, particularly in European universities. The first university to establish a program focused on the study of medicine was the University of Bologna in 1219, followed by several others such as the University of Padua and the University of Montpellier. However, this development pertains to the organization of medical education, not the invention of medicine itself. In conclusion, the first invention of medicine predates the Italian universities mentioned in the statement and involves the collective knowledge of countless individuals and societies over thousands of years. The question of who invented medicine first is complex and multifaceted, with roots in prehistory and major contributions from various ancient civilizations and periods during human history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this \\"A review of laws surrounding the \\"significantly increasing\\" problem of online abuse is urgently needed, former culture secretary Maria Miller says.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Former Culture Secretary Calls for Urgent Review of Laws to Address Growing Online Abuse Introduction: In the digital sphere, the issue of online abuse has permeated every corner of the internet, from social media platforms to online forums. Most recently, former Culture Secretary Maria Miller has expressed her concerns about the rapidly growing problem of online abuse. Miller believes that the present situation calls for an immediate review of the existing laws surrounding this problem, adding that it is high time to reevaluate the legal framework in place. Step 1: Background on Maria Miller and Her Expertise Maria Miller is a British Conservative Party politician, who served as the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport from 2012 to 2014. Given her expertise in overseeing areas concerning media and addressing matters related to internet content, she is well-positioned to advocate for a comprehensive review of online abuse laws. Step 2: Highlight the Prevalence of Online Abuse Data gathered from multiple sources suggest that online harassment and abuse have become a significant issue. In fact, a 2017 study by the Pew Research Center found that 41% of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment. With the increasing reliance on digital platforms for communication, work, and learning, cyberbullying and targeted harassment have only continued to rise. Step 3: Explain the Need for a Review of Laws Cases of online abuse have become increasingly prominent, and many argue that current legal frameworks have failed to keep up with this evolving problem. To make matters worse, many victims are hesitant to report incidents due to the fear of further harassment or victim blaming. Miller's call for an urgent review of laws emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive approach to addressing online abuse. Step 4: Detail the Desired Outcomes of the Legal Review The aim of the legal review should be twofold: to ensure that existing legislation is effective in the digital age, and to develop new policies to address emerging challenges and forms of online abuse. Creating more precise definitions of online abuse and establishing clear guidelines for reporting and handling cases can pave the way for a more effective response to this issue. Additionally, this legal review should involve collaboration between government, law enforcement, and tech companies in order to create a more wholesome approach to combat cyberbullying and harassment. Step 5: Address Possible Objections and Challenges Some critics may argue that a law review could potentially infringe upon free speech rights or lead to increased surveillance over citizen's internet usage. However, it is crucial to emphasize that the goal of this review is to protect individuals from targeted, harmful behavior without compromising their freedom of expression. Striking a balance between protecting users' safety and maintaining their rights requires careful deliberation to ensure an equitable solution. Conclusion: Maria Miller's call for an urgent review of the laws surrounding the increasingly pressing problem of online abuse highlights the need for a more proactive and robust legal framework. Tackling the issue requires not only reviewing current laws but also engaging in a collaborative effort with various stakeholders. As we continue to embrace digital environments in every aspect of our lives, it is our collective responsibility to create a safer and more equitable online world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Maria was into music.  (2). Natalie was into music.","output":"Option 1: Maria was into music. Maria learned to play the violin in school because she was genuinely passionate about music. Ever since she was a little girl, she found solace in the melodies and harmonies that filled her world. Her mother, a gifted pianist, nurtured her interest in music and encouraged her to explore various instruments. It wasn't until her father brought home a beautiful, handcrafted violin, a gift from his European trip, that Maria truly fell in love with the art of playing music. As Maria began learning the violin, she dedicated herself to understanding the complexities of the instrument and the enchanting way it evoked emotions. Her natural talent shined through her hard work, leading her music teacher to recognize her potential and offer her personalized lessons to hone her skills further. With every note and bow stroke, Maria poured her heart and soul into the music, embracing it as a form of self-expression that allowed her to connect with others on a deeper level. Natalie, on the other hand, had different interests. While she appreciated her friend's affinity for music, she found more satisfaction in exploring the world of sports. Natalie was a natural athlete, gifted with speed, agility, and an innate understanding of strategy. She felt an adrenaline rush every time she stepped onto the field, absorbing the energy of the game unmatched by anything else. The two girls were perfect complements, balancing each other out in their diverse passions. Maria would often cheer Natalie on from the sidelines, her violin case by her side, watching her friend deftly maneuver around her opponents. And Natalie would attend Maria's recitals, feeling a sense of pride in their shared successes, knowing that her friend's talent shone just as brightly under the stage lights as hers did on the soccer field. As the years passed, Maria's love for music only grew stronger. With her violin as a constant companion, she traveled the world, studying different styles and techniques, honing her talent, and becoming an accomplished musician. The violin allowed her to share her innermost feelings and forge profound bonds with audiences around the globe. Eventually, she found herself on the world's most prestigious stages, performing for thousands of adoring fans, her friend Natalie proudly cheering her on from the audience. Maria's love for music drove her to pursue a life filled with passion, creativity, and self-discovery. By embracing her inner artist and dedicating herself to the violin, she was able to craft a life that effortlessly blended her talent with her deepest desires. The beautiful sounds produced by her violin served as a testament to the power of music, a celebration of the universal language that could bridge gaps and transcend boundaries in ways, unlike any other art form."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the below context:  Martin O'Donnell confirmed Halo 3's soundtrack would see a commercial release in a Bungie podcast. O'Donnell also stressed that the soundtrack would not be released at or near the release date of the game on September 25, 2007. The soundtrack was officially announced on October 17, 2007. The score to the game was used extensively for marketing purposes, even before the release of the game. The first piece heard was entitled \\"Finish the Fight\\", and was used in the announcement trailer for Halo 3 at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2006. This piece was accented with O'Donnell's well-known Halo theme, which now included a trumpet fanfare and heavy brass section; O'Donnell stated \\"I want the viewer to have a feeling of anticipation and wonder for the first fifty seconds or so, up until Master Chief is revealed and they realize that it's Cortana trying to tell them something.\\" The track opens with a piano section written by Matt Daspit, uncharacteristic for the series at that point; O'Donnell suspected \\"no [other announcement at E3] would start with a piano\\", thus grabbing attention. O'Donnell designed the opening to lull the listener into a sense of suspense, then wonder; \\"I want them to feel pride and longing the moment Master Chief walks out of the smoke.\\" he said. \\"I want them to be left with that, 'I can hardly wait to play this game' feeling\\". Another reworked theme from Halo was used as the background music for the Halo 3 E3 2007 trailer; O'Donnell later offered this track for free online.In addition to the music composed by O'Donnell and Salvatori, the announcement of the Halo 3 Soundtrack was followed with a call for entries to all artists or bands to submit their own original song to be included on the final CD. The submissions were judged by O'Donnell, producer Nile Rodgers, and other artists including Steve Vai. Rodgers stated that more than 21,000 songs were entered, and at least 30% were \\"amazing\\"; the winner was Greg Haupt and his band Princeton, whose song \\"LvUrFR3NZ\\" appears as the final track on the...

Based on the premise \\"come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Come by at any time and knock on the door and we'll hand you the recycling.\\" is true?","output":"To determine the truth of the hypothesis \\"Come by at any time and knock on the door and we'll hand you the recycling,\\" based on the premise \\"come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb,\\" we should closely examine the information provided in the premise, and compare it with the hypothesis. The premise states that: 1. The event takes place on a specific day: the regular garbage day. 2. The recycling is kept outside at the curb. 3. The action involves picking up the recycling. The hypothesis states that: 1. The event can occur at any time. 2. The recycling is handed over after knocking on the door. 3. The action involves handing over the recycling. Upon comparing the two statements, it's evident that the premise and the hypothesis differ in terms of the day and timing of the task, as well as the method of transferring the recycling. The following differences can be noted: 1. The premise specifies a particular day (the regular garbage day) for the task to be carried out, while the hypothesis suggests that the task can be executed at any time. 2. In the premise, there is no interaction with the homeowner, as the recycling is simply picked up from the curb by the garbage collection service. On the other hand, in the hypothesis, the homeowner is more actively involved in the process, as they hand over the recycling to the person knocking on their door. 3. The recycling pick-up location differs in both instances. In the premise, the recycling is placed outside at the curb, whereas in the hypothesis, the recycling is handed over indoors after the service provider knocks on the door. Based on these discrepancies, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Come by at any time and knock on the door and we'll hand you the recycling\\" is true, given the premise \\"come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb.\\" The actions and conditions suggested by the hypothesis are not consistent with or supported by the information provided in the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that said Solti is tense at rehearsals? is inside the article: In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

Avoid this by setting it to manual mode while the door is closed. If this is impossible because the door is stuck open, move on to the next step. Use 2x4s that are as high as the garage door opening. If you don't have 2x4s that will fit the opening, you can improvise by placing a sturdy item like a shelf in its place. Use a hammer to tap the planks in between the door and the floor on each side of the garage door opening. Using something sturdy to prop up the door will prevent it from slamming shut, even if the garage door spring is damaged. The manual release cord is usually red and located next to the garage door motor. Pull down on this cord to disconnect the trolley from the automatic opening system. Pulling the cord will allow you to manually open and close your garage door. Have someone help you as you manually close the door. Remove the 2x4s by tapping them out with a hammer as someone holds the handle on the door. Once the 2x4s are removed, slowly and carefully lower the garage door to the closed position. Prevent the manual release cord from getting caught on the garage door tracks by pulling it down and towards the motor when you’re opening the door. If you have trouble doing this yourself, ask someone for help. If you want to set the garage door back to automatic mode, you'll need to pull the manual release cord towards the door opening while simultaneously opening the door.

One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses.

In England, in the absence of census figures, historians propose a range of preincident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300, and a postincident population figure as low as 2 million. By the end of 1350, the Black Death subsided, but it never really died out in England. Over the next few hundred years, further outbreaks occurred in 1361–1362, 1369, 1379–1383, 1389–1393, and throughout the first half of the 15th century. An outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10–15% of the population, while the death rate of the plague of 1479–1480 could have been as high as 20%. The most general outbreaks in Tudor dynasty and House of Stuart England seem to have begun in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589, 1603, 1625, and 1636, and ended with the Great Plague of London in 1665.

The most significant outbreak was the Black Death, which arrived in England in 1348 and lasted until around 1350.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A Nobel Prize is considered by most people one of the highest international honours  a person can receive. As you know, the prizes were started by a Swede called Alfred Nobel. He was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Alfred Nobel was a great scientist. He made two important inventions, and so he became very rich. Although he was rich, Nobel was not a happy man. He never married or had children. Also, he was a sick man during his large part of life. When he died at the age of 63, he left a fund of 9,000,000. The money was to be used in giving prizes to those who made great achievements in physics, chemistry , medicine and literature , and for world peace. The first Nobel Prizes were given on December 10, 1901, five years after Nobel's death. Since then many famous people from all over the world have been given Nobel Prizes for their achievements. Each prize has three parts. The first part is a gold medal. Second, a winner of a Nobel Prize is given a certificate saying that he has been given the prize. The third part of the prize is a large amount of money-about 40,000. Often a prize is given to just one person, but not always. Sometimes a prize is shared. It may be given to two or more people who have worked together. It is also sometimes true that a prize is not given at all if there is no great achievement. In 1972, for example, no Nobel Peace Prize was given. A:","output":"Which of the following statements is true about the Nobel Prize? A) It is awarded only to citizens of Sweden.

About 45 percent of children suffer passive smoking in families, 50 percent in public places, and almost 6 percent on public transportation, shows a research released by the Shanghai Children's Medical Center on Tuesday. \\"Not only adults but also children and newborn babies are at risk for the adverse effects of passive smoking,\\" said Tang Jingyan, a doctor at the Shanghai Children's Medical Center. \\"Actually, those young children whose bodies are still growing and developing are more sensitive to the effects of secondhand smoke.\\" Research has shown that children who are exposed to secondhand smoke will suffer from more colds, coughs and sore throats, and they are more likely to suffer from bronchitis, pneumonia and will have a higher risk of developing cancer. Doctors even suggested that children suffering passive smoking are more likely to have behavioral problems and may not develop mentally as quickly as their peers. Other research by the Shanghai Children's Medical Center has found that more than 80 percent of child patients in the center live in a smoke-filled household, where one or both parents smoke. \\"Though doctors have stressed the harm of passive smoking over and over, it is still hard to reach a totally 'smoke free' home,\\" said a pediatrician named Zhang Yiwen, noting that parents are often tempted to smoke even though they have learned the harmful effects of secondhand smoke.

In the cosmic scheme of things, this was relatively minor. But very annoying. I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor.

Article:","output":"Title: Cool and Clean Mud Baths for Elephants! Do you know what elephants love to do to keep cool and clean? They love taking mud baths! But what is a mud bath, and why do elephants love it so much? Let's find out! First, let's talk about why mud baths are important for elephants. Just like how people can feel really hot on a sunny day, elephants feel that too. To stay cool, they cover themselves in mud. The mud acts like a nice, cool coat that protects them from the heat. Not only do mud baths help elephants feel cool, but they also help them stay clean. You may think that getting covered in mud would make them dirty, but it actually helps them stay free from tiny unwanted critters called parasites. Parasites are little bugs that can make animals feel itchy and uncomfortable. By rolling in mud, the elephants protect themselves from these bugs because the mud sticks to their skin and creates a barrier that keeps them away. Some elephants like to take a 'dust bath' after having a morning bathe. This is a part of their daily routine, just like how you might brush your teeth every morning. A nice photo-taker named Peter Delaney followed some elephants for a week to take pictures of them enjoying their mud baths. He spent lots of time watching these wonderful creatures as they splashed around in the mud.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"To consider the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"Don't be silly!\\", I will analyze it step-by-step in terms of grammar, semantics, and pragmatics. 1. Grammar: The sentence consists of an imperative form of the verb \\"be\\" with the negative contraction \\"don't\\" (do not). The modifier \\"silly\\" acts as a predicate adjective following the verb. The sentence structure is grammatically correct, though informal. 2. Semantics: The sentence's meaning is clear. It conveys the speaker's instruction or request for the listener not to behave in a silly or ludicrous manner. 3. Pragmatics: The sentence functions as a directive, which is a speech act aiming to guide the listener's behavior. This informal expression can be used in a friendly, playful, or mildly disapproving way, depending on the tone and context. It assumes that the listener understands what \\"silly\\" behavior entails.

The tweet reads: \\"Horrible .. im super sick .. you ?\\" Breaking down the tweet content, we can observe that the user (@KardiSmacks) is expressing strong negative feelings. Firstly, the word \\"Horrible\\" is often used to depict a very unpleasant or undesirable situation or condition. In this case, the user is describing how they feel, which is not a good state. Additionally, the user then explicitly mentions being \\"super sick,\\" which again conveys a negative emotion. The use of the word \\"super\\" as an adjective intensifies the severity of their illness, further emphasizing that the sentiment is indeed negative. Nobody wants to be sick, and illness typically results in discomfort, pain, or suffering. As the user also asks a question at the end - \\"you?\\" - it might indicate that they want to know how the person they are conversing with is feeling.

Paper Pressing the sheet removes the water by force; once the water is forced from the sheet, a special kind of felt, which is not to be confused with the traditional one, is used to collect the water; whereas when making paper by hand, a blotter sheet is used instead. Q: How is the water removed by force from a sheet of paper?","output":"Step 1: Prepare the materials: To remove water from a sheet of paper, you will need a sheet of wet paper, a flat surface, a special felt (or a blotter sheet for handmade paper), and a heavy object or roller. Step 2: Place the wet paper sheet on the flat surface: Lay the wet sheet of paper flat on a clean, flat surface, ensuring there are no folds or creases. Step 3: Put the special felt or blotter sheet on top of the wet paper: Carefully place the special felt or blotter sheet on top of the wet paper, making sure it covers the entire sheet. The purpose of the felt or blotter sheet is to absorb water and also facilitate even distribution of pressure on the paper. Step 4: Apply pressure using a heavy object or roller: In this step, the water is removed by force. Place a heavy object, such as a large book, evenly across the felt or blotter sheet. Alternatively, use a roller to firmly press down on the paper, starting from the center and moving outwards. The force applied will squeeze the water out of the paper and into the felt or blotter sheet. Step 5: Check the paper: After applying pressure, carefully lift the heavy object or stop rolling and gently peel back the felt or blotter sheet to check the paper. If necessary, repeat the process using a fresh felt or blotter sheet until the paper is adequately dry. Step 6: Final drying: Allow the paper to air dry completely before using it. This can be done by hanging the paper on a clothesline or laying it on a flat surface. In summary, the water is removed from a sheet of paper by force through a process of evenly applying pressure using a heavy object or roller, which forces water out of the sheet and into a specially designed felt or blotter sheet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Carr was born Joseph Francis Karr on October 23, 1879, at his parents' home in the Irish neighborhood on the East End of Columbus, Ohio. His father, Michael Karr, was a shoemaker who was born in Ireland in 1841 and immigrated to the United States in 1864. His mother Margaret Karr was born in New York to Irish immigrant parents. Carr had five older siblings, Bridget, James, John, Mary, and Michael, and a younger brother, Edward. In 1900, Carr organized a baseball team made up of employees of the railroad's Panhandle Division. The team, known as the Famous Panhandle White Sox, played in the Capital City League and the Saturday Afternoon League in Columbus for several years. According to the Chicago Tribune, Carr's Panhandle club \\"gained a reputation in semi-professional ranks throughout the country.\\"  In 1907, Carr began a long association with the sport of football. He obtained permission from the Panhandle Athletic Club to reorganize the Columbus Panhandles football team, a team that had been formed in 1900 or 1901 and disbanded in 1904. He secured players from the railroad shop where he worked. The core of Carr's Panhandles teams were six Nesser brothers who worked at the shop and were excellent athletes. To save on expenses, the players, who were railroad employees, used their passes to ride the train for free and practiced during the lunch hour on the railroad yards. Over the next 13 years, the Panhandles became known as a traveling team, as Carr saved money on travel expenses and stadium rental by playing mostly road games. In 1921, the Fort Wayne Journal called the Panhandles the \\"most renowned professional football aggregation in the country.\\"  Carr also continued his association with professional baseball while running the Panhandles, serving for several years as the secretary/treasurer and later president of the Ohio State League, a minor league baseball circuit.  As early as 1917, Carr was one of the leading advocates of a plan to develop a national professional football league. Sources are not in agreement as to what role, if any, he played in the formation of the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which later became the National Football League (NFL). However, once the APFA was formed in 1920, Carr's Panhandles played in the league's inaugural season. The 1920 Panhandles team played only one home game and compiled a 2-7-2 record. How did the inaugural season go?","output":"The inaugural season of the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which later became the National Football League (NFL), took place in 1920. During this season, Carr's Columbus Panhandles team played only one home game and compiled a record of 2 wins, 7 losses, and 2 ties. Overall, the season was not very successful for the Panhandles, as they struggled to make a significant impact in the league standings. However, the fact that the team participated in the first-ever season of the APFA marked an important milestone in their history and the development of professional football in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Who are you talking to?\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Why aren't you talking?\\" true?","output":"In order to assess the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, we must first examine the content and context of each statement: Premise: \\"Who are you talking to?\\" The premise poses a question about the identity of the person (or AI) the conversation participant is engaging with. It implies that someone is actively talking or communicating, and the speaker asking the question wants to know the identity of the recipient of the communication. Hypothesis: \\"Why aren't you talking?\\" The hypothesis, on the other hand, appears to question the lack of communication from someone—one might infer that this question is directed towards someone who is not currently engaging in conversation. It juxtaposes the initial premise, as it assumes the opposite state; that someone is not talking when they could or should be. To determine whether the hypothesis, \\"Why aren't you talking?\\", maybe considered true based on the premise, \\"Who are you talking to?\\", we need to evaluate whether these two statements are congruent. If congruent, it could lead to the interpretation that the hypothesis is true or supportable. Upon analysis, we observe that the premise and the hypothesis contradict each other. The premise assumes that someone is currently talking and directs the question towards the identity of the person (or AI) being spoken with. On the other hand, the hypothesis questions a lack of communication and assumes that someone is not talking when they are expected to be. As the two statements are at odds with each other, it is not possible to conclude that the hypothesis, \\"Why aren't you talking?\\", is true based on the premise, \\"Who are you talking to?\\" The premise and the hypothesis convey opposing scenarios, making it impossible to infer or support the hypothesis based on the premise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Justin Bieber Is Right to Fight Silly \\"Sorry\\" Copyright Lawsuit I’m no Justin Bieber fan. Heck, I even signed that petition a few years back to have the White House deport the Biebs because he is a cultural nuisance. But when it comes to this copyright lawsuit, we should all have his back. News of the lawsuit emerged last Friday. It concerns an indie singer named White Hinderland, who claims Bieber and his producer Skrillex ripped off a vocal sequence for the smash hit “Sorry.” The disputed vocal sequence comes at the very opening of “Sorry” during which Bieber coos something like “ah, ooo–ooo–ooo.” Hinterland (or, more precisely, her lawyer) says the refrain is the same as one in her song “Ring the Bell,” and that Bieber’s “wrongful conduct has deprived Plaintiff of the benefit of her exclusive right to … her copyrighted works.” The singer is now asking a Tennessee court to order Bieber and his gang to pay damages, and for an injunction barring them from using that piece of music. Bieber, to his credit, is having none of it. The Canadian star on Friday tweeted a video showing how he produced the vocals, and suggesting he did not infringe Hinterland’s copyright: Others have since taken to YouTube to compare the two pieces. (This clip, which suggests the opening of “Sorry” was crafted from Bieber’s own voice, is worth a look since it shows a technical construction of the two songs.) Hinterland’s lawyer, meanwhile, will no doubt counter by pointing to a musicologist’s report, cited in the lawsuit, that says the pieces of music are the same. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. But whatever’s going on, let’s hope Bieber fights this in court since these types of cases are ridiculous—and bad for copyright and creativity. Let’s start with where this case was filed: the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. As a lawyer writing at J.D. Supra notes, this choice of venue is no coincidence. It lies in the the 6th Circuit, which has issued a series of infamous copyright rulings in the past that effectively banned sampling and, in the process, nearly destroyed hip-hop. This venue shopping is just one aspect of a cynical business model in which trolling copyright lawyers use technology to discover similarities between pieces of music, and then embark on a sort of shakedown. As Charles Cronin, a copyright authority at the University of Southern California, told the Fashion Law Blog in relation to the Bieber case: “Music infringement claims tend to be settled early on, with financially successful defendants doling out basically extorted payoffs to potential plaintiffs rather than facing expensive, protracted and embarrassing litigation.” Does this mean anyone should be able to help themselves to an artist’s work without permission? No, of course not. But it’s also absurd to require every musician to call a lawyer when they want to use a few seconds of sound. These sort of rules don’t encourage creativity, which copyright is supposed to do, but instead suppress it by taking away basic building blocks of art. It’s like telling a writer she can’t use the phrase “once upon a time” or a painter he can’t use a type of brush stroke. Fortunately, copyright law has some safety valves in the form of the “De Minimis” doctrine and “fair use” that can stop some of this silliness. Let’s hope Bieber takes up one these or another defense, and makes White Hinterland and her lawyer “sorry” they sued in the first place. Summary:","output":"There is a news article about Justin Bieber and a singer named White Hinderland. White Hinderland is saying that Justin Bieber and his producer took a part of her song \\"Ring the Bell\\" and used it without permission in Justin Bieber's song \\"Sorry.\\" Now, she wants Justin Bieber to pay her money and stop using that part of her song. But Justin Bieber doesn't agree, so they might go to court. The article believes that these kind of cases are not good for music and creativity and hopes that Justin Bieber can make a strong case against it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer from: I. yes; II. it is not possible to tell; III. no;","output":"Answer: II. it is not possible to tell Explanation: The premise states that a food cart is operated near an outdoor seating area, but it does not provide specific information about the food items being sold at the cart. While the hypothesis suggests that the food cart is selling hot dogs in the park, there is no information in the premise to confirm or disprove this suggestion. With the available information, one cannot definitively conclude that the food cart is selling hot dogs in the park. There could be various possibilities, such as the food cart offering other food items like sandwiches, tacos, or hamburgers. It is essential to have more information to support or refute the hypothesis. However, the hypothesis is not completely disconnected from the premise, as it still relates to a food cart located in an outdoor space, which aligns with the idea of a park and outdoor seating area. The hypothesis merely provides one possible detail that needs further information to be confirmed or denied.

What is the most sensical answer between \\"Mercury\\" and  \\"Venus\\"? Answer:","output":"The most sensical answer between \\"Mercury\\" and \\"Venus\\" is \\"Mercury.\\" In this short story, it is mentioned that Mercury has less mass than Venus, which implies that it has weaker gravity (Option A). Before we delve into the reasons why Mercury has weaker gravity, let's first understand a little about both planets' characteristics. Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of approximately 4,880 kilometers, while Venus is significantly larger, with a diameter of about 12,104 kilometers. Comparing their masses, Mercury has a mass of 3.3011 x 10^23 kg, while Venus's mass is 4.8675 x 10^24 kg. Gravity is directly proportional to an object's mass. The larger an object's mass, the greater the force of gravity it can exert. The force of gravity can be calculated using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, as follows: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 where F is the force of gravity, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers. Given that Mercury has less mass than Venus, we can deduce that the force of gravity on its surface will be weaker than that on Venus's surface. Mercury's gravity is about 3.7 m/s² (0.38 times Earth's gravity), while Venus's gravity is around 8.9 m/s² (0.9 times Earth's gravity). Consequently, an object would weigh less on Mercury than it would on Venus. However, it is essential to note that the force of gravity is not the sole factor determining the strength of gravity experienced on a planet's surface. Other factors, such as the planet's size (diameter) and the distance from its center to its surface, can also influence the gravity we feel on the planet. In the case of Mercury and Venus, these factors still lead to the conclusion that the gravity on Mercury is weaker than that on Venus. In conclusion, the most sensical answer between \\"Mercury\\" and \\"Venus\\" is \\"Mercury.\\" The original statement provided – \\"Mercury has less mass than Venus so it has weaker gravity\\" – is accurate and well-reasoned."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we should first understand the meaning of the terminologies involved and the context in which they are being used. The 'Sabbath' refers to a weekly day of rest, commonly observed by the Jewish faith from Friday evening to Saturday evening, and by some Christian denominations on Sundays. The term 'Passover' refers to the Jewish holiday that celebrates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. Premise: Closed Sabbath This statement informs us that a specific place, event, or establishment (which has not been mentioned) is closed on the Sabbath, either on Saturdays or Sundays, depending on the faith or belief system followed. Hypothesis: It's closed on the Sabbath and during Passover. This hypothesis builds upon the premise that the establishment is closed on the Sabbath and adds that it is also closed during the Passover holiday. Now, to analyze if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to check if the information in the premise is enough to logically conclude the hypothesis. The premise only states that the place is closed on the Sabbath. However, the hypothesis goes beyond this by including the fact that the place is also closed during Passover, which is not mentioned in the premise. Therefore, while the Sabbath portion of the hypothesis is supported by the premise, the Passover portion is additional information that is not entailed by the premise. We cannot conclusively say that the entire hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as the information about Passover closure is not derived from or supported by the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to the problem, if Leo gains 10 pounds, his weight will be L + 10. At that point, he will weigh 50% more than Kendra, so we can write the equation: L + 10 = 1.5K We also know that their combined current weight is 180 pounds, so we can write another equation: L + K = 180 Now we have a system of two equations with two variables: 1) L + 10 = 1.5K 2) L + K = 180 We can solve this system by expressing K in terms of L from the second equation and then substituting it into the first equation. From the second equation: K = 180 - L Now we substitute K in the first equation: L + 10 = 1.5(180 - L) Now we solve for L: L + 10 = 270 - 1.5L L + 1.5L = 270 - 10 2.5L = 260 L = 260 / 2.5 L = 104 So, Leo's current weight is boxed{104}  pounds."},{"instruction":"find the area of the quadrilateral of one of its diagonals is 20 cm and its off sets 5 cm and 4 cm ?","output":"To find the area of a quadrilateral given one of its diagonals and the lengths of the perpendiculars (offsets) from the other two vertices to this diagonal, you can use the following formula: Area = (1/2) * d * (h1 + h2) where d is the length of the diagonal, h1 is the length of one offset, and h2 is the length of the other offset.

The total number of matches played by the team also increased by 70, making it 120 + 70 = 190 matches. The team's average after the winning streak became 52%, which means: (W + 70) / 190 = 52/100 Now, we can solve for W: W + 70 = 190 * (52/100) W + 70 = 190 * 0.52 W + 70 = 98.8 Subtract 70 from both sides to find W: W = 98.8 - 70 W = 28.8 Since W must be a whole number (as you can't win a fraction of a match), we'll round W to the nearest whole number, which is 29.

If kk_{1}+kk_{2}+3=0, find the perimeter of triangle FPQ.","output":"# Solution:  Part (1) Given the area of the quadrilateral formed by connecting the four vertices of the ellipse E is 4sqrt{3}, and a=2, we can use the formula for the area of an ellipse, which is pi a b, but since we are dealing with a quadrilateral, the area is frac{1}{2} times 2a times 2b = 4ab. Setting this equal to 4sqrt{3}, we get: [ 4ab = 4sqrt{3} implies ab = sqrt{3} ] Given a=2, we can solve for b: [ 2b = sqrt{3} implies b = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] Thus, the standard equation of the ellipse E is: [ frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1 ] Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is boxed{frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1}.  Part (2) Given the right vertex of ellipse E is the focus of parabola G, and the shortest distance from a moving point M on G to the point H(10,0) is 4sqrt{6}, we first identify the right vertex of E as (a,0). For a parabola with focus (a,0), the equation can be written as y^2 = 4ax. Considering the distance from M(x,y) to H(10,0), we have: [ |M H| = sqrt{(x-10)^2 + y^2} = 4sqrt{6} ] Substituting y^2 = 4ax into the distance equation, we get: [ sqrt{(x-10)^2 + 4ax} = 4sqrt{6} ] Solving for a when the distance is minimized, we find that a = 4 when considering the conditions provided. Therefore, the value of a is boxed{4}.  Part (3) Given the conditions for the slopes of lines l, AP, and AQ, and using the equation of line l as y = kx + m, we can express k_1 and k_2 in terms of the coordinates of P and Q. The given condition kk_1 + kk_2 + 3 = 0 leads us through a series of algebraic manipulations to find the relationship between m and k. We find that m = k satisfies the condition without contradicting the given constraints. With m = k, the line l is y = kx + k, which always passes through the left focus of the ellipse, denoted as F_1. Considering the geometry of the ellipse and the properties of the focus, we calculate the perimeter of triangle FPQ as the sum of the distances |PF|, |FQ|, and |PQ|. Given the symmetry and properties of an ellipse, this simplifies to 4 times 2 = 8. Therefore, the perimeter of triangle FPQ is boxed{8}."},{"instruction":"Last year, Jorge planted corn on all of his 60 acres of property.  Typically, corn grown on good soil yields 400 bushels per acre, but in clayrich soil, the yield is only half as much per acre as in good soil.  Onethird of Jorge's 60 acres of land is clayrich soil and the rest is good soil.  How many bushels of corn did Jorge's land yield last year?","output":"To determine the total yield of corn from Jorge's land last year, we need to calculate the yield from both the good soil and the clay-rich soil separately, and then add them together. First, let's find out how many acres of clay-rich soil Jorge has: - Jorge has a total of 60 acres. - One-third of his land is clay-rich soil, so the number of acres of clay-rich soil is 60 times frac{1}{3} = 20 acres. Next, we calculate how many acres of good soil he has: - Since 20 acres are clay-rich, the remaining land is good soil. - Therefore, the number of acres of good soil is 60 - 20 = 40 acres. Now, let's calculate the yield from the good soil: - Good soil yields 400 bushels per acre. - Therefore, the yield from 40 acres of good soil is 40 times 400 = 16,000 bushels. For the clay-rich soil: - The yield is half that of good soil, so it yields 400 div 2 = 200 bushels per acre. - Therefore, the yield from 20 acres of clay-rich soil is 20 times 200 = 4,000 bushels. Finally, to find the total yield from Jorge's land, we add the yields from both types of soil: - The total yield is 16,000 + 4,000 = 20,000 bushels of corn. Thus, Jorge's land yielded a total of boxed{20,000} bushels of corn last year."},{"instruction":"The mean of 30 values was 250.

Since 60% of the employees are female, the number of female employees is: 60/100 * 1100 = 660 The number of male employees would then be the total number of employees minus the number of female employees: 1100 - 660 = 440 Now, we know that 62% of all employees are computer literate, so the total number of computer literate employees is: 62/100 * 1100 = 682 We are given that there are 462 female employees who are computer literate. To find the number of male employees who are computer literate, we subtract the number of computer literate female employees from the total number of computer literate employees: 682 - 462 = 220 Now we have the number of computer literate male employees (220) and the total number of male employees (440). To find the percentage of male employees who are computer literate, we divide the number of computer literate male employees by the total number of male employees and multiply by 100: (220 / 440) * 100 = 50% Therefore, boxed{50%}  of the male employees are computer literate."},{"instruction":"A valid license plate in the country of Eldorado consists of three letters followed by four digits.

Each factor ( (1 + x^k) ) in the product corresponds to the choice of including or not including the part ( k ). 2. The term ( d(n) cdot x^n ) will be present in the expansion if there is a way to write ( n ) as a sum of distinct integers.     For example, to form the term corresponding to ( x^n ), we pick ( x^k ) from some terms and 1's from others. This exactly matches the partitions of ( n ) into distinct parts. Thus, the generating function is confirmed to be: [ d(0) + d(1)x + d(2)x^2 + cdots = (1+x)(1+x^2)(1+x^3) cdots ] **b)** Now, for the number of partitions of ( n ) into odd parts, consider the generating function: [ l(0) + l(1)x + l(2)x^2 + cdots = (1-x)^{-1}(1-x^3)^{-1}(1-x^5)^{-1} cdots ] To understand this, recall the generating function for partitions into parts of specific forms. Here we are considering only odd parts: 1. An inverse factor ( (1 - x^k)^{-1} ) corresponds to the infinite geometric series summing all possible multiples of ( k ). 2. Each ( x^k ) represents that we can have ( k, k^2, k^3, ldots ) number of such parts.     Thus multiplying such series, and ensuring they are only using odd ( k ), correctly gives the generating function for partitions into odd parts. Therefore: [ l(0) + l(1)x + l(2)x^2 + cdots = (1-x)^{-1}(1-x^3)^{-1}(1-x^5)^{-1} cdots ] **c)** Next, we show that ( d(n) = l(n) ) for all ( n geq 0 ). Notice that both derived generating functions represent series whose products cancel out in a similar manner: [ (1+x)(1+x^2)(1+x^3) cdots = prod_{k geq 1} (1 + x^k) ] And, [ (1-x)^{-1}(1-x^3)^{-1}(1-x^5)^{-1} cdots = prod_{text{odd } k} (1 - x^k)^{-1} = prod_{text{odd } k} sum_{m geq 0} x^{mk} ] One can observe: [ prod_{k geq 1} (1 + x^k) = frac{1}{1-x} cdot frac{1}{1-x^3} cdot frac{1}{1-x^5} cdots ] This simplifies to: [ prod_{m  > 0}(1-x^{2m}) prod_{k text{ odd}} frac{1}{1-x^k} = 1 ] By cancellation, the generating function showing equality drives the required assertion: [ d(n) = l(n) ] Thus, we conclude the pair of numbers counting partitions of ( n ) into distinct parts is equal to those counting partitions into odd sums: [ boxed{d(n) = l(n) quad (n=0,1,2,ldots)}.] (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"f theta is an angle in the first quadrant, then always (　　) A: sin frac{theta}{2} > 0 B: tan frac{theta}{2} < 1 C: sin frac{theta}{2} > cos frac{theta}{2} D: sin frac{theta}{2} < cos frac{theta}{2}","output":"Since theta is an angle in the first quadrant, we have 2kpi < theta < frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi.

If ( Z ) is finite, then the number of distances between pairs of points in ( Z ) is also finite. However, the problem states that for any ( r > 0 ), there exists an unjoinable pair of points separated by distance ( r ).

Therefore, for ( n = 4 ), the condition is satisfied. 2. **Case ( n ge 5 ):**    - **Subcase 1: Four points lie on a plane.**      - Suppose there are four points ( A, B, C, D ) that lie on a plane. Since no three points are collinear and no four points are concyclic, the circles passing through any three of these points must be congruent.      - Consider the circles passing through points ( A, B, C ) and ( A, B, D ). These circles must have the same radius. However, since there are only two circles with a fixed radius passing through two fixed points ( A ) and ( B ), and if at least one of them contains the other two points, it leads to a contradiction.      - Therefore, there must be exactly one point on each circle, say ( C ) and ( D ).

Each transition from ( B rightarrow G ) or ( G rightarrow B ) is counted (1).    - Since seating is a continuous cyclic sequence, and total seating offsets are closed-loop permutations, counting transitions (pairs) must close the even inclusion. 9. **Conclusion**:    - Summing the flip pairs across the cyclic direct index, show iterations cover and count even outcomes invariant of total placements.    - Hence the pairs count ((BG) or (GB)) in cyclic count parity covers all with even count.

The eccentricity formula gives us c = frac{sqrt{5}}{3}a. When the line l is perpendicular to the y-axis and left| AB right|=3sqrt{3}, we can infer that the point left( frac{3sqrt{3}}{2},1 right) lies on the ellipse. Substituting this point into the general equation of the ellipse frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, we get: [ frac{left(frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2}{a^2} + frac{1^2}{b^2} = 1 implies frac{frac{27}{4}}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} = 1 ] Given c^2 = a^2 - b^2 and substituting c = frac{sqrt{5}}{3}a, we can solve for a and b. We find that a = 3 and b = 2. Therefore, the standard equation of the ellipse E is: [ boxed{frac{x^2}{9} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1} ]  Part 2: Finding the Value of k Let A(x_1,y_1), B(x_2,y_2), and C(x_0,y_0) be the midpoint of AB. The equation of line l is y = kx + 1. Substituting y from the line equation into the ellipse equation gives: [ frac{x^2}{9} + frac{(kx + 1)^2}{4} = 1 implies (4 + 9k^2)x^2 + 18kx - 27 = 0 ] Since Delta > 0, we have the midpoint C's x-coordinate as x_0 = frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = frac{-9k}{4 + 9k^2} and the y-coordinate as y_0 = kx_0 + 1 = frac{4}{4 + 9k^2}. The equation of the line passing through point C and perpendicular to l is: [ y = -frac{1}{k}left( x + frac{9k}{4 + 9k^2} right) + frac{4}{4 + 9k^2} ] Substituting point Mleft( frac{5}{12},0 right) into this equation gives: [ 0 = -frac{1}{k}left( frac{5}{12} + frac{9k}{4 + 9k^2} right) + frac{4}{4 + 9k^2} ] Simplifying this equation leads to 9k^2 + 12k + 4 = 0.

Begin by noting that the sum of the digits of a number a, denoted by S(a), is congruent to a modulo 9. This can be written as:    [    a equiv S(a) pmod{9}    ] 2. Similarly, for the number 2a, the sum of the digits of 2a, denoted by S(2a), is congruent to 2a modulo 9:    [    2a equiv S(2a) pmod{9}    ] 3.

Since S(a) = S(2a), we equate the two congruences:    [    a equiv 2a pmod{9}    ] 5.

The volume of the cylinder with the increased radius is (pi cdot (r+4)^2 cdot 5). The volume of the cylinder with the increased height is (pi cdot r^2 cdot 15).
