It is very important in American culture. American stories speak of Johnny Appleseed, who went throughout America collecting apple seeds and planting apple trees. He had a great love for nature and went through fields and farms adding richness and beauty to the country. One of the first sayings taught to school children is, \\"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\\" This short saying encourages children to eat fresh fruit to keep healthy. If someone always says good words to a person, people will call him an _ . This, however, is not a good name. If someone is very dear to us, we say that he or she is the \\"apple of our eye\\". Most people believe that the fruit which Eve gave to Adam was an apple, even though the Bible  never says so. The apple, therefore, is a deep part of the language and stories of America. An apple is also delicious. Apples can be cooked in many ways, used as a dessert   , and made into sweet juice. In many parts of the country during the harvest season, a popular activity is to go into an apple garden to pick apples. Washington, D. C. and New York are both famous for their apples. Finally, when it's time to take a vacation to American cities, one can always visit New York, which is \\"the biggest apple\\" of all the American cities.

The blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900. Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and red design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel. The club's most frequently used change colours have been yellow and orange.

We were cornered in a sort of way already.  But these butchers up the cavern had been surprised, they were probably scared, and they had no special weapons, only those little hatchets of theirs.  And that way lay escape.  Their sturdy little forms--ever so much shorter and thicker than the mooncalf herds--were scattered up the slope in a way that was eloquent of indecision.  I had the moral advantage of a mad bull in a street.  But for all that, there seemed a tremendous crowd of them.  Very probably there was.  Those Selenites down the cleft had certainly some infernally long spears.  It might be they had other surprises for us.... But, confound it!  if we charged up the cave we should let them up behind us, and if we didn't those little brutes up the cave would probably get reinforced.  Heaven alone knew what tremendous engines of warfare--guns, bombs, terrestrial torpedoes--this unknown world below our feet, this vaster world of which we had only pricked the outer cuticle, might not presently send up to our destruction.  It became clear the only thing to do was to charge!  It became clearer as the legs of a number of fresh Selenites appeared running down the cavern towards us.

I wasn't paying attention when I pulled into the parking lot and I thought I was going to Whataburger. Imagine my surprise when all I saw was hotdogs on the menu! Took me a minute to figure out why, but once I did, since I was there, I thought I'd try something. Having never been to a Wienerschnitzel before I had to rely on the photos to show me what to expect. Saw the sauerkraut dog and had to order that, has mustard too, perfect way to eat a hot dog. Shakes were on sale, so i got a chocolate one. The shake was ok, it didn't make it back to the office, but not because it was 'awesome', it was because I was thirsty and that's all I had. Got to the office, opened the bag, pulled out the hotdog and, well, was quite disappointed. The photo shows a HOTDOG in a bun with a nice stripe of mustard and a heaping amount of sauerkraut. That is not what I got. I got a hotdog in a BUN, with about a teaspoon of sauerkraut that looked like it was dipped in mustard. Ok, so i'm used to the Costco hotdogs, where you can actually see the dog sticking out each side, so i was expecting as such. That's how the photo looked, but no, no dog sticking out. took me two bites each end to find the hot dog. and it was no bigger around than my finger and was tasteless.

The reviewer starts off by expressing their disappointment, using the word \\"totally\\" to emphasize their dissatisfaction. 2. They mention that they accidentally went to Wienerschnitzel instead of Whataburger, which sets a negative tone for their experience. 3. The review mentions that they were forced to rely on the menu photos to make a decision, indicating a lack of familiarity and comfort with this dining option. 4. While discussing their order, the reviewer casually describes the shake as \\"ok,\\" but not outstanding. They also clarify that they finished it not out of enjoyment, but out of thirst. 5. The primary source of disappointment seems to be the hotdog, with the reviewer outlining several issues: the presentation did not match the photo, there was barely any sauerkraut and mustard, and the hotdog itself was small and tasteless. 6. The review concludes with a clear statement that they will not return to this establishment, which reaffirms the negative sentiment. Overall, the reviewer expresses dissatisfaction and disappointment throughout their description of the dining experience, making it evident that the sentiment of this review is decidedly negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Our equation is: 8 * k + 3 = 7 * k First, we'll see that there is a \\"k\\" on both sides of the equation. That means we can get all the \\"k's\\" on one side by subtracting the smaller one from the bigger one, like this: (8 * k) - (7 * k) + 3 = 7 * k - 7 * k Now, when we subtract 7 * k from both sides, we get: 1 * k + 3 = 0 Next, we want to get the \\"k\\" all by itself. To do that, we need to get that \\"+ 3\\" away from the \\"k\\". We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 1 * k = -3 Now, finally, we can see that our answer is: k = -3 So, in a way that a five-year-old can understand: Think of it like this, if we have 8 toy cars and we take away 7 toy cars, we are left with 1 toy car.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Krum was the Khan of Bulgaria from sometime after 796 but before 803 until his death in 814. During his reign the Bulgarian territory doubled in size, spreading from the middle Danube to the Dnieper and from Odrin to the Tatra Mountains. His able and energetic rule brought law and order to Bulgaria and developed the rudiments of state organisation.  - Nikephoros I or Nicephorus I , also Logothetes or Genikos ( Greek :    , Nikphoros I , \`\` Bringer of Victory '' ; died July 26 , 811 ) , was Byzantine Emperor from 802 to 811 AD , when he was killed in the Battle of Pliska . A patrician from Seleucia Sidera , Nikephoros was appointed finance minister ( logothets tou genikou ) by the Empress Irene . With the help of the patricians and eunuchs he contrived to dethrone and exile Irene , and to be chosen as Emperor in her stead on October 31 , 802 . He crowned his son Staurakios co-emperor in 803 . His rule was endangered by Bardanes Tourkos , one of his ablest generals , who revolted and received support from other commanders , notably the later emperors Leo V the Armenian and Michael II the Amorian in 803 . But Nikephoros gained over the latter two , and by inducing the rebel army to disperse achieved the submission of Bardanes , who was blinded and relegated to a monastery . A conspiracy headed by the patrician Arsaber had a similar issue . Nikephoros embarked on a general reorganization of the Empire , creating new themes in the Balkans ( where he initiated the re-Hellenization by resettling Greeks from Anatolia ) and strengthening the frontiers . Needing large sums to increase his military forces , he set himself with great energy to increase the Empire 's revenue . By his rigorous tax imposts he alienated the favour of his subjects , and especially of the clergy , whom he otherwise sought to control firmly . Although he appointed an iconodule , Nikephoros as patriarch , Emperor Nikephoros was portrayed as a villain by ecclesiastical historians like Theophanes the Confessor . In 803 Nikephoros concluded a treaty , called the \`\` Pax Nicephori '' , with Charlemagne , but refused to recognize the latter 's imperial dignity . Relations deteriorated and led to a war over Venice in 806 -- 810 . In the process Nikephoros had quelled a Venetian rebellion in 807 , but suffered extensive losses to the Franks . The conflict was resolved only after Nikephoros ' death ,...  - The Battle of Pliska or Battle of Vrbitsa Pass was a series of battles between troops, gathered from all parts of the Byzantine Empire, led by the Emperor Nicephorus I Genik, and Bulgaria, governed by Khan Krum. The Byzantines plundered and burned the Bulgar capital Pliska which gave time for the Bulgarians to block passes in the Balkan Mountains that served as exits out of Bulgaria. The final battle took place on 26 July 811, in some of the passes in the eastern part of the Balkans, most probably the Vrbitsa Pass. There, the Bulgarians used the tactics of ambush and surprise night attacks to effectively trap and immobilize the Byzantine forces, thus annihilating almost the whole army, including the Emperor. After the battle, Krum encased Nicephorus's skull in silver, and used it as a cup for wine-drinking. This is one of the best documented instances of the custom of the skull cup.  - The Balkan mountain range (Bulgarian and , Latin Serbian Stara planina, \\"Old Mountain\\"; ) is a mountain range in the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula. The Balkan range runs 560 km from the Vrashka Chuka Peak on the border between Bulgaria and Serbia eastward through central Bulgaria to Cape Emine on the Black Sea. The highest peaks of the Balkan Mountains are in central Bulgaria. The highest peak is Botev at 2,376 m, which makes the mountain range the third highest in the country, after Rila and Pirin. The mountains are the source of the name of the Balkan Peninsula.   - Pliska (, romanized: \\"Plskov\\") is the name of both the first capital of the First Bulgarian Empire and a small town situated 20 km Northeast of the provincial capital Shumen.  - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\".  - The First Bulgarian Empire (Old ) was a medieval Bulgarian state that existed in southeastern Europe between the 7th and 11th centuries AD. It was founded circa 681 when Bulgar tribes led by Asparukh moved to the northeastern Balkans. There they secured Byzantine recognition of their right to settle south of the Danube by defeating  possibly with the help of local South Slavic tribes  the Byzantine army led by Constantine IV. At the height of its power, Bulgaria spread from the Danube Bend to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River to the Adriatic Sea.

Step 1: The US capital city, Washington, District of Columbia (also known as Washington, D.C.), was established by the Residence Act of 1790, which was signed into law by President George Washington. The act authorized the creation of a capital district along the Potomac River, between the states of Maryland and Virginia. Step 2: Since the land occupied by Washington, D.C. was located along the Potomac River between Maryland and Virginia, it can be determined that both Maryland and Virginia initially donated land for the establishment of the capital. However, the land donated by Virginia (the portion south of the Potomac River) was later returned to the state in the mid-19th century.

Here is a detailed and long answer on how to accomplish this goal: 1. Prepare the necessary ingredients and equipment: - Deer loin - Ziplock bags or airtight containers (for marinating) - Italian dressing - Your favorite jerky seasonings (e.g., salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, etc.) - A dehydrator with adjustable temperature control - Paper towels or clean kitchen towels (for drying the meat) 2. Defrost the deer loin: - Ensure you properly defrost the deer loin in the refrigerator. This process may take 12-24 hours, depending on the size of the loin. Place it on a tray or in a container to catch any drips and avoid cross-contamination. 3. Prepare the marinade: - In a bowl, combine the Italian dressing and your preferred seasonings. You can use a store-bought dressing or make your own by mixing olive oil, vinegar, oregano, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Experiment with different seasonings, such as red pepper flakes, brown sugar, soy sauce, or even pineapple juice, to create your desired flavor. 4. Trim and slice the deer loin: - Once the deer loin is fully defrosted, trim any excess fat or connective tissue. Slice the loin into thin strips, approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. This ensures the jerky will dry evenly and thoroughly. For a more tender jerky, slice against the grain. If you prefer a more chewy texture, slice the meat with the grain. 5. Marinate the deer loin: - Place the sliced deer loin strips in a Ziplock bag or airtight container. Pour the marinade over the meat, ensuring every piece is thoroughly coated. Seal the container or bag, removing any excess air. Place the container in the refrigerator and let the deer loin marinate overnight, or for at least 8-12 hours. The longer the marination, the more flavorful the jerky will be. 6. Preheat the dehydrator: - Before removing the marinated deer loin from the refrigerator, set up your dehydrator according to the manufacturer's instructions and preheat it to the meat setting, typically around 160°F (71°C). 7. Drain and pat the deer loin dry: - Remove the marinated deer loin strips from the refrigerator and drain off any excess marinade. Using paper towels or clean kitchen towels, pat the strips dry to remove excess surface moisture. This will help the jerky dehydrate more quickly and help achieve a consistent texture. 8. Arrange the deer loin strips in the dehydrator: - Place the dried deer loin strips in a single layer on the dehydrator trays, ensuring they do not touch or overlap. This allows for ample airflow and even dehydration. 9. Dehydrate the deer jerky: - Turn the dehydrator on and let it run until the deer jerky reaches your desired texture. This may take anywhere from 4 to 12 hours, depending on the thickness of the meat, your dehydrator, and personal preferences. Check the jerky periodically for doneness. It should be firm and leathery, yet bendable and easy to tear. 10. Cool and store the deer jerky: - When the jerky is done, remove it from the dehydrator and let it cool to room temperature on clean trays or a wire rack. Once cooled, store the jerky in an airtight container or plastic Ziplock bag for up to two weeks at room temperature, or freeze it for longer-term storage. By following these instructions, you will be able to create delicious homemade deer jerky that can be enjoyed as a nutritious, high-protein snack."},{"instruction":"Addison gave Bailey the advantage since it was her first time playing.

On Friday, July 8, 2011, a family... (Associated Press)      Mrs. Ford's death was confirmed by Marty Allen, chairman emeritus of the Ford Foundation. He did not comment further, and said he expected the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum would release information later.      Betty Ford, whose husband, Gerald, died in December 2006, had undergone surgery for an undisclosed ailment in April 2007. During and after her years in the White House, 1974 to 1977, Mrs. Ford won acclaim for her candor, wit and courage as she fought breast cancer, severe arthritis and the twin addictions of drugs and alcohol. She also pressed for abortion rights and the Equal Rights Amendment.      But it was her Betty Ford Center, a desert oasis that rescued celebrities and ordinary people from addiction, that made her famous in her own right. She was modest about that accomplishment.      \\"People who get well often say, \`You saved my life,' and \`You've turned my life around,'\\" she recalled. \\"They don't realize we merely provided the means for them to do it themselves and that's all.      \\"That's a God-given gift as far as I'm concerned. I don't take any credit for providing anything that wasn't provided to me.\\"      After the former president died Dec. 26, 2006, at age 93, his widow said: \\"His life was filled with love of God, his family and his country.\\" They had been married in 1948, the same year he was elected to Congress.      As she and their children led the nation in mourning him, Americans were reminded anew of her own contributions, as well as his. It was calculated then that the Betty Ford Center had treated 76,000 people.      \\"It's hard to imagine a more important figure in the substance abuse field than Mrs. Ford,\\" Rick Rawson, associate director of the integrated substance abuse program at the University of California at Los Angeles, said at the time.      She and her husband had retired to Rancho Mirage after he lost a bruising presidential race to Jimmy Carter in 1976. She went to work on her memoirs, \\"The Times of My Life,\\" which came out in 1979. But the social whirlwind that engulfed them in Washington was over, and Betty Ford confessed that she missed it.      \\"We had gone into the campaign to win and it was a great disappointment losing, particularly by such a small margin,\\" she said. \\"It meant changing my whole lifestyle after 30 years in Washington, and it was quite a traumatic experience.\\"      By 1978, she was addicted to alcohol and prescription drugs. She would later describe herself during that period as \\"this nice, dopey pill-pusher sitting around and nodding.\\"      \\"As I got sicker,\\" she recalled, \\"I gradually stopped going to lunch. I wouldn't see friends. I was putting everyone out of my life.\\" Her children recalled her living in a stupor, shuffling around in her bathrobe, refusing meals in favor of a drink.      Her family finally confronted her in April 1978 and insisted she seek treatment. She credited their \\"intervention\\" with saving her life.      \\"I was stunned at what they were trying to tell me about how I disappointed them and let them down,\\" Ford told The Associated Press in 1994.      \\"I was terribly hurt _ after I had spent all those years trying to be the best mother, wife I could be. ... Luckily, I was able to hear them saying that I needed help and they cared too much about me to let it go on, she said.      She entered Long Beach Naval Hospital and underwent a grim detoxification, which became the model for therapy at the Betty Ford Center. She saw her recovery as a second chance at life.      \\"When you come back from something that was as disagreeable and unsettling as my alcoholism, when you come back to health from that, everything is so much more valuable,\\" she said in her book, \\"A Glad Awakening.\\"      Her own experience, and that of a businessman friend whom she helped save from alcoholism, were the inspiration for the center, located on the grounds of the Eisenhower Medical Center. She helped raise 3 million, lobbied in the state capital for its approval, and reluctantly agreed to let it be named for her.      \\"The center's name has been burden, as well as honor,\\" she wrote. \\"Because even if nobody else holds me responsible, I hold myself responsible.\\"      She liked to tell patients, \\"I'm just one more woman who has had this problem.\\"      Her efforts won her a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, from the first President Bush in 1991. In October 1999: Gerald and Betty Ford both were awarded Congressional Gold Medals.      She continued to be outspoken on public issues, pressing for fellow Republicans to be moderate on social questions. She spoke out in favor of gays in the military in a 1993 Washington Post interview, saying they had been serving for many years.      During the Clinton presidency, Mrs. Ford praised first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, saying she had been with her at a meeting on health care and found her \\"courteous, charming, able, attractive. ... She asks good questions. She picked out one of the most demanding roles she possibly could.\\"      In 2005, she was presented with the Gerald R. Ford Medal of Distinguished Public Service from her husband's foundation, telling the gathering that it was \\"very, very special.\\" She added in her typical candor: \\"It's kind of all in the family, and I feel a little guilty about it.\\"      Mrs. Ford's first public appearance after her husband's death was in August 2007, when she attended a ceremony near Rancho Mirage as a postage stamp honoring the late president was issued. She did not speak. She had not traveled to Texas for the funeral of Lady Bird Johnson the previous month.      Elizabeth Bloomer was born in Chicago on April 8, 1918, and raised in Grand Rapids, Mich. She was talented in dancing and ultimately studied with the great dancer and choreographer Martha Graham. She also worked as a model to make extra money during the Depression.      With her gray-green eyes, chestnut hair and stately bearing, she was often described as regal.      An early marriage to a furniture company representative, William Warren, ended in divorce before she met Gerald Ford, a lawyer just out of the Navy. When he proposed in 1948, she said later, she had no idea he planned a political career.      \\"I really thought I was marrying a lawyer, and we'd be living in Grand Rapids,\\" she recalled. Then he announced his plan to run for Congress and even made a campaign appearance during their honeymoon.      Political life was hard for her. While her husband campaigned or worked late on Capitol Hill, she raised their four children: Michael Gerald, born in 1950; John Gardner, born in 1952; Steven Meigs, born in 1956; and Susan Elizabeth, born in 1957.      She said the pressure led her to consult a psychiatrist who told her \\"I shouldn't give up everything for my husband and my children, but had to think about what mattered to me.\\"      The children were in their late teens and early 20s by the time the Fords moved into the White House and only Susan lived there. But they were a close family, gathering at Vail, Colo., for Christmas skiing vacations.      \\"When I came to Washington, I saw my job as a supporting wife and mother,\\" Mrs. Ford said. \\"But I came to feel an emptiness in spite of the fact I was happy. The old term housewife just didn't seem right. That's when I looked for support in my thinking that there must be something more than that. And indeed there is.\\"      She became an outspoken advocate for the Equal Rights Amendment, favored legal abortion and supported drafting women for the armed services. When asked on \\"60 Minutes\\" what she would do if her daughter, Susan, had an affair, she responded, \\"Well, I wouldn't be surprised. I'd think she was a perfectly normal human being. ... If she wanted to continue, I would certainly counsel and advise her on the subject.\\"      Drawing on her dance background, she also helped foster interest in the arts during her time as first lady. She reconnected with her old teacher Graham, who remembered her as \\"very dedicated,\\" and Graham received the Medal of Freedom in a White House ceremony during the Ford years.      When she underwent a radical mastectomy for removal of a cancerous breast, she kept no secrets, bringing the disease into the open.      Thousands of women rushed to get breast examinations because of Ford's example.      ___      Online:      Betty Ford Center: http://www.bettyfordcenter.org/      Gerald Ford library and museum: http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/default.asp ||||| Betty Ford, the widow of late President Gerald Ford and a co-founder of an eponymous addiction center in California, has died at the age of 93, according to the director of the Gerald R.

One of the most widely accepted, commonly repeated assumptions   in our culture is that if you exercise, you will lose weight. I exercise all the time, but I still have gut fat that hangs over my belt when I sit. Why isn't all the exercise getting rid of it? It's a question many of us could ask. More than 45 million Americans now belong to a health club, up from 23 million in 1993. We spend some 19 billion a year on gym memberships. Of course, some people join and never go. Still, as one major study -- the Minnesota Heart Survey -- found, more of us at least say we exercise regularly. And yet obesity   figures have risen sharply in the same period: a third of Americans are obese, and another third count as overweight by the Federal Government's definition. Yes, it's entirely possible that those of us who regularly go to the gym would weigh even more if we exercised less. But like many other people, I get hungry after I exercise, so I often eat more on the days I work out than on the days I don't. Could exercise actually be keeping me from losing weight? The popular belief that exercise is essential for weight control is actually fairly new. As recently as the 1960s, doctors routinely advised against too much exercise, particularly for older adults who could injure themselves. Today doctors encourage even their oldest patients to exercise, which is sound advice for many reasons: People who regularly exercise are at significantly lower risk for all manner of diseases -- those of the heart in particular. They less often develop cancer and many other illnesses. But the past few years of obesity research show that the role of exercise in weight loss has been wildly over-evaluated. \\"In general, for weight loss, exercise is pretty useless,\\" says Eric Ravussin, exercise researcher at Louisiana State University. Many recent studies have found that exercise isn't as important in helping people lose weight as you hear so regularly in gym advertisements or on shows likeThe Biggest Loser -- or, for that matter, from...

Given the question: -  Coal is burned in a boiler - Steam is produced under pressure - Flows into a turbine - The turbine spins  What might be the last step of the process? The answer is:","output":"The last step of the process after the turbine spins is the generation and transmission of electricity to consumers.  After the coal is burned in the boiler, steam is produced under high pressure. This high-pressure steam flows into a turbine, which is essentially a large wheel with numerous blades. As the steam comes into contact with the blades, it forces the turbine to rotate rapidly due to the transfer of kinetic energy. The spinning of the turbine generates mechanical energy, which needs to be transformed into electrical energy. This transformation is achieved through the use of an electrical generator, which is connected to the spinning turbine. The generator is designed to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, which is achieved through the process of electromagnetic induction. Within the generator, there are two essential components: a rotor (a rotating electromagnet) and a stator (stationary wires). As the rotor spins, it generates a magnetic field around the stator. The change in the magnetic field causes electrons within the stator to move, thereby producing an electric current. This electric current (or electricity) generated by the conversion process is then sent to substations, where transformers are used to adjust the voltage to levels appropriate for long-distance transmission. Once the voltage is adjusted, it is transmitted through high-voltage power lines to local distribution utilities. These utilities then distribute the electricity to residential, commercial, and industrial consumers, who ultimately utilize the power for various purposes. It is important to mention that during this entire process, several measures are taken to minimize energy loss and ensure the efficiency of the power generation and transmission system. For instance, efforts are devoted to minimizing heat loss from the boiler, turbine, and generator, as well as optimizing the combustion of coal to generate the maximum amount of energy. Additionally, modern power plants are making use of technologies such as carbon capture and storage to reduce the environmental impact of burning coal. In summary, the last step of the process after the turbine spins is the generation of electricity through an electrical generator, followed by the transmission and distribution of electricity to various consumers who utilize it for their needs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: FRANKFURT — The market for luxury cars is recovering, but makers of the lower-priced cars that most people drive could struggle with meager profits for years to come. That was the message to be drawn from earnings reports released by Bayerische Motoren Werke and Volkswagen on Thursday. BMW said that its car division returned to profit in the fourth quarter of 2009, as sales stabilized in established markets and grew in emerging countries like China and Brazil. Soaring demand for higher-priced models like the top-of-line 7 Series contributed to the gains. For the full year, net profit at BMW beat expectations, falling 36 percent to €210 million, or 286 million. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had on average forecast a profit of €174 million. Sales fell 4.7 percent to €50.7 billion. Volkswagen also reported a profit for the year and record sales, confirming numbers first released early this month. But a closer look showed that its premium Audi unit accounted for almost all the operating profit of €1.9 billion, which was a 71 percent decline from 2008. Audi last week reported an operating profit €1.6 billion. That means Volkswagen’s volume brands, which also include Skodas from the Czech Republic and SEAT cars made in Spain, barely broke even, according to Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. “VW Group profit is based almost exclusively on the strength of Audi,” Mr. Dudenhöffer wrote in an analysis of the carmaker’s results. “VW Group’s volume brands are headed for a new cost problem.” If Volkswagen is racking up record unit sales but barely making money on small cars, the road to recovery looks longer than ever for other mass-market carmakers like General Motors and its Opel/Vauxhall unit, or Renault, both of which lost billions in 2009. The Volkswagen results are especially bad news for carmakers because the company, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, was considered among the healthiest in the industry, with strong market share in fast-growing developing countries and a broad portfolio of products, including 75 new or improved models last year alone. “Among the European carmakers Volkswagen is certainly the best-positioned globally,” said Georg Stürzer, an analyst at UniCredit in Munich. Including all its brands, Volkswagen sold more than 6.3 million cars and trucks in 2009, a 1.3 percent increase. But the value of those sales fell. Revenue at Volkswagen declined 7.6 percent to €105.2 billion, the company said. “We have to continue to work hard on our cost structures,” Hans Dieter Pötsch, the chief financial officer at Volkswagen, acknowledged in a statement. Few automakers are as strong in China or other emerging countries as Volkswagen, where car sales are expected to grow much faster than in Western Europe. VW sales in China soared 37 percent in 2009 to 1.4 million vehicles, more than VW sold in Germany. Sales abroad will help VW offset weak profit and underutilized assembly lines at home, Mr. Stürzer said, but “the others will not be able to do that.” Volkswagen said it expected to increase profit this year from last year, but warned that sales would not recover to 2007 levels until 2012. BMW is also turning to emerging markets for growth. It said sales in China grew 38 percent in 2009 and doubled in Brazil. Unit sales fell 20 percent in the United States last year, but BMW said that sales had already picked up this year. Particularly striking was the surge in sales of BMW’s most expensive cars. The 7 Series, which starts at €79,000 and tops out at more than €145,000 for a limousine version including rear seats with built-in massage, booked a 36 percent increase in sales to 52,680 cars. The X6 four-wheel-drive car and Z4 sports car also generated big sales increases, BMW said. Its car division, which also makes Rolls-Royces and Mini small cars, was unprofitable for the first nine months of 2009, but returned to an operating profit of €93 million in the final quarter, BMW said. The company remained profitable overall during 2009 because of earnings from its financial services and motorcycle units. “We performed well in 2009 despite difficult market conditions worldwide,” Norbert Reithofer, the automaker’s chief executive, said in statement. BMW came through the financial crisis better than rivals like Daimler, the maker of Mercedes cars, because it cut manufacturing capacity early in 2008 and did not build up large inventories of unsold vehicles. The company has said that it expected sales to improve later this year as it rolled out new models like the redesigned BMW 5 Series and four-wheel-drive Mini Countryman. BMW said Tuesday that unit sales of all its automobile brands rose 14 percent in February from a year earlier, to 92,000 vehicles. In 2009, BMW sold almost 1.3 million cars including the Mini and Rolls-Royce, a 10.4 percent decline from 2008. The company said it would pay an unchanged dividend of 30 cents for every common share and 32 cents for preferred shares. BMW shares rose 1 percent in Frankfurt trading, while Volkswagen’s preferred shares rose 3 percent after the company said it would not sell as much new stock to finance acquisitions as investors had feared.

Possible A: garden, yard, southern europe, rice paddy, house  Why is \\"garden\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Garden\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. First, the context provided in the question suggests that the subject is focusing on an outdoor space connected to her living area. A terrace is an outdoor space designed for various uses like relaxation, leisure, and even gardening activities, often found adjacent to or within a garden. Second, when the statement mentions the terrace being covered in green next year, it implies that the area will have plants, shrubs, or other greenery, which are common features of a garden. A garden is a cultivated plot of land with a variety of plants, flowers, and other vegetation, making it a logical choice for the desired outdoor space. Furthermore, the statement refers to this space as the final piece of her dream. This implies that the outdoor space holds great significance and is an essential element of the individual's ideal living arrangement. A garden, with its lush greenery, vibrant flowers, and aesthetic appeal, is often seen as a significant and desirable component of a home. In comparison to the other possible answers: - A yard is a general term for an open outdoor space and might not necessarily focus on the greenery aspect desired. - Southern Europe is a geographical region and doesn't align with the context regarding an outdoor space around a house. - A rice paddy is a specific type of agricultural field for rice cultivation, which doesn't make sense within the context given. - A house represents the entire living space, but the question specifically points to an outdoor component of the property.

The result was a second consecutive victory for Constantine Karamanlis and his National Radical Union party , which won 171 of the 300 seats in Parliament .  - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - The National Radical Union ((), \\"Ethnik Rizospastik Énsis\\" (ERE)) was a Greek political party formed in 1955 by Konstantinos Karamanlis, mostly out of the Greek Rally party.  - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe.  Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki.  - Greek Rally ((), \\"Ellnikòs Synagermós (ES)\\") was a right-wing political party in Greece. Founded on 6 August 1951 by former field marshal Alexandros Papagos, the party encompassed a broad spectrum of the royalist conservative elements in Greek society and was modelled on the Charles de Gaulle's Rassemblement du Peuple Français (RPF). Throughout the years, the Greek right had become splintered. Papagos' new party managed to attract considerable support, and the Populist Uniting Party (led by Panagiotis Kanellopoulos and Stephanos Stephanopoulos) and the New Party (led by Spiros Markezinis) dissolved and merged with the Greek Rally. Later on, a large portion of the People's Party, the major right-wing party of the prewar era, defected to the Greek Rally; among the prominent defectors was Konstantinos Karamanlis.

People: While people can cause rocks to have less friction by handling and shaping them, it is less likely that this process is as widespread as natural phenomena like water or wind. C).

Article: Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)      Paula Deen’s longtime powerhouse publicist, Nancy Assuncao, has quit after six years over the butter-loving chef’s plan to plug a diabetes drug.      Assuncao faithfully stuck with Deen through years of hearty drama, including her battle with rival chef Anthony Bourdain, who called her “the most dangerous woman in America.” But she quit as Deen’s spokeswoman and chief marketer last month as Deen negotiated her deal to hawk the drug Victoza.      Deen, now under siege by diabetics, nutritionists and fellow chefs for keeping her own Type 2 diabetes secret for three years, even as she pushed recipes full of sugar and fat, probably could use Assuncao’s help now. Deen only revealed her diagnosis last week.      A source said Assuncao “strongly disagreed with Deen’s dramatic turnabout, after years of promoting fatty foods, to announcing she has a deal with a diabetes drug company [Novo Nordisk] and will be promoting lighter food and ‘diabetes in a new light.’      “While Paula did tell some people at her live appearances about her diabetes, she certainly didn’t talk about it on her show. Nancy disagreed with Paula’s plan to be a drug-company spokesman and challenged her decision. But this wasn’t a battle Nancy felt she was going to win. She couldn’t be part of it.”      Assuncao, whose past clients have included Ian Schrager, told us last night, “I’m very grateful for the six years that I worked with Paula in helping her build the Deen brand.      “Although we had a great deal of fun along the way, I could not agree with the new business strategy going forward. Nonetheless, I wish them continued success.”      Deen’s new rep could not be reached last night, with a staffer at her office telling us, “She is on the Paula Deen cruise.” The chef’s Web site said Celebrity Cruises’ Eclipse would be a “tasty journey” in the Caribbean with a group buffet dinner, a cooking demo and a personal photo with Deen (one per family). ||||| Let Food Network chefs plan what's for dinner, with quick and easy recipes delivered to your inbox daily.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Having read many of the other reviews for this film on the IMDb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based. Upon this point I cannot comment, having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously. However, what I can say with certainty, is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass; Let's be honest here - this film is just so much fun! OK..so I must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character/s but let's put this into a clear perspective..do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960's Batman series does not remain faithful to the original DC comic book character? Or perhaps is there STILL unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of Flash Gordon was too much of a departure from the original series? The point is, yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm! Former Tarzan, Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and bears more than a passing resemblance to Gary Busey to boot!) and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles. Also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite Michael Berryman. Best scene? Far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke, lemonade and milk at a formal occasion! Also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein Savage tackles his nemesis Captain Seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen!  Priceless!

Summarize this article: Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders walks the picket line with Verizon protesters in New York on Wednesday, April 13. Verizon and the unions have been talking since last June over the company's plans to cut healthcare and pension-related benefits over a three-year period. (Reuters)      NEW YORK — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made two shows of solidarity with labor unions, picking up the endorsement of the local Transport Workers Union and rallying with Communications Workers of America members who are on strike against Verizon.      The presidential candidate, who has spent days rallying voters and CWA shop stewards in New York, started off at the Brooklyn offices of TWU Local 100. In 2008, its national organization endorsed John Edwards, then Barack Obama. This time, said the union's president, John Samuelsen, members realized that “business-as-usual politics is not going to give us the jolt we need” and got behind Sanders.      “We all know in this room that you don’t have a great and growing middle class unless you have a great and growing trade union movement,” Sanders said. “And it is no secret that there have been fierce attacks against the trade union movement for the last number of decades, and in fact, you could argue that it is the trade unions of today that are the last lines of defense against a vicious corporate agenda that is working hard to destroy the middle class.”      [Verizon’s workers on strike after impasse over contract talks]      At times during the endorsement event, a few boisterous members of the union tried to start a chant: “Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, 2016 is Bernie time!” When he wrapped, Sanders was swarmed by supporters, including one who told him to “kick some a—“ in the April 19 New York primary.      “I believe we're gonna win here in New York City, and we're gonna win here in New York state,” Sanders said.      Leaving through a back door, Sanders headed to a Verizon protest on Flatbush Avenue. Surrounded by Secret Service agents and moving briskly from his motorcade to a speech site, Sanders was followed for three blocks by a man who kept shouting “I love you, Bernie!” Asked if he was “excited” to be there, Sanders turned the subject immediately to the workers’ grievance.      “This is about a company that wants to take health-care benefits away from its workers, but somehow they have enough money to pay 20 million a year,” Sanders said. “These workers are standing up against injustice, and I stand with them.”      A cheer went up as Sanders approached the protest. “We’ve got a champion who’s fighting for us,” said Christopher Shelton, CWA’s president. “Bernie Sanders!”      Addressing the strikers as “brothers and sisters,” Sanders again condemned Verizon for its chief executive's pay and reluctance to pay the benefits the union had asked for.      “This is just another major American corporation trying to destroy the lives of working Americans,” Sanders said. “Today you are standing up not just for Verizon workers; you’re standing up for millions of Americans who don’t have a union … on behalf of every worker in America, who is facing the same kind of pressure: Thank you. We’re gonna win this thing!”      Sanders left the stage, pausing briefly for photos, then working a makeshift ropeline — actually a metal gate — with more than his usual aplomb. A few minutes later, he was back in the motorcade, with no more public events planned until a Wednesday night rally in Washington Square.      Meanwhile, Sanders was declaring another kind of solidarity — with a trio of Democratic congressional candidates. They included Zephyr Teachout, an author, academic and surprisingly strong 2014 candidate for governor of New York who is now seeking a seat in the Hudson Valley.      \\"When we talk about a political revolution, we also need to have people in Congress who aren't beholden to special interests,\\" Sanders wrote in his Teachout letter. \\"Zephyr literally wrote the book on political corruption. She understands better than anybody how special interests try to buy off politicians, and she's dedicated her life to fixing our broken political system.\\"      Teachout, like Sanders, was in the midst of a solidarity rally with striking Verizon workers.      We need more people to build out FiOS. But Verizon wants to slash jobs. Proud to stand with CWA. #verizonstrike pic.twitter.com/H2jk2MB9iX — Zephyr Teachout (@ZephyrTeachout) April 13, 2016 ||||| Photo      About 36,000 Verizon workers went on strike early Wednesday after the communications company failed to reach an agreement with unions representing workers for its wireline operations.      Verizon has said that consumers will be mostly unaffected because it has trained thousands of nonunion employees since last year to fill in for those who walk the picket line. Union workers counter that the strike will impair Verizon’s ability to deliver quality customer service, including service calls and equipment installations.      Here’s a guide to which consumers may be affected, who won’t and how any disruption might manifest itself.      Which services will be affected?      The unions generally represent workers for Verizon’s wireline operations, which include the company’s landline, high-speed Internet and television services. These services are mostly available only in the Northeast, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island and the region from southern New York to Virginia. Verizon offers home wireline services in parts of nine states, serving about 15 million phone lines. The unionized workers perform a range of tasks, like fixing a phone line that’s out of service, installing new phone and broadband Internet lines, or fielding customer support calls.      Union workers say they plan to picket some Verizon Wireless stores, but only a small number of those employees are part of the unions.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      In other words, subscribers to Verizon’s cellular phone and data services should not notice any changes. There should be no major difference when you call Verizon Wireless or go into a retail store with questions about your cellphone bill, data usage or upgrading to a new smartphone, for example.      How might wireline services be affected by the strike?      Verizon says consumers need not worry about the potential strike. “We went through very extensive, good training and we’re very confident that we’re more than ready to meet the needs of our customers,” said Raymond McConville, a Verizon spokesman.      But judging from numbers alone, Verizon’s wireline customers can reasonably expect a deterioration in customer service quality. Even with preparation, the company said it had trained only upward of 10,000 employees to fill in for the nearly 36,000 workers who went on strike. In addition, many unionized workers who are striking have been doing this type of work for far longer than the one year that Verizon has trained nonunion workers to fill in.      “There will almost certainly be some functions which may be slower or unavailable during the strike, because they require specialized skills or there just aren’t sufficient alternative resources available to fill all functions,” said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research.      Why is Verizon tightening the belt on wireline services?      Revenue for Verizon’s wireless business has grown healthily, whereas sales in its wireline business are shrinking slightly. For wireline services, Verizon focused on building out a strong customer base in the Northeast, but it sold its wireline assets in other states, including California, Florida and Texas.      In other words, Verizon has a small, concentrated wireline business compared with its nationwide wireless service, and it is putting more money into wireless resources.      How long could services be disrupted?      Indefinitely. Verizon’s unionized workers have not specified how long they might go on strike, so it could last hours, days, weeks or even months.      Will this affect my utility bill?      Mr. McConville said the strike would have no effect on consumers’ bills. ||||| Summary:","output":"Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) displayed solidarity with labor unions in New York as he gained the endorsement of the local Transport Workers Union and participated in a rally with Communications Workers of America (CWA) members who are striking against Verizon.

Reading improves your brain's mental flexibility, an important part of memory retention, by stimulating your entire mind and keeping every part of your brain active.  You don't need to read an entire book a day. At least 15-20 minutes of continuous reading can give you the mental benefits you need to be more intelligent. Listening to audio books is a convenient way to read every day. Reading more fiction will help you become better able to empathize with other people and view the world from their perspective, because novels and short stories encourage you to understand the motivations and points of view of multiple characters. The ability to understand other people requires a high degree of emotional intelligence, and fiction is an easy way to improve yours. Fiction also improves your cognitive flexibility by mentally placing you in different situations and settings, allowing you to imagine how you would respond. Reading the news keeps you informed and a steady diet of national, local, and international news will make you smarter, sharper, and more intelligent. Whether it's a traditional newspaper or a news app on your smartphone or tablet, aim to read at least the latest headlines for the day.  Don't neglect your local news– it's just as important to stay informed about what's going on in your community as it is to learn about what's going on in the broader world. Talk radio is a convenient way to absorb the day's news.","output":"Reading improves mental flexibility and memory retention, with benefits like enhanced emotional intelligence and cognitive flexibility gained from reading fiction and staying informed through news consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She tried to stand up but couldn't move. She had to leave the field in an ambulance as people cried for her. Hypothesis: After recovering, Sonia never went on a baseball field again. Choices:  (1). Yes  (2). It's impossible to say  (3). No","output":"Based on the given context, the hypothesis that Sonia never went on a baseball field again after recovering cannot be definitively confirmed or rejected. The context, while providing a detailed account of the incident that leads to Sonia being injured and the immediate subsequent events, does not give any information about her actions after recovery. Thus, the accurate answer is: (2). It's impossible to say However, it is important to note that the context indirectly allows one to infer that Sonia might have experienced fear, anxiety, or discomfort due to the traumatic nature of the incident. Her inability to distinguish faces and move after the injury, as well as the people crying for her, suggest that the event was both emotionally and physically distressing. From this perspective, one could argue that it is plausible that Sonia may have struggled with overcoming the emotional and psychological barriers associated with playing baseball again.  However, without further information about Sonia's recovery process, her emotional state, and her subsequent actions, it remains impossible to say for certain if the hypothesis is true. It could also be the case that Sonia recovered fully and returned to the baseball field determined not to let her previous experience hold her back.

Given the question: The color of leaves on deciduous trees usually changes in the autumn season, and peachleaf willow is a deciduous tree. Given these facts, what does a peachleaf willow do in the autumn among the following options: - staying warm  - It expands  - Die  - Change colors  - Fall over  - Grow new flowers  - flowers  - spread flower seeds The answer is:","output":"The peachleaf willow (Salix amygdaloides) is a deciduous tree species native to North America. It is a member of the Salicaceae family and is named for its lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of a peach tree. As a deciduous tree, the peachleaf willow follows a seasonal lifecycle that involves shedding its leaves during autumn. Out of the given options, the answer is \\"Change colors.\\" In the autumn season, the peachleaf willow, like many other deciduous trees, undergoes a process wherein its leaves change color. This change is due to several factors – primarily, the decrease in sunlight hours and temperatures experienced during these months. As the amount of sunlight decreases, chlorophyll production begins to slow down. Chlorophyll is the pigment responsible for the green color of leaves and plays a critical role in photosynthesis, the process through which plants convert sunlight into energy. As chlorophyll levels drop, other pigments present in the leaves, such as carotenoids and anthocyanins, become more visible. These pigments are responsible for the yellow, orange, red, and purple hues commonly associated with autumn foliage. The gradual loss of chlorophyll in the leaves triggers a process called abscission. This process helps the tree remove its leaves efficiently to conserve energy and water during the colder months. Abscission starts with the formation of a specialized cell layer known as the abscission zone at the base of the leaf stem. As the cells in this layer gradually break down, the connection between the leaf and the tree weakens, eventually causing the leaf to fall off. The other options listed, such as staying warm, expanding, dying, falling over, growing new flowers, flowering, or spreading flower seeds, do not specifically apply to the peachleaf willow during the autumn season. These processes might either occur during other times in the tree's life cycle or not at all. In conclusion, a peachleaf willow's primary activity in the autumn season is that its leaves change colors. This occurs as a part of the tree's seasonal cycle and physiological adaptations to conserve energy and water during the colder months. The tree prepares to shed its leaves and enter a dormant state, resting until warmer temperatures and increased sunlight return in the spring."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Information:  - Armen Grigoryan is a singer/songwriter, artist, and the front man (and main songwriter) of \\"Krematorij\\" (\\"Crematorium\\") Russian rock-band.  - The desires, wants, and thinking of the majority of the people  or the collective opinion of the people of a society or state on an issue or problem  is called public opinion.  The English term \\"public opinion\\" dates back to the seventeenth century work by John Locke, \\"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\\", which contains an early consideration of the importance of public opinion in the ordering of politics. The term was derived from the French word \\"l'opinion\\", which was first used in 1588 by Michel de Montaigne.  - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\")   - Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek  (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from  (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\").  - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016.

Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - Krematorij (Russian \\"\\" - \\"Crematorium\\") is a Russian rock group. The group is considered one of the best concert performing teams in Russia, known for its masterly rock-n-roll. Formed in Moscow in 1983, Krematorij gained quick recognition, achieved the status of a legend of Russian Rock-n-Roll and after 30 years on stage continues to delight its audiences throughout the former Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Germany, Israel and the United States. The groups front man (and main song writer) is Armen Grigoryan.  - Agon (Classical Greek ) is an ancient Greek term for a struggle or contest. This could be a contest in athletics, in chariot or horse racing, or in music or literature at a public festival in ancient Greece.  - Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (AD). Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire.  - How to Find the Ideal ( Ukrainian :    , Kak nayti ideal ) is a 2007 Ukrainian comedy directed by Vera Yakovenko and starring Armen Grigoryan .

Negative Title: 'Ocean's Desperation' Review: 'Ocean's Desperation' is a feeble attempt at creating an enthralling heist film that ultimately fizzles out, making it a disappointing watch for audiences. Directed by an amateur, who rather ironically drowns in the vast pool of clichés and plot holes, the film takes its inspiration from a number of previous heist films but never manages to steal the spotlight. The premise of the film centers around a ragtag group of criminals who band together to pull off a seemingly impossible robbery. While this initially sparks some intrigue, the weak and underdeveloped characters make it nearly impossible for the viewers to stay invested. Instead of sharing the thrill of a fast-paced, high-stakes crime, 'Ocean's Desperation' ultimately feels like a sluggish, monotonous slog. The performances by the ensemble cast leave much to be desired amid a convoluted plot ridden with unnecessary twists. The actors, much like the director, are unable to save the sinking ship of 'Ocean's Desperation', delivering stale and uninspired portrayals of their respective characters. This is further exacerbated by the weak dialogues, which lack the wit and punchiness that a good heist film demands. Moreover, the cinematography only serves to highlight the inadequacies of the production as a whole. It appears as though the camera work was done with little foresight or vision, resulting in scene after scene of disjointed and unengaging visuals that continuously distract from the plot's momentum. The biggest letdown of the film is its ending, which instead of providing a sense of resolution, inevitably leads to an eye roll. It aspires to shock the audience with one final twist, but the contrived nature of the attempt only adds to the movie's overall underwhelming impact. In conclusion, 'Ocean's Desperation' proves to be a desperate attempt at resurrecting a popular genre but falls devastatingly short.

Soil protection plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy environment, sustainable agriculture, and the overall well-being of our planet. Several factors contribute to the significance of soil protection. Firstly, soil is a vital natural resource that provides essential nutrients, water, and air for the growth of plants. A diverse range of flora and fauna depend on the soil to survive, making it the foundation of ecosystems and biodiversity. By protecting soil, we also contribute to the preservation of various plant and animal species. Secondly, soil plays a significant role in maintaining water quality. Healthy soil can act as a filter, removing pollutants and reducing the contamination of water resources. This helps maintain clean water supplies for millions of people around the world, as well as preventing the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, soil protection aids in climate change mitigation. Soils can store immense quantities of carbon, acting as a carbon sink, which helps reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. When soil is degraded or eroded, stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Therefore, by safeguarding soil, we help combat global warming and its negative effects on the earth. Soil also plays a crucial role in food production and food security. Healthy soils enable farmers to grow nutritious and plentiful crops, which contribute to a stable global food supply. The loss of fertile soil through erosion, compaction, salinization, or other forms of degradation can severely impact agricultural productivity and threaten food security for millions of people. Moreover, soil protection contributes to the well-being of the economy. Soil conservation practices often result in increased agricultural yields and higher quality products, which in turn lead to economic growth. Additionally, protecting soil can help avoid the negative costs and consequences associated with soil degradation, such as the loss of arable land, increased flooding, and the necessary investments in remediation efforts. Overall, the protection of soil is vital for maintaining a healthy environment, preserving ecosystems and biodiversity, mitigating climate change, ensuring food security, and fostering economic growth. By valuing and prioritizing soil protection, we can contribute to a more sustainable future for our planet and future generations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Westlife were an Irish pop vocal group, formed in Dublin in 1998 and disbanded in 2012. Originally signed by Simon Cowell and managed by Louis Walsh, the group's line-up consisted of Nicky Byrne, Kian Egan, Mark Feehily, Shane Filan and Brian McFadden, who was a member until his departure in 2004. Westlife sold over 50 million records worldwide, a total that included studio albums, singles, video releases, and compilation albums. The group accumulated 14 number-one singles in the United Kingdom. The group released their eleventh UK No. 1 single, \\"Unbreakable\\" in 2002. Amidst rumours of a split, Westlife released their first greatest hits album in November that same year titled Unbreakable - The Greatest Hits Vol. 1, which zoomed all the way to No. 1 in the UK. The release was followed by the double A-side single \\"Tonight/Miss You Nights\\", which debuted at No. 3 in the UK. At this time, Because Films Inspire made a TV documentary titled \\"Wild Westlife\\", directed by Iain MacDonald and starred the group, featuring their daily life as musicians and their tour experiences. In 2003, Westlife went on their third world tour, The Greatest Hits Tour, shrugging off rumours of a split.  In September 2003, Westlife released \\"Hey Whatever\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the UK Charts. Their fourth studio album, Turnaround, was then released in November, earning the group another UK No. 1 album. \\"Mandy\\", a cover of the Barry Manilow hit, was released in November 2003. Their version won them their third Record of the Year award, in under five years. Their version of \\"Mandy\\" is also considered the single with the longest leap to the top (from No. 200 to No. 1) in UK music history. \\"Obvious\\" was released as the final single from the album, charting at #3.  On 9 March 2004, just three weeks prior to embarking on their fourth world tour, McFadden left the group to spend more time with his family and work on solo projects. On that day, a press conference was held where all the group's members were present, each giving emotional individual speeches. McFadden's final public performance as part of Westlife was at Newcastle upon Tyne's Powerhouse nightclub on 27 February 2004. He subsequently began a solo career, and reverted the spelling of his first name back to its original 'Brian'. He released his first solo single, \\"Real To Me\\", which entered the UK chart at No. 1 and soon after, he released his first solo album Irish Son under Sony Music. McFadden later released more singles, but only with moderate success.  Less than a month after McFadden's departure, the group kicked off their \\"Turnaround Tour\\".

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  I am facing a new situation today: The underwater fishing teams picked their spots early.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The San Diego Museum of Art is a fine arts museum located at 1450 El Prado in Balboa Park in San Diego, California that houses a broad collection with particular strength in Spanish art. The San Diego Museum of Art opened as The Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego on February 28, 1926, and changed its name to the San Diego Museum of Art in 1978. The official Balboa Park website calls the San Diego Museum of Art \\"the region's oldest and largest art museum\\". Nearly half a million people visit the museum each year.  - The Young Shepherdess is an 1885 painting by William - Adolphe Bouguereau ( 1825 -- 1905 ) . It is owned by the San Diego Museum of Art. This and similar images by the artist attracted collectors in Europe and America because of their nostalgic content . In such works the artist depicted a variety of poses and expressions , in this case showing the mild curiosity of the girl . In portraying a shepherdess Bouguereau is working within the pastoral mode or theme , as developed by ancient Greek and Hellenistic artists and poets . French painters who preceded him in this include Claude Lorrain , Poussin , and Watteau .  - William-Adolphe Bouguereau (November 30, 1825  August 19, 1905) was a French academic painter and traditionalist. In his realistic genre paintings he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of classical subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body. During his life he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work. As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the Impressionist avant-garde. By the early twentieth century, Bouguereau and his art fell out of favor with the public, due in part to changing tastes. In the 1980s, a revival of interest in figure painting led to a rediscovery of Bouguereau and his work. Throughout the course of his life, Bouguereau executed 822 known finished paintings, although the whereabouts of many are still unknown.  - San Diego (Spanish for \\"Saint Didacus\\") is a major city in California, United States. It is in San Diego County, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean in Southern California, approximately south of Los Angeles and immediately adjacent to the border with Mexico.

The reason for this choice is that 'The Young Shepherdess' is an 1885 painting by William-Adolphe Bouguereau, who was a French academic painter and traditionalist. His origin and the origin of his artwork are both connected to France, making it the country of origin for the subject 'The Young Shepherdess'. Although the San Diego Museum of Art, where the painting is currently housed, is located in California, United States, this does not change the painting's country of origin, which remains France due to the artist's nationality and the time and place of its creation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- World powers meeting Friday in Tunisia called for a political solution in Syria and what one diplomat called a \\"tsunami wave\\" of pressure to peel away internal support for the embattled regime of Bashar al-Assad. \\"We agreed on increasing the pressure on Assad, getting humanitarian aid in as quickly as possible and preparing for a democratic transition,\\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters. \\"That was my message, and that was the message of the chairman statement that reflected the consensus reached here.\\" That consensus was reached during a day of meetings by the \\"Friends of Syria\\" in the cradle of the Arab Spring, where participants laid out the groundwork for a political transition in Syria, not unlike the international planning that preceded the changes in Libya, where Moammar Gadhafi's regime was toppled last year. \\"To those OPTIONS: - Arab Spring who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - Assad who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - Bashar al-Assad who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - CNN who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - Clinton who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - Friends of Syria who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - Hillary Clinton who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - Homs who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - Libya who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - Moammar Gadhafi who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - Red Cross who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - Syria who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - Syrian who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - Tunis who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - Tunisia who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said. - U.S. who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said.","output":"- Syrian who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,\\" Clinton said.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Gaius Julius Caesar (; 12 or 13 July 100 BC - 15 March 44 BC), known by his cognomen Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. He is also known as a notable author of Latin prose. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. In 60 BC, Caesar sought election as consul for 59 BC, along with two other candidates. The election was sordid - even Cato, with his reputation for incorruptibility, is said to have resorted to bribery in favour of one of Caesar's opponents. Caesar won, along with conservative Marcus Bibulus.  Caesar was already in Crassus' political debt, but he also made overtures to Pompey. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds for a decade, so Caesar tried to reconcile them. The three of them had enough money and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the First Triumvirate (\\"rule of three men\\"), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia. Caesar also married again, this time Calpurnia, who was the daughter of another powerful senator.  Caesar proposed a law for redistributing public lands to the poor--by force of arms, if need be--a proposal supported by Pompey and by Crassus, making the triumvirate public. Pompey filled the city with soldiers, a move which intimidated the triumvirate's opponents. Bibulus attempted to declare the omens unfavourable and thus void the new law, but he was driven from the forum by Caesar's armed supporters. His bodyguards had their ceremonial axes broken, two high magistrates accompanying him were wounded, and he had a bucket of excrement thrown over him. In fear of his life, he retired to his house for the rest of the year, issuing occasional proclamations of bad omens. These attempts proved ineffective in obstructing Caesar's legislation. Roman satirists ever after referred to the year as \\"the consulship of Julius and Caesar.\\"  When Caesar was first elected, the aristocracy tried to limit his future power by allotting the woods and pastures of Italy, rather than the governorship of a province, as his military command duty after his year in office was over. With the help of political allies, Caesar later overturned this, and was instead appointed to govern Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) and Illyricum (southeastern Europe), with Transalpine Gaul (southern France) later added, giving him command of four legions. The term of his governorship, and thus his immunity from prosecution, was set at five years, rather than the usual one. When his consulship ended, Caesar narrowly avoided prosecution for the irregularities of his year in office, and quickly left for his province.  Caesar was still deeply in debt, but there was money to be made as a governor, whether by extortion or by military adventurism. Caesar had four legions under his command, two of his provinces bordered on unconquered territory, and parts of Gaul were known to be unstable. Some of Rome's Gallic allies had been defeated by their rivals at the Battle of Magetobriga, with the help of a contingent of Germanic tribes. The Romans feared these tribes were preparing to migrate south, closer to Italy, and that they had warlike intent. Caesar raised two new legions and defeated these tribes.  In response to Caesar's earlier activities, the tribes in the north-east began to arm themselves. Caesar treated this as an aggressive move and, after an inconclusive engagement against the united tribes, he conquered the tribes piecemeal. Meanwhile, one of his legions began the conquest of the tribes in the far north, directly opposite Britain. During the spring of 56 BC, the Triumvirs held a conference, as Rome was in turmoil and Caesar's political alliance was coming undone. The Lucca Conference renewed the First Triumvirate and extended Caesar's governorship for another five years. The conquest of the north was soon completed, while a few pockets of resistance remained. Caesar now had a secure base from which to launch an invasion of Britain.  In 55 BC, Caesar repelled an incursion into Gaul by two Germanic tribes, and followed it up by building a bridge across the Rhine and making a show of force in Germanic territory, before returning and dismantling the bridge. Late that summer, having subdued two other tribes, he crossed into Britain, claiming that the Britons had aided one of his enemies the previous year, possibly the Veneti of Brittany. His intelligence information was poor, and although he gained a beachhead on the coast, he could not advance further, and returned to Gaul for the winter. He returned the following year, better prepared and with a larger force, and achieved more. He advanced inland, and established a few alliances. However, poor harvests led to widespread revolt in Gaul, which forced Caesar to leave Britain for the last time.  While Caesar was in Britain his daughter Julia, Pompey's wife, had died in childbirth. Caesar tried to re-secure Pompey's support by offering him his great-niece in marriage, but Pompey declined. In 53 BC Crassus was killed leading a failed invasion of the east. Rome was on the brink of civil war. Pompey was appointed sole consul as an emergency measure, and married the daughter of a political opponent of Caesar. The Triumvirate was dead.  Though the Gallic tribes were just as strong as the Romans militarily, the internal division among the Gauls guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar. Vercingetorix's attempt in 52 BC to unite them against Roman invasion came too late. He proved an astute commander, defeating Caesar in several engagements, but Caesar's elaborate siege-works at the Battle of Alesia finally forced his surrender. Despite scattered outbreaks of warfare the following year, Gaul was effectively conquered. Plutarch claimed that during the Gallic Wars the army had fought against three million men (of whom one million died, and another million were enslaved), subjugated 300 tribes, and destroyed 800 cities.  While he was still campaigning in Spain, the Senate began bestowing honours on Caesar. Caesar had not proscribed his enemies, instead pardoning almost all, and there was no serious public opposition to him. Great games and celebrations were held in April to honour Caesar's victory at Munda. Plutarch writes that many Romans found the triumph held following Caesar's victory to be in poor taste, as those defeated in the civil war had not been foreigners, but instead fellow Romans. On Caesar's return to Italy in September 45 BC, he filed his will, naming his grandnephew Gaius Octavius (Octavian, later known as Augustus Caesar) as his principal heir, leaving his vast estate and property including his name. Caesar also wrote that if Octavian died before Caesar did, Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus would be the next heir in succession. In his will, he also left a substantial gift to the citizens of Rome.  During his early career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and dysfunctional the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery had broken down under the weight of imperialism, the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. With a weak central government, political corruption had spiralled out of control, and the status quo had been maintained by a corrupt aristocracy, which saw no need to change a system that had made its members rich.  Between his crossing of the Rubicon in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the Republic. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. Finally, he wanted to knit together all of the provinces into a single cohesive unit.  The first goal was accomplished when Caesar defeated Pompey and his supporters. To accomplish the other two goals, he needed to ensure that his control over the government was undisputed, so he assumed these powers by increasing his own authority, and by decreasing the authority of Rome's other political institutions. Finally, he enacted a series of reforms that were meant to address several long-neglected issues, the most important of which was his reform of the calendar.

Taiwan  was first populated by Austronesian people and was colonized by the Dutch, who had arrived in 1623. The Kingdom of Tungning, lasting from 1661 to 1683, was the first Han Chinese government to rule Taiwan. From 1683, the Qing Dynasty ruled Taiwan as a prefecture and in 1875 divided the island into two prefectures. In 1885 the island was made into a separate Chinese province to speed up development in this region. In the aftermath of the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan and Penghu were ceded by the Qing Dynasty to Japan in 1895. Japanese troops in Taiwan surrendered to the Republic of China at end of World War II, putting Taiwan under a Chinese government again after 50 years of Japanese rule. The ROC would then claim sovereignty on the basis of the Qing dynasty's administration, Cairo Declaration, Potsdam Declaration, and Japanese Instrument of Surrender, but this became contested by pro-independence groups in subsequent years due to different perceptions of the said documents' legality. Upon losing the Chinese civil war in 1949, the ROC government retreated to Taipei, and kept control over a few islands along the coast of mainland China and in the South China Sea. The People's Republic of China  was established in mainland China on 1 October 1949, claiming to be the successor to the ROC. Quemoy, Matsu and Wuchiu on the coast of Fukien, Taiping and Pratas in the South China Sea, are part of the ROC's present territory, but were not ceded to Japan.

Article: I discovered the power of fear when I became stuck to my driveway, as if my feet were crazy--glued to the cement .As much as I tried, I could not move them. The realization that my daughters were playing in Nancy's house, just one-half block away, paralyzed  my legs, making me unable to move when I neared the end of our driveway. Dense, black smoke was rising from behind the Sycamore Maple trees on the other side of the street and was enveloping three houses, making them barely visible. Nancy's house was one of them. I tried to call out for my daughters hoping to see them run safely to my arms, but my voice was also stuck - stuck in my throat with no intention of coming out. There I stood, helpless, paralyzed and silenced by fear, unable to protect the two little girls I loved more than even I had realized. Although trapped in a body that couldn't move or speak, I could still hear. I could hear other mothers anxiously calling their children. I could hear a frightening silence that covered the neighborhood instead of the usual happy voices of children. And, finally, I could hear the alarm of the fire engine. As the alarm announced, \\"We're on our way,\\" it instantly dissolved the crazy glue that had held my feet to the cement and it unlocked the soundproof box that had silenced my voice. I was free to make sure my daughters were safe. As I continued down the driveway, two little girls, my two little girls, ran toward me from across the street.

Here is a news article: Discovery turns out to be shipwreck      Published: January 23, 2015 7:56AM      JEFF TER HAR — For The Daily Astorian Part of a ship’s keel was discovered last November by Seaside residents Ben Hidy and Travis Trapani.      JEFF TER HAR — For The Daily Astorian The best environment to preserve a ship recently discovered buried in sand on the Seaside beach is under the sand, says the state’s archaeologist.      JEFF TER HAR — For The Daily Astorian The wood found two months ago by two Seaside residents comes from a ship, according to the state archaeologist. More tests may lead to the ship’s identity.      The state archeologist says the wood found last November under the sand in Seaside was, indeed, a ship.      SEASIDE — What three friends discovered while metal-detecting in the dunes last November is indeed a shipwreck.      Now the question is: which one?      “We have over 2,000 wrecks at the mouth of the Columbia (River),” said Oregon’s State Archaeologist, Dennis Griffin. “So it’s interesting if we can figure out what wreck this is because we don’t have it on record.”      In hopes of recovering the ship’s identity, Griffin traveled to the site near Avenue L Jan. 13 and took two wood samples from the boat’s 21-foot keel, then sent them to Eugene for testing. The results, expected in a few weeks, will determine the type of lumber used in construction and, in turn, narrow the ship’s potential points of origin.      Hypothetically “Let’s say it’s Douglas fir,” Griffin said. “If that’s what it is, that’s usually used in more West Coast shipping.”      Should that be the case, lost ships from abroad — and even the East Coast — would be crossed off the list of candidates.      The tests being performed will not account for age, though Christopher Dewey, a volunteer at the Columbia River Maritime Museum, examined the site and estimated that the ship was built in the 20th century.      “It’s really a process of elimination,” Griffin said. “You look at reported wrecks in the area and try to determine would this size of an artifact be from one ship rather than another? Trying to nail that down to one particular wreck, that can be very difficult.”      That is, in part, because where a ship was known to sink and where it may wash up can be vastly different.      “We’ve known boats to hit a sandbar off the Columbia but found the wrecks had floated down 20-some miles or so to Arch Cape,” Griffin said. Historically, lost ships are more likely not to be found, he said.      “Over 3,000 wrecks are known to be off the coast of Oregon,” he said. “We have the locations of a little over 300 in our database.”      Regardless of whether or not the wreck beneath the dunes in Seaside is identified, it’s likely to remain where it is — buried in the sand.      “Once a piece of a ship that’s been in a water-logged state leaves the beach, or leaves that environment, it will dry and fall apart,” Griffin said. “It would need to be placed in a tank ­— in a plastic solution — that protects it. I don’t know of any place on the West Coast that has a tank large enough to hold that piece. This piece of wood is huge. It would cost tens-upon-tens-of-thousands of dollars to protect that wood.”      “The best environment it could be in is right where it is now,” he said. “It’s being preserved right there.”      The worth of the find, he added, is purely informational.      “We place the value, archaeologywise, on the historical value,” he said. “What those sites have is a potential to tell us more about our past.”      “Shipwrecks tie us more into the land that we now live in,” he added. “Whether it’s the logging industry, whether it’s commercial trade or fishing trade, whatever it was, it’s all important.”      “The wreck itself might be important because, perhaps, it was a fishing trawler that sunk in a storm in the 1930s,” Griffin said. “If so, it tells us more about the expanse of people going out there to harvest fish to feed the growing cities.”      “So it’s about historical value,” he said. “We don’t place monetary value on these sites.” ||||| SEASIDE, Ore. (AP) — Three friends discovered a shipwreck on the northern Oregon coast last fall. The ship that wrecked is a mystery the state archaeologist wants to solve.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: One of the most significant financial problems that countries will face in the coming decades is the amount they will spend to support the elderly. This will be exacerbated by increased debt-to-GDP ratios in most of the 49 countries where old age costs will be the highest percentage of GDP, according to the Standard & Poor’s Global Aging Report. Of the 49 countries, 32 are members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and 17 are large, emerging market nations.      The Standard & Poor’s Global Aging report emphasizes: “No other force is likely to shape the future of national economic health, public finances, and policy making as the irreversible rate at which the world’s population is aging. The problem has been long observed and is well understood.” The analysis adds, “U.N. figures show the proportion of the world’s population aged over 65 is set to more than double by 2050, to 16.2% from 7.6% currently.”      “The elderly” refers to people who are over 65. These people are, for the most part, retired and not working. The eventual burden of supporting them will become impossible to sustain in some countries, and in many it nearly is already.      These huge debt loads of many countries have risen as nations have spent far more than their tax receipts, and the trouble can no longer be remedied by GDP growth as it often was in the latter half of the 20th Century. Few developed nations have rapid enough GDP growth to decrease deficits and bring down national debt. That leaves higher taxes and spending cuts as the only means to close budget gaps.      Care for the elderly the US is at the core of entitlement reform. Projections by the Congressional Budget Office and think tanks show that Social Security and Medicare costs will be overwhelming in a few decades. Defense cuts and reductions in discretionary federal government spending will not be enough to offset the cost of entitlement programs, which are growing more quickly than other government expenses. According to Standard and Poor’s, the United States will undergo a greater increase in health care spending for the elderly than any other developed nation. The battle over entitlement reforms has begun already. People who are in their prime working years face the possibility that the payments they receive from Social Security will be less than those their parents received or are receiving.      The analysis of the problem takes into account: (1) the amount spent as a percentage of GDP on health care for elderly, (2) pension spending, (3) unemployment benefits for the elderly, and (4) long-term care. Health care and long-term care are primarily medical costs. Pension costs, which include early retirement and disability pensions, cover primarily the expenses of daily living. Unemployment costs cover the elderly who do not have pensions or other means of independent financial support.      Each country’s burden is based on current GDP growth and for the next four decades, net government debt, debt as a percentage of GDP, and the S&P sovereign credit rating of the 49 countries.      24/7 Wall St. chose the ten nations which currently spend the most on care for the elderly as a percentage of GDP. Most of these counties face a grim financial future as the number of old people grows more quickly than their country’s GDP. This gap will be a primary driver of increases in national deficits, which in turn will drive national debt higher.      There have been no acceptable solutions suggested for these problems. All of citizens of nations on this list refuse to have their retirement benefits lowered. The issues can be deferred, but the process that will increase costs will eventually push indebted nations to the point where sovereign borrowing will become unsustainable. Then, like Greece, many of the nations analyzed here will face years of austerity forced on them by creditors. ||||| One of the most significant financial problems that countries will face in the coming decades is the amount they will spend to support the elderly.

Now let's say you need to use some money from it to buy candies for your grandpa and grandma, because they can't work anymore and need your help. But what if you start having more grandparents than the money you can save for their candies? That's where a big problem starts, right? That's what's happening in the world according to a report. Countries are having trouble because they have more older people, like your grandparents, who they have to take care of. These older folks, mostly above 65, are not working anymore. They rely on the countries to take care of them which can be quite costly and can lead to big money problems for the countries.  Just like your piggy bank might not have enough money to buy candies for all your grandparents, countries might not have enough money to care for all the older people. The sad part is these countries often borrow money to cope with it, and it becomes a big debt, kind of like owing a lot of candies to your friend because you took more than you could pay back. In the United States, they are thinking about how to solve this problem. They are considering changing how Social Security and Medicare (kind of like a safety net that helps people when they get old or sick) work. This way, they might be able to save some money. Yet, no solution seems to make everyone happy.  What we know for sure is that this problem is serious and needs a solution, otherwise lots of nations might end up not having enough money to take care of their people, especially the elderly. Just like if you run out of candies, you won't be able to give any to your grandparents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pregnancy itself is a natural and normal physiological process, and it should not directly affect the mitotic process in cells. However, various external factors, such as environmental influences, stress, or health issues that could arise during pregnancy, might indirectly impact mitosis by causing cellular stress or DNA damage. These factors could disrupt the normal regulation of the cell cycle and hinder the correct progression of mitosis.

I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Imagine a house that keeps itself warm in the wintertime. Think of the savings in terms of fuel bills and unfriendly emissions. Such houses in fact exist, called \\"passive houses\\". The concept of these highly energy-efficient buildings took root in the 1990s, before slowly consolidating as a niche construction   concept in the 2000s. Are passive houses now actively moving into the mainstream as sustainable buildings? For Brian McGarry, an economics lecturer who built a family house based on passive housing criteria in the Pyrenees this year, the arguments look convincing. As his first full winter in the low energy house draws in, we asked him to keep us informed. Do passive houses work? I had never heard of a passive house in February 2012, when I purchased a plot of land. Nor did I expect that I would be persuaded to build a pre-constructed, custom-designed house based on energy-efficient passive house criteria. It promised to be easier and quicker to build, cheaper to run, and more comfortable to live in. The objective was to incorporate the fundamental concepts of passive energy management into my project: an airtight and highly insulated building envelope; large southfacing double or triple-glazed windows (if possible, filled with argon gas) that passively capture the energy of the sun; a heat recovery ventilation system to provide fresh air; and a simple, low-cost heating system consisting of a modern wood-burning stove, a bathroom heater and a portable radiator backup for when the sun doesn't shine and temperatures decline. No significant limitations were placed on the design, and it had excellent environmental credentials. Moreover, the cost was no more than a conventional build. After six months in use, the house is proving to be both cheap to run and remarkably comfortable-staying cool in the hot summer was effortless, as long as the windows were shuttered or shaded from the sun. Nowstaying warm in the cold, high-altitude December climate also seems easy, so far. Winter arrived in force in the... Question: How did Brian McGarry find his self-built passive house?

In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.  I am facing a new situation today: two buildings had different tenants. Building Y had many seniors over 65 years of age, and building X had individuals under 65 years old.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which building had fewer people that have retired from work? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the background article.  From the article, we can gather that most people over 65 have retired from work.  Step 2: Apply the information to the new situation. In the new situation, we have two buildings: Building Y with many seniors over 65 years of age, and Building X with individuals under 65 years old. Step 3: Compare the retirement rates in both buildings. Since most people over 65 have retired, there is a higher likelihood that a larger proportion of tenants in Building Y, with seniors over 65 years old, have retired. On the other hand, Building X has individuals under 65 years old, which means the likelihood of them being retired is lower. Step 4: Determine the answer to the question. By considering the information in the background article and the new situation, we can conclude that Building X likely had fewer people that have retired from work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It appears that the person reviewing the book has a strong interest and experience in reading books within the horror genre, as they mention having \\"read them all.\\" In this context, their statement that this particular book is the \\"scariest book\\" they have ever read can be perceived as high praise for the book, showcasing its effectiveness in causing an intense and frightful experience for the reader. This effectively indicates that the book is successful in achieving its goal of provoking fear within its audience. Additionally, the reviewer emphasizes the book's lingering impact after reading, mentioning that it \\"will keep you awake after you put it down for the night.\\" This further reinforces the positive sentiment in the review, as it highlights the book's powerful capacity to stay with the reader even after they've stopped reading. Such a statement would be particularly appealing to fans of the horror genre, as this lasting-effect is often a sought-after characteristic within the realm of scary books. However, it's worth noting that the reviewer's statement at the beginning - \\"This book is hard to read if you're in the house alone\\" - could be perceived as a mild drawback for some potential readers. People who might be easily frightened or uncomfortable with horror might take this statement as a warning for the strong intensity of fear the book provokes. However, for seasoned horror fans, this statement could actually heighten the appeal of the book, indicating that it provides a genuinely terrifying experience. In conclusion, the provided review conveys a positive sentiment highlighting the book's effectiveness in inducing fear and its ability to leave a lasting impact on the reader. While the reviewer acknowledges the intensity of the book's fear-inducing capabilities, which could potentially be seen as a warning for readers who are not fans of horror, the review overall praises the book's success in achieving its primary goal as a scary story and is likely to entice horror enthusiasts seeking an intense and provocative reading experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Prime Minister: Narendra Modi.    - The sentence identifies Narendra Modi as the current Prime Minister of India. Indeed, Narendra Modi has been serving as the Prime Minister since May 26, 2014, and is also a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). As the Prime Minister, he is responsible for shaping and implementing the policies and programs of the Indian Government and overseeing the executive branch. This fact is essential as it provides information about the current political leadership in India. In summary, the sentence provides valuable information related to the country of India, focusing on a cultural site (Amdavad ni Gufa), its location within India, and important historical and current political figures (T S Thakur and Narendra Modi)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A-Teens (stylized as A*Teens) were a Swedish pop music group from Stockholm, Sweden, formed by Niklas Berg in 1998 as an ABBA tribute band called ABBA Teens and later renamed A-Teens. The band members were Marie Serneholt, Amit Sebastian Paul, Dhani Lennevald and Sara Lumholdt. The band's debut album became a success around the world and in 2001 it was reported that the band had sold 6 million albums worldwide. After six years together, the band announced they would take a break in 2004 after the release of their Greatest Hits album. The band's second album, entitled \\"Teen Spirit\\", featured a compilation of tracks that were not ABBA covers and when it was finally released on 26 February 2001, it debuted at number two in the Swedish Charts. This pop sensation hit reached the top ten in other countries and entered at number eighty-three on the World Charts, number thirteen on the European Albums Chart, number fourteen on CNN's WorldBeat Album Charts and peaked at number fifty in the United States selling over 60,000 copies in its first two weeks, ensuring Gold Status for sales exceeding the 500,000 copies in the United States alone. Prior to the release of the album, the A-Teens became one of the first bands to broadcast one of their shows on MSN's Websites.  The UK releases were delayed due to A-Teens' failure with their previous album in that country. When \\"Upside Down\\" was released there in May 2001, it became their biggest hit in the country. The single peaked at number ten in the United Kingdom becoming their only top ten hit in that country. The album was delayed and released after the second single, \\"Halfway Around The World\\" in late October 2001. The single barely made the top thirty and the album did not chart in the top 75.  Before they started their concert tour in the U.S. the band went to promote their album to Asia, with stops in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia where they did show for MTV Asia and Thailand, with great success, especially in the former where Coca-Cola signed the band to become the face of the brand there and promote, \\"We were the first international artists ever to appear on a soda can there. They printed 15 million of them; we went home with ten!\\" Remembers Sara, The cans were distributed around the country that year. Also in 2001, the A-Teens performed as top billing during the Radio Disney Live! 2001 World Tour in Chicago and Philadelphia markets.  The group promoted their album with a forty-three-date tour with Aaron Carter around the U.S. Back in Europe, the band toured with No Angels in Germany. By the end of 2001, Teen Spirit went on to sell over 1 million copies worldwide and were invited by Walt Disney/Buena Vista to record the European soundtrack for the movie \\"The Princess Diaries\\". As the movie had already been released in North and South America, the movie was set to be released in Europe in the winter 2001. \\"Heartbreak Lullaby\\" a song written by Cathy Dennis (famous for writing Kylie Minogue's number one hit, \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\") and Kasmanaut, the video was shot in Germany in late October, in the middle of their tour.

Would \\"A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"It is important to address this sensitive topic cautiously. I understand that your question is about the age of a child in relation to pedophilic crimes, and whether the provided statement about research done since the 1980s is a reasonable answer.  Firstly, let me clarify that pedophilia is a psychiatric disorder and not a crime in itself. It is when an adult experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children, typically aged under 13. However, acting upon these urges and engaging in sexual activities with children is a criminal offense, commonly known as child sexual abuse. Now, regarding your question about the age of a child in pedophilic crimes, the age can vary depending on the jurisdiction. Different countries have different age limits defining minors, usually ranging from under 16 to under 18 years of age. However, pedophilic attraction usually targets prepubescent children, typically younger than 13 years old.  Regarding the statement \\"A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s,\\" it is reasonable to say that efforts to understand and address this issue have increased since the 1980s. However, this statement does not directly answer the question about the age of a child in relation to pedophile crimes. Instead, it provides information about the timeline of research into the issue without addressing the specific details about the age of the children involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1782, Marshall won a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates, in which he served until 1789 and again from 1795 to 1796. The Virginia General Assembly elected him to serve on the Council of State later in the same year. In 1785, Marshall took up the additional office of Recorder of the Richmond City Hustings Court.  In 1788, Marshall was selected as a delegate to the Virginia convention responsible for ratifying or rejecting the United States Constitution, which had been proposed by the Philadelphia Convention a year earlier. Together with James Madison and Edmund Randolph, Marshall led the fight for ratification. He was especially active in defense of Article III, which provides for the Federal judiciary. His most prominent opponent at the ratification convention was Anti-Federalist leader Patrick Henry. Ultimately, the convention approved the Constitution by a vote of 89-79. Marshall identified with the new Federalist Party (which supported a strong national government and commercial interests), and opposed Jefferson's Republican Party (which advocated states' rights and idealized the yeoman farmer and the French Revolution).  Meanwhile, Marshall's private law practice continued to flourish. He successfully represented the heirs of Lord Fairfax in Hite v. Fairfax (1786), an important Virginia Supreme Court case involving a large tract of land in the Northern Neck of Virginia. In 1796, he appeared before the United States Supreme Court in another important case, Ware v. Hylton, a case involving the validity of a Virginia law providing for the confiscation of debts owed to British subjects. Marshall argued that the law was a legitimate exercise of the state's power; however, the Supreme Court ruled against him, holding that the Treaty of Paris in combination with the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution required the collection of such debts.  Henry Flanders in his biography of Marshall remarked that Marshall's argument in Ware v. Hylton \\"elicited great admiration at the time of its delivery, and enlarged the circle of his reputation.\\" Flanders also wrote that the reader \\"cannot fail to be impressed with the vigor, rigorous analysis, and close reasoning that mark every sentence of it.\\"  In 1795, Marshall declined Washington's offer of Attorney General of the United States and, in 1796, declined to serve as minister to France.  In 1797, Marshall accepted when President John Adams appointed him to a three-member commission to represent the United States to negotiate with France which, during the midst of its Revolutionary Wars, had seized neutral American merchant vessels. This had prompted the United States to appropriate funds to equip and man three frigates.  The other members of this commission were Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Elbridge Gerry. However, when the envoys arrived in October 1797, they were kept waiting for several days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister Talleyrand. After this, the diplomats were met by three of Talleyrand's agents. Each refused to conduct diplomatic negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, and another to the Republic of France. The Americans refused to negotiate on such terms. Marshall and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained. This diplomatic scandal became known as the XYZ Affair, inflaming anti-French opinion in the United States. Marshall arrived in New York on June 17. His handling of the affair, as well as public resentment toward the French, made him popular with the American public. He opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts, enacted by the Federalists in response to the crisis.  In 1798, Marshall declined a Supreme Court appointment, recommending Bushrod Washington, who would later become one of Marshall's staunchest allies on the Court. In 1799, Marshall reluctantly ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. Although his congressional district (which included the city of Richmond) favored the Democratic-Republican Party, Marshall won the race, in part due to his conduct during the XYZ Affair and in part due to the support of Patrick Henry. His most notable speech was related to the case of Thomas Nash (alias Jonathan Robbins), whom the government had extradited to Great Britain on charges of murder. Marshall defended the government's actions, arguing that nothing in the Constitution prevents the United States from extraditing one of its citizens.  On May 7, 1800, President Adams nominated Congressman Marshall as Secretary of War. However, on May 12, Adams withdrew the nomination, instead naming him Secretary of State, as a replacement for Timothy Pickering. Confirmed by the United States Senate on May 13, Marshall took office on June 6, 1800. As Secretary of State, Marshall directed the negotiation of the Convention of 1800, which ended the Quasi-War with France and brought peace to the nation.  Elected as a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830, John Marshall advanced his view that the electorate should be expanded in Virginia by the provision that any white male who had served in the War of 1812 or who would serve in the militia in the future defense of the country deserved the right to vote.  Fletcher v. Peck (1810) was the first case in which the Supreme Court ruled a state law unconstitutional, though the Court had long before voided a state law as conflicting with the combination of the Constitution together with a treaty (Marshall had represented the losing side in that 1796 case). In Fletcher, the Georgia legislature had approved a land grant, known as the Yazoo Land Act of 1795. It was then revealed that the land grant had been approved in return for bribes, and therefore voters rejected most of the incumbents; the next legislature repealed the law and voided all subsequent transactions (even honest ones) that resulted from the Yazoo land scandal. The Marshall Court held that the state legislature's repeal of the law was void because the sale was a binding contract, which according to Article I, Section 10, Clause I (the Contract Clause) of the Constitution, cannot be invalidated. Marshall emphasized that the rescinding act would seize property from individuals who had honestly acquired it, and transfer that property to the public without any compensation. He then expanded upon his own famous statement in Marbury about the province of the judiciary:  It is the peculiar province of the legislature to prescribe general rules for the government of society; the application of those rules to individuals in society would seem to be the duty of other departments.  Based on this separation of powers principle, Marshall questioned whether the rescinding act would be valid even if Georgia were a completely sovereign state independent of the federal Constitution. Ultimately, though, Marshall grounded the Court's opinion in the restrictions imposed by the federal Constitution. As in Marbury, this decision of the Court in Fletcher was unanimous. Answer this question \\"What was Marshall's involvement in this case?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Marshall's involvement in the case of Fletcher v. Peck (1810) was as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, in which he delivered the Court's opinion. The Marshall Court held that the state legislature's repeal of the law was void because the sale was a binding contract, which according to Article I, Section 10, Clause I (the Contract Clause) of the Constitution, cannot be invalidated.

Write a text based on this summary: clinton cracks down on teen smoking Text:","output":"Title: Clinton Takes a Stand Against Teen Smoking – A Protective Measure for Future Generations In an effort to combat the escalating number of teenagers who are taking up the habit of smoking, former President Bill Clinton has taken a decisive step to crack down on this dangerous trend. Recognizing the tremendous health risks and long-term consequences associated with smoking, Clinton's campaign is aimed at protecting the vulnerable teenage population, fostering a healthier future for generations to come. Faced with the alarming statistic that around 90% of smokers start before the age of 18, it has become increasingly clear that smoking is not just an adult problem. The teenage years are a critical period during which lifelong habits begin to form, and for many, this includes the development of a smoking addiction that will persist for years or even decades. The Clinton initiative begins by targeting the accessibility of cigarettes to young people. By pushing for stricter enforcement of the legal smoking age and demanding more rigorous identification checks at points of sale, the initiative aims to make it significantly more difficult for teenagers to obtain cigarettes. Retailers found in violation of these laws will face substantial fines and the potential loss of their tobacco sales license. Another important aspect of the initiative is educational outreach with a particular focus on preventive measures. Campaigns will target middle and high schools, where the habit often first takes root. With a combination of engaging presentations, age-appropriate materials, and testimonies from former smokers, young people will be equipped with the knowledge and tools necessary to resist the allure of smoking and make healthier choices. Educational programs will also focus on dispelling common myths about smoking, such as the idea that it aids in weight loss or relieves stress, thus eliminating common motivations for starting. Supporting this educational campaign, the Clinton initiative calls for stringent restrictions on cigarette advertising, especially in avenues that can easily reach young, impressionable minds. It has long been known that tobacco companies have purposely targeted youth with their advertising strategies, tapping into teenage rebellion, the desire to fit in, or the attractiveness of an \\"adult\\" vice. By limiting the visibility and reach of these advertisements, it becomes more difficult for tobacco companies to normalize or glamorize smoking among teenagers. Additionally, the crackdown will include a concerted effort to ensure the proper labeling of tobacco products, emphasizing the inclusion of clear, graphic warnings about the associated risks and potential health consequences. While many tobacco products currently include warning labels, they are often relegated to the small print or obscured by clever packaging. By making these warnings more prominent and visually arresting, the initiative will make it more difficult for teenagers to ignore or minimize the hazards of smoking. Finally, the Clinton campaign aims to work in tandem with existing public health and medical organizations to identify and support teenagers who are already struggling with nicotine addiction. By offering targeted intervention and counseling services, as well as medical assistance and resources, these efforts can help reverse the cycle of addiction and guide teens towards healthier choices and behaviors. With the Clinton crackdown on teen smoking, the fight against this deadly habit is receiving much-needed support and momentum. By implementing a multifaceted approach that includes education, regulation, and community support, the Clinton initiative endeavors to save lives, improve health outcomes, and ultimately, prevent future generations from succumbing to the devastating consequences of smoking."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Jeremy Kerr, a researcher at the University of Ottawa in Canada, and his colleagues analyzed more than 400,000 observations of bumblebee species collected in North America and Europe from 1975 to 2010. When the researchers recorded the locations of these bee populations, they found that many of the 67 species analyzed were moving northward from their southern limits while the northern edges of the bees' ranges are staying in place. What it results in is obvious. Bees have been paid more attention to in recent years, with populations of honeybees and bumblebees obviously declining in some parts of Europe. Previously, attention on the decline of bee populations has focused on causes including habitat loss, pesticide use and the spread of bee parasites . But the work by Kerr's team found something different. \\"For every species, there is one or two species declining and others that are not moving at all,\\" says Kerr. This shift has also been observed in other species, such as butterflies. But due to a new cause -- the rise of temperatures instead of total pesticide use, a change in land use or parasites, bumblebees -- unlike butterflies -- have failed to extend the northern boundaries of their ranges into the territory that is now habitable for them, so bumblebee species across Europe and North America are declining rapidly, the latest study led by Kerr's team finds. \\"Our data suggest that the new factor plays a leading, or perhaps the leading, role in this trend,\\" says Kerr. \\"This study shows that a fourth factor is also beginning to affect it. It is likely that the combined stresses from all of these pressures will have destructive impacts on bumblebees in the not-too-distant future,\\" says Dave Goulson, a bee researcher at the University of Sussex, Brighton, UK. Exactly what can be done to help bumblebees is not clear. Kerr's team suggests that relocating colonies might be an answer but Goulson says that because the insects are mobile they are capable of moving northwards if there is suitable habitat available. Question: Which statement may Goulson agree with? Options: A: Relocating bumblebees isn't much good. B: The findings of Kerr's study are doubtful. C: The future of bumblebees is still promising.

(March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) At Chicago O'Hare International Airport, a group of Marines have just returned to the US from Iraq. As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up.

Write some highlights for the following article: A doctor who abducted her six-year-old daughter and vanished in the wake of a marriage break-up has been told by a judge 'the courts will not give up'. Deputy High Court Judge Clive Heaton issued a warning nearly two years after Humma Dar, 39, disappeared with daughter Aamina Khan, who will be eight in July. The judge said it was impossible not to have sympathy for Aamina’s father Safraz Khan, 44, from Croydon, south London, who is also a doctor and had been given custody of the girl. Abduction: Judge Clive Heaton issued a warning nearly two years after Dar disappeared with her daughter Aamina. He said the search for Aamina and Dar - who vanished from Morden, south-west London, in August 2011 and are thought to be in Pakistan - had not reached its end. He was speaking at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London, where he gave permission for Aamina to be identified in media reports. 'The abduction of children is a very serious matter and the courts should and do pursue, locate and return such children to their rightful carers,' said the judge. Father and daughter: The judge added that it was impossible not to feel sympathy for Aamina's father Safraz Khan, who had been given custody of the child. 'The message must go out to those who. abduct children that the courts will not give up after a few months or. years just because no progress seems to have been made.' He added: 'This is not the end of the story so far as attempts to locate Aamina are concerned.' Mother: Humma Dar is thought to have taken her daughter Aamina to Pakistan after she abducted her. The judge said Dr Khan - who broke down during the hearing - was 'distressed and frustrated'. 'It is impossible not to have sympathy with the father,' he said. “I urge the father to continue to pursue all proper steps open to him to locate his daughter. Where the court can properly assist him in the search it will certainly do so.” The judge said Aamina had been visiting her mother when the pair vanished on August 26 2011. He said Dr Dar had 'abducted' Aamina and evidence suggested that they had gone to Pakistan. Dr Khan had begun civil court action in the hope of finding his daughter and police in London and Pakistan had been involved in trying to trace Dr Dar - who had been hoping to be a GP - and Aamina, the court heard. 'It is an extraordinarily serious matter,' said the judge. 'This child has been missing ... for approaching two years.' He added: 'Sadly the whereabouts of both the mother and child remain unknown.' Highlights:","output":"1. Deputy High Court Judge Clive Heaton issued a warning two years after Dr. Humma Dar disappeared with her daughter, Aamina Khan.  2. Aamina's father, Dr. Safraz Khan, was granted custody of their daughter and has been searching for her since August 2011. 3.

Article: To varying degrees, Nasser's statist system of government was continued in Egypt and emulated by virtually all Arab republics, namely Algeria, Syria, Iraq, Tunisia, Yemen, Sudan, and Libya. Ahmed Ben Bella, Algeria's first president, was a staunch Nasserist. Abdullah al-Sallal drove out the king of North Yemen in the name of Nasser's pan-Arabism. Other coups influenced by Nasser included those that occurred in Iraq in July 1958 and Syria in 1963. Muammar Gaddafi, who overthrew the Libyan monarchy in 1969, considered Nasser his hero and sought to succeed him as \\"leader of the Arabs\\". Also in 1969, Colonel Gaafar Nimeiry, a supporter of Nasser, took power in Sudan. The Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM) helped spread Nasser's pan-Arabist ideas throughout the Arab world, particularly among the Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese, and in South Yemen, the Persian Gulf, and Iraq.

First, we're going to find out what -293 - 267 is. If you have 293 apples and you lose all of those, as well as 267 more apples, how many apples have you lost in total?  Well, you'll find out that you lost 560 apples.  So now our equation looks like this: -560 = -86*j + 1762 Next, we want to get the \\"j\\" term on one side by itself. To do that, let's move the 1762 from the right side of the equation over to the left side.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The climate change, in general, does not have a direct effect on the process of the dishwasher cleaning the dishes better. Dishwashers are closed systems, so they do not rely on external environmental factors during the cleaning process, such as temperature or humidity. However, there might be some indirect effects of climate change on the dishwasher's performance. For example, climate change could lead to a higher demand for energy-efficient appliances. As a result, new dishwasher models might be developed with more energy-efficient features that can also enhance the dishwashing performance, such as improved water heating or better spray jet technology. Another indirect effect could be an increased focus on water conservation in response to climate change. This may lead to dishwashers being designed to use less water while still maintaining their cleaning efficiency. In this case, the perturbation may help improve the dishwasher's cleaning capabilities by forcing technological advancements. In conclusion, while climate change itself does not directly affect the dishwasher's performance, it might indirectly influence the advancement and design of dishwashers leading to improvement in cleaning performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Russia Withdraws From Plutonium Disposal Treaty\\"","output":"Title: Russia Withdraws From Plutonium Disposal Treaty Introduction In a surprising move, Russia has announced its withdrawal from the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement (PMDA), a key non-proliferation treaty aimed at mutual commitments of both Russia and the US to dispose of their excess weapons-grade plutonium. This unilateral decision raises questions and concerns over the future of nuclear non-proliferation efforts and the escalating tensions between Russia and the United States. Background of the Plutonium Disposal Treaty The PMDA, signed in 2000 by Russia and the United States, was designed to enhance nuclear security and mitigate risks associated with uncontrolled excess weapons-grade plutonium stockpiles. Under the terms of the treaty, each nation agreed to irreversibly dispose of 34 metric tons of surplus plutonium, enough to create thousands of nuclear weapons. In 2010, the treaty was amended with the Protocol, which outlined specific translational measures for plutonium disposal. The agreement required each nation to implement the disposal process by incorporating the excess plutonium into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, thus making it suitable for use in civilian nuclear power plants and rendering it unsuitable for weapons production. Reasons for Russia's Withdrawal Officially, Russia cited \\"unfriendly actions\\" by the United States as the primary factor influencing its decision. They argued that the US had failed to meet the terms of the agreement. Specifically, the US was accused of pursuing a substandard method of diluting and storing plutonium, rather than actual disposal through MOX fuel fabrication, contrary to the treaty terms. Experts, however, believe that the reasons for Russia's withdrawal are more complex and may include economic, political, and strategic factors. The strained relations between Russia and the United States, triggered by issues such as the Russian annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, could be significant contributing factors. Consequences and Implications of Withdrawal Russia's withdrawal from the Plutonium Disposal Treaty could have multiple implications for nuclear security, diplomacy, and international non-proliferation efforts. Firstly, it casts doubt on Russia's commitment to non-proliferation and disarmament goals, potentially undermining the broader international regime. Secondly, the decision might cause increasing uncertainty in the already-fragile relationship between Russia and the United States, leading to increased mistrust and escalating tensions. This move could potentially provoke an arms race, particularly if both nations are unwilling to reduce their respective plutonium stockpiles. Lastly, the withdrawal could significantly impact other areas of cooperation, such as future arms control negotiations and collaborative efforts in managing nuclear risks globally. Conclusion Russia's decision to withdraw from the Plutonium Disposal Treaty, while not an invasion of treaty provisions, raises troubling questions about nuclear security and non-proliferation efforts. The move potentially threatens global security by increasing mistrust between the powers and undermining confidence in the international non-proliferation regime. As such, it is essential for the remaining parties to the treaty to engage in diplomatic dialogue and seek alternative mechanisms to avoid regional and global escalation of conflict."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Eric always arrived at work earlier than Jason, as","output":"he was a firm believer in the saying, \\"The early bird catches the worm.\\" Jason, on the other hand, was more of a night owl, believing that his best work was done in the quiet solitude of the late hours. Their contrasting work styles fostered a light-hearted rivalry between the two, with each often trying to prove the merits of their own preferred schedule. However, their boss, Susan, appreciated the diversity in their work habits as this ensured that someone was always available to address any urgent matters. With Eric being an excellent problem-solver and Jason being known for his impeccable attention to detail, the pair complemented each other perfectly, creating a balanced and effective team. One Monday morning, Eric reached the office at 6:30 AM, as always, to find an email from a client requesting urgent amendments to a project. He knew that Jason, who was adept at proofreading even the most complex documents, wouldn't be at work until 9:30 AM, but made the decision to tackle some of the changes himself to save time. As the sun climbed higher into the sky and daylight flooded the cozy office, Eric felt proud of the progress he had made on the project, thankful that he always had a head start on the day. When Jason arrived, Eric excitedly showed him the changes he'd made, eager for his partner's input. Jason immediately noticed that, while Eric had addressed many of the client's pressing concerns, a few critical errors had been introduced. With his keen eye, Jason pinpointed errors in grammar, formatting, and even some inconsistencies in the data. He knew that, with their powers combined, they could polish the document to perfection. The two colleagues spent the rest of the morning resolving those issues and improving the project together. After a final review, they sent it back to the client with confidence. Just as they wrapped up the task, Susan entered the office, pleased to see them working harmoniously together. She congratulated them on another successful project and reminded them that, while their individual strengths were valuable, collaboration was the real key to the team's success. Later that evening, after most of the staff had gone home, Jason continued to work on his own projects, taking advantage of the quiet office space. He made formidable progress, but after encountering a complicated problem he wished he could discuss with Eric, he realized the importance of maintaining a balance in his schedule as well. The next day, Jason decided to adjust his arrival time, coming in a little earlier to overlap with Eric's schedule, while still maintaining some of his cherished late-night work sessions for more focused tasks. Eric, too, started staying just a bit later, recognizing the value in having someone to collaborate with throughout the day. This compromise allowed them to utilize their individual strengths and better support one another. As the weeks went on, their collaborative efforts led the team to new heights of success. Their projects consistently exceeded client expectations, and the office developed a reputation for efficiency, attention to detail, and clear communication. Eric and Jason's once-rivalry blossomed into a strong partnership built on mutual respect and understanding. This redefined relationship cast ripples throughout the entire office. Staff members began to appreciate the individual strengths of each team member, and the work environment transformed into an increasingly cooperative and productive space. Susan couldn't have been more proud of her team, and more importantly, the lessons they had taught one another about the importance of balance and unity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition, the proteins, fats and calcium in whole cow's milk are more difficult for an infant to digest and absorb than the ones in breast milk. Evaporated milk may be easier to digest due to the processing of the protein but is still nutritionally inadequate. Some infants are allergic to cow's milk protein, this problem may be associated with infant formulas derived from cow's milk. Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: is cow milk the same as breast milk? Choose your answer from:  +no.  +yes.","output":"+no. Cow's milk is not the same as breast milk. The text explains that whole cow's milk contains too little of essential nutrients, such as iron, retinol, vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin D, unsaturated fats, and essential fatty acids for human babies. It also has too much protein, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and chloride, which may strain an infant's immature kidneys. Furthermore, the proteins, fats, and calcium in whole cow's milk are harder for an infant to digest and absorb compared to those in breast milk. Even evaporated milk, while easier to digest, is still nutritionally inadequate.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: make off with a small painting in her oversized purse  B: accuse Addison of stealing the paintings without proof  C: ask Addison questions about the value of the paintings Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, it is difficult to predict exactly what Sasha will do next. However, we can analyze and compare the given options to determine which one best aligns with the provided context. A: Make off with a small painting in her oversized purse - This option implies that Sasha is intending to steal a painting from Addison's collection. The context does not provide any information about Sasha's moral character or intentions, so we cannot assume that she would commit theft just because she is browsing Addison's collection. B: Accuse Addison of stealing the paintings without proof - This option suggests that Sasha would make a serious accusation against Addison without having any evidence to support her claim. Again, the context does not provide any indication about Sasha's character or her relationship with Addison, so we cannot assume she would make such an accusation. C: Ask Addison questions about the value of the paintings - This option is the most appropriate given the context. Since Sasha is browsing through Addison's collection of rare and precious art paintings, it is reasonable for her to be curious about the value of those paintings. By asking Addison questions about the value of the paintings, Sasha is engaging in a conversation and seeking more information about the collection, which aligns with the context provided. Therefore, option C: \\"Ask Addison questions about the value of the paintings\\" best answers the question according to the context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy.  Paragraph: Tony and Greg are brothers. They are currently in the kitchen eating a snack together. Greg is eating a stalk of celery while Tony is eating out of a bowl of candy. Tony remarks that he doesn't know how Greg enjoys such a bland snack. Greg just gives Tony an angry glare before getting up to go into the living room. On the living room table, Greg finds a glass of milk and a bowl of milk. The glass of milk has started to get thick, but the bowl of milk appears to be still fresh. Greg rolls his eyes at the mess and walks away.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person will experience more tooth decay? Answer:","output":"Tony is likely to experience more tooth decay.  This is because, Tony is eating candy which is high in sugars. The bacteria in the mouth use these sugars for energy and produce lactic acid as a waste product. The lactic acid can cause tooth decay because it harms the tooth enamel, which is the protective outer layer of the teeth, leading to the formation of cavities.  On the other hand, Greg is eating a stalk of celery, which contains lower amounts of sugar. Therefore, the bacteria in his mouth have less sugar to convert to lactic acid, reducing the potential for tooth decay. So, comparing their current diets, Tony's high sugar intake increases his risk of tooth decay, while Greg's low-sugar snack reduces his risk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll in a plant - The light energy is used to convert carbon dioxide - The plant uses nutrients in the soil - The plant uses carbon dioxide in the air to produce glucose - The plant uses the glucose to give itself energy - Oxygen is released as a by product.  Question: suppose less sugar produced happens, how will it affect more sugar produced.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If less sugar (glucose) is produced in a plant due to any perturbation such as a change in light intensity, nutrient availability, or carbon dioxide levels, it will have a direct effect on the amount of sugar that can be produced in the future. This is because the glucose produced in plants serves multiple purposes, such as providing energy (ATP) for different processes, including the mechanisms that lead to even more sugar production. If less glucose is produced, the plant's energy availability is compromised, which can result in reduced efficiency and capacity for photosynthesis. This can lead to even less sugar production in the future. In conclusion, less sugar production due to any perturbation can have a direct negative effect on the potential for producing more sugar in the future (a \\"less\\" effect). This is because the decreased glucose production can limit the plant's energy availability and resource allocation, ultimately reducing the efficiency of photosynthesis and hindering the generation of more glucose."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"KerPlunk and Ludo are both types of board games that involve strategy, skill, and chance, providing entertainment and social interaction among players. KerPlunk is a classic chance-and-skill game that was developed by the Ideal Toy Company and first released in 1967. The game involves a plastic tube and marbles, with plastic sticks or straws threaded through the tube to create a lattice-like web. Marbles are then placed atop the web. The aim of the game is for players to carefully remove sticks one at a time without causing the marbles to fall. The player who causes the fewest marbles to fall is the winner. Ludo, on the other hand, is a traditional board game that has its roots in ancient India, with its earliest form being Pachisi. Ludo was adapted and popularised in England around 1896 under the name \\"Ludo\\" to make it more palatable for British gaming tastes. The game is played on a square board divided into 4 quadrants with each player controlling 4 tokens. The objective is to race your tokens around the board from the starting point to the \\"home\\" section by rolling a die. Strategy comes into play as you try to block your opponents or land on their tokens to send them back to their starting point.

He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes.

Barenaked Ladies and Ben Folds Five try to make the ‘Last Summer’ count Barenaked Ladies with frontman Ed Robertson (center right). Barenaked Ladies and Ben Folds Five are currently roaming the country on a jaunt called “Last Summer on Earth” tour, which comes to the Bank of America Pavilion on Tuesday. Do they know something we don’t? “We actually started the tour last year,” says BNL frontman Ed Robertson, noting that 2012 was the year the Mayan calendar predicted the end of the world. “This year, we’re just hedging our bets. Maybe the Mayans forgot to carry the one or something and maybe it ends this year. We’re going to keep doing the ‘Last Summer on Earth’ tour until the world ends. And then we’ll say, ‘See, told you so!’ ’’ Both groups are promoting new releases, the excellent “Grinning Streak” for Canada’s BNL and the live album from the reunited-in-2011 piano pop trio BFF. The longtime mutual admirers are excited to be out together. “We’re bands that grew up and cut our teeth together,” says Robertson of BFF and Guster. (The Boston-spawned group is appearing on almost all the other dates on the “Last Summer” tour but skipped Boston in favor of opening for Dispatch last month at the Comcast Center.) We recently chatted with Robertson and Folds from a Columbus, Ohio, tour stop, posing questions both serious and silly. Q. You both have blatant untruths in your name. Which is worse, that Ben Folds Five is a trio or the dearth of nude females in BNL? ROBERTSON: What’s funny is my high school band was called Three Guys From Barrie and there were five of us. And none of us were from Barrie so it was doubly misleading. FOLDS: They’re both pretty bad names. If you’ve never heard of either one of our bands they could sort of exist on some lounge marquee at a Four Seasons somewhere and people would say “God, what a [expletive] name.” I think once you make records, there’s an association with it and then it’s good. I like that both names are playful because what else are you going to do? Q. In a “Battle of the Network Stars”-type competition, who is the victor among your bands? ROBERTSON: I would have to say Guster would be our strongest competition — Brian Rosenworcel, Adam Gardner, Luke Reynolds — there are three physical specimens to be reckoned with. I’ve totally ruled Ben Folds Five out, they’re not even in the competition. I think it’s definitely between Guster and Barenaked Ladies, and ultimately we get inside their heads and we win. FOLDS: We don’t have enough people for that. [BFF drummer] Darren [Jessee] doesn’t really like to move. [Bassist] Robert [Sledge] is pretty strong. I just don’t weigh enough. On tug-of-war they’d just yank my ass across the line. ROBERTSON: Hey, what are you trying to say, Ben? Q. That you’re strong and powerful? ROBERTSON: No he’s trying to say we weigh a lot. [Laughs.] FOLDS: You’re tall and built. ROBERTSON: It’s true we are the tallest band in rock ’n’ roll. We have three guys over 6 feet. Q. How about in a more brain-teaser-like competition such as Scrabble? ROBERTSON: That’s tough. I think the last men at the board would be myself, [Guster frontman] Ryan Miller, and Ben. But among us I’m probably the only one who has read Stefan Fatsis’s book about Scrabble and also narrated a documentary on Scrabble, so I may have a competitive edge. FOLDS: I’m not really very good at Scrabble. I think Robert probably would be. If I had the help of my girlfriend I could kick all of y’all’s asses. Q. Are there songs in each other’s catalogs you wish you’d written? FOLDS: “Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did,” I think that’s a neat lyric [from “Brian Wilson.”] In fact, I guess I thought I’d wished I’d written enough to where I have a similar sounding cadence in a line on a song called “Rockin’ the Suburbs,” “just like Jon Bon Jovi did.” There’s something funny about putting “did” at the end of the sentence, it’s real conversational. It’s also got a melancholy feel to the lyric while the song sounds happy and I like that. ROBERTSON: I love “Army.” I try to catch it every night. It’s such a great song, it’s a such a great story. I will often make a mixtape-type playlist for somebody to describe the kind of music that I like and that’s always one that I put on there. I think the lyrics come across totally conversational, nothing seems forced. Q. The a cappella competition “The Sing-Off,” on which Ben serves as a judge, is returning to NBC this winter. Ed will you pledge right now to bring BNL on the show for a sing-off? ROBERTSON: We’ve been talking about organizing a freestyle rap battle between me, Ben, and Ryan. I think it would be pretty killer. [Ben laughs.] FOLDS: I’ll do that. I think the Barenaked Ladies could kill on an a cappella show. ROBERTSON: We’re actually working up an a cappella version of “Army” right now. FOLDS: It’s a shoo-in, they’re on. Q. Ben when you toured with Guster and Rufus Wainwright, you and Rufus did a great version of “Careless Whisper” by Wham! Will you all be doing any onstage collaborations like that? ROBERTSON: You guys do “Careless Whisper”? Dude, we do “Careless Whisper”! I think we might’ve done “Careless Whisper” with Guster back in the day. FOLDS: When you say back in the day, how far back? ROBERTSON: Oh God, probably late ’60s, early ’70s. FOLDS: OK, well that’s definitely after ours because ours was in the ’30s and it was only a wire recording. ROBERTSON: You know what, we recorded it with the Guster guys and now I’m remembering it originally came out on player piano rolls. It was originally arranged for hurdy-gurdy. FOLDS: Yeah, well it wasn’t called “Careless Whisper” back when we did it. It was called “Unga Unga Un” and it was some rocks smashed together. Q. Now that you’ve found this common ground, is it possible that you’ll perform together? ROBERTSON: Ben has been out to rock a little piano with us and he has an open invite, and I hope he will take advantage of it more.

Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.

This cultural identity was historically defined by the study of Torah and Talmud, observance of Jewish Law, and the use of liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew and Yiddish languages.

However, upon visiting, it's safe to say that my expectations were far from met. When my party and I arrived at the restaurant, the first thing we noticed was the unappealing ambiance. The lighting was far too dim, making it difficult to read our menus without using our phone flashlights. The tables and chairs seemed cramped together, restricting space for movement and conversation. We waited quite a while to be seated, even though there seemed to be plenty of empty tables. Once seated, our server took more than 15 minutes to acknowledge our presence. When we finally flagged her down, she seemed annoyed and inattentive. We ordered our drinks and, after waiting for another 20 minutes, we decided to make do with the free water provided and proceed with ordering our food. Unfortunately, the disappointing experience continued when our food finally arrived. My pasta dish was overcooked and swimming in a watery sauce. My friend's burger was burnt, and the vegetables accompanying it were wilted and lifeless. We called our server's attention to these issues, but we were met with little sympathy or effort to resolve the problem. To make matters worse, when the bill came, they had charged us for the drinks we had never received. We were too exhausted by then to make a fuss, so we paid the bill and simply left. Overall, The Hasty Hare failed to provide the enjoyable dining experience we had hoped for. With so many other options available in the area, it's safe to say that we won't be returning or recommending this restaurant to anyone else."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They were both from the House of Trastámara and were second cousins, being both descended from John I of Castile; on marriage they were given a papal dispensation to deal with consanguinity by Sixtus IV. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of Valladolid; Isabella was eighteen years old and Ferdinand a year younger; this marriage united both kingdoms under one crown. It is generally accepted by most scholars (John Elliott being an English-speaking example) that the unification of Spain can essentially be traced back to the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella. Some newer historical opinions propose that under their rule, what later became Spain was still a union of two crowns rather than a unitary state, as to a large degree Castile and Aragon remained separate kingdoms, with most of their own separate institutions, for decades to come. The court of Ferdinand and Isabella was constantly on the move, in order to bolster local support for the crown from local feudal lords.  - The New World is one of the names used for the Earth's Western Hemisphere, specifically the Americas (including nearby islands such as those of the Caribbean and Bermuda).  - Genoese (\\"Zeneize\\") is a dialect of the Ligurian language spoken in Genoa (the principal city of the Liguria region in Northern Italy).  - Bartholomew Columbus (Genoese dialect: Bertomê Corombo; ) (c. 1461  1515) was an Italian explorer from Genoa and the younger brother of Christopher Columbus.  - Christopher Columbus ( 20 May 1506) was an Italian explorer, navigator, colonizer, and citizen of the Republic of Genoa. Under the auspices of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, he completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean. Those voyages and his efforts to establish permanent settlements on the island of Hispaniola initiated the European colonization of the New World.  - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - Hispaniola (Spanish: \\"La Española\\"; Latin: \\"Hispaniola\\"; Taíno: \\"Haiti\\") is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles.

If you encounter difficult stains that do not come off with a commercial cleaner, paint thinner applied with steel wool can help. Make sure to follow package directions, especially any safety instructions, before applying paint thinner. Then, work the paint thinner into the frames using a steel wool sponge until the stains come off.  Be gentle when using steel wool to avoid scratching the frames. Some steel wool pads have soap built in that can help you clean. After cleaning your frames, they may look a little dull. Apply water using fine steel wool, buffing the surface of the frames until they shine. Outdoor frames may become dull due to a process called anodizing. This looks similar to rust and cannot be polished off. Aluminum frames that appear rusty should be treated by a professional cleaner. Never apply any product, even household products, to the full window frame without testing them first.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Lookalike Mimics Ichiro, Gains National Recognition As Ichiro Suzuki approaches Pete Rose's professional baseball record of 4,256 hits, the Marlins' outfielder has understandably some found himself with some serious scrutiny. Some would argue that whenever Suzuki gets his next two hits – after a 3-for-4 performance against the Padres on Monday, he stands at 4,255 total – he will become the true hits king. But others – including Rose himself – might argue that because 1,278 of Ichiro's hits came in Japan before he entered MLB as a 27-year-old in 2001, Rose will remain the real king due to his numbers coming strictly against MLB competition. Ultimately that debate will probably last far beyond whenever Ichiro surpasses Rose's professional mark. But one thing that can't be argued is the skill of a Marlins fan who has nailed an absolutely perfect imitation of Suzuki. In this video posted by MLB.com, the fan's talents were put on display to the public during the Marlins' 13-4 win on Monday. Although the clip only shows one of Ichiro's at-bats, the fan was going to work all night long, earning the attention of sports fans everywhere for his spotless work. And perhaps it gives the Marlins some solace in knowing that whenever the Hall-of-Fame-bound 42-year old finally does retire, they'll have a perfectly suitable replacement waiting in the wings. But until then, Ichiro – whose .350 batting average in 2016 would be the highest of all-time for a player past the age of 40 if it holds – will continue to embark on the record books. Even without accounting for his hits from Japan, Suzuki stands at 2,977 in his MLB career entering Tuesday, only 23 shy of becoming the 30th player in MLB history to join the 3,000 hit club.

There is also a fan who is really good at pretending to be Ichiro. He got a lot of attention because he looks and acts just like him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Die Steigerung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit kann durch mehrere Strategien erreicht werden. Dazu gehören unter anderem die Förderung von Innovation, die Verbesserung der Infrastruktur, die Erhöhung der qualifizierten Arbeitskräfte, die Verringerung von gesetzlichen Beschränkungen und die Förderung einer wettbewerbsorientierten Unternehmenskultur.  Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass alle diese Faktoren miteinander verknüpft sind und dass ihre Integration auf nationaler Ebene notwendig ist, um eine nachhaltige Wettbewerbsfähigkeit zu gewährleisten. Zum Beispiel führt die Förderung von Innovation und technologischer Entwicklung unserer Industrien nicht nur zu gesteigerter Produktivität, sondern kann auch zur Schaffung neuer Arbeitsplätze und zur Stärkung der nationalen Wirtschaft beitragen. Die Verbesserung der Infrastruktur - ob physikalisch, wie Straßen und Telekommunikationsnetze, oder soziale, wie Bildung und Gesundheitswesen - ist ebenfalls ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Verbesserung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Sie ermöglicht nicht nur den reibungslosen Transport von Gütern und Dienstleistungen, sondern trägt auch zur Verbesserung der Lebensqualität der Bürger bei und macht das Land attraktiver für ausländische Investitionen. Darüber hinaus ist die Ausbildung und Qualifizierung von Arbeitskräften ein kritischer Faktor.

Die Reduzierung von gesetzlichen Beschränkungen und die Förderung einer wettbewerbsorientierten Unternehmenskultur können auch dazu beitragen, die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit zu steigern, indem sie Unternehmern und Unternehmen mehr Freiheit und Flexibilität geben, um zu wachsen und sich zu entwickeln. Durch die Umsetzung dieser Strategien und Maßnahmen können wir unsere Wirtschaft stärken und sie widerstandsfähiger gegenüber globalen Herausforderungen machen.

Don't want to leave New York  How would the sentiment of this tweet be described?","output":"The sentiment of the tweet \\"On the way to LGA... Don't want to leave New York\\" can be described as a blend of mixed emotions, with an overall tone of mild sadness or reluctance. Let's break down the different components of the tweet to better understand the sentiment: 1. \\"On the way to LGA\\": LGA refers to LaGuardia Airport, one of the major airports in the New York City area. This part of the tweet implies that the individual is currently en route to the airport, which is generally associated with an upcoming departure from the city. The mention of travel can evoke a variety of emotions, such as excitement or anxiety, depending on the context and personal preferences. 2. \\"Don't want to leave New York\\": This statement clearly conveys a sense of reluctance or sadness. The user is expressing their desire to remain in New York, which may indicate a strong attachment to the city, or perhaps their enjoyment of the experiences they had there. When we put these two parts together, the overall sentiment conveys a sense of sadness and wistfulness at the prospect of leaving New York, even as they prepare to depart from LaGuardia Airport. The tweet may also suggest that the individual had an enjoyable visit to the city and may be reminiscing about their experiences or relationships formed there. This sentiment can be relatable for those who have had similar experiences of being hesitant to leave a location that holds special memories or connections for them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What can damage trees? Context: It is remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is hundreds, and in a few instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position. Answer:","output":"Damage to trees can be caused by broken limbs or roots, deep wounds from fire, insects (specifically their larvae), or falling timber. These damages can allow decay to enter and spread throughout the tree, and the tunnels created by insect larvae can remain as sources of weakness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When someone says, \\"Well, I guess I'll have to go to face the music\\", it does not mean he is planning to go to a concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that, and why you did not do this or that. Sour(; )music, indeed, but it has to be faced. The phrase \\"to face the music\\" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. Where did the expression come from? The first information comes from the American writer James Fennimore Cooper. He said in 1851 that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their cue(,) to go on, they often said, \\"It's time to go to face the music.\\" And that is exactly what they did--- face the orchestra   which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. So, \\"to face the music\\" came to mean having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice. The other explanation comes from the army. Men had to face inspection by their leader. The soldiers worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean--shiny enough to pass inspection? Still, the men had to go out, and face the music of the band, as well as the inspection. What else could they do?

AFP - Pauline Hanson, the former leader of Australia's xenophobic One Nation party, has announced that she was coming back from political retirement to run for a seat in the Senate next month.","output":"This announcement is about Pauline Hanson, the previous leader of Australia's One Nation party, who has decided to return from political retirement and contest for a seat in Australia's Senate in the upcoming elections. One Nation is a far-right political party that has been known to propagate policies targeting immigration and multiculturalism. In recent years, the party has gained notoriety for advocating anti-immigration and anti-Muslim sentiments.  Pauline Hanson, born on May 27, 1954, in Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia, is an Australian politician who has been involved in politics since the 1990s. Hanson initially became a member of the Liberal Party of Australia before being disendorsed due to her controversial comments on indigenous Australians and immigration. Despite being disendorsed, she went on to win a seat in the Australian Parliament as an independent in 1996. In 1997, she co-founded and became the leader of the One Nation party. During her time in politics, Hanson has been known for holding and espousing far-right views. Her maiden speech in the Australian Parliament is still considered one of the most controversial speeches in Australian history, where she advocated anti-immigration policies and claimed that Australia was being \\"swamped by Asians.\\" Over the years, Hanson has been criticized for promoting extremist views, which led to her being involved in several political controversies. After a hiatus in her political career, Pauline Hanson decided to come out of retirement and run for a seat in the Senate in the next month's elections. Her re-emergence in the political landscape speaks to the resurgence of far-right movements and anti-immigration sentiment not only in Australia but in many countries around the world. Hanson's return to politics could potentially have an impact on several policies related to immigration, religious freedoms, and cultural diversity if she gets elected into the Senate. As a political figure, she has previously voiced concerns about the effects of immigration, particularly from Muslim-majority countries, on Australia's social fabric and economy. Her participation in the Senate race might increase the attention and focus on those issues during the election campaigns. In summary, this announcement is about Pauline Hanson, a far-right Australian politician and former leader of the One Nation party, who has decided to contest for a seat in the Senate after coming back from political retirement. Her return to the political scene may reignite debates around immigration policies and multiculturalism in Australia."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It was founded in 1987 by Jim Foster, making it the third longest-running professional football league in North America, after the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the National Football League (NFL). The AFL plays a proprietary code known as arena football, a form of indoor American football played on a 66-by-28 yard field (about a quarter of the surface area of an NFL field), with rules encouraging offensive performance, resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game. The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster, a former executive of the United States Football League (USFL) and the NFL.  - The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. They are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time. Above all, the point guard must totally understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football or a playmaker in association football (soccer).  - Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University, is a private research university in Stanford, California, adjacent to Palo Alto and between San Jose and San Francisco.

The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.  - The Kansas Jayhawks, commonly referred to as KU, are the teams of the athletic department at the University of Kansas.

Write a question about the following article: The Finnish Red Guards seized the early initiative in the war by taking control of Helsinki on 28 January 1918 and by undertaking a general offensive lasting from February till early March 1918. The Reds were relatively well armed, but a chronic shortage of skilled leaders, both at the command level and in the field, left them unable to capitalise on this momentum, and most of the offensives came to nothing. The military chain of command functioned relatively well at company and platoon level, but leadership and authority remained weak as most of the field commanders were chosen by the vote of the troops. The common troops were more or less armed civilians, whose military training, discipline and combat morale were both inadequate and low. Ali Aaltonen was replaced on 28 January 1918 by Eero Haapalainen as commander-in-chief. He, in turn, was displaced by the Bolshevik triumvirate of Eino Rahja, Adolf Taimi and Evert Eloranta on 20 March. The last commander-in-chief of the Red Guard was Kullervo Manner, from 10 April until the last period of the war when the Reds no longer had a named leader. Some talented local commanders, such as Hugo Salmela in the Battle of Tampere, provided successful leadership, but could not change the course of the war. The Reds achieved some local victories as they retreated from southern Finland toward Russia, such as against German troops in the Battle of Syrjäntaka on 28-29 April in Tuulos.","output":"What problems did the Finnish Red Guards face during their offensives in the war, despite being well-armed, and how did their leadership change throughout the conflict?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If your plant is an air bromeliad, you probably purchased it attached to driftwood or another object, placed in a pot that contained pure bark or rocks instead of soil or potting mix, or by itself with no attachment at all. These plants draw moisture and nutrients from the air around them. They are especially hardy compared to other bromeliads, but you should keep an eye out to deal with problems early. Most air bromeliads cannot draw moisture or nutrients through the roots at all, and only need to be placed in dry bark so it has crevices to attach to and hold itself upright. Smaller varieties can even be attached to driftwood, pebbles, or other objects.  Before placing on object under your bromeliad, if you suspect it has been exposed to saltwater, immerse the object in distilled water or rainwater for two weeks, changing the water frequently. Some bromeliads sold as air bromeliads may have more extensive root systems, either because they are larger and require more support, or because they can draw moisture from both air and water. Plant these in a mix of 1 part perlite and 2 parts bromeliad potting mix, and occasionally moisten around the base of the plant if the leaves look dry. Air bromeliads tend to originate in desert environments and can take more sunlight than other varieties, but this is not true of every species. Keep it in front of an east- or north-facing window for indirect sunlight, or move it to a west- or south-facing window for full sun and keep a close eye out for dry leaves.  Most air bromeliads are small and thus make easy indoor plants, but they can be kept outside. They tend to be hardier than other varieties, but will do best in warm weather and should be brought inside before the frost hits. If you are in the Southern Hemisphere, the south-facing window will get indirect sunlight, and the north-facing one receives direct sunlight. You may also need to adjust to a different window if there are hills or a mountain slope nearby. See Troubleshooting for signs your plant has too little or too much sun exposure. Air bromeliads require extra moisture from the air. Use a spray bottle to mist the surface of the plant once every few days. It may require misting daily or every other day if kept in an arid indoor environment or during a dry season.  Do not water the base of the plant unless another step tells you to in specific situations. Air bromeliads do not primarily use its roots to draw up water, and standing water could cause them to rot. Use distilled or bottled water in the sprayer for the best results. Bromeliads grow slowly and do not typically require fertilizer. If you want to encourage blooming or rapid growth, you can attempt to fertilize it infrequently, no more than once every two weeks at the very most. Air plants can only be fertilized using liquid fertilizer, since they do not draw nutrients through their roots. Always dilute one part liquid fertilizer with one to three parts water before spraying. When your bromeliad eventually flowers, which can take years and last several months, it will produce \\"pups\\", or young buds. Use a disinfected knife to cut off dead flowers or spiky flower-supporting structures when they become unattractive, and to remove the buds when they have grown for several months or the plant begins to die. Disinfect the blade with rubbing alcohol before cutting and take care not to injure the main plant body.

During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time.

Trudeau closed the summit Saturday by refusing to budge on positions that place him at odds with Trump, particularly new tariffs on steel and aluminum that have irritated Canada and the European Union.

Question: What does Steffen Seibert personally think about allowing Russia re-join the G-8? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"The provided text does not contain any information on what Steffen Seibert, the German spokesman, personally thinks about allowing Russia to re-join the G-8. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately attribute an opinion or stance on this particular matter to Steffen Seibert from the information given. In the provided excerpt, Seibert is quoted as stating that Germany stands by the communique that was jointly agreed upon at the G-7 summit, a statement made in response to U.S. President Donald Trump instructing his representatives not to sign the communique following disputes over tariffs. These disputes involved Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, among others, expressing deep dissatisfaction with the newly imposed American tariffs on steel and aluminum. Notably, Trudeau declared that Canada would enact retaliatory tariff measures against U.S. goods. The fallout over these economically-potent disagreements was significant -- they led to the U.S. rejecting the very concept of solidarity represented by the joint signing of the communique. However, Steffen Seibert's comments were specifically related to the discussions and outcomes of that summit, not about the question of allowing Russia to re-join what was previously known as the G-8 (it became the G-7 after Russia's membership was suspended in 2014 as a result of the country's annexation of Crimea). The information given does not include any mention of this clearly separate and highly charged geopolitical issue. Given the importance and potential sensitivity of both these subjects – international trade and tariffs, and Russia's status in relation to this group of leading industrial nations – it would be important to seek out precise and objective information about Steffen Seibert's perspective on the latter issue from a reputable source.

With Wade's gang weakened by police infiltration and increasing infighting, it is the perfect moment for D'Amico to make his move. On the other side of the law, a seasoned detective, Jack Dawson, has spent his whole career chasing after the gang, determined to bring them to justice. He's made incredible sacrifices, allowing his personal life to crumble in his pursuit of justice. Believing that capturing Ben Wade's gang would be his career-defining achievement, he finds a renewed sense of hope when Sarah Mitchell's investigation offers new leads and insights.

People are happier and laugh 50% more when they talk face to face with friends or via webcam (web camera) than when they use social networking sites, a study has found. Dr. Roberts, a famous lecture at the University of Chester, said such websites don't appear to help make true friendships. Based on two questionnaires , he found there was no link between Facebook use and people with larger groups of friends. Dr. Roberts, whose work will be presented at the British Psychological Society conference in Harrogate, said, \\"The bottom lime conclusion is that our relationships are not dependent on the quantity of communication. They depend on quality, and even Skype  is better at increasing the quality of our communication than time on Facebook.\\" Even talking on the phone or texting does not make people feel as good as sharing a smile, the research says. The studies suggest quality, not quantity, of communication is the most important for keeping friends for life.

Question: suppose there is less of a current happens, how will it affect LESS snow.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"To answer the question, let us analyze the process step-by-step: Step 1: The air is cold. Step 2: Water is in the air. Step 3: The water forms tiny ice crystals. Step 4: The ice crystals collide with each other. Step 5: The ice crystals stick to each other. Step 6: The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together. Step 7: The ice crystals get too heavy to be in the air. Step 8: The ice crystals become snowflakes. Step 9: The snowflakes fall to the ground as snow. Now, let's consider the situation where there is less of a current (air movement). Less air movement would mean less chance for ice crystals to collide with each other (Step 4). This would make it harder for ice crystals to stick to each other and grow in size (Steps 5 and 6). As a result, there would be fewer instances of ice crystals growing too large and becoming too heavy to remain in the air (Step 7). This would ultimately lead to fewer instances of ice crystals turning into snowflakes and falling to the ground as snow (Steps 8 and 9). So, in a situation with less of a current, the correct answer is: B: less snow"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Samantha loves doing interesting activities outside the most usually.; B). Betty loves doing interesting activities outside the most usually.;","output":"B). Betty loves doing interesting activities outside the most usually. Betty had always been an outdoor enthusiast, finding joy and solace in the natural world. She was passionate about hiking, camping, and exploring all the wonders that Mother Nature had to offer. On the other hand, Samantha, her close friend, was an expert angler who had a wealth of knowledge and experience in all things related to fishing. Seeing Betty's excitement for outdoor adventures, Samantha thought it would be a perfect opportunity to introduce her friend to the sport of fishing. Samantha knew that fishing would not only provide Betty with an enjoyable way to spend her time outdoors but also offer her a new skill that she could cultivate and develop further. To begin with, Samantha decided to share information about the basics of fishing with Betty. She explained the various techniques used in both freshwater and saltwater fishing, elaborated on the different types of fishing rods and equipment available, along with their respective advantages and drawbacks. Betty listened intently, soaking in every bit of knowledge that her friend had to offer. As the weekend approached, Samantha planned a trip to a nearby lake that was known for its abundance of fish. Before hitting the water, she made sure to equip Betty with the right fishing gear, including a sturdy rod, a tackle box filled with various hooks, lures, and other necessary equipment, as well as clothing suitable for spending long hours outdoors. On the day of the fishing trip, Samantha and Betty set out early in the morning to catch the first light and make the most of their day. Once they reached the picturesque lake, Samantha helped Betty set up her fishing rod, demonstrating the appropriate techniques for tying knots, attaching the bait, and casting the line into the water. As the sun rose, the two friends enjoyed the serene ambience, waiting patiently for the fish to bite. Betty leaned on Samantha's expertise as they engaged in conversation about various topics, learning more about diverse species of fish as well as the importance of respecting the environment and practicing sustainable fishing. It wasn't long before Betty felt a tug on her line. With her heart racing, she followed Samantha's instructions, gently reeling in the fish to avoid breaking the line. Finally, the moment of truth arrived as Betty successfully landed her first-ever fish. Her eyes sparkled with joy, and she couldn't contain her excitement. Samantha joined in the celebration, proud of her friend's accomplishment. Throughout the day, Betty continued to improve her fishing skills, reeling in more fish and growing increasingly confident in her abilities. As the sun began to set, the two friends decided it was time to head back. They packed their gear and began their journey home, reflecting on the fun and successful day they had shared. In the weeks and months that followed, Betty and Samanta planned more fishing trips together, each one providing new challenges and opportunities for growth. As Betty's skills flourished, so too did their friendship. Through their shared love for outdoor activities and the bonding experience that fishing offered, Samantha and Betty formed a deep and lasting connection that would endure for years to come. In teaching Betty the art of fishing, Samantha had not only imparted valuable knowledge and skills but had also fostered a love for the outdoors within her friend that would continue to fuel her spirit of adventure. Their story is a testament to the power of friendship and the incredible experiences that await when we dare to venture beyond the familiar and embrace the wilderness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Windows forms are covered in Chapter 17 and 18 but there is no discussion about Web development or using C# with Active Server Pages (ASP).Starting in Chapter 6 (Collecting Data - The Class and the Array) there are several really annoying errors, for example, on page 105 the author uses \\"for (int i = 0; i < 11; i++)\\" to iterate thru a 10 element array. In the section below this (Array bounds checking), the author uses exactly the same code and says this will fail. The first code should be \\"for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\\".

Answer this question: who was england's prime minister during ww1??","output":"England's Prime Minister during World War 1 was David Lloyd George, who served as the Prime Minister from 1916 to 1922. Born on January 17, 1863, in Manchester, England, David Lloyd George was a key political figure during the early 20th century and played a pivotal role in the British war effort during WW1. David Lloyd George was a member of the Liberal Party, which he joined as a young man. He was initially elected as a Member of Parliament for Caernarfon Boroughs in 1890, a position he would hold until 1945. Before becoming Prime Minister, Lloyd George held various important positions in the government, such as the President of the Board of Trade, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Minister of Munitions. When World War 1 broke out in 1914, David Lloyd George initially served under Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's administration. During his time as Minister of Munitions and later as Secretary of State for War, he displayed exceptional administrative capabilities while overseeing the production and supply of armaments for the British forces. His efforts contributed to an increase in arms production, helping the British military to maintain a strong frontline against their enemies. On December 7, 1916, David Lloyd George became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom after H. H. Asquith was forced to resign due to growing dissatisfaction with his leadership during the war. As Prime Minister, Lloyd George played a crucial role in strengthening the British war effort and led the country to victory in 1918. One of his most significant achievements was the establishment of a unified Allied command structure, which facilitated effective cooperation between British, French, and American forces. As a wartime Prime Minister, Lloyd George also faced the challenge of maintaining support for the war on the domestic front. He worked tirelessly to increase national morale, rallying the population to support the war effort and even implemented policies like food rationing to ensure the military's needs were met. Moreover, he played a key role in formulating the policies that aimed to address some of the root causes of the war, such as negotiating the Irish Home Rule issue. Following the end of World War 1 in November 1918, Lloyd George participated in the Paris Peace Conference, where the Treaty of Versailles was negotiated and signed in June 1919. During the negotiations, he played a balancing role between the harsher demands of France's Georges Clemenceau and the more moderate approach of the United States' Woodrow Wilson, thus shaping the peace terms imposed on Germany and the newly established international order. Lloyd George's tenure as the Prime Minister continued until October 19, 1922, when internal divisions within the Liberal Party and the wider political landscape led to the collapse of his coalition government. Despite his resignation, David Lloyd George is still remembered as one of the most important and influential British political figures of the 20th century, particularly for his leadership during World War 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"On July 30, 1916, the St. Patrick's Parish in Jersey City, New Jersey, experienced significant damage due to a massive explosion that took place at the nearby Black Tom Island munitions depot. This explosion occurred during World War I and is often referred to as the \\"Black Tom Explosion.\\" The Black Tom Island munitions depot was a major hub for shipping weapons and ammunition from the United States to the front lines, supplying the Triple Entente forces – Britain, France, and Russia – in their fight against the Central Powers, primarily Germany and Austria-Hungary. It operated as a significant component of the United States' role in the war at that time, although the country did not officially join the fighting until 1917. On the night of July 30, 1916, a series of fires broke out at the munitions depot, which soon led to several catastrophic explosions. The cause of these fires and explosions is thought to have been a German sabotage operation. German agents had infiltrated the United States and were looking to disrupt the flow of arms and ammunition to the Allied forces, potentially altering the course of the war. The explosion was powerful enough to shatter windows in buildings as far as 25 miles away and was heard over 100 miles away. The destruction caused by the Black Tom Explosion stretched for miles, and several buildings in the surrounding areas were heavily damaged or outright destroyed. One such structure was the St. Patrick's Parish in Jersey City, located approximately 2-3 miles away from the explosion site. The building was severely damaged by the blast and subsequent shockwaves, with windows shattered, walls cracked, and portions of the structure utterly collapsing. The destruction caused by the extensive damage to St. Patrick's Parish necessitated considerable repairs, reconstruction, and renovations. This work was undertaken in the years following the explosion, with the church and its community ultimately recovering from the disaster. In conclusion, on July 30, 1916, the St. Patrick's Parish in Jersey City experienced significant damage, both structural and otherwise, due to the massive explosion at the Black Tom Island munitions depot. This event highlights the far-reaching impacts of the First World War, even affecting those who were not directly involved in the conflict and serves as a reminder of the extensive and tragic consequences of war."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He then had 21 rushing touchdowns on the year and brought his career QB record to 7 completions out of 10 attempts with 6 touchdowns. Philip Rivers, on the other hand, struggled completing 14 of 31 passes and throwing for only a 133 yards with no touchdowns and 1 interception. The Chargers swept the Raiders and had then won seven straight from Oakland. The scoring started with the Raiders  making it 7-0 after a 1-yard pass from Aaron Brooks to Reshard Lee. The Chargers answered back when Antonio Cromartie returned the ensuing kick 91 yards, which set up a 2-yard run by LT to tie the score at 7-7 going into the half. The Raiders took the lead again on a catch and run by rookie John Madsen that set up a 2-yard pass from Brooks to Madsen to make it 14-7 Oakland.  On 4th and 2, Rivers passed to Vincent Jackson for a first down, but Jackson proceeded to get up and throw the ball forward in celebration, but he hadn't been touched down. The initial ruling was that it was a fumble and Oakland's ball; however, after the officials got together for a conference they declared that since it was an illegal forward fumble that it was technically an illegal forward pass and San Diego was then given back the ball and penalized 5 yards, which was still enough for the first down. The game continued and on the next play, Rivers pitched the ball to Tomlinson as if it were a run play but then threw the ball to an open Antonio Gates to tie the score at 14-14. After forcing Oakland to punt, the Chargers drove down field and LT ran it in from 10 yards out to give the Chargers the 21-14 win. With the win, the Chargers had won 7 straight games over the Raiders and improved their record to 9-2. Question: How many times did the teams tie?

Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Now, I have a new situation: Tim the seismologist studied data from two cities: Tokyo and Kansas City. Tokyo experienced many more earthquakes than Kansas City.  Answer this question please: Which city experiences more energy release because of rocks breaking?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: Arrange a time to sit down with your parents and ask for the money. You want your parents to know that you aren't taking this situation lightly, and you'd only be asking if you needed it. You'll come across as more serious and sincere if you set up a time beforehand, rather than having a quick phone call or just casually asking for the money in passing. Depending on how large a sum you're asking for, you might want to bring some paperwork to your discussion with your parents. Show them how you calculated the exact amount that you need. Indicate how much you've been able to save to pay for the item, then ask for the remaining amount.  If you're asking for money for a specific item, find it online and print out the price. If you'd like extra money you can use as a cushion, be upfront about that. Tell them that if they give you a certain amount now, you'll be able to get on your feet and won't have to ask again. If you're going to pay them back, you might want to provide a printed installment plan or schedule they can keep. This shows that you're serious about making good on your promise. You probably have a fairly good picture of what your parents' finances are like. Still, it's better not to assume they can give or even loan you a large amount of money. Ask them if they feel comfortable with the amount you're asking for. They may tell you they simply can't afford it, or that they'd be able to give you a partial amount. Asking for money is a big favor, and your parents are entitled to making a few stipulations. They may say that they'll give you just a part of what you're asking for, or perhaps they'll say they can loan you the money if you pay it back within a short time. Your first inclination might be to get upset or angry that they didn't give you what you wanted with no strings attached. However, if you want or need the money, you'll have to accept what comes with it.  It's possible that your parents will decline to give you the money. If that's the case, see if there's anything you can do to make them feel better about giving it to you. Is there a chore or job you could do in exchange for the money? See if you can make repairs, do the grocery shopping, or help out in some other way. If they still won't budge, don't beg. Instead, try to find another way to get money. If you show your parents you're resourceful, they may even decide to help you out. If your parents decide to give you the money, it's in your best interest to tell them thanks. If you're over eighteen, your parents are no longer obligated to support you financially, so the money they hand over is a gift. If you want to go above and beyond, you could even write them a thank-you note. Your attitude will make them feel more willing to help you out in the future.","output":"To effectively ask your parents for financial assistance, it is crucial to maintain a sincere and organized approach. Begin by scheduling a designated time to sit down and discuss the matter with them, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation and the fact that you would only be asking for help if it were absolutely necessary. When preparing for the conversation, gather documentation to support your request. This may include paperwork showing how you arrived at the needed sum, evidence of your personal savings contribution, and the exact cost of the item or service if applicable. If you desire extra funds for added security, be transparent about this. Clearly conveying your financial needs and goals will illustrate your commitment to responsibly addressing the situation. In presenting your case, remain considerate of your parents' financial circumstances and avoid making assumptions about their ability to provide assistance. Ask if they are comfortable with the amount you are requesting and be prepared to negotiate, keeping in mind that they have the right to establish conditions or offer partial support. If your parents agree to loan you the money and you intend to repay them, provide a printed repayment schedule to further demonstrate your dedication to fulfilling your promise. In the event they decline your request, explore alternative methods of earning the funds, such as offering to complete chores or tasks in exchange for the money. Demonstrating resourcefulness may persuade them to reconsider. Regardless of the outcome, express gratitude for any support they are able to provide. Remember that, if you are over eighteen years old, their financial assistance is a generous gift and not an obligation. Exhibiting a positive and appreciative attitude will not only strengthen your relationship but also increase the likelihood of their willingness to help in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If Encourage personal investment in postsecondary education, can we conclude that \\"If you don't encourage person investment in postsecondary education you will fail. \\"?","output":"It is important not to jump to the conclusion that if you don't encourage personal investment in postsecondary education, you will necessarily fail. Encouraging personal investment in postsecondary education can bring numerous benefits, such as enhanced skills, career opportunities, and personal development. However, it is not the only factor that contributes to an individual's success or failure in life. The statement, \\"If you don't encourage personal investment in postsecondary education, you will fail,\\" makes an assumption that success is solely linked to postsecondary education, which is not the case. There are several factors and pathways that contribute to an individual's success in life, and postsecondary education may only be one of these factors. 1. Different learning styles and preferences: Not all individuals are suited to the traditional postsecondary education format, and they may learn better through alternative methods such as vocational training, apprenticeships, or on-the-job training. In these cases, personal investment in postsecondary education may not result in success if it doesn't align with their learning style and preferences. 2. Varied definitions of success: Everyone has different definitions of success. For some, success may be linked to obtaining a prestigious job or earning a specific salary, while for others, success could mean being content and satisfied with their work and personal life balance. Encouraging personal investment in postsecondary education is not universally applicable to achieve success, as it may not be the priority or goal for all individuals. 3. Availability of opportunities: Various factors can impact an individual's opportunities, such as socio-economic background, geographic location, and personal connections. Encouraging personal investment in postsecondary education may not be enough to guarantee success if an individual does not have equal access to opportunities and resources. 4. Importance of soft skills: While postsecondary education can certainly enhance an individual's technical skills and knowledge in a particular field, success in the workforce often depends on soft skills such as communication, collaboration, problem-solving, and adaptability. These skills may not necessarily be developed through postsecondary education but can instead be nurtured through other experiences and personal development. 5. Changing job market: The rapidly changing job market and rise of various industries make it difficult to predict the long-term relevance of certain degrees or qualifications. Encouraging personal investment in postsecondary education may not guarantee success if the chosen field of study or occupation becomes obsolete in the future. Thus, while encouraging personal investment in postsecondary education can indeed contribute to an individual's likelihood of success, it is not the sole determinant. Success is multi-faceted and influenced by various factors. To develop a comprehensive approach towards success, it is important to consider individual goals, unique circumstances, and various pathways that align with an individual's strengths and preferences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Television drama's whole point is to bring you through an often slow start, followed by a complex development to a point where there are two or three potential dénouements before, \\"Cut!\\", it is the end of the episode and you will have to await the \\"right answer\\" in the following week's show. This post came to me at 10pm last night, on Day 16 of this challenge, after a day of holidaying in London and with my head (and feet) too weary to put finger to touchscreen. Mrs Mc and I had just watched another live instalment of Broadchurch, murder mystery extraordinaire, particularly since in the second series there is no actual fresh murder to investigate. The verdict is about to be given on the accused killer from Series 1 when the inevitable happens... Cue title music. This moment has even gained a moniker in British homes, based on the theme tune to the real masters of the four-times-a-week cliffhanger, London-based soap opera Eastenders. It's call a \\"ba...ba...ba...ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba\\" (YouTube will provide overseas readers with auditory explanation). Eastenders is such a master of writing in the perfect pace that every 28 minute episode ends with a tantalising screen freeze on the latest shocked face / smirking baddy / confused victim. For really big stories the cliffhanger can last significantly longer. This week, to celebrate the show's 30 year birthday, we will finally find out the answer to a question unanswered for the past 14 months: \\"Who killed Lucy Beale?\\" Now, most classrooms do not involve murder, incest, dodgy deals and danger, but \\"good teaching\\" encourages a type of pacing that totally ignores the ingredients that have millions in the edges of their seats every day: the good old cliffhanger. In fact, we see teachers giving away the punchline at the beginning: \\"Today we are learning this:...\\" Why does the drama have a cliffhanger? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. because the drama involves danger  B. because the pacing encourages audience to keep watching for updates  C. not enough information  D. because the drama has tales to relate Answer:","output":"B. because the pacing encourages audience to keep watching for updates Television dramas often employ the use of cliffhangers to keep the audience captivated and eager to follow the story. The whole point of a television drama is to bring viewers through an often slow start, followed by a complex development where there are multiple potential dénouements, eventually concluding with an end-of-episode cliffhanger. This structure ensures that the audience will have to wait until the next episode, or even longer, as in the case of Eastenders, to get the \\"right answer\\" or resolution to the mystery or storyline. The most important reason for this approach is because it effectively maintains the audience's interest. By incorporating engaging plot developments and storytelling devices like cliffhangers, the pacing of the drama encourages viewers to keep tuning in for updates. This is a key aspect to the success and longevity of popular television dramas, as a substantial and loyal audience is essential for their continued production. Furthermore, the use of cliffhangers can have an impact on the way viewers discuss, think, and analyze the content of television dramas. A compelling cliffhanger can prompt people to talk about the story with their friends, family or coworkers and engage them in speculation about upcoming events. This word-of-mouth promotion helps in expanding and maintaining the show's viewership, and sustains the audience's emotional investment in the series. Overall, the purpose of a cliffhanger in television drama is to effectively maintain the audience's attention by capitalizing on what they find most engaging about the story. By keeping viewers on the edge of their seats, the pacing encourages them to continue watching for updates, ultimately ensuring the drama's success and longevity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lady Sarah's husband is murdered shortly before she arrives, and the authorities tell her that the killer is an Aboriginal elder, \\"King George\\".

Does the word \\"score\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","output":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"score\\" is used with two different meanings. It is important to analyze each sentence separately to understand the meanings in their respective contexts. 1. \\"Add it to my score and I'll settle later.\\" In this sentence, \\"score\\" refers to the total amount at which someone owes or is owed. Here, it is being used to express the total sum of a debt or credit. It is typically used when someone has an ongoing account or tab with a business, such as a bar, where they receive goods or services and pay for them at a later time. In this context, the speaker is asking to add the current transaction to their existing account, and they will pay for it later. 2. \\"A score were sent out but only one returned.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"score\\" has a different meaning. Here, \\"score\\" is being used as an alternative term to express 20 units of something, which is a well-known definition. This usage is based on the traditional counting system that was used in England long ago. In the given context, the term \\"score\\" is referring to the number of items or individuals sent out, which is equal to 20. The sentence is stating that 20 units of something were dispatched, but only one of those units made its way back. In conclusion, it is important to pay attention to the context in which a word is used, as it can often have multiple meanings or connotations. In the case of the word \\"score\\" in these two sentences, the first usage represents the total debt or credit sum, while the second one signifies a set of 20 units."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the title of this article: Hume maintained that all knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, cannot be conclusively established by reason. Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method — that of the problem of induction. Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past. Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.

The statement primarily discusses the presence of subsidiary temples within the premises of the Govindaraja temple, such as the Parthasarathi temple and the Kalyana Venkateswara temple. Furthermore, it mentions the individual shrines for Pundarika Valli, Alwars, Lakshmi Narayana Swami, and others. Based on this context, it becomes apparent that the <MASK> token should be the name of a deity or a divine figure associated with these temples. Comparing the given options: Option A: இராமானுசர் (Ramanuja) - This name is already mentioned later in the same sentence, so it would not make logical sense to repeat it. Option B: விசுவாமித்திரருக்கும் (For Vishvamitra) - This word doesn't fit the context well, as the other names mentioned are mainly Vaishnavite figures and traditions, while Vishvamitra is not directly connected to the context of these temples as Vishvamitra is one of the Saptarshis and is often considered as the patron of Rama. Option C: ஆண்டாள் (Andal) - This is a suitable name to replace the <MASK> because Andal is one of the 12 Alwars (saints in Vaishnavism), and it would fit the context since other Alwars and Vaishnavite figures are mentioned in the sentence. Option D: இராமானுசரால் (By Ramanuja) - This word has a different meaning (by/through Ramanuja) and does not fit the context, as the sentence is apprehending the presence of individual shrines and not referring to the action done by Ramanuja.

Production capacity in Britain and the United States was improved by the invention of the cotton gin by the American Eli Whitney in 1793. Before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s a number of crude ginning machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor, making large-scale production uneconomical in the United States, even with the use of humans as slave labor. The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from Henry Odgen Holmes, for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796. Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire, and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in West Africa, India, and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong). What business development did the British use to establish a hold on the global cotton market?","output":"The British used the improvement in technology, like the cotton gin, to establish a hold on the global cotton market.

A:","output":"Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur was a pioneering environmental toxicologist who studied the effects of the historic air inversion event known as the Donora Smog of 1948, which killed 20 people and adversely affected the health of thousands of others. The Donora Smog occurred in the mill town of Donora, Pennsylvania, from October 27th to October 31st, 1948. The disaster was a result of a weather phenomenon called temperature inversion, a situation where a layer of warm air traps cold air and pollutants beneath it, leading to poor air quality and reduced dispersion of pollutants. During this period, pollutants from local industries, including U.S. Steel's Donora Zinc Works and American Steel & Wire Company, were trapped close to the ground due to the temperature inversion. This created a dense smog over the town, causing visibility to decrease dramatically. The trapped pollutants consisted of sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and metal dust, which had a severe impact on the health of the town's residents. Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur investigated this tragic event, focusing on understanding the effects of the toxic air pollution on human health. Through her research, she collected and analyzed data on the symptoms experienced by the affected individuals and linked the rise in respiratory and cardiovascular problems to the trapped pollutants. Amdur's study also helped identify the various components of the smog that were responsible for causing such detrimental health effects. The Donora Smog disaster led to increased awareness of the dangers of air pollution and was an impetus for the implementation of stronger environmental policies in the United States. Amdur's research significantly contributed to the foundation of modern environmental toxicology, and her work laid the groundwork for future environmental protection policies, ultimately culminating in the Clean Air Act of 1963 and its subsequent amendments. In summary, Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur studied the effects of the historic Donora Smog of 1948, a severe air inversion event that killed 20 people and impacted the health of thousands of residents. Her research played a crucial role in understanding the implications of air pollution and laid the groundwork for stronger environmental policies and regulations in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

James threw a shoe at the window and got it broken. The  OPT:  a). window is pretty hard.;  b). shoe is pretty hard.;","output":"James threw a shoe at the window and got it broken. The logical conclusion would be that either the window or the shoe was particularly hard, as different materials and constructions would result in varying levels of damage.  Step 1: Analyze the available options. Option A suggests that the window is pretty hard. This implies that the window should not be easily broken, so if it was, the impact of the shoe must have been quite forceful. Option B suggests that the shoe is pretty hard. This implies that the shoe is made of a durable material or has a solid construction, which increases its likelihood of causing damage.  Step 2: Consider additional factors. In cases where windows break due to impact, the force of the thrown object and the window's durability will play crucial roles. The same applies to the shoe's construction and materials used. It is important to note that even a not-so-hard shoe can break a fragile window if thrown with enough force, and vice versa. Step 3: Choose the most plausible option. Since the text already mentions that the window was broken, and we are considering the reasons, it would be more logical to mention the shoe's hardness. This would provide a possible explanation for the breakage. Step 4: Finalize the text. James threw a shoe at the window and got it broken.

Write a text based on this summary: sunni group to boycott iraq elections Text:","output":"Title: Sunni Group Announces Boycott of Upcoming Iraq Elections A prominent Sunni group in Iraq has declared its intention to boycott the scheduled national elections, casting a shadow over the democratic process in the country. The group has expressed concerns regarding the fairness and transparency of the electoral process, ultimately deciding that they will not participate in the approaching elections. The Sunni group's decision to withdraw from the election comes amidst growing political unrest and skepticism about the ability of the Iraq government to ensure fair representation for all. This boycott echoes similar actions taken by minority groups in Iraq's previous elections and serves as a reminder of the ongoing difficulties in achieving political unity in a nation with such diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds. The concerns raised by the group include apprehensions about the electoral system's potential vulnerability to manipulation and fraud, the lack of an independent monitoring body to oversee the electoral process, and the possibility of widespread voter intimidation. In response to the boycott announcement, the Iraqi government has called for national unity and urged the Sunni community to participate in the elections to guarantee their representation in the government. However, the Sunni group's reluctance to engage in the electoral process could result in a further marginalization of their community, deepening the existing religious and political division in the war-torn nation. As the elections draw closer, the international community is also monitoring the situation closely to ensure that the democratic process in Iraq progresses in a just and inclusive manner. It remains to be seen whether the Sunni group's boycott will ultimately lead to meaningful change in the nation's electoral processes and contribute to the long-term stability of Iraq, or if it will merely exacerbate the existing divisions and perpetuate the cycle of conflict and instability."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - free flowing - translucent - sparse - slender - clear  The answer is \\"sparse\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer to the question is \\"sparse\\" because when an area is not thick with resources, it implies that the resources are thinly scattered or distributed over a large area, making them harder to find or collect in that particular region. Let's discuss the other options to better understand why they do not correctly answer the question: 1. Free flowing: This term refers to something that moves or circulates easily and smoothly, usually in reference to a liquid or a substance with fluid characteristics. Resources that are free flowing could be abundant or scarce, and therefore, this term does not specifically denote that the resources in an area are limited or thinly scattered. 2. Translucent: This term describes a material or substance that allows light to pass through it, but not clearly enough to see distinct shapes or images. Translucence is more a physical property of a material, rather than a descriptor of resource distribution or abundance. Therefore, it is not relevant to the question. 3. Slender: Slender generally means thin or narrow, often in reference to a person's body shape or to objects such as tools or devices. Though slender could be loosely related to the idea of resources being limited or thinly distributed, it is not the most specific or accurate term for describing the distribution of resources in this context. 4. Clear: Clear generally refers to either the absence of obstructions or the transparency of a medium. In the context of resources, \\"clear\\" might imply that they are easily accessible or visible, but it does not specifically describe the distribution or abundance of the resources in an area. In conclusion, \\"sparse\\" is the most accurate answer for describing a situation where resources are not thick or abundant in an area. A sparse distribution of resources indicates that they are spread thinly, making it more challenging to find or obtain these resources, as opposed to a region where resources are densely packed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: My old roommate’s cats, Clise and Monkey, were about as different as cats could be. Clise, rescued as an emaciated kitten from a local park, grew up to be morbidly obese. His interests mainly involved eating food, begging for food, or going around the neighborhood scrounging for food. He could hear a can opener from a mile away. Monkey was a more active cat. He liked to chase the laser pointer and was the first to run to the door when someone arrived. But he could also be lazy, lounging in a sunbeam or stretched out on the couch. Both of them liked to watch TV. Soon after I moved in, I started having health issues which necessitated a lot of time lounging around myself. This was the era of reality TV, back when much of it was actually good. The cats, Monkey especially, watched with me. Monkey definitely had his preferences. His favorite shows were The Girls Next Door and Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making The Team. Notice a theme here? Playboy Playmates and professional cheerleaders. Monkey liked his T & A (tits and ass). If one of these shows was on, and I turned it to Project Runway or something, Monkey would march off. But as soon as I turned it back, and he could hear the high-pitched giggling, he’d come running back. Clise’s favorite shows were Top Chef, Iron Chef, and Rachael Ray. Food porn. If there was something he especially craved, like a shrimp stir-fry, he’d assume a begging pose, right in front of the TV, as if Rachael might take pity on him and throw him a scrap or two. I moved out about a year later. A few months previous, Monkey ended up catching some wasting disease and dying, but Clise, as far as I know, is still there, begging for scraps from anyone he can — in real life or televised.

The Berg mountains in Berg county are of a volcanic nature, very massive, few caves. The Gorge mountains in Gorge county are made of sedimentary rocks, predominantly limestone. They were exposed to water and that lead to karst lanscapes, caves, blue holes, stalactites and stalagmites.  Hint: About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years.

Information:  - Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe ( SWOTL ) is a World War II air - combat flight simulation video game released in August 1991 and expanded in 1992 by LucasFilm Games . It is a MS - DOS game for IBM PC compatibles . It was the last of a trilogy of World War II titles by LucasFilm Games , the others being Battlehawks 1942 ( 1988 ) and Their Finest Hour ( 1989 ) . It enabled the player to fly aircraft of the USAAF Eighth Air Force and the German Luftwaffe , including some experimental aircraft that did not see operational service during World War II. The game was initially released with a codewheel and a 225 - page manual , detailing the air war over Western Europe between 1943 and 1945 . The game also featured a campaign mode , similar to that found in \`\` Their Finest Hour '' , where the player had to make the strategic decisions on which targets were to be attacked ( as USAAF 8th Air Force ) or defended ( by the German Luftwaffe ) . Some gameplay elements included , such as the historic missions section , are evident in later Lawrence Holland games including X-Wing .  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.  - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.  - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced.  - Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC is an American film and television production company based in the Letterman Digital Arts Center in San Francisco, California. The studio is best known for creating and producing the \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\" franchises, as well as its leadership in developing special effects, sound and computer animation for film. Lucasfilm was founded by filmmaker George Lucas in 1971 in San Rafael, California; most of the company's operations were moved to San Francisco in 2005. The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 at a valuation of 4.06 billion.  - The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted.  - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. It is the birthplace of the United Nations. Located at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula, San Francisco is about in area, making it the smallest countyand the only consolidated city-countywithin the state of California. With a density of about 18,451 people per square mile (7,124 people per km), San Francisco is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in California and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City. San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose, and the 13th-most populous city in the United Stateswith a census-estimated 2015 population of 864,816. The city and its surrounding areas are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, and are a part of the larger OMB-designated San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated population of 8.7 million.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - George Walton Lucas Jr. (born May 14, 1944) is an American filmmaker and entrepreneur. He is best known as the creator of the \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\" franchises, as well as the founder of Lucasfilm and Industrial Light & Magic.

The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - The Letterman Digital Arts Center, located in the Presidio, San Francisco, became the new combined home of Industrial Light and Magic, LucasArts, and Lucasfilm's marketing, online, and licensing units in 2005.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.

It is about an hour into the movie before we have much idea of what it is supposed to be about; the characters often mumble inaudibly; actions frequently seem to have no relation to each other; nobody seems to be concerned about who actually murdered the girl; a pair of spooky kids go swimming in waters that seem threatening but nothing happens; the Irishman gets punched in the face by one of his buddies for no apparent reason ... to continue would be as boring as the movie itself. The only half-entertaining element is the landscape photography; but anyone could point a camera at the Australian outback a get memorable shots.

Bill tired to light a candle during the wind storm, but the","output":"relentless gusts of wind kept extinguishing the feeble flame each time. He knew he had little time left. As the storm roared outside the small wooden cabin, the shadows of trees danced menacingly on the walls. Bill struggled to maintain his composure, as the darkness in the room seemed to close in around him. Bill began to think of his family who lived a few miles down the hill. Desperation crept in as he realized how vital it was for him to light the candle and send a signal, a beacon of hope and safety to them. He fetched a cardboard box from the corner, hoping to create a barrier around the candle to protect the flame from the gale. Positioning the box carefully, he tried again to light the candle. This time, tiny hints of orange flickered to life on the wick, glowing defiantly even as the wind outside seemed eager to snuff them out. Bill carefully shielded the flame with his hand and watched as it slowly grew, casting a warm and welcoming glow across the dimly-lit room. A sigh of relief escaped him as he watched the flame finally hold its ground. Bill knew that he had to act swiftly, for his family's safety was on the line. In preparation, he had mounted a mirror near the window to reflect and amplify the light from the candle. He tilted the mirror so that it reflected the candlelight towards the hill where his family resided. Even before the storm had hit, they had planned this as an emergency communication method, should anything go wrong. Elsewhere, his family huddled together, shivering in fear as the storm battered their home. They heard the chilling howls of the wind, the rain pounding against their windows as if demanding to be let in. Their hearts heavy with worry and uncertainty, they looked up the hill anxiously, their eyes searching for any sign of hope. Suddenly, a faint glimmer of light appeared in the distance. As they stared intently at it, they could see that it fluctuated slightly, obviously fighting against the wind's persistent attempts to snuff it out. Hope blossomed in their hearts. It was Bill's signal. He was safe, and he must have found refuge in the cabin. Even though the storm raged on, the small but determined flame continued to flicker through the gloom, serving as a reassuring reminder that they were not alone in their fight. Filled with a renewed sense of determination, Bill's family took every measure they could to protect their home and endure the tempest together, knowing that they could lean on each other for strength in the face of danger. Outside the cabin, Bill continued to keep vigil, occasionally refreshing the melted candle to ensure the flame continued to burn. The storm showed no signs of relenting, and his family's safety was still uncertain, yet the simple act of keeping the candle lit helped forge an unbreakable bond among them all, an invisible link that assured them that they were enduring this ordeal as one. Hours passed, and finally, the storm seemed to diminish. The wind gradually lost its ferocity, and the perpetual downpour slowed to a gentle mist. As the daylight broke through the clouds, an indescribable sense of relief washed over Bill, and he knew they'd made it through the storm. When the skies cleared and the storm had completely passed, Bill ventured outside the cabin, his heart overflowing with gratitude that they had all survived. Through immense struggle, he'd helped to keep his family bound together through a tiny, flickering light—a beacon of hope amidst the darkness. United and resilient, they would now move forward, stronger than ever."},{"instruction":"Q: What is the only substance on earth that is stable in all three states?

Yes;","output":"[a]. No; A burn injury to the skin may vary in severity and can be categorized into three degrees based on the depth and extent of the damage caused: 1. First-degree burn: This type of burn affects only the top layer of the skin (epidermis) and causes redness, mild swelling, and pain. First-degree burns are usually managed with home care and do not require a visit to a burn center. 2. Second-degree burn: This type of burn affects the first two layers of the skin (epidermis and dermis). It causes a more intense reddening of the skin, along with blisters, severe pain, and edema (swelling). Some second-degree burns can be treated with home care, while others require medical attention. 3. Third-degree burn: This type of burn affects all the layers of the skin (epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue), resulting in a charring of the skin, which may appear white, leathery, or dark brown. Third-degree burns are the most severe and always require immediate medical attention. When a person experiences a severe burn, they should be taken to a specialized burn care facility, such as a burn center.

Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of less coal being burned will have a direct effect on the process of generating electricity in a coal-fired steam station. Since coal is the primary fuel source for heating the water and producing steam in this system, burning less coal will result in less heat generation. Consequently, this will produce less steam, which will then exert less force on the turning mechanism. With less force applied, the mechanism will generate less electricity. Therefore, the perturbation of burning less coal will directly lead to less electricity being produced in the coal-fired steam station."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Who gives Susan's brother a rock?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  LA siblings Ted and Susan Johnson join their parents in Kenya where their father, Earl, works at a NASA tracking station, and their mother, Jean, works at a clinic. Ted's dreams of roughing it on the savannah are squashed when Jean leads him into a house that looks like it belongs in Pasadena, California. Although Jean forbids her children to explore, Ted and Susan sneak out to a nearby watering hole to meet with a Masai tribal boy named Morogo. Morogo shows the siblings the wildlife of Kenya and they show him how to play video games. One day, Jean comes home to discover Morogo in her home. Ted and Susan plead with their parents to let Morogo be their guide and the parents reluctantly give in. One day, Ted kicks a soccer ball over a barrier and it lands against a sleeping rhino. Morogo sneaks up on the animal, retrieves the ball, and places a small stone on the rhino's side. He then gives Ted another stone, daring him to do the same. The rhino awakens as Ted nears, causing him to flee. A laughing Morogo tells him that a person must approach a rhino downwind or it will smell him. Kipoin, Morogo's father, is displeased his son is keeping company with Americans, because they are \\"cattle eaters\\" and is even more disgusted to learn they eat fish. One day, the trio comes across a cheetah cub whose mother has been killed by a poacher. Susan insists they take the cub home and talk their parents into letting them raise it. The cub, Duma, becomes the household pet, playing ball, wrestling, and riding in the family car. Ted trains her to come when he blows a whistle. A few months later, however, the Johnson family are convinced their children, who are about to return to the U.S., to free Duma and train her to hunt according to the advice of an Australian game warden named Larry. Answer:","output":"Morogo gives Susan's brother (Ted) a rock."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

I should have downloaded \\"Land of Shame\\" for a dollar, instead. Is the review positive or negative? The answer is:","output":"The review is primarily negative.  The reviewer begins by mentioning that they had high expectations for the album, hoping that a few tracks would be similar to the brilliant song \\"Land of Shame.\\" This statement initially shows that the reviewer enjoys the song \\"Land of Shame\\" and had a positive expectation for the album as a whole, based on their experience with this particular song. However, as the review progresses, it becomes evident that the reviewer's expectations were not met, and their feelings towards the album are, in fact, largely negative. They express their disappointment by stating that the remainder of \\"Music for People\\" was \\"marginalized with a heavy orchestra and Creed-style vocals.\\" This suggests that the other tracks on the album did not appeal to the reviewer's preferences and fell short of the standard set by \\"Land of Shame.\\" The reviewer concludes their review by stating that they should have downloaded \\"Land of Shame\\" for a dollar instead of purchasing the entire album. This further emphasizes their negative sentiments towards the album and implies a regret for their purchase decision. They believe they would have been better off simply acquiring the one song they enjoyed, instead of investing in the full album which did not meet their expectations. While the review does contain a positive aspect in the appreciation for the song \\"Land of Shame,\\" it is overall a negative review. The critical tone in the description of the other songs and the overall dissatisfaction with the album demonstrates that the reviewer did not find \\"Music for People\\" to be a worthwhile purchase, and they share their negative experience to inform potential listeners of their perspective."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Anna looked for a plant for her house, and chose a fern over a frond, because the","output":"fern had a lush, delicate appearance that she thought would brighten up her home and add some fresh air. The fronds would have been lovely too, but their strikingly bold, rigid appearance didn't quite fit with the aesthetic she had in mind for her space. After making her decision, Anna carefully picked up the fern plant, ensuring that it wasn't damaged during transportation. As she carried the fern back to her house, she felt a sense of satisfaction knowing this was the perfect addition to her living area that would not only beautify her home, but also provide much-needed oxygen and tranquility. Upon arriving home, Anna placed the fern on her living room window sill, giving it ample access to natural sunlight. To ensure its survival and successful growth, Anna diligently researched how to properly take care of her new addition. She read about how ferns typically thrive in environments with consistent moisture and humidity, so she misted the plant daily and watered it as per the instructions she found online. To further invest in the care of her fern, Anna decided to buy a decorative plant pot to accentuate its beauty. She chose a stylish ceramic pot with intricate designs that she felt matched the visual appeal of the fern. Anna repotted the plant and placed it back in its original spot on the window sill. The intricate pot complemented the fern perfectly, and Anna couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride as she admired her handiwork. As the days went by, Anna became increasingly attached to her fern and made sure it was thriving under her care. She continued her daily routine of misting and watering the plant, and she diligently rotated it so that all the fronds received equal amounts of sunlight. One day, while observing the fern, Anna noticed that it had begun to grow small, vibrant green leaves. Excited and encouraged by the progress, she took this as a sign that her nurturing was paying off and decided to introduce more plants into her living space. Anna's collection included a variety of plant species, each with unique care requirements which she was eager to learn about. Over time, her once barren living area began to transform into a lush, vibrant, and rejuvenating indoor garden. The increased oxygen levels and natural aromas provided by her plants created a pleasantly refreshing atmosphere that friends and family noticed as soon as they stepped inside the house. People often commented on how happy and alive Anna's home now seemed, and these compliments motivated her to expand her indoor garden further. The process became therapeutic for Anna, as she found solace in caring for her plants and witnessing their growth. It challenged her in the best way, making her realize that with the right care and attention, she too could flourish, just like her beloved plants. Year after year, Anna's indoor garden continued to thrive. Her collection grew as she nurtured endangered plant species, rare herbs, and various exotic flowers. In many ways, the plants became an extension of her identity, reflecting her commitment to growth, transformation, and care. As she gazed out upon her ever-growing garden, Anna looked back at her decision to choose the fern over the frond and realized that this seemingly simple decision had led her down a life-changing path full of growth, self-realization, and an unending curiosity for nurturing the natural world around her."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Question: Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize? Answer:  A. because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations. B. because President Moon wants him to. C. because he said he would. D. not enough information. Answer:","output":"A. because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The M606 Motorway is a relatively short link motorway connecting the city of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England, to the M62 Motorway. It is approximately 2.5 miles (4 km) in length and was officially opened for use in 1973.  The purpose of the M606 is to provide a direct link from Bradford to the major motorway network of the United Kingdom, and in particular, to the M62, which runs from East to West across the country, connecting Liverpool on the west coast to Kingston upon Hull on the east, with Manchester and Leeds along the way, among other destinations. The M62 also forms a junction with the M1 motorway, a significant north-south artery, further enhancing the strategic importance of the M606 for Bradford's connectivity. The M606 also forms an integral part of the region's transportation infrastructure. Alongside its functional aspect of relieving local and through traffic pressure by removing the necessity of passing through residential areas or busy town centres, it helps support the economy of the region by enhancing its transport links, thereby fueling economic growth and development. In terms of its layout, starting from its southern end, the M606 leaves the M62 at Junction 26, which is also the location of a major inter-regional retail and leisure complex. It then runs northwards to terminate at a roundabout junction with the A6177 Bradford Ring Road, after having served junctions leading to various local destinations such as Staygate and Rooley Lane. Thus, the M606, while relatively short in length, plays an essential role in the region's road travel and transportation system by connecting Bradford directly to the M62, and thereby to the broader UK motorway network."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Barry Brown is with the Mobile Life Centre in Stockholm,Sweden.He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States.There he borrowed a GPSequipped car to use during his stay.Mr Brown says,\\"They just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination.And,then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived.They actually put their home address in.So again,the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\\" Mr Brown says this is a common human error,but what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings,or failures,of GPS equipment.He says,\\"One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn.Because they just give you the next turn,sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the overview that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place.\\" Mr Brown says,\\"One of the things that struck us,perhaps the most important thing was that you have to know what you're doing when you use a GPS.There are these new skills that people have developed.There are these new competencies   that you need to have to be able to use a GPS because they sometimes go wrong.This goes against a common belief that GPS systems are for passive drivers who lack navigational skills.\\" Barry Brown says to make GPS systems better we need a better understanding of how drivers,passengers and GPS systems work together. Question: The example of Barry Brown's friend is used to show that  _  . Options: A: GPS is nothing but garbage B: GPS is still not accurate enough C: it is difficult for drivers to use GPS equipment D: sometimes drivers are responsible for the problem","output":"The example of Barry Brown's friend is used to show that sometimes drivers are responsible for the problem. In the given situation, his friend mistakenly entered a wrong address, which led to them driving in the wrong direction. This instance highlights that although GPS systems can sometimes be inaccurate or present shortcomings, the drivers themselves can also contribute to a problem occurring. Therefore, the correct answer to the question would be option D: sometimes drivers are responsible for the problem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: The standards have been revised to require a description of the property transfer transaction; if the fair value is known, nothing would preclude reporting it. Sentence 2: They have revised the standards, said the news. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Step 1: Understand both sentences. Sentence 1 states that the standards (likely referring to some set of regulations or guidelines) have been changed to require a certain type of description. It also mentions a condition involving fair value and reporting. Sentence 2 simplifies the concept by saying that the standards have been revised, according to the news. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between both sentences. Both sentences mention that the standards have been revised, which is a similar piece of information. However, Sentence 1 provides more details about the changes and conditions, while Sentence 2 is more general and mentions the news as the source of the information. Step 3: Determine if Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1. While both sentences have similarities, Sentence 2 does not include all the information provided in Sentence 1. It only contains the general idea of the standards being revised but leaves out the details about the description, fair value, and reporting. Additionally, Sentence 1 does not mention the news as a source. Conclusion: Sentence 2 is partially entailed by Sentence 1 because it conveys the same idea of the standards being revised. However, the second sentence doesn't include all the information from the first sentence, and it mentions the news as the source, which is not mentioned in the first sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

[substeps] Though citrus trees may seem to have a lot of common, significant differences between breeds and varieties do exist. Learn how much water, sunlight, and fertilizer is required to support the citrus trees under your care. Can we infer the following? water sunlight and fertilizer are not required for the plants.","output":"No, we cannot infer that water, sunlight, and fertilizer are not required for the plants. On the contrary, the information provided emphasizes the importance of knowing exactly how much water, sunlight, and fertilizer are needed to support the appropriate growth and development of the citrus trees under your care. To manage a citrus tree nursery, let's dive into a more detailed plan that will help you efficiently maintain and care for these trees: 1. Proper spacing and layout: Start by planning the layout of your nursery. Ensure the citrus trees have adequate space between them to allow room for growth, sufficient air circulation, and easy access for regular maintenance. It is essential to space the trees in a manner that will minimize the spread of any disease or pests. For example, typically, a distance of 4 to 6 meters (13 to 20 feet) between trees is recommended. 2. Soil preparation: Citrus trees need well-draining soil with a pH level between 6.0 and 7.0. Ensure the soil in your nursery is suitable for their growth or make necessary improvements (e.g., adding organic matter) before planting the trees. 3. Planting healthy trees: Obtain healthy and certified plants from reliable sources. Inspect the plants for any signs of disease or pests before introducing them to your nursery. 4. Irrigation: Different citrus tree varieties may have different water requirements, but generally, they all require a consistent and deep watering schedule to ensure strong root development and a healthy tree. Too little or too much water can affect the overall health and productivity of the tree, so it's crucial to provide the right amount. Typically, young trees require about 2-3 gallons of water per week, while mature trees need around 8-12 gallons. 5. Fertilization: Regular fertilization is essential for citrus tree growth and fruit production. A well-balanced fertilizer with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is recommended. The age, size, and variety of the tree, as well as local soil conditions, will determine the exact fertilizer requirements. Consult local agricultural authorities or experienced citrus growers for advice on fertilization in your specific area. 6. Pruning: Regular pruning helps maintain the overall shape and size of the tree, promotes air circulation, and encourages fruit production. Remove dead or diseased branches and any growth that obstructs access to sunlight. 7. Pest and disease management: Regularly inspect your citrus trees for signs of pests or diseases. Some common citrus pests include aphids, scale insects, and spider mites, while common diseases include citrus canker, greening, and root rot. Implement an integrated pest management strategy that combines cultural, biological, and chemical controls to prevent and manage pest infestations and diseases. 8. Monitoring the overall health of your citrus trees: Keep a close eye on your citrus trees so you can quickly address any early signs of stress, pests, or diseases. Regularly check leaves, fruits, and stems for indications of issues and take corrective action as necessary. In conclusion, managing a citrus tree nursery requires proper planning, knowledge of the specific needs of the citrus trees, and constant monitoring to ensure the trees remain healthy and productive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the British. The film effectively blames the people of NI as being the cause of their own troubles. It suggests that the 25 year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with Britain's partition of Ireland and domination of its history i.e. NI was created by Britain in 1921 irrespective of the wishes of the rest of Ireland. The characters are portrayed as hapless fools, even though I despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause - maintaining their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is a known fact that British Intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war, no doubt to keep the Catholics at bay and demoralise republicanism. Nineties' values about 'machismo', masculinity etc are transposed on to 1970s Belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique Irish 'psyche' which leads to violence. The stupid song from the woman in the club - old Ireland of green fields ..blah..blah.. - is given a symbolic stature, i.e. poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause.

Choose your answer from: 1. Chris is a senior citizen .. 2. Chris is a middle - aged .. 3. Chris is a young man .. 4. Chris is a kid ..","output":"Based on the given information and context in which the conversation takes place, we can deduce that Chris is most likely a young man (option 3). Let's examine the different reasons that support this conclusion: 1. Vocabulary and slang: The use of the word \\"geezer\\" and phrases like \\"innit\\" suggest that Chris is familiar with modern slang, which is typically more common among younger people. This implies that he keeps up with contemporary culture and language. 2. Lively conversation: The fact that Chris was able to overhear your conversation and chime in casually suggests that he is sociable, confident, and energetic. These traits are more commonly associated with young people than with senior citizens, middle-aged, or kids. 3. Knowledge about the Hefner pad: Chris's awareness of the Hefner pad, along with its luxurious features like a Jacuzzi on the roof, suggests that he is relatively young and in touch with popular trends or tastes. The lifestyle associated with the Hefner pad appeals more to younger individuals who enjoy a more lavish and exciting way of life. 4. The nature of the invitation: The suggestion to move into the Hefner pad, even if just for a few days, seems to be the kind of offer that a young person would.make. It implies a spontaneous, carefree attitude that may be less plausible for a senior citizen, middle-aged person, or a kid. While it is entirely possible that Chris could be of a different age than what these observations suggest, the given context and information provide a stronger indication that Chris is a young man.

Its main character Julian, played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by Brosnan, is not your typical hero. Julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid-life crises. Having spent 22 years in the profession of cold blooded murder he now finds himself stressed out and desperately lonely. And so, after a chance meeting at a bar with Danny (Greg Kinnear), he latches on and begins a halting, awkward friendship. Danny, the quintessential nice guy, is dealing with some stuff in his own life and, truth be told, could use a friend as well. The two make an unexpected connection, and Danny sticks around to hear Julian's story, even after learning the \\"unsavory\\" truth about Julian's work. Matador approaches a subject not completely unheard of in cinema, the anti-hero assassin (films like 'Assassins' and 'Grosse Pointe Blank' come to mind). But Matador differs in several key ways. First of all, the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail, meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you. And second, unlike most anti-hero films, Matador makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character. Julian's job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is' kind of thing. This is unusual, given that 99.99% of us would consider killing for money horrific. And yet this unorthodox approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic. Although we don't like to admit it, almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough, maybe even murder. Did Julian's victims deserve to die? Who is paying to have people killed? Who knows. The movie never deals with these questions. The focus is on Julian and his stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship. If you read about someone like Julian in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer, but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity. Sympathy for the devil, I guess. Brosnan's take on Julian is well done and deeply unsettling. He doesn't completely divorce himself from his James Bond good looks and smooth charm, but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix. Weird or crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance. It keeps you guessing about his grasp on his sanity and how it will affect those around him. It's a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while he plays, but it works. The films only other major role, that of Danny, is not nearly as meaty. Kinnear turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular Joe with a regular Joe life and problems. The film doesn't really have any huge shocks or M Night Shyamalan twists, but I wasn't able to guess the ending and it felt satisfying. It doesn't have any deep philosophical or spiritual insights and yet it felt very human. And it didn't have any heart pounding car chases or gun battles and yet I thought the pacing was well done and I was never bored. Maybe the only real message here is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another, and how those needs have no moral prerequisites. Even a murderer needs friends, and even good people can be friends with bad people. It's a comment on the strange, random world we live in. A good film; worth seeing. Choose your answer.

Remove any obstacles or ground debris that may interfere with the proper use of a ladder. Move lawn furniture, potted plants, toys, sticks, and rocks away from where you're working.","output":"After clearing obstacles and clutter, follow these steps for removing vinyl siding safely and effectively: 1. Gather necessary tools and materials: Before starting the removal process, ensure you have all the needed tools and materials. Common items include a ladder, safety goggles, gloves, a siding removal tool (also called a zip tool), a flat pry bar, a utility knife, and a measuring tape. 2. Prepare the work area: Set up your ladder securely and ensure it is level on the ground to prevent accidents. Always follow the manufacturer's recommendations for ladder use and safety. 3. Locate the starting point: To remove vinyl siding, it's best to start at the top and work your way down. Begin by removing any corner posts, trim, or J-channels that are attached to the siding you want to remove. 4. Use the siding removal tool: Slip the curved end of the siding removal tool (zip tool) under the bottom lip of the top piece of siding you want to remove. The curved end should hook onto the back lip of the siding underneath. Slide the tool horizontally along the entire length of the siding to release the lower piece from the upper one.  5. Lift and unhook the siding: Pull the bottom of the lifted siding away from the wall to unhook the nails or clips securing it. Be careful not to apply excessive force, as this may cause damage to the siding or underlayment. If any nails or clips remain attached to the siding after lifting, carefully pry them out using a flat pry bar. 6. Cut or pry off damaged siding: If you need to remove a damaged section of siding, use a utility knife to cut along the top and bottom lip of the damaged piece, being careful not to cut into the sheathing or framing beneath. If the siding is too damaged for cutting, gently pry the damaged section away from the wall using the flat pry bar. 7. Remove remaining siding: Repeat the process for each piece of siding, working your way down from the highest point to the lowest. Remove any remaining nails or clips using the flat pry bar as necessary. 8. Clean up:Once all the desired vinyl siding has been removed, clean your work area, disposing of any debris according to your local waste and recycling regulations. Store any reusable materials for future projects, such as replacing the removed siding or repairing other sections of your home. 9. Assess underlying materials: After removing the siding, inspect the underlying materials for any signs of damage, rot, or mold. Address any issues before installing new siding or finishing the area in another manner. 10.

Does call mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the meaning of the word \\"call\\" in Sentence 1. In this sentence, \\"call\\" refers to a telephone connection, specifically the act of someone trying to establish communication with another person via the telephone. The context shows that the subject (he) recognizes the sound of the phone ringing but isn't interested in speaking to the caller. Therefore, in this context, \\"call\\" means \\"telephone call.\\" Step 2: Analyze the meaning of the word \\"call\\" in Sentence 2. In this sentence, \\"call\\" also refers to a telephone connection, with the added detail that these calls are anonymous, implying that the person making the call is not revealing their identity. The context shows a concern from the subject (she) over the unknown nature of the calls. Therefore, in this context, \\"call\\" also means \\"telephone call.\\" Step 3: Compare the meanings. Now, I will compare the meanings of \\"call\\" in both sentences: - Sentence 1: \\"call\\" means \\"telephone call.\\" - Sentence 2: \\"call\\" means \\"telephone call.\\" Conclusion: Based on careful analysis of the context in each sentence, the meaning of \\"call\\" is indeed the same in both sentences.

They wanted to make sure their kids didn't experience loud sounds that might damage their hearing. In order to do this where would the family stand and observe? (A) In the front row of the crowd (B) in the back of the crowd  Choose the answer between \\"Far from the fireworks\\" and \\"Close to the fireworks\\". The answer is:","output":"Far from the fireworks. In order to ensure that Jim and Kelly's kids are not exposed to loud sounds that might damage their hearing during the fireworks show, the family should stand and observe at a location that is far from the fireworks. This would correspond to option (B) in the back of the crowd. When fireworks explode, they produce loud sounds due to the rapid release of energy in the form of light and sound. The intensity of the sound produced - which can easily exceed safe levels for children and adults alike - decreases as one gets farther from the source. Standing far from the fireworks, in the back of the crowd, would provide the following advantages: 1. Sound Intensity Reduction: As mentioned, the intensity of the sound decreases as the distance from the source increases, following the inverse square law. This means that by standing farther away from the fireworks, the family would be exposed to a less intense sound, reducing the risk of hearing damage. 2. Crowd Buffer: By standing in the back of the crowd, they would also be surrounded by other spectators who could help to absorb and dissipate some of the sound energy produced by the fireworks. 3. Reduced Risk of Debris and Injury: In addition to protecting their ears, standing farther away from the fireworks display could also reduce the family's risk of being hit by debris produced by exploded fireworks or accidents that may occur during the show. Overall, the family should choose to stand far from the fireworks, in the back of the crowd, to minimize the risk of hearing damage as well as other potential hazards related to the fireworks show."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes.","output":"[A]. No. The given product review is definitely a negative one. Let's break down the reasons why it is a negative review: 1. Title – \\"Idem is JUNK!! Did Not Last Three MONTHS!\\": The use of the word \\"JUNK\\" in all capital letters along with the exclamation marks is a clear indication of the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the product. Additionally, making a point that the product didn't last for even three months further indicates their disappointment. 2. Review content – \\"The watch quit working after less than 90 Days.\\": The reviewer explicitly states that the watch stopped functioning in less than 90 days, which would understandably lead to a negative experience. A product, especially a watch, is expected to last longer than that, and not doing so reflects negatively on its quality and durability. 3. Review content – \\"Been buying on the internet a long time and this is the most expensive peace of Junk I have ever bought.\\": In this sentence, the reviewer shares their experience of buying products online, mentioning that this purchase turned out to be the most expensive \\"piece of junk\\" they have encountered. The use of \\"most expensive\\" suggests that the watch might have been costly, and yet it did not live up to its price in terms of quality and performance. This amplifies the negative sentiment expressed in the review. In conclusion, the strong negative words and phrasing used in both the title and the review content, as well as the context of the reviewer's disappointment regarding the quality, durability, and price of the watch, make it quite evident that this is not a positive review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since they were little girls, Mary and Katrina had shared a deep bond that transcended their cousin relationship. The memories they had built over the years as they played together and grew up side by side were truly precious, and as they grew older, their bond only became stronger. Mary had been there during Katrina's darkest moments and celebrated her joyous ones as well. Similarly, Katrina had always stood by Mary's side, providing unwavering love and support. When Mary started dating her soon-to-be husband, Jack, Katrina was the first person she shared the news with. Their conversations often ran long into the night, dreamily discussing what the wedding might look like and the roles they would play in the big event. As the years went by and their dreams neared reality, Mary and Jack's love blossomed, and he eventually proposed to her on a quiet sandy beach under a star-lit sky. With tears in her eyes, she called Katrina right away, eager to share the exciting news. Jumping at the opportunity, Katrina wasted no time in agreeing to be her dear cousin's flower girl. As the wedding preparations were underway, Mary and Katrina spent countless hours discussing the tiniest details of the big day, from the choice of flowers to the overall theme. Eventually, they settled on a soft, pastel aesthetic with dashes of romantic florals to complement their vision of a garden-inspired wedding. The excitement only grew when it was time to go shopping for the flower girl dress. Katrina's eyes twinkled with joy as she tried on various lovely dresses, her excitement for her important role evident in her every twirl and grin. Finally, after months of preparation, the big day arrived. The venue was transformed into a beautiful oasis, adorned with vibrant, cascading flowers and delicate pastel accents.

The air was filled with warmth, love, and anticipation. Katrina, now dressed in a charming pastel dress with tiny flowers sewn carefully onto its lace, stood nervously at the end of the aisle. She clutched a small basket filled with rose petals, her hands trembling just slightly. Mary, radiant in her white gown, looked to her with a reassuring smile, conveying all the love and gratitude she felt for her dear cousin on this momentous day. As the music started, Katrina took a deep breath and began to walk down the aisle, carefully scattering rose petals at her feet. Her cheeks flushed as she stole a glance at the enchanted faces beaming at her from both sides of the aisle. As she reached the altar, she took her place next to Mary and stood proudly, feeling honored to partake in this special moment. Jack looked at his bride-to-be with immense love, and as the ceremony progressed, the bond between Mary, Jack, and Katrina seemed to be infused with even more warmth and depth. That day, not only did Mary and Jack promise to love and cherish each other for the rest of their lives, but they also acknowledged and celebrated the incredible bond that existed between Mary and Katrina, two souls forever intertwined by love and family. And from that day on, as they each embarked on new chapters in their lives, Mary, Jack, and Katrina continued to be a source of unending love, support, and inspiration for each other.

Question: What does Edgar refuse to do? Title: Fallen Movie plot: A voiceover says that this is the story of how the narrator almost died. Philadelphia Police Detective John Hobbes visits serial killer named Edgar Reese, who he helped capture, on death row. Reese grabs Hobbes' hand and says something in an unknown language, later identified as Aramaic. After Reese is executed, Hobbes and his partner Jonesy investigate a string of murders by an apparent copycat killer. Hobbes, through hints given initially by Reese, and later by the apparent copycat killer, tracks down a woman named Gretta Milano, the daughter of a former detective. Gretta explains that her father, a detective in the same city killed himself after being accused of a series of demonic-themed murders. Hobbes goes to the Milano family's lake-house, and finds books concerning demonic possession, and sees the name Azazel written on a wall. Hobbes inquires after the name to Gretta, who gravely advises him to drop the case to protect his life and family. Gretta explains that Azazel is a fallen angel with the power to possess human beings by touch. Hobbes realizes that Azazel, while possessing Edgar Reese, touched Hobbes before the execution, but was not able to possess him. Gretta explains that the demon will try to ruin his life by another way, and warns him of the inevitability of Azazel's victory. Azazel finds Hobbes at his precinct, and through his coworkers, torments him. Hobbes reveals his knowledge of Azazel's true identity, to which the demon responds, \\"Beware my wrath\\", and disappears into the city.

He meets several others who arrived in the same manner: Mexican drug cartel enforcer Cuchillo (Danny Trejo), Spetsnaz soldier Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov), Israel Defense Forces sniper Isabelle (Alice Braga), Revolutionary United Front officer Mombasa (Mahershala Ali), death row inmate Stans (Walton Goggins), Yakuza enforcer Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien), and a general practice doctor Edwin (Topher Grace). Upon landing, they discover that all are armed and lethal killers, with the apparent exception of Edwin, though none know where they are or how they got there. The group follows Royce, who Isabelle suspects is a former black operations soldier turned mercenary. In the jungle they find empty cages, plants with a neurotoxic poison that Edwin collects on a scalpel, and a deceased US Special Forces soldier. Arriving at higher ground, they find themselves staring at an alien sky and realize that they are not on Earth. The party is attacked by a pack of quadruped alien beasts. Cuchillo is killed, and his body is then used as bait to lure the survivors into a trap, but they avoid it. Royce deduces they are on a planet used as a game preserve, where humans are hunted as game. The group follows the quadruped's tracks to a camp and find a captive Predator. The \\"hunters\\", three larger Predators, attack the group. Mombasa is killed and the rest of the group escapes. Isabelle reveals that she has heard of the Predators before, from a report by the only survivor (Major Alan \\"Dutch\\" Schaefer) of a Special Forces team who encountered one in Guatemala in 1987. The group next meets Noland (Laurence Fishburne), a lone soldier who has survived on the planet for \\"10 seasons\\" by hiding and scavenging from the Predators and their victims. At his hideout, he explains that the Predators sharpen their killing skills by collecting warriors and dangerous beasts from other worlds and bringing them to the planet to hunt.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: When the police arrive who do they believet was responsible for the destruction? Sykes Answer:","output":"Title: The Fall of Sykes Step 1: Establishing the Setting The movie is set in a small, tight-knit town where everybody knows each other. The people are generally good-natured, except for one notorious individual named Sykes, who has a long history of causing trouble due to his violent tendency and conniving attitude. However, he has never been caught and has managed to continue his pursuits under the radar. Step 2: Introducing the Protagonists Jenny is a young, ambitious police officer recently transferred to the town. She becomes aware of the situation with Sykes and is determined to bring him to justice. Her partner, Alex, is a seasoned officer who grew up in the town and knows Sykes' past, which motivates him to support Jenny's mission in taking Sykes down. Step 3: Building the Conflict One day, the town's annual festival is disrupted by an explosion that destroys a significant part of the festivities and causes numerous injuries. The townspeople are devastated, and the police begin an immediate investigation into the cause of the destruction. Step 4: Deepening the Plot Jenny and Alex gather evidence and start interviewing witnesses. Many eyewitnesses report seeing Sykes at the scene moments before the explosion, further deepening their suspicion. However, they also come across contradictory pieces of evidence that point towards different potential suspects, leaving them uncertain about Sykes' involvement. Step 5: Introducing Additional Characters  While investigating, Jenny and Alex meet Mary, a seemingly innocent woman in town who also seems to be connected to the destruction. As they dig further into her background, they discover a connection between Mary and Sykes, which further complicates the case. Step 6: Climax Jenny and Alex continue their investigation, leading them to a final showdown with Sykes and Mary. In a tense confrontation, they reveal the truth behind the destruction, and it turns out that Mary was the one responsible. She framed Sykes to exact revenge on him for his past wrongdoings against her and her family while simultaneously using him as a scapegoat for the destruction she caused. Step 7: Resolution With the truth revealed, Sykes is cleared of the charges, although his reputation remains tainted. Mary is arrested for the crime, and the town begins rebuilding and healing. Jenny and Alex, having successfully resolved the case, now have an even stronger bond as they continue to work together to keep their town safe. In conclusion, when the police arrive, they initially believe Sykes was responsible for the destruction due to his notorious past and multiple eyewitnesses. However, through thorough investigation and determination, Jenny and Alex uncover the truth and reveal that Mary was the mastermind behind the incident, using Sykes as her scapegoat."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch.

There’s a certain tone to Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook (unblockable!) posts, a kind of “aw shucks” white-bread earnestness — not unpleasant, not offensive, just friendly and happy to be here.      Look, Zuck runs the world’s largest social network, so he can’t just issue a boilerplate PR press release for the hoi polloi, like the CEO of an oil company or auto manufacturer, and be done with it — he has to connect, to show the power of Facebook’s platform to allow people to share moments from their lives. That means charming anecdotes about his dog alongside announcements about new charity initiatives. The means s 360° video of his child’s first steps. The means bland platitudes about personal plans to read more books or run a mile a day. That means warm, inviting photography. And it means a team of at least a dozen people helping run his Facebook page.      As Bloomberg reports, Zuck doesn’t do this on his own. He has a whole team of at least 12 people who help write his posts for him, shoot those beautiful candid photographs he posts — including Washington Post stringer Charles Ommanney — and moderate his comments to keep the incredibly racist and vile stuff off Zuck’s page.      None of this should be any surprise. Most major social-media presences are managed by a team of people, and why should Zuck be any different? And Zuck seems to realize he still has some serious image rehab to do after years of being painted as a cold, socially awkward boy genius. As court documents show, Zuck unfiltered was an odd and aggressive creature (though, granted, he was much, much younger when typing those IMs than he is today — and God forbid we all be judged on what we type into ostensibly secret chat windows). And Jesse Eisenberg’s alternatively insecure and ruthless portrayal of Zuckerberg in 2010’s The Social Network probably did him no favors ether.      So one of his Zuck’s strategic goals, both for himself and for Facebook, has to been to turn “Mark Zuckerberg, billionaire tech weirdo” into “Mark Zuckerberg, goofy nerd who cares about the world’s problem’s, especially yours.” This is especially true because, with Steve Jobs gone, there simply is no other tech company than Facebook that is so thoroughly seen through the lens of its CEO. A strange and creepy Zuck translates into a strange and creepy social network. A happy-go-lucky Zuck that goes on safaris, builds his own personal home-AI, and loves to play with his dog translates into a social network meant for moments from your personal life, both big and small.      The latest manifestation of this? A series of posts from Texas, which Zuckerberg is posting as if it’s part of his 2017 promise to visit all 50 states of the United States this year.      There’s Zuck in Dallas “for work” (i.e., testifying in a massive lawsuit case against Facebook subsidiary Oculus Rift), planting a community garden tree:      There’s Zuck sitting down with normal, everyday folks.      There’s Zuck taking part in a cultural tradition outside his own Northeastern upbringing:      And there’s Zuck doing the classic factory tour, in case a data center for Facebook:      Plenty of people have pointed out these posts — and Zuck’s overall plan to visit all 50 states in 2017 — feel an awful lot like what someone would do if they were getting ready to run for political office. And it was recently revealed Zuckerberg asked for — and got — permission to serve for two years in government without relinquishing control of Facebook.      But maybe you don’t need to see political machinations at play here. Two years isn’t a long time to serve in government. At most Zuckerberg could serve one term in the House of Representatives if elected (or serve in an another position if appointed by a president, which seems unlikely under Trump). Maybe all these rodeos and community gardens and local diner sit-downs are just Zuckerberg and his team’s awkward attempt to make him seem like exactly what he is not — just another average Facebook user. ||||| \\"Fortune favors the bold.\\"      - Virgil, Aeneid X.284            \\"All children are artists.

As much as anything, that image was of Jesse Eisenberg’s fictionalized performance as Zuckerberg in The Social Network: an intense, socially inept kid billionaire who always wore a hoodie, whether he was meeting with financiers or trying to screw a co-founder in court. Over the past couple of years, Zuckerberg has made a concerted effort to steer his image in a different direction.      Near the end of 2014, he began holding Q&A sessions with groups of people wherever he was traveling around the world, fielding softballs ranging from lessons on startup-building to his favorite pizza toppings. Those town halls have evolved into near-daily posts on Zuckerberg’s own Facebook page, mixing news of company milestones with personal epiphanies, soft-focus photos from his life as a new dad, and responses to user comments. “What he’s learned over the last two years is that his image in the digital domain needs to be controlled,” says David Charron, who teaches entrepreneurship at the University of California at Berkeley. “And he’s simply growing up.”      Meeting developers in Lagos. Source: Facebook      Zuckerberg has help, lots of it. Typically, a handful of Facebook employees manage communications just for him, helping write his posts and speeches, while an additional dozen or so delete harassing comments and spam on his page, say two people familiar with the matter. Facebook also has professional photographers snap Zuckerberg, say, taking a run in Beijing or reading to his daughter. Among them is Charles Ommanney, known most recently for his work covering the refugee crisis for the Washington Post. Company spokeswoman Vanessa Chan says Facebook is an easy way for executives to connect with various audiences.      While plenty of chief executive officers have image managers, the scale of this team is something different. So is its conflation of Zuckerberg’s personal image with that of his company, the diaper-changing photos next to the user growth stats. “I don’t know that there are a lot of other business leaders that would find the same level of comfort sharing their personal and business stuff in the way that he does,” says Fred Cook, director of the University of Southern California Center for Public Relations, who has worked with Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs.      Looking for game at Lake Naivasha in Kenya. Souce: Facebook      Facebook’s a little different in that respect. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has used her page to discuss workplace inequality and her husband’s sudden death. And within Facebook, it’s an article of faith that Zuckerberg’s image is pretty much synonymous with the company’s, employees say. If people think Zuckerberg is innovative and charming, so is Facebook. That may help explain the PR team’s more ambitious recent efforts to compare the CEO to Iron Man.      Beijing Source: Facebook      In December, Zuckerberg, his wife, his baby daughter, his parents, and his dog all appeared in a series of videos dramatizing his yearlong effort to create a smart-home device akin to Amazon.com’s Echo. Zuckerberg dubbed the project Jarvis, as in the AI butler that Robert Downey Jr. uses in the Marvel movies.      The Facebook team shot one video from Zuckerberg’s POV, one from that of his wife, Priscilla Chan, and one from that of Jarvis, voiced by Morgan Freeman. There are some cringeworthy moments, including the one after Zuckerberg asks Jarvis to play a good Nickelback song, and Freeman’s voice says there aren’t any.      Groans notwithstanding, the PR blitz seems to be working. Zuckerberg’s posts typically get at least a couple hundred thousand shares; the Jarvis video clocked more than a million. USC’s Cook says his 18-year-old son follows Zuckerberg and reported that “he seems like a regular guy.” “If an 18-year-old thinks he’s coming across in an authentic way, that’s really something,” says Cook.      Leaving the Vatican. Source: Facebook      Jarvis was Zuckerberg’s personal challenge for 2016. His stated goal this year is to travel to all 50 U.S. states and improve his understanding of their communities. (By contrast, in 2011 his goal was to eat meat only if he’d killed it himself.) The CEO is also spending more time meeting with diplomats and beginning to figure out how to invest 99 percent of his personal fortune—about 2 billion in cash and other assets, plus 52 billion in Facebook stock—in philanthropic causes.      With all that in mind, it’s fair to wonder whether Zuckerberg wants to run for public office. He isn’t saying, but his online mix of serious business and dad jokes can’t help but feel a little political. For a point of comparison, check out Barack Obama’s social media accounts sometime.      The bottom line: There are more than a dozen Facebook employees writing Mark Zuckerberg’s posts or scouring the comments for spammers and trolls. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has at least a dozen PR professionals managing his online image, it has been revealed.

The Kentucky senator then started citing specific data from the 2012 general election, including Guinta's race. \\"Your two Republicans up there lost recently for Congress,\\" Paul said to New Hampshire political reporter James Pindell in the telephone interview on WGIR. \\"They lost by four percentage points, and the libertarian in each race got 4½ percent, so really we do have to figure out a way to attract some of those voters who are voting libertarian if we want to have enough of a majority to win.\\" \\"This was not his political adviser,\\" the New Hampshire","output":"native and former congressman Guinta mused later, \\"this was a sitting senator from another state who took the time and effort to study and analyze the local election results, which highlights the broader challenges faced by the Republican Party nationwide.\\" Guinta felt a kinship with Paul, sharing not only a political misfortune but also a drive to reshape the GOP's direction and voter appeal. The challenge now is not just about winning local races, but also about redefining the party's core principles and messaging to unite conservative and libertarian-leaning individuals alike. As Guinta and other Republicans look towards the future, they must find innovative ways to connect with all factions within their base, ensuring that the party understands the various concerns of the electorate and addresses them in a comprehensive and inclusive manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For the first one, whether a compartment or a tray paddy separator is better can depend on a few things. Imagine if you had a box of crayons and you wanted to separate them into different colors. A compartment separator would be like having different sections in the box for each color. A tray separator would be like having different trays for each color. Both can do a good job, but you might prefer one over the other depending on how many crayons you have, how much space you have to store them, and which one is easier for you to use.

In between the scary bits is the most BANAL and BORING dialog ever written. Stupid \\"we're going to the prom\\" junk. I wanted to claw my ears off. Honestly, \\"The Hills\\" has better dialog. There really was no need to make this movie. Leading lady is uninteresting and I kept thinking \\"Her? Really? Guy is obsessed with her? Really?\\"  All the characters act in stupid ways, including the police. (Cover the place in teams of 2! Front and back! Not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed.)  The serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem. No resistance from victims (or doors). Nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back (or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door). The people are like mentally disabled sheep. By the by, if you're a gore fan, you'll be disappointed too. All the killing is kept offscreen and is -- ahem -- tastefully done. (So boo hoo for you!)  None of the killings is the least bit interesting. Most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out.

Wash with a color-correcting, low-sulfate shampoo and conditioner. Apply a hair mask once a week to hydrate your strands. Shower every other day with lukewarm water.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Revamp Your Color with Balayage: The Guide to Perfecting Your Locks Introduction Balayage has become a popular hair color technique that allows you to achieve effortless, low-maintenance, and natural-looking highlights. This freehand painting method lightens the hair strands from the middle to the ends, resulting in a soft, sun-kissed appearance. However, it is essential to maintain and repeat the process to keep your hair looking vibrant and healthy. In this article, we will explain how to preserve your balayage color and how to integrate the right hair care practices into your routine. 1. Repeat Your Balayage Process Like any hair color process, balayage is not permanent. With time, your hair will start to lose its vibrancy and brightness. Factors such as frequent hair washing, exposure to the sun, and using heat-styling tools can fade the color. To maintain your radiant locks, it is essential to repeat your balayage process when necessary. Typically, it is recommended to revive your balayage every 3-4 months or when your hair needs a significant color boost. It is always good to check with your stylist for personalized recommendations depending on your hair type and needs. 2. Wash with a Color-Correcting, Low-Sulfate Shampoo and Conditioner Using the right shampoo and conditioner is vital to preserving the longevity of your balayage. Invest in a color-correcting, low-sulfate shampoo and conditioner designed to protect and enhance colored hair. These products contain less harsh chemicals and will not strip your hair of its natural oils, ensuring that your balayage stays fresh and vibrant for longer periods. Additionally, color-correcting shampoos help to combat any brassiness or unwanted yellow tones, ensuring a natural and soft transition from your roots to your lighter ends. 3. Apply a Hair Mask Once a Week Balayage can cause some stress on your hair, especially if you are going from a darker shade to a lighter one. To keep your hair hydrated and healthy, you should incorporate a nourishing hair mask into your hair care regimen. Apply a hydrating, color-safe hair mask once a week, focusing on your mid-lengths to ends. This will not only strengthen and protect your hair but also provide it with the necessary nutrients to prevent breakage and dullness. Hair masks not only enhance the longevity of your balayage but also give your hair a lustrous and healthy appearance. 4. Shower Every Other Day with Lukewarm Water Overwashing your hair can strip away its natural oils and lead to color fading. To make your balayage last longer, try to shower every other day, or even every three days if possible. This will help preserve your hair's natural oils and maintain the vibrancy of your balayage. When taking a shower, always use lukewarm water instead of hot water, as hot water can damage your hair and cause the color to fade rapidly. Lukewarm water helps to minimize color loss during washing while effectively cleaning your hair and scalp. Conclusion Balayage is an attractive and low-maintenance hair coloring technique that gives you a natural, sun-kissed finish. By repeating the process when necessary, using a color-correcting low-sulfate shampoo and conditioner, applying a hair mask weekly, and showering every other day with lukewarm water, you can maintain the vibrancy and health of your locks. These essential hair care practices will help further prolong the life of your balayage, making sure you always look stunning and stylish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) was a Canadian railway locomotive manufacturer which existed under several names from 1883 to 1985, producing both steam and diesel locomotives. For a number of years it was a subsidiary of the American Locomotive Company. MLW's headquarters and manufacturing facilities were located in Montreal, Quebec.  - A locomotive or engine is a rail transport vehicle that provides the motive power for a train. The word originates from the Latin \\"loco\\"  \\"from a place\\", ablative of \\"locus\\", \\"place\\" + Medieval Latin \\"motivus\\", \\"causing motion\\", and is a shortened form of the term \\"locomotive engine\\", first used in the early 19th century to distinguish between mobile and stationary steam engines.  - A train is a form of rail transport consisting of a series of vehicles that usually runs along a rail track to transport cargo or passengers. Motive power is provided by a separate locomotive or individual motors in self-propelled multiple units. Although historically steam propulsion dominated, the most common modern forms are diesel and electric locomotives, the latter supplied by overhead wires or additional rails. Other energy sources include horses, engine or water-driven rope or wire winch, gravity, pneumatics, batteries, and gas turbines. Train tracks usually consist of two running rails, sometimes supplemented by additional rails such as electric conducting rails and rack rails, with a limited number of monorails and maglev guideways in the mix. The word 'train' comes from the Old French \\"trahiner\\", from the Latin \\"trahere\\" 'pull, draw'.  - A classification yard (American and Canadian English) or marshalling yard (British, Hong Kong, Indian, Australian and Canadian English) is a railway yard found at some freight train stations, used to separate railway cars on to one of several tracks. First the cars are taken to a track, sometimes called a \\"lead\\" or a \\"drill\\". From there the cars are sent through a series of switches called a \\"ladder\\" onto the classification tracks. Larger yards tend to put the lead on an artificially built hill called a \\"hump\\" to use the force of gravity to propel the cars through the ladder.  - A switcher or shunter (Great Britain: \\"shunter\\"; Australia: \\"shunter\\" or yard pilot; United States: \\"switcher\\", switch engine, or yard goat, except Pennsylvania Railroad: shifter) is a small railroad locomotive intended not for moving trains over long distances but rather for assembling trains ready for a road locomotive to take over, disassembling a train that has been brought in, and generally moving railroad cars around  a process usually known as \\"switching\\" (USA) or \\"shunting\\" (UK). They do this in classification yards (Great Britain: \\"marshalling yards\\"). Switchers may also make short transfer runs and even be the only motive power on branch lines and switching and terminal railroads. The term can also be used to describe the workers operating these engines or engaged in directing shunting operations.  - The Pennsylvania Railroad was an American Class I railroad, founded in 1846. Commonly referred to as the \\"Pennsy,\\" the PRR was headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  - A railroad car or railcar (American and Canadian English), railway wagon or railway carriage (UK and IUR), also called a train car or train wagon, is a vehicle used for the carrying of cargo or passengers on a rail transport system (a railroad/railway). Such cars, when coupled together and hauled by one or more locomotives, form a train. Alternatively, some passenger cars are self-propelled in which case they may be either single railcars or make up multiple units.  - The ALCO S2 and S4 were 1,000 horsepower ( 746 kW ) diesel electric switchers produced by ALCO and Canadian licensee Montreal Locomotive Works ( MLW ) . Basically , the two locomotives differed only in trucks , with the S - 2 using ALCO 's own \`\` Blunt '' trucks , and the S - 4 riding on standard AAR type A switcher trucks . Both were powered by ALCO 539 turbocharged , 6 - cylinder diesels . The S - 2 was built between August 1940 and June 1950 , with a total of 1502 completed , while the S - 4 was constructed between June 1949 and August 1957 ( MLW until 1957 ) with total sales of 797 . Canadian production of the S - 4 started more than a year before U S production of the S - 4 . ALCO did not start building the S - 4 until August 1950 . A modified version , the S - 7 , was built by MLW only ; 29 were built between June and August 1957 .  - The American Locomotive Company, often shortened to ALCO, ALCo or Alco, designed, built and sold steam locomotives, diesel-electric locomotives, diesel engines and generators, specialized forgings, high quality steel, armed tanks and automobiles and produced nuclear energy. The American Locomotive Company was formed in 1901 by the merger of Schenectady Locomotive Engine Manufactory of Schenectady, New York with seven smaller locomotive manufacturers.    'alco s-2 and s-4' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'manufacturer'?  Choices: - american locomotive company  - montreal locomotive works  - pennsylvania railroad  - philadelphia  - train Answer:","output":"- American Locomotive Company - Montreal Locomotive Works"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, is known for various aspects, including its rich history, fascinating architecture, vibrant culture, and religious significance. While \\"Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city\\" is a factual statement, it does not encapsulate the essence of what Kathmandu is famous for. Here is a more comprehensive answer to your question: Kathmandu, often referred to as the \\"City of Temples,\\" is renowned for its exquisite religious and cultural sites. Some of the prominent landmarks include the Pashupatinath Temple, Swayambhunath Stupa, Boudhanath Stupa, and Kathmandu Durbar Square. These sites are not only of great religious importance but also bear testimony to the artistic and architectural brilliance of the indigenous Newar community. The Pashupatinath Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of the most significant Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. This ancient temple, located on the banks of the sacred Bagmati River, attracts millions of devotees and tourists from around the world every year. Swayambhunath Stupa, also known as the Monkey Temple, is another important religious site in Kathmandu. It is one of the oldest Buddhist pilgrimage sites and is revered by both Buddhists and Hindus. The stupa offers a panoramic view of the Kathmandu Valley, making it a popular destination for tourists. The Boudhanath Stupa is one of the largest stupas in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is an important center of Tibetan Buddhism in Nepal, surrounded by monasteries, shops, and restaurants. The site is known for its serene atmosphere and the beautiful display of prayer flags. Kathmandu Durbar Square, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a testament to the architectural prowess of the Malla and Shah dynasties that ruled Nepal in the past. The square is packed with palaces, temples, and courtyards that showcase intricate wood carvings, pagoda-style architecture, and the famous Kumari Ghar – the residence of the living goddess Kumari. Apart from its cultural and religious significance, Kathmandu is also known as the gateway to the Himalayas. It serves as the starting point for numerous treks and mountaineering expeditions in the region, including the world-famous Everest Base Camp trek. The city houses the Tribhuvan International Airport, which connects Nepal to other countries, and a network of roadways that provide access to various parts of the country. In conclusion, Kathmandu is primarily known for its rich cultural heritage, religious significance, and as the gateway to the Himalayas. While the majority of the population in Kathmandu speak Nepali, it is not the primary aspect that the city is famous for."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Royal assent The Royal Assent ceremony takes place in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills).

As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock.

It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music.

Question: what is the system in field hockey Suggestion: If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout, depending on the competition's format. A:","output":"False The question asks about the system in field hockey, which refers to the rules, gameplay, or organizational aspects of the sport. The suggested answer discusses a specific scenario that occurs when the score is tied at the end of the game but does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the system in field hockey.  Field hockey is a team sport in which two teams of 11 players each, comprising ten field players and a goalkeeper, compete against each other. The main objective is to score more goals than the opposing team within the 60-minute game duration, which is broken down into four 15-minute quarters. The teams switch sides after the second quarter, and two-minute breaks occur between the first and second quarters and third and fourth quarters with a 10-minute halftime break. The game is played on a rectangular grass or synthetic turf field, measuring 91.4 meters long and 55 meters wide. The goals, which are smaller than soccer goals, are 2.14 meters high and 3.66 meters wide, located at both ends of the field. A semi-circle, known as the \\"shooting circle\\" or \\"D,\\" extends 14.63 meters from the goalposts' base line. A goal is only counted if it is scored from within the shooting circle. Field hockey players use flat, curved sticks to pass, shoot, and dribble a 5.6-ounce ball, made of hard plastic. Players can only use the flat side of the stick, and hitting, lifting, or hooking the ball with other parts of the stick is considered a foul. There are three types of primary fouls: obstruction, stick interference, and body contact. If a player commits a foul, the opposing team receives a free hit, a penalty corner, or a penalty stroke, depending on the location and severity of the offense. In field hockey, numerous strategies and player positions exist, including attackers, midfielders, defenders, and a goalkeeper. The tactical formations that teams employ vary depending on their style of play and coaching philosophy. Some popular formations include 4-3-3, 3-4-3, and 5-3-2. As noted in the proposed suggestion, when a field hockey game ends in a tie, the outcome depends on the specific competition's regulations. Some matches may end in a draw, while others enter extra time, consisting of two 7.5-minute periods. If the score remains tied, the game proceeds to a penalty shootout to determine the winner. In a penalty shootout, five players from each team take alternating shots, and the team with the most successful tries wins. If the score remains tied after five efforts per side, the shootout proceeds to sudden-death rounds until a winner is declared. Overall, the system in field hockey encompasses the rules, regulations, gameplay strategies, player positions, and various competition formats used in the sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: In your life, there are a lot of people around you. They are your relatives, neighbors, friends or classmates. Sometimes you get along well with them, but sometimes don't. What can you do when someone hurts you? Most people may be angry or even fight with him. But it's not a good idea. You'd better forget all this and forgive(,) him. Maybe it's not easy for you to do that, but it's possible. Please remember: Keep a good mood, and you will keep healthy. Staying angry with others, in fact, means letting others' mistakes treat yourself unfairly. How can you forgive others? First, think of something pleasant and try to get yourself happy.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. beyond the fact crazy people exist and there are religious nuts out there. The characters basically make no sense most of the time. The film has no real beginning, middle or ending, nor is anything ever explained much. The film opens with a young man, with the unlikely name of Hazel Motes, apparently returning from a stint in the army. He hitches a ride to a two story house that is in extreme disrepair, windows boarded over. He goes in the house, walks around and finally writes a note that he leaves there. This scene comes to nothing, and we learn nothing further about the house or its history. It is never explained exactly whose house this is, or where the people have gone, but we are given the impression Hazel has probably lived there at one time. Hazel decides to go to a city. Why - we don't know. Once he arrives in this city he writes down a name & address that he sees on a bathroom wall, and goes to visit this woman, who is a surprisingly fat hooker. He sees her for awhile and then he apparently isn't seeing her anymore. Like everything else in this movie, it comes to nothing and serves no purpose. A young man named Enoch, tries to befriend him, but Hazel really isn't interested, although they keep crossing paths. Enoch is about as crazy as you can get. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimps are and talk at them insultingly. We never really know why Enoch behaves as he does, or why Hazel behaves as he does, beyond the fact Hazel had an overdose of old time scary, fundamentalist religion via his grandfather. Enoch later becomes enthralled with a man who dresses in a gorilla suit, and manages to get the gorilla suit from him and then runs around in it. Hazel, who is wound rather tight and seems to be in a constant borderline rage does a bit of street preaching. I got the impression he was trying to free himself from the untruths of the religion that had been drilled into him. He has several encounters with a preacher and his daughter, although their interactions never really make any particular point, and there is no plot line. Eventually Hazel succumbs to complete religious fervor and begins self-harming. It is a very odd film. Interesting in it's oddness but other than that it has absolutely nothing going for it. The cast does an outstanding job,but this film completely fails to deliver either a point of view or a storyline. The film also has the characters tossing around the N word from time to time with no connection to the rest of the dialog. 2 stars Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

Please answer the following question: Carson had a  lot of homework that night but was able to complete it.  Given the context: How would Carson feel afterwards?  Possible answers: nervous, glad to be finished, sad he did not have more homework A:","output":"Based on the given context, it is most likely that Carson would feel glad to be finished with his homework for that night. This assessment takes into consideration the emotional and mental state one experiences after successfully completing a burdensome and time-consuming task. To begin with, Carson had a lot of homework to complete that night, which implies that he felt burdened by the amount of work he had to do. It is natural for a person to feel overwhelmed or stressed in such situations. Being able to complete all of the homework assignments demonstrates that Carson was able to overcome this challenging situation, and as a result, he would most likely feel a sense of relief and accomplishment. Feeling glad to be finished with the homework also suggests that Carson values his personal time and prefers to engage in other activities instead of spending extended periods on school-related tasks. After completing the homework, he might feel satisfied with a job well done and look forward to enjoying leisure time or other non-academic pursuits. This sense of fulfillment and the freedom to allocate his time however he chooses would contribute to Carson feeling glad to be finished with his assignments. Additionally, completing all the assigned homework means that Carson does not have to worry about potential negative consequences or unfinished tasks hanging over his head. He can rest assured that he has met the expectations of his teachers and can maintain good standing in his classes. This peace of mind further supports the idea that he would feel glad to be finished with his homework. While one could argue that being sad he did not have more homework or feeling nervous are possible emotions in this context, these options seem less plausible considering typical student experiences. The desire to have more homework is an uncommon sentiment, as most students prefer to strike a balance between schoolwork and personal time. Similarly, feeling nervous after completing all the homework seems unlikely, as successfully finishing the workload would typically alleviate stress and anxiety. In conclusion, based on the given context, Carson would most likely feel glad to be finished with his homework that night. This emotional state results from a combination of relief, sense of accomplishment, and the anticipation of being able to enjoy his free time without the burden of unfinished homework."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Despite both questions dealing with Virtual Private Servers (VPS), they inquire about different aspects and aren't the same. The first question, \\"Which is the best unmanaged VPS setup guide?\\" is seeking a specific guide or resource to set up an unmanaged VPS. Here, the person asking the question is most likely requesting for reliable, easy-to-follow guides or tutorials on the setup and configuration of an unmanaged VPS. An unmanaged VPS refers to a server in which the user is entirely responsible for the management and maintenance, including updates, security, software installation among other tasks. In this context, the 'best' is subjective and could refer to the most comprehensive, the most user-friendly, or the most popular setup guide. The second question, \\"What are the awesome ways to use your VPS e.g., Linode?\\", is looking for various innovative or effective ways to utilize a VPS, using Linode as an example. The person asking the question could be looking for ideas on how to make the most out of their VPS. They might want to know about possible applications or uses such as hosting websites, setting up VPN, running a game server, or engaging in data analytics.

To better understand the different meanings of \\"hold\\" in these sentences, let's analyze each sentence separately. 1. \\"I hold with those who say life is sacred.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"hold\\" means to \\"agree with\\" or \\"support\\" an opinion or belief. The person is expressing that their stance aligns with those who believe that life is sacred, and they uphold the same viewpoint. \\"Hold\\" in this context refers to the mental acceptance or agreement with a certain idea.  The use of \\"hold\\" in this sentence relates to the concept of holding something in one's mind or adhering to a belief. It signifies that the speaker shares the belief and remains steadfast in supporting it. 2. \\"She can hold an audience spellbound.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"hold\\" conveys the meaning of captivating, maintaining, or sustaining someone's attention. The phrase \\"hold an audience spellbound\\" implies that the person is able to keep the audience deeply engaged or under her spell. The audience remains so absorbed by her speech, performance, or presence that they are unable to focus on anything else. In this context, \\"hold\\" carries a physical or tangible connotation, as if the person is grasping the attention of the audience and preventing them from being distracted. This usage of \\"hold\\" signifies the ability to control or retain the audience's interest and direct it towards the subject matter being delivered. In conclusion, while both sentences use the word \\"hold,\\" they depict different meanings. In the first sentence, \\"hold\\" refers to mentally agreeing with or supporting a belief, whereas in the second sentence, it pertains to captivating and retaining someone's attention. The word \\"hold\\" demonstrates the flexibility of the English language, where a single word can adopt various meanings based on the context in which it is used."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This part asks about the differences between these styles, like how they move, which body parts they use, or what rules they follow. 2.

Pyótr Ilʹyích Chaykóvskiy, IPA: [pʲɵtr ɪlʲˈjitɕ tɕɪjˈkofskʲɪj] (listen); 7 May 1840 [O.S. 25 April] – 6 November [O.S. 25 October] 1893), was a Russian composer of the romantic period, whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose early separation from his mother for boarding school was followed by his mother's early death?, what is it ?

An interesting idea hit her. The ball hit the fence. Choose from: [a]. different meanings. [b]. the same meaning.","output":"[b]. the same meaning. The word \\"hit\\" in both sentences conveys the same basic meaning, which is to come into contact with or encounter with force or impact. However, the context of each sentence is different and the usage of the word \\"hit\\" is somewhat metaphorical in one sentence and literal in the other. To further explain the nuance in each sentence, let's break them down individually. 1. An interesting idea hit her. In this sentence, the word \\"hit\\" is used metaphorically. It implies that an idea or thought suddenly occurred to her or struck her mind. The phrase \\"hit her\\" in this context does not mean any physical contact but rather the impact of an idea appearing suddenly. This usage highlights the moment when the idea comes into her mind, emphasizing its impactful entry into her thought process. 2. The ball hit the fence. In this sentence, the word \\"hit\\" is used in its more literal sense, which carries the meaning of coming into contact with physical force. Here, the ball physically strikes the fence, showing a tangible impact between the ball and the fence. The primary focus of this sentence is on the physical action and force there was in the event. In summary, although the word \\"hit\\" carries the same fundamental meaning in both sentences, its application varies due to the differing contexts. The first sentence utilizes \\"hit\\" metaphorically to describe the sudden occurrence of an idea, while the second sentence employs the term in a literal sense to illustrate the physical impact between two objects. Nonetheless, both usages convey the underlying idea of impact or encounter with force."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the sentence: \\"Sleeping mother holding her child in her arms.\\" 1. Sleeping: This word depicts the condition or state of the mother. This is an important word as it sets a context and suggests a peaceful image. 2. Mother: This word is crucial as it represents one of the main subjects in the sentence. It provides a significant aspect to the understanding of the sentence. 3. Holding: This action verb is a keyword because it tells us about what the mother is doing. It provides a specific detail of the scene described. 4. Child: This word is another main subject in the sentence, indicating the receiver of the action. This is an important aspect of the scene described. 5. Arms: The word 'arms' is the location where the action by the mother is performed upon the child. This is a relevant detail specifying the particular scene of mother-child interaction.  So the keywords in the sentence \\"Sleeping mother holding her child in her arms.\\" are 'sleeping', 'mother', 'holding', 'child', and 'arms'.

Soon after the US enters World War II, Steve Britt, a former World War I flying ace, arrives at Thunderbird Field, looking for a job as a civilian primary flight instructor. The base commander is an old friend, Lt. Col. \\"Mac\\" MacDonald, working with Squadron Leader Barrett (Reginald Denny, himself a World War I aerial observer), who is in charge of the Royal Air Force cadets at the base. Steve says he wants the job because he is too old for combat and the war will be won by pilots trained on bases like Thunderbird, but it is soon clear that he chose this base because his former girlfriend, Kay Saunders, lives nearby with her grandfather, retired Colonel Cyrus \\"Gramps\\" Saunders, also a close friend of Steve's. Steve immediately flies to their ranch and performs stunts over a water tank where Kay is bathing, blowing her robe away and then dropping her his flying coveralls.

Please segment the words.","output":"There were other conceptual shortcomings of LTCM strategies. Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was a hedge fund founded in 1994 that used complex mathematical models and cutting-edge strategies to generate significant returns. However, it ultimately collapsed in 1998 due to several conceptual shortcomings within its strategies. In this detailed answer, we will discuss these conceptual shortcomings. 1. Over-reliance on historical data: LTCM's strategies heavily depended on historical data to predict future market behavior. This approach assumed that the past would be a reliable indicator of the future, which was a significant conceptual shortcoming. Financial markets often exhibit unique behavior that cannot be fully captured by historical data, leading to unforeseen events such as market crashes, political turbulence, or economic crises. 2. Underestimation of market risk: The mathematical models utilized by LTCM did not adequately account for potential extreme events or market liquidity risks. Consequently, the fund was significantly exposed to unexpected market shocks, which eventually led to its collapse. 3. Leverage: LTCM employed considerable leverage, which meant that even small market movements could result in significant losses. When the models failed to predict market behavior accurately, LTCM found itself in a precarious position, unable to close out losing positions quickly enough without incurring massive losses. 4. Concentration of risk: The fund's strategies were primarily focused on a few specific markets and asset classes. This created a high level of risk concentration, making the fund extremely susceptible to adverse market developments in those areas. A well-diversified portfolio could have potentially reduced the impact of these risks. 5. Overconfidence in their models: The founders of LTCM included two Nobel laureates, leading to overconfidence in their complex mathematical models. This overconfidence resulted in an underestimation of the potential for failure, leaving the fund without adequate risk management measures. 6. Lack of transparency: The highly secretive nature of LTCM's operations made it difficult for investors and regulators to understand the true risks associated with their strategies. This lack of transparency made it difficult to see the vulnerabilities within the fund until it was too late. 7. Failure to adapt: As the market conditions evolved, LTCM failed to adapt its strategies effectively. The fund's rigid reliance on mathematical models made it difficult to react to changing market dynamics, contributing to the eventual collapse of the fund. In conclusion, the conceptual shortcomings of LTCM's strategies led to its eventual collapse, mainly due to over-reliance on historical data, underestimation of market risk, excessive leverage, concentration of risk, overconfidence in their models, lack of transparency, and failure to adapt to changing market conditions. These factors serve as critical lessons for hedge funds and investment firms in evaluating their strategies and ensuring proper risk management measures are in place."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

O'Neill Jr., emerged from a White House meeting today with President Reagan he denounced the President's tax proposals as ''a windfall for the rich'' and said the Democrats were concerned with ''the working class.'' The statement by the Massachusetts Democrat underscored the basic differences on tax policy that divide the Republican Administration and the Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives. The Reagan ''supply side'' approach to tax relief emphasizes the incentive effect of letting workers and investors take home a larger fraction of any extra money they earn. The traditional Democratic approach, represented by Mr. O'Neill, calls for ''targeted'' tax cuts, giving special attention - an extra dollop of tax relief - to those with low or middle incomes. On other aspects of the tax issue, notably how to encourage business investment, differences between Republicans and Democrats are minor. The following is a summary of how the principal tax issues stand four months into Mr. Reagan's Presidency: Duration of a Tax Cut The Administration insists on the Republican formula first articulated by Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York and Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware of three consecutive reductions in tax rates, to be mandated in a single bill. The Democrats had wanted a one-year bill but in the last week or so Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, had indicated that he would go to two years if the White House would make some concessions on who gets tax relief. Form of Tax Relief Hewing to the Kemp-Roth formula, the President insists on uniform, across-the-board reductions in all rates. Speaker O'Neill and Mr. Rostenkowski assert that tax relief should be targeted to the ''middle class'' or ''working class,'' whom they describe as the people with incomes of 15,000 or 20,000 to 50,000. Republicans, asserting that the Democrats have made no specific counterproposal, contend that the legislative meaning of ''targeted'' is unclear. What it seems to mean, the Republicans say, is that, although taxpayers in the 20,000-50,000 range pay 50 percent of the income tax total, they should get more than 50 percent of the tax relief. Size of Tax Reduction From an initial proposal of a tax cut of 10 percent a year for three years, Mr. Reagan has backed off to a formula of 5-10-10, 5 percent the first year with 10 percent the second and third. This plan was offered by Representative Kent Hance, a conservative Texas Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. The Treasury Department says that the revised bill, including relief for business, would cost 37 billion in lost revenues in the 1982 fiscal year, starting next Oct. 1, as against the 54 billion Mr. Reagan originally proposed. Cost estimates for a Rostenkowski bill are uncertain because the Illinois Democrat has talked only in general terms. Other Tax Bill Provisions The White House has agreed that a provision to moderate the ''marriage penalty'' paid by some two-salary couples should be part of the tax relief bill. The White House has stopped talking about a second 1981 tax bill, an idea Congress never took seriously. The Administration has agreed in principle to the liberalization of the present limitations on eligibility for and use of Individual Retirement Accounts. The Administration has also agreed to an immediate cut in the maximum tax rate, to 50 percent from 70 percent. Special relief for Americans who work abroad and on estate and gift taxes is also likely. Business Tax Relief The Reagan proposal to let business take faster, larger tax writeoffs for the costs of buildings, machinery and vehicles is almost certain to be enacted with only minor changes. Tax writers from both parties and the Treasury, however, are having second thoughts about the President's proposal to permit a full 10 percent tax credit on assets to be written off in five years, instead of seven, as now. There is, however, some sentiment for a longer ''carryback'' so that money-losing companies with no tax liability can receive the investment credit as a refund against earlier years' taxes. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. The differences between the Republicans and Democrats on tax policy: Republicans support the \\"supply side\\" approach which allows workers and investors to keep more of their earnings, while Democrats prefer \\"targeted\\" tax cuts for those with low or middle incomes. 2. President Reagan's tax proposal includes three consecutive reductions in tax rates (5-10-10), while Democrats want targeted relief for people with incomes between 20,000 and 50,000. 3. The Reagan administration proposes faster, larger tax write-offs for businesses, which is likely to be enacted with only minor changes. 4. Both parties are discussing other provisions like moderating the \\"marriage penalty,\\" liberalizing Individual Retirement Accounts, and granting special relief for Americans working abroad and on estate and gift taxes. Remember, these important tax policy differences mainly focus on who gets tax relief and how much relief each group receives."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Many of the world's great cities are located  on rivers, and almost every country has at least one river running through it that plays an important role in the lives of its people. Since the beginning of the history, people have used rivers for transportation . The longest one in the United States is the Mississippi. The lifeline of Egypt is the Nile. To the people of India, the Gangs is great, but it is also important for transportation; Ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeast Asia. The greatest of all for navigation  , however, is the Amazon in Brazil. It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles upon it. Besides transportation, rivers give food, water to drink, water for crops , and chances for fun and entertainment for the people who live along their banks. In order to increase  the supply of crops, engineers sometimes build a dam   across a river and let a lake from behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate   their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. However, large cities and industries that are located upon rivers often make problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals  and other materials.

The premise indicates that the boys are releasing bowling balls down their respective lanes. This action matches the typical action performed in the sport of bowling. Step 4: Justify the conclusion Based on the comparison of the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the premise does tell us whether the hypothesis is true. The information provided in the premise (boys releasing bowling balls down lanes) aligns with the sport of bowling, supporting the hypothesis that the boys are bowling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Still searching for their first win of the year, the Rams flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 4 showdown with the Dallas Cowboys.  After a scoreless first quarter, St. Louis trailed early as Cowboys RB Julius Jones got a 2-yard TD run.  Later in the period, the Rams would get their only score of the game as WR Dante Hall returned a punt 85&#160;yards for a touchdown.  Afterwards, Dallas regained the lead with QB Tony Romo getting a 15-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Cowboys managed to put the game away with Romo hooking up with WR Patrick Crayton on a 59-yard and a 37-yard TD pass.  Afterwards, the scoring ended with Romo's 17-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten. With no touchdowns in their last 30 offensive possessions to go with their fourth-straight loss, the Rams fell to 0-4. Question: How many yards difference was Tony Romo's first touchdown pass compared to his second? Answer:","output":"To find the difference between Tony Romo's first and second touchdown passes, we need to look at the yardage mentioned for each pass in the context. First TD pass yardage: 59 yards (to Patrick Crayton) Second TD pass yardage: 37 yards (also to Patrick Crayton) Difference = First TD pass yardage - Second TD pass yardage = 59 - 37 = 22 yards So, the difference between Tony Romo's first and second touchdown passes was 22 yards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

No. The given statement, \\"However, whether tuberculosis originated in bovines, then was transferred to humans, or whether it diverged from a common ancestor, is currently unclear.\\", does not answer the question \\"What does MTBC stand for?\\". Instead, it discusses the possible origins of tuberculosis in humans and bovines. MTBC stands for Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex. This is a group of closely related mycobacterial species that cause tuberculosis (TB) in humans and animals. The MTBC includes various species such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (which causes TB in humans), Mycobacterium bovis (causing TB in cattle and other animals, as well as humans), Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium canettii, and others. Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex is known for causing a severe and contagious respiratory disease that has affected humans for thousands of years. This group of bacteria can also cause systemic infection, which can lead to severe health complications or even death. Infection with MTBC can be acquired through inhalation of aerosolized particles containing the bacteria, released when an infected person or animal coughs, sneezes, or speaks. In recent years, researchers have been studying the evolutionary history and emergence of MTBC species from a common ancestor, and how the different strains may have adapted to their human or animal hosts. While the statement referred to the unclear origin of tuberculosis, it did not directly address the meaning of the acronym MTBC.

Complete the next sentence: How to immobilize an injured or frightened cat  Wrap the cat in a pillowcase then put it in a box.  One of the safest and easiest ways to immobilize a cat is by wrapping its body in a pillowcase. Place your cat on top of a pillowcase lying on a flat surface, several inches from the edge of the pillowcase. Available options:  (1). Wrap the pillowcase around your cat's waist, if you are immobilizing it. The cat will be in a standing position instead of on its back..  (2). Cover the cat's body with the short side of the pillowcase, leaving its head out. Grab the other end of the pillowcase and pull it over the cat's body..  (3). Wrap 1 hand or 2 hand (still holding the pillowcase together) around the pillowcase and wrap the other hand firmly over the top. Try using a blanket over the cat to immobilize it..  (4). The pillowcase should also contain padding so it does not collapse under the cat's body. An extra precaution is to wrap your cat's dominant side.. The answer is:","output":"(2). Cover the cat's body with the short side of the pillowcase, leaving its head out. Grab the other end of the pillowcase and pull it over the cat's body. This option is the correct way to immobilize a cat using a pillowcase. By covering the cat's body with the pillowcase and leaving its head out, you reduce the risk of injuries and provide a secure, gentle restraint. (1). Wrapping the pillowcase around the cat's waist while it is standing is not an effective method to immobilize a frightened or injured cat, as it still allows the cat to move around and possibly hurt itself. (3). Using one or two hands to hold the pillowcase and another hand to wrap it around the cat is not a proper use of a pillowcase to immobilize a cat. Covering the cat with a blanket is insufficient and is not the objective of using a pillowcase. (4). Adding padding to the pillowcase and wrapping the cat's dominant side is unnecessary when immobilizing a cat using a pillowcase. The main purpose is to provide a secure restraint, so extra padding and focusing on the dominant side are not needed."},{"instruction":"Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Where are boxes of products stored?

Quality of the coffee and food: - The coffee tasted burnt and had an unpleasant aftertaste. - The food was disappointing, with a limited selection and poor presentation. Cleanliness: - The tables were sticky and the floors were covered in crumbs. - The restrooms were in poor condition, lacking basic hygiene. Customer service: - The staff seemed indifferent and did not greet the customers. - The service was slow, with long wait times for orders.

The coffee was burnt and left a bitter aftertaste, while the food options were not only limited but also poorly presented.  As for the overall cleanliness, it was far from satisfactory. Tables were not wiped down properly, leaving them sticky, and the floors were covered in crumbs. The restrooms were also in a state of disarray, lacking even the most basic hygiene standards. Adding to the unpleasant experience, the customer service left a lot to be desired. The staff showed no enthusiasm or even basic courtesy, failing to acknowledge customers upon entering.

Answer the following question: Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...

As for the broad population, the supplementation may not be necessary unless dietary sources are lacking.

A scheme to move unaccompanied children from the so-called Jungle was launched in October after criticism of the government's efforts to provide refuge. Many have been reunited with family members already in the UK, Immigration minister Robert Goodwill said. He also insisted the transfers had not ended and more children would arrive from Europe \\"in the coming months\\". Children who have family links have been admitted to the UK under the Dublin regulation - which requires evidence that they have relatives who can care for them. Others, without family ties, have arrived under the \\"Dubs amendment\\" rules which allow particularly vulnerable children - such as girls and those under 13 - refuge in the UK. The Home Office said the transfers were being carried out as part of a planned process in conjunction with French authorities and all the children taken from the camp to children centres in France had been interviewed by UK officials. A total number of those brought to the UK as a result of the operation is expected to be published once all the transfers are concluded. Mr Goodwill said: \\"We have been working with the French authorities to bring children eligible to come here under the Dublin Regulation or the Immigration Act since the clearance of the Calais camp in October. \\"More than 750 children have arrived so far. Many have been reunited with family members already in the UK, while others are being cared for by local authorities across the UK. \\"The remaining children are safe and in the care of the French authorities.\\" He added: \\"The Dubs process has not ended. More eligible children will be transferred from Europe, in line with the terms of the Immigration Act, in the coming months and we will continue to meet our obligations under the Dublin Regulation.\\" The charity Unicef, and the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams were among those who previously accused the government of \\"foot-dragging\\" over the transfer of migrant children.

Read this and answer the question The political turmoil continued. John began to explore an alliance with the French king Philip II, freshly returned from the crusade. John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went to Paris, where he formed an alliance with Philip. He agreed to set aside his wife, Isabella of Gloucester, and marry Philip's sister, Alys, in exchange for Philip's support. Fighting broke out in England between forces loyal to Richard and those being gathered by John. John's military position was weak and he agreed to a truce; in early 1194 the king finally returned to England, and John's remaining forces surrendered. John retreated to Normandy, where Richard finally found him later that year.

Read this: When John DeStefano, Jr., became mayor of New Haven in 1995, he outlined a plan to transform the city into a major cultural and arts center in the Northeast, which involved investments in programs and projects other than sports franchises. As nearby Bridgeport built new sports facilities, the brutalist New Haven Coliseum rapidly deteriorated. Believing the upkeep on the venue to be a drain of tax dollars, the DeStefano administration closed the Coliseum in 2002; it was demolished in 2007. New Haven's last professional sports team, the New Haven County Cutters, left in 2009.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step in the process that you described is the formation of magma. Magma forms when the Earth's mantle or crust melts due to various factors such as increased temperature, decreased pressure, or the presence of water. This leads to a partially molten state, giving rise to magma, which then rises to the surface due to its lower density. Here is a brief overview of the entire process: 1. Formation of magma: The Earth's mantle or crust melts, creating magma. 2. Magma crystallizes: As magma cools, it begins to solidify, which leads to the formation of minerals through the process of crystallization. 3. Magma reaches the surface: Magma rises to the Earth's surface where it is called lava. 4. Lava cools on the surface: Upon reaching the surface, lava cools quickly and solidifies. The newly formed rock could be either extrusive (formed above the surface) or intrusive (formed below the surface). 5. Lava crystallizes: As lava solidifies, minerals present in the molten rock crystallize, forming an array of rock types such as basalt, andesite, or rhyolite. 6. Minerals dissolve in water: Rocks containing minerals erode due to weathering, and the minerals are carried by water. 7. Minerals dissolved in water crystallize: Over time, changing conditions like temperature, pressure, and evaporation may lead to the dissolved minerals crystallizing again, forming deposition structures like stalactites, stalagmites, or other mineral deposits."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there.

It was necessary to go to the store for the","output":"missing ingredient, so she quickly made a list of other items she might need for the party as well, hoping to make the most of the unplanned trip. She glanced around her kitchen, mentally ticking off items that would be useful for her cake, as well as snacks and drinks for the guests. As she prepared to leave, she decided to call her neighbor, Linda, to see if she could borrow some milk, just in the off chance she had some extra. Much to her surprise, Linda gladly offered her a small carton of milk, which Susan gratefully accepted. However, Susan still decided to make the trip to the store, realizing that it would be wise to have a backup plan, and perhaps even purchase extra supplies should any unexpected guests arrive. After thanking Linda, Susan grabbed her keys, her list, and her wallet, and began the short journey to the local grocery store. Upon her arrival, Susan found herself perusing the aisles not only for milk and cake ingredients, but also for various appetizers, beverages, and festive decorations to spruce up her home for the gathering. As the afternoon sun slowly began to dip below the horizon, she hastily filled her shopping cart with an assortment of cheeses, crackers, fruits, and vegetables that she knew her guests would enjoy. As she carefully picked out fresh ingredients for her cake and party snacks, Susan began to feel a growing sense of accomplishment. She couldn't help but imagine her friends and family gathered around her beautifully decorated table, engaging in lively conversations, and enjoying the scrumptious spread she'd prepared.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Tropic Thunder Context: A commercial depicts rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) promoting his two brands -- the \\"Booty Sweat\\" energy drink and \\"Bust-A-Nut\\" candy bar -- while performing his hit song, \\"I Love Tha' Pussy.\\" The first trailer shows action star Tugg Speedman's (Ben Stiller) latest film, Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown, a film so much like its five predecessors that even the trailer narrator sounds shaky about it. In another trailer, funnyman Jeff \\"Fatty\\" Portnoy (Jack Black) plays every member of \\"America's favorite obese family\\" in the highly flatulent The Fatties: Fart 2. The final trailer, for a film called Satan's Alley, features Australian \\"five-time Oscar winner\\" Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) and Tobey Maguire (as himself) as two monks who begin an impassioned affair.We are taken, via the narration of John \\"Four Leaf\\" Tayback (Nick Nolte), into a gruesome battle of the Vietnam War. This is actually a scene from Tropic Thunder, a big-budget adaptation of Tayback's wartime memoir. Starring as the central platoon are Speedman, Lazarus, Chino and Portnoy, as well as young character actor Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). To play the role of Sgt. Lincoln Osiris, an African American, Lazarus has dyed his skin dark and refuses to break character. (\\"I don't drop character 'till I done the DVD commentary.\\") A take of Osiris crying over Tayback's (Speedman's) blown-off hands is ruined when Speedman is unable to cry and Lazarus dribbles uncontrollably into Speedman's face. The ruined take causes great frustration for the film's director, Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan). The chaos is exacerbated when the film's pyrotechnics expert, Cody (Danny McBride), mistakes Cockburn's conniptions for a signal to set off several expensive explosions.Faux Access Hollywood clips reveal that Speedman's career has been on a downward spiral.

First question: Can a housewife get the same freedom and respect as much as a working woman gets (from her in-laws)? Second question: A woman I love and respect loathes me. How do I get back her love and respect? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"These two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question has to do with the comparison of social perceptions and treatment of housewives and working women, while the second question is regarding interpersonal relationships and how to regain someone's love and respect. The first question focuses on the societal and cultural aspects of how housewives and working women are treated by their in-laws, specifically in terms of freedom and respect. This question could be analyzed by comparing the typical expectations of housewives and working women in a particular society, and whether those expectations lead to differences in the way in-laws treat each group. The second question, on the other hand, deals with an individual's specific relationship with a woman they love and respect. The focus here is on the personal steps that can be taken to improve that relationship and earn back the love and respect that has been lost. This question may involve finding ways to communicate better, taking actions to show appreciation or understanding, or working on self-improvement to demonstrate change.

Older workers are often passed over for younger, less experienced candidates. Employers often assume that older workers lack tech skills or are resistant to change. Older workers are less likely to get promoted than their younger colleagues.","output":"Age Discrimination in the Workplace: A Problem in Many Industries Age discrimination in the workplace has long been a problem, particularly for older workers. As companies place more emphasis on technology and innovation, older employees are often passed over for younger, less experienced candidates. Here are some reasons why age discrimination occurs and how it impacts older workers. Assumption of Lack of Tech Skills or Resistance to Change Employers often assume that older workers lack tech skills or are resistant to change. While there may be some truth to this assumption in certain instances, it is not always accurate. Many older workers have valuable experience and knowledge that can positively impact a company's bottom line. Furthermore, older workers often have a strong work ethic and valuable soft skills, such as managing and mentoring others, that can make up for any perceived weaknesses in tech skills. Fewer Promotions for Older Workers Another issue in the workplace is that older workers are less likely to get promoted compared to younger colleagues. While seniority and experience used to be the main factors considered when promoting employees, today, youth and technological skills are prioritized. This disparity leaves many older workers feeling underappreciated and frustrated. It also can have a negative impact on the company as a whole since employees may not feel as committed to their jobs and may even leave for more opportunities elsewhere. What Can be Done To combat age discrimination, employers must recognize the value of experienced workers and make a concerted effort to include them in the workplace. Companies can provide ongoing training and development opportunities to ensure that older workers are up to speed on the latest technology and trends. Employers should also provide opportunities for older employees to mentor younger colleagues to share their valuable knowledge and experience. In conclusion, age discrimination in the workplace is a problem that affects many industries. The absence of policies and practices that support the hiring and promotion of older workers is detrimental to both employees and the company. It is essential that employers recognize the value of older workers and work to foster an inclusive and diverse workforce that benefits all."},{"instruction":"What's the next step for preparing this recipe?

Senior Turkish sources have said that talks between the two countries, which have recently improved after diplomatic tensions last year, have included the possibility of a ground invasion. The proposal, which would likely require US approval, comes as Russia and Iran increase their support for Syrian President Bashar alAssad. Expand this summary.","output":"Reports indicate that Turkey and Saudi Arabia are in discussions about deploying troops to Syria as a joint effort to combat ISIS. This proposal comes as Russia and Iran increase their support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Senior sources from Turkey have confirmed that the talks have included the possibility of a ground invasion, although any such move would need US approval. Relations between Turkey and Saudi Arabia were strained last year, with diplomatic tensions souring ties between the two nations. However, this new plan marks a fresh step forward for the countries, with officials suggesting that recent discussions have been positive. If the two nations go ahead with the proposal, it could have far-reaching implications for the Syrian conflict. Both Saudi Arabia and Turkey have previously spoken out about the need to ramp up efforts to tackle ISIS, and this latest move would signal a more significant commitment. Nonetheless, there are concerns about the potential impact of such an invasion, particularly given the increasing support for Assad from Russia and Iran. There has been no confirmation of the likelihood of such an intervention, but the news will be closely monitored by those with interests in the Syrian conflict.

It begins in the mouth, where enzymes in saliva start breaking down carbohydrates. The chewed food then travels through the esophagus into the stomach, where it is mixed with more enzymes and digestive fluids to further break down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. The partially digested food then moves into the small intestine, where enzymes from the pancreas and the small intestine continue to break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Enzymes like amylase, protease, and lipase are responsible for breaking down these macromolecules into their smaller subunits. The broken-down nutrients are then absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine and transported to different parts of the body for energy and other functions. Any undigested waste material is then eliminated from the body through the large intestine and rectum.

The situation is particularly dire in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where poverty levels are already high. In these areas, lockdowns and supply disruptions have made it even more difficult for families to access the food they need to survive. The UN has called for immediate action to avert a major humanitarian crisis, including increased funding for food assistance programs and measures to ensure the continued functioning of food supply chains.

They also argue that animals used in research are well-cared for, and that strict regulations and ethical standards ensure that their suffering is minimized and justified for the greater good. Perspective 2: Many animal rights advocates argue that using animals in scientific research is a cruel and unnecessary practice that should be banned. They believe that animals have the same inherent right to live free from exploitation and suffering as humans do, and that scientists have no moral justification for causing pain and distress to animals. They also argue that animal testing often produces misleading results, as animals may not react to drugs and diseases in the same way as humans do.

The spider, known as the “Di Caprio Spider”, was found by a group of researchers who were exploring the area. The spider was named after Leonardo Di Caprio because its unique markings resemble the actor’s famous smile. The discovery has caused excitement among arachnologists who have been studying the spider’s behaviour and characteristics. One of the most interesting findings about the Di Caprio Spider is that its venom has potential medical benefits. Studies have shown that the venom contains a compound that could be used in the treatment of nerve diseases. This is a very significant discovery that could potentially lead to the development of new treatments for nerve-related conditions. However, research in this area is still in its early stages and much more work needs to be done before any treatments can be developed. Despite its potential medical benefits, the Di Caprio Spider is also known for its aggressive behaviour. The spider has been known to attack humans who come into contact with it, so caution is advised when exploring the Amazon rainforest. In conclusion, the discovery of the Di Caprio Spider is an exciting development for arachnologists and medical researchers alike. Further research into the spider’s venom could potentially lead to the development of new treatments for nerve-related conditions. However, caution is advised for those exploring the Amazon rainforest as the spider can be quite aggressive."},{"instruction":"What is the capital of Australia?
