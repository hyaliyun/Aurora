The location of the Acra is important for understanding how events unfolded in Jerusalem during the struggle between Maccabean and Seleucid forces. This has been the subject of debate among modern scholars. The most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, where it is described as residing in the Lower City, upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure: ...and when he had overthrown the city walls, he built a citadel [Greek: Acra] in the lower part of the city, for the place was high, and overlooked the temple; on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers, and put into it a garrison of Macedonians. However, in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude, from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities. The location of the \\"lower part of the city\\", elsewhere referred to as the \\"Lower City\\", at the time of Josephus (1st century CE) is accepted to be Jerusalem's south-eastern hill, the original urban center traditionally known as the City of David. Lying to the south of the Temple Mount, however, the area exposed today is significantly lower than the Mount itself. The top of the Mount is approximately 30 metres (98 ft) above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later Herodian-era expansion of the Temple enclosure. The elevation decreases to the south of this point. Josephus, a native of Jerusalem, would have been well aware of this discrepancy, yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood. Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount, however, has failed to locate any evidence for such large-scale quarrying. On the contrary, excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times, casting doubt on the suggestion that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the...

On a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", how closely does the first sentence resemble the second one?","output":"In order to answer the question, a deeper understanding of the context is essential. However, I will try to provide a general overview of how Martin (or anyone) might not know something, and how it can be difficult to discern intentions based on actions. 1. How would Martin not know that that was not the case? There are several ways Martin might not be aware of a certain fact or situation. These reasons can be based on individual characteristics, external factors, or even the nature of the information itself. a. Lack of information or exposure: If Martin hasn't been exposed to the information required to know that something is not the case, he will remain unaware. This could be due to limited access to resources or the fact that no one has communicated the information to him. b. Misinterpretation or misunderstanding: Martin might have the relevant information but may have misunderstood or misinterpreted it, leading him to believe something different. c. Cognitive biases: People are subject to various cognitive biases that can affect their understanding or perception of a situation. Martin might be influenced by a bias that makes it difficult for him to recognize the truth of the matter. d. Willful ignorance: In some cases, people might actively choose not to know about a specific situation or topic. If Martin has some motivation to avoid certain information, he might remain intentionally uninformed. 2. How would Martin or anyone else know his intentions based on his actions? Understanding someone's intentions based on their actions can be challenging, as actions often don't convey the full depth of an individual's thoughts, feelings, or motivations. Here are some factors that can contribute to this complexity: a. Multiple interpretations: One action can often be interpreted in various ways, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact motivation behind the behavior. b. Unconscious motivations: People may sometimes act without being fully aware of their intentions, making it challenging for both themselves and others to determine the true driving force behind their actions. c. Disguised intentions: In some instances, individuals may intentionally hide their true intentions, acting in a way that is purposefully misleading. d. Cultural differences: People from different cultural backgrounds might interpret actions differently based on their unique cultural norms, making it challenging to understand someone's intentions universally. 3. On a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", how closely does the first sentence resemble the second one? After a careful analysis of both sentences, I would rate their similarity at around 2. While both sentences focus on the theme of uncertainty and understanding, they delve into distinct aspects of these concepts. The first sentence concerns Martin's lack of knowledge about a specific situation or fact, whereas the second one tackles the question of understanding intentions based on actions. While these ideas are somewhat related, they do not convey the same meaning, hence the rating of 2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Australia's Northern Territory became the first legal authority in the world to perform euthanasia --that's to say, doctors are permitted to take the lives of incurably ill patients who wish to die. Word that the law was passed by the vote of 15 to 10 immediately flashed on the Internet and was picked up by John, the director of the Right to Die Society of Canada, who posted it on the group's homepage online, saying, \\"This isn't merely something that happened in Australia. It's world history.\\" The NT Rights of the Terminally Ill Law has left physicians and citizens trying to deal with its moral and practical influence. Some have breathed sighs of relief; but others, including churches, right to life groups and the Australian Medical Association, bitterly attacked the law. But the tide is unlikely to turn back. In Australia--where an aging population, life-extending technology and changing community attitudes have all played their part--other states are going to consider making a similar law. In the U. S. and Canada, where the right to die movement is gathering strength, _ . Under the new Northern Territory law, an adult patient can request death--probably by a deadly injection or pill--to end suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as incurably ill by two doctors. After a \\"cooling off\\" period of seven days, the patient can sign a certificate of request. After 48 hours the wish for death can be met. For Lloyd, a 54-year-old Darwin resident suffering from lung cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally Ill Law means he can get on with living without the disturbing fear of his suffering: a terrifying death from his breathing condition. \\"I' m not afraid of dying from a spiritual point of view, but what I was afraid of was how I'd go, because I've watched people die in the hospital fighting for oxygen and clawing at their masks,\\" he says. Question: According to the text, which of the following statements is TURE? - Patients will ask their doctors for euthanasia if they are afraid of illness. - Australia, Canada and the US speak highly of the law of euthanasia. - All people in Australia don't share the positive attitude to euthanasia - If a patient requests death, he should sign a certificate after 48 hours.

Title: Frost/Nixon Movie plot: After the Watergate scandal of 1972 and his subsequent resignation in 1974, 400 million worldwide watch Nixon leave the White House. Among them is British journalist David Frost, currently recording a talk show in Australia, who decides to interview Nixon. Nixonâs literary agent, Irving \\"Swifty\\" Lazar, believes the interview would be an opportunity for Nixon to salvage his reputation, and to make some money. Nixon ultimately demands 600,000, and Frost accepts. After persuading his friend and producer John Birt that the interviews would be a success, Frost and Birt travel to California to meet with Nixon. On the plane to California, Frost flirts with a young woman called Caroline Cushing, and they begin a relationship. Frost struggles to sell the interviews to U.S. networks, and decides to finance the project with private money and syndicate the broadcast of the interviews. He hires two investigators â Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. â to help him prepare, along with Birt. Frost is not clear on what he wants from the interview, and Reston encourages him to aim for a confession from Nixon. Under the watchful eye of Nixon's post-presidential chief of staff, Jack Brennan, Frost and Nixon embark on the first three recording sessions. Restricted by an agreed-upon timeframe and under pressure from his own team to ask the tough questions, Frost struggles to get a word in as Nixon dominates with lengthy and self-serving monologues, fencing ably on Vietnam and boasting about his achievements in foreign policy. Behind the scenes, Frost's editorial team is nervous about his interviewing technique, and angry that Nixon appears to be exonerating himself. Four days before the final session, which will center on Watergate, Frost receives a phonecall from an inebriated Nixon. In a drunken rant, Nixon declares that they both know the final interview will make or break their careers, and compares himself to Frost, insisting that they both came from humble backgrounds and had to battle the elite to make it to the top of...

The story begins when Peter is sent to Manhattan to retrieve his playboy cousin Keith (Ellison) and immediately falls in love with Francey. After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn).

Given the question: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"In order to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, it's essential to examine the logical connection or implication shared between the two statements. The premise is: \\"I want you to take a moment to look at this pie chart.\\" This statement implies that the speaker is requesting the listener to direct their attention towards a specific pie chart and spend a brief moment analyzing it. The premise establishes the context for an ensuing discussion or inquiry, as it creates the expectation that the listener will engage with the pie chart's visual representation of data. This is evident through the use of words such as \\"take a moment\\" and \\"look,\\" which denote attention, contemplation, and focus. On the other hand, the hypothesis is: \\"Quit looking at that pie chart.\\" The hypothesis proposes an instruction to disengage or stop paying attention to the pie chart. The directive \\"quit looking\\" signifies an abrupt cessation of the action of \\"looking,\\" implying that there is a contrasting situation at hand—a situation where the listener was previously engaged with the chart but is now asked to discontinue that engagement. Upon comparing the two statements, it becomes apparent that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. While the premise encourages the listener to focus on the pie chart, the hypothesis suggests the listener should disengage from it. These two instructions are contradictory, meaning that they cannot both be valid within the same context. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"Quit looking at that pie chart\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"I want you to take a moment to look at this pie chart\\" because the actions suggested in the two statements are contradictory and cannot logically coexist in the same context. The lack of logical connection or implication between the two statements means that the hypothesis does not follow from the premise."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November.

If you like this make sure you catch Dead or Alive which is very similar (barring the insane ending in DOA of course). Great for Japan that they have a talent like Miike working at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best chance of seeing this film outside a Takashi Miike retrospective at a film festival is on DVD.

A study in 2007 by Mark Long, an economics professor at the University of Washington, demonstrated that the alternatives of affirmative action proved ineffective in restoring minority enrollment in public flagship universities in California, Texas, and Washington. More specifically, apparent rebounds of minority enrollment can be explained by increasing minority enrollment in high schools of those states, and the beneficiaries of class-based (not race) affirmative action would be white students. At the same time, affirmative action itself is both morally and materially costly: 52 percent of white populace (compared to 14 percent of black) thought it should be abolished, implying white distaste of using racial identity, and full-file review is expected to cost the universities an additional 1.5 million to 2 million per year, excluding possible cost of litigation.

He's dedicated to his job and rarely takes any time off for personal enjoyment. Mike's best friend, Trent, is a fun-loving, charismatic individual who believes that life should be a non-stop party. Trent feels that Mike needs to loosen up and enjoy life more. As the birthday gift, Trent plans the ultimate Vegas trip for them both. One day, Mike returns home to find Trent waiting for him with two tickets in hand. He talks Mike into taking an impromptu weekend trip to Las Vegas, selling it as a once-in-a-lifetime adventure that could completely change their lives. Mike hesitantly agrees and packs his bags. Act 2 Upon arriving in Vegas, Mike and Trent dive headfirst into the wild nightlife, with Trent leading Mike through a series of extravagant, luxurious parties. Intrigued and drawn in by the electrifying atmosphere of the city, Mike starts to let go of his rigid, driven nature and embraces an entirely new side of himself. During their adventures, Mike meets and falls for a captivating and fascinating local artist named Lily. Meanwhile, Trent, known for his insatiable gambling adrenaline, takes Mike on a lucky streak in the casinos where they win big. Slowly, Mike starts to realize that there is more to life than just work and finds himself embracing the carefree attitude that Trent has always espoused. Act 3 As their trip comes to an end, Mike and Trent prepare to return to Los Angeles. But a sudden twist of fate changes everything: Trent loses all their winnings in one last ill-advised bet. Mike starts to question Trent's excessively relaxed approach to life, realizing that maybe he's been irresponsible as well. The duo must now find a way to get back to Los Angeles, brokered and stranded in Las Vegas. As they hustle and rely on each other through a series of comical misadventures, they learn valuable life lessons about the balance between responsibility and letting loose. In the end, Mike and Trent manage to get back home, thanks to their newfound resourcefulness and a little help from kind-hearted Lily. As they recover from their wild trip, both friends genuinely appreciate the life-changing experience and vow to find a better balance in their daily lives. Back in Los Angeles, Mike begins dating Lily, both embracing his work and enjoying life more fully with a newfound sense of balance. Trent, while still the life of the party, becomes more mindful of his actions and chooses to give in to his reckless impulses more sparingly. \\"Vegas, Baby!\\" is a journey where two best friends learn to balance the extremes of their outlooks on life, while discovering the value of cherishing the simple pleasures and joys that friendship and love can bring."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After removing the torte from the freezer, spread the whipping cream mixture all of the top using a loaf pan.; (B). After removing the torte from the freezer, spread the whipping cream mixture all of the top using an offset spatula.;","output":"Option B is the correct choice for spreading frosting on a creamy chocolate toffee torte. To spread frosting on a creamy chocolate toffee torte, you should follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Prepare all necessary ingredients: Ensure that you have prepared the chocolate toffee torte, the frosting (typically a whipped cream or buttercream), and any additional toppings (such as crumbled toffee bits, chocolate shavings, or chopped nuts) as per your recipe. 2. Freeze the torte: To help prevent the torte from becoming too soft or falling apart during decoration, most recipes will require you to freeze the torte for at least one hour or until it has firmed up. 3. Collect your tools: For this task, you will need an offset spatula (option B) and a cake stand or a serving platter. An offset spatula is a versatile tool that is ideal for frosting cakes due to its angled handle, allowing better control and precision when spreading the frosting. 4. Place the torte on a cake stand or serving platter: Carefully transfer the frozen torte from the freezer to the cake stand or platter. This will make it easier for you to apply the frosting and create a visually appealing presentation. 5. Apply a crumb coat: If your torte has loose crumbs on the surface, you can apply a thin layer of frosting (known as a crumb coat) to the entire cake. This layer will trap any crumbs and set a smooth base for the final frosting. After applying this layer, chill the torte in the refrigerator for about 15-30 minutes. 6. Spread the frosting: After removing the torte from the refrigerator (or freezer if not applying a crumb coat), place a dollop of the whipping cream mixture onto the center of the torte. Using the offset spatula, spread the frosting evenly across the top of the torte, working from the center outwards in smooth, sweeping motions. As you frost the cake, rotate the turntable (if using one) or the cake stand to access all angles. 7. Frost the sides: To frost the sides of the torte, scoop a generous amount of the remaining frosting onto the offset spatula, and gently spread it around the torte's sides using smooth, even strokes. Ensure that the frosting is uniformly spread, from top to bottom. 8. Smooth the surface: Once the torte is completely covered in frosting, use the offset spatula to go over the top and sides again, smoothing any ridges or imperfections. This will give you a polished, professional appearance. 9. Add additional toppings: If desired, sprinkle crumbled toffee bits, chocolate shavings, or chopped nuts over the top of the torte to enhance the overall appearance and taste. You can also add designs with a piping bag for a more elaborate presentation. 10. Allow the torte to set: To ensure that the frosting adheres properly and sets firmly, return the cake to the refrigerator for at least 30-60 minutes, or until the frosting is firm to the touch. Once this process is complete, your delicious creamy chocolate toffee torte, beautifully frosted using an offset spatula (option B), will be ready to serve and enjoy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered, but 1969's \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time. Directed by John Schlesinger and written by Waldo Salt, the movie seems to be a product of its time, the late 1960's when American films were especially expressionistic, but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period. The film's cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in Ang Lee's \\"Brokeback Mountain\\". The meandering plot follows Joe Buck, a naive, young Texan who decides to move to Manhattan to become a stud-for-hire for rich women. Full of energy but lacking any savvy, he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances. He meets a cynical, sickly petty thief named \\"Ratso\\" Rizzo, who first sees Joe as an easy pawn. The two become dependent on one another, and Rizzo begins to manage Joe. Things come to a head at a psychedelic, drug-infested party where Joe finally lands a paying client. Meanwhile, Rizzo becomes sicker, and the two set off for Florida to seek a better life. This is not a story that will appeal to everyone, in fact, some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures, yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic. In his first major role, Jon Voight is ideally cast as he brings out Joe's paper-thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities. As Rizzo, Dustin Hoffman successfully upends his clean, post-college image from \\"The Graduate\\" and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to Joe. The honesty of their portrayals is complemented by Schlesinger's film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the Times Square district at the time. The director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character's fragile psyches. Credit also needs to go to Salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story. The other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters, including Brenda Vaccaro as the woman Joe meets at the party, Sylvia Miles as a blowsy matron, John McGiver as a religious zealot and Barnard Hughes as a lonely out-of-towner. The two-disc 2006 DVD package contains a pristine print transfer of the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer Jerome Hellman since unfortunately neither Schlesinger nor Salt are still living. There are three terrific featurettes on the second disc - a look-back documentary, \\"After Midnight: Reflections on a Classic 35 Years Later\\", which features comments from Hellman, Hoffman, Voight and others, as well as clips and related archive footage such as Voight's screen test; \\"Controversy and Acclaim\\", which examines the genesis of the movie's initial 'X' rating and public response to the film; and a tribute to the director, \\"Celebrating Schlesinger\\".

Paragraph: The Bush administration did not develop new diplomatic initiatives on al Qaeda with the Saudi government before 9/11. Vice President Cheney called Crown Prince Abdullah on July 5, 2001, to seek Saudi help in preventing threatened attacks on American facilities in the Kingdom. Secretary of State Powell met with the crown prince twice before 9/11. They discussed topics like Iraq, not al Qaeda.U.S.-Saudi relations in the summer of 2001 were marked by sometimes heated disagreements about ongoing Israeli- Palestinian violence, not about  Bin Laden. The confirmation of the Pentagon's new leadership was a lengthy process. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was confirmed in March 2001 and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith in July. Though the new officials were briefed about terrorism and some of the earlier planning, including that for Operation Infinite Resolve, they were focused, as Secretary Rumsfeld told us, on creating a twenty-first-century military. At the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton did not recall much interest by the new administration in military options against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He could not recall any specific guidance on the topic from the secretary. Brian Sheridan-the outgoing assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict (SOLIC), the key counterterrorism policy office in the Pentagon-never briefed Rumsfeld. He departed on January 20; he had not been replaced by 9/11. Rumsfeld noted to us his own interest in terrorism, which came up often in his regular meetings with Tenet. He thought that the Defense Department, before 9/11, was not organized adequately or prepared to deal with new threats like terrorism. But his time was consumed with getting new officials in place and working on the foundation documents of a new defense policy, the quadrennial defense review, the defense planning guidance, and the existing contingency plans. He did not recall any particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before 9/11, other than the development of the Predator unmanned aircraft system. The commander of Central Command, General Franks, told us that he did not regard the existing plans as serious. To him a real military plan to address al Qaeda would need to go all the way, following through the details of a full campaign (including the political-military issues of where operations would be based) and securing the rights to fly over neighboring countries. The draft presidential directive circulated in June 2001 began its discussion of the military by reiterating the Defense Department's lead role in protecting its forces abroad.  Question: \\"What position was vacant from January 2001 and had not been replaced before 9/11?\\" Answer: \\"Commander\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer is incorrect.

Article: Electricity, like clean water, is a resource that's often taken for granted. But last summer, when blackouts struck much of the northeastern US, Ontario and Rome, consumers on two continents were given a painful reminder of just how easily broken electricity supplies can be. The massive disorder stranded  commuters, stopped freezers, shut down businesses and refocused attention on where most of the planet's power comes from:oil-and-gas-fired generators and nuclear plants, These sources not only pollute the environment but also make many consumers feel unacceptable health risks. Companies are trying to offer an alternative, clean energy from renewable resources that's plentiful and portable. Lifton's Medis Technologies, as well as companies like Hydrogenics and Nanosys, is tapping into fuel cells and dolor panels to give people power whenever and wherever they want it, free from dependence on local grids . The search for alternative energy is nothing new, but the current trend of innovators is focusing on the goal of making clean and sustainable power a mainstream commodity. For example, the fuel cell, which produces electricity from the chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen, has been around for about 150 years, though its commercial development did not begin until the 1960s and then only as part of NASA spacecraft. Today this technology is coming down to Earth in places like Tokyo; in nine European cities, from Stockholm to Porto, each operating three hydrogen-fuel-cell buses; and in Iceland, which is trying to create the first fuel free hydrogen economy by 2030.

(CNN) -- If this is an indication of what Roger Federer will do at Wimbledon, his opponents had better watch out. Federer recorded the second double bagel of his career when he defeated wildcard Mischa Zverev 6-0 6-0 on Friday to reach the semifinals of a Wimbledon warm-up in Halle, Germany. The only other time Federer didn't drop a game in a match was at the year-end championships in 2005 against clay-court specialist Gaston Gaudio. \\"You never go to court aiming for such a score,\\" Federer, who turns 32 in August, told reporters. \\"I'm surprised to have managed it today.\\" At Wimbledon, which begins on June 24, Federer will be bidding to advance to a first grand slam final since claiming a seventh title on the","output":"London grass in 2012. The Swiss maestro, ranked No. 3 in the world, has been showing glimpses of his vintage best in recent months, winning titles in Dubai and Miami, and reaching the semifinals in Indian Wells and Madrid. As the championships draw closer, expectations are high for Federer to bring his A-game to the All England Club. This scintillating performance at Halle, where he has already won the Gerry Weber Open a record nine times, could be just the confidence boost he needs to perform exceptionally well on his favorite surface, grass. Federer's early exit at the French Open this year raised a few questions about his ability to challenge for major titles at 32. However, this win over Zverev proves that he cannot be written off just yet. Moving into the Wimbledon fortnight, Federer's main challengers are likely to be his arch rivals, world No. 1 Novak Djokovic and 12-time French Open winner Rafael Nadal. Djokovic recently defeated Federer in the thrilling final of the Australian Open, while Nadal triumphed on his favorite surface at Roland Garros. However, Andy Murray, a two-time Wimbledon champion, and rising stars like Alexander Zverev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, can't be ignored. These young talents have shown great promise and could pose a significant threat to the veterans of the game. Federer's fans will be eagerly looking forward to another potential classic between the Swiss legend and the top players in the game. The ultimate dream showdown would be a repeat of the epic 2008 Wimbledon final between Federer and Nadal, often regarded as one of the greatest matches of all time. In order to achieve this dream final, Federer will have to navigate his way through the typically star-studded Wimbledon draw and overcome formidable opponents during the two-week championship. Regardless of the outcome at Wimbledon, Federer's unrivaled career, which includes a record 20 Grand Slam titles, has already secured his place in tennis history. His incredible consistency over two decades and unmatched longevity make him one of the most iconic figures in the world of sports. It remains to be seen whether Federer can defy time once again and lift the coveted trophy at Wimbledon, or if a new champion will step up and claim the throne. But one thing is clear - this year's Wimbledon Championships promise to be a thrilling and unforgettable event for tennis fans around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Researchers excavate a Neanderthal dwelling site called El Salt in southeastern Spain. (Photo: Courtesy of Ainara Sistiaga)      Maybe archaeologists should watch where they step. Researchers have stumbled across what may be the world's oldest human poop, deposited by Neanderthals about 50,000 years ago atop an ancient campfire in Spain.      If the discovery is truly a prehistoric latrine – a claim that has provoked skepticism among other researchers – it contradicts the pop-culture image of Neanderthals as hunters who subsisted on hunks of flesh. Two of the new poop samples contain the chemical footprints of both meat and plant consumption, providing the earliest known evidence that humans were omnivores who ate significant quantities of plant-based food.      To the uneducated eye, the newfound Pleistocene poop doesn't look like poop except for its light-brown color, and the scientists who found it weren't looking for coprolites – preserved dung – at all. They were poking around rudimentary hearths at the Neanderthal site known as El Salt, hoping to find evidence of food preparation.      \\"I thought they were cooking in there, so I was looking for lipids from cooking,\\" says Ainara Sistiaga of Spain's University of La Laguna, one of the scientists reporting the new discovery in Wednesday's PLOS ONE. Instead, analysis revealed traces of an activity that doesn't usually take place atop a blazing fire, but \\"I don't think they were using (the site as a toilet) when the fire was active.\\"      Closeup of what the scientists say is a miniature sample of Neanderthal poop. (Photo: Courtesy of Carolina Mallol)      The poop samples come from rock layers dated to roughly 50,000 years ago. That's far older than other ancient wastes, such as those found at Turkey's Catalhöyük, one of the world's earliest large villages, dating back 6,000 to 7,000 years, and what might be 14,000-year-old human coprolites at a cave in Oregon.      Three of the five Neanderthal samples contained high levels of compounds created by the breakdown of cholesterol, which is found in animal foods. But two additional samples contained those same compounds as well as those produced by the breakdown of molecules found in plant-based foods. The ratio of the different compounds points to a human origin, the researchers say.      The researchers haven't calculated the percentage of vegetable matter in these ancient dinners, but Sistiaga speculates that they could have been up to 25% plant-based. Previous studies have shown that Neanderthals ate deer and horse as well as roots, tubers and fruit.      Other researchers call the new study intriguing but far from airtight. The compounds measured by Sistiaga and her colleagues have probably degraded over time, making them unreliable as indicators of human feces, says Michael Richards of the University of British Columbia. The study does not rule out bears, which are also omnivorous, as the source of the coprolites, says Hervé Bocherens of the University of Tübingen in Germany.      The new method described in the paper is \\"very exciting,\\" says Amanda Henry of Germany's Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. But \\"they have not managed to convince me yet that the coprolite they're looking at is actually human.\\"      Sistiaga responds that as far as she knows, bears don't produce the same chemical from cholesterol that humans do. She also says degradation would not affect her results and that prehistoric poop may not be all that rare.      \\"No one has been looking for it,\\" she says. \\"It's not because it's not there.\\"      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1v6Wz7n ||||| Bones can only tell us so much. Experts often assume or make educated guesses to fill in the gaps in mankind's family tree, and to develop a sense what our ancestors may have looked like. Judging from skull and mandible fragments found in a cave in Israel in 1969, this young female Homo sapien lived between 100,000 and 90,000 years ago. Her bones indicate she was about 20 years old. Her shattered skull was found among the remains of 20 others in a shallow grave.      The skull and jaw of this female \\"hobbit\\" was found in Liang Bua, Flores, Indonesia, in 2003. She was about 1 meter tall (about 3'3\\") and lived about 18,000 years ago. The discovery of her species, Homo floresiensis, brought into question the belief that Homo sapiens was the only form of mankind for the past 30,000 years. Scientists are still debating whether Homo floresiensis was its own species, or merely a group of diseased modern humans. Evidence is mounting that these small beings were, in fact, a distinct human species.      The \\"Old Man of La Chapelle\\" was recreated from the skull and jaw of a Homo neanderthalensis male found near La Chapelle-aux-Saints, in France in 1908. He lived 56,000 years ago. His relatively old age, thought to be between 40 to 50 years old, indicates he was well looked after by a clan. The old man's skeleton indicates he suffered from a number of afflictions, including arthritis, and had numerous broken bones. Scientists at first did not realize the age and afflicted state of this specimen when he was first discovered. This led them to incorrectly theorize that male Neanderthals were hunched over when they walked.      This adult male, Homo heidelbergensis, was discovered in in Sima de los Huesos, Spain in 1993. Judging by the skull and cranium, scientists believe he probably died from a massive infection that caused a facial deformation. The model, shown here, does not include the deformity. This species is believed to be an ancestor of Neanderthals, as seen in the shape of his face. \\"Miquelon,\\" the nickname of \\"Atapuerca 5\\", lived about 500,000 to 350,000 years ago and fossils of this species have been found in Italy, France and Greece.      The almost perfectly preserved skeleton of the \\"Turkana Boy\\" is one of the most spectacular discoveries in paleoanthropology. Judging from his anatomy, scientists believe this Homo ergaster was a tall youth about 13 to 15 years old. According to research, the boy died beside a shallow river delta, where he was covered by alluvial sediments. Comparing the shape of the skull and teeth, H. ergaster had a similiar head structure to the Asian Homo erectus.      This model of a sub-human species -- Homo rudolfensis -- was made from bone fragments found in Koobi Fora, Kenya, in 1972. The adult male is believed to have lived about 1.8 million years ago. He used stone tools and ate meat and plants. H. Rudolfensis' distinctive features include a flatter, broader face and broader postcanine teeth, with more complex crowns and roots. He is also recognized as having a larger cranium than his contemporaries.      Researchers shaped this skull of \\"Zinj,\\" found in 1959. The adult male lived 1.8 million years ago in the Olduvai Gorge of Tanzania. His scientific name is Paranthropus boisei, though he was originally called Zinjanthropus boisei -- hence the nickname. First discovered by anthropologist Mary Leakey, the well-preserved cranium has a small brain cavity. He would have eaten seeds, plants and roots which he probably dug with sticks or bones.      The skull of this male adult was found on the western shore of Lake Turkana in Kenya in 1985. The shape of the mouth indicates that he had a strong bite and could chew plants. He is believed to have lived in 2.5 million years ago and is classified as Paranthropus aethiopicus. Much is still unknown about this species because so few reamins of P. aethiopicus have been found.      Meet \\"Mrs. Ples,\\" the popular nickname for the most complete skull of an Australopithecus africanus, unearthed in Sterkfontein, South Africa in 1947. It is believed she lived 2.5 million years ago (although the sex of the fossil is not entirely certain). Crystals found on her skull suggest that she died after falling into a chalk pit, which was later filled with sediment. A. africanus has long puzzled scientists because of its massive jaws and teeth, but they now believe the species' skull design was optimal for cracking nuts and seeds.      With each new discovery, paleoanthropologists have to rewrite the origins of man's ancestors, adding on new branches and tracking when species split. This model was fashioned from pieces of a skull and jaw found among the remains of 17 pre-humans (nine adults, three adolescents and five children) which were discovered in the Afar Region of Ethiopia in 1975. The ape-man species, Australopithecus afarensis, is believed to have lived 3.2 million years ago. Several more bones from this species have been found in Ethiopia, including the famed \\"Lucy,\\" a nearly complete A. afarensis skeleton found in Hadar.      To put a human face on our ancestors, scientists from the Senckenberg Research Institute used sophisticated methods to form 27 model heads based on tiny bone fragments, teeth and skulls collected from across the globe. The heads are on display for the first time together at the Senckenberg Natural History Museum in Frankfurt, Germany. This model is Sahelanthropus tchadensis, also nicknamed \\"Toumai,\\" who lived 6.8 million years ago. Parts of its jaw bone and teeth were found nine years ago in the Djurab desert in Chad. It's one of the oldest hominid specimens ever found.      Neanderthals in Spain weren't just meat eaters, suggests the first direct evidence of their omnivorous diet. An analysis of 50,000-year-old feces -- likely the oldest known human poop -- suggest they ate tubers, berries and nuts as well as meat.      Researchers from MIT and the University of La Laguna say we've probably overemphasized the role of meat in the Neanderthal diet based on traces of plant matter found in samples from a site in El Salt, Spain.      Previous research showed what sorts of prey Neanderthals consumed -- pigs vs. cows, for example -- and depicted Neanderthals as exclusively carnivorous. Later studies found plant remains in the teeth of Neanderthals, but that might also be misleading.      \\"Sometimes in prehistoric societies, they used their teeth as tools, biting plants, among other things,\\" said Ainara Sistiaga, a graduate student at the University of La Laguna who led the study as a visiting student at MIT, in a statement. \\"We can't assume they were actually eating the plants based on finding microfossils in their teeth.\\"      So the researchers decided to take a more direct approach.      \\"This study represents the first approach to Neanderthal diet through the analysis of fecal markers\\" found in soil, Sistiaga said.      The research shows Neanderthals ate meat as their primary food source, but the discovery of a compound from plant sources called 5β-stigmastanol shows that plants added variety to their diet that was previously unproven. Every sample studied showed signs of meat consumption, and some samples showed signs of plant matter.      \\"It's important to understand all aspects of why humanity has come to dominate the planet the way it does,\\" said co-author Roger Summons, a professor of geobiology at MIT. \\"A lot of that has to do with improved nutrition over time.\\"      Photo: iStock ||||| Summary:","output":"Researchers have discovered 50,000-year-old feces, likely the oldest known human poop, which provides the earliest known evidence that Neanderthals were omnivores who consumed both meat and plant-based foods.

De Blasio rules out canceling J'Ouvert amid calls for its end Mayor de Blasio ruled out cancelling the predawn festival on Tuesday, a day after two people were killed by errant bullets during the Brooklyn event. It appeared on Monday that nixing the violence-marred street event was a possibility when Hizzoner said “all options are on the table.” Pols say N.Y.'s tough laws can't stop guns from entering state “J’Ouvert will continue. It’s an event that’s very important to the community,” de Blasio said. “We were not including the option of ending something that has gone on for decades.” A handful of other elected officials disagreed, saying J’Ouvert — which floods streets in Crown Heights and Flatbush — needed to be suspended or significantly restricted. The deaths of Tyreke Borel, 17, and Tiarah Poyau, 22, at J’Ouvert came despite a massive deployment of cops designed to prevent bloodshed. The fatal shootings at J’Ouvert came nearly a year after Carey Gabay, 43, an aide to Gov. Cuomo, was shot and killed in a gang crossfire during the same event. Four shot, two fatally, in J’Ouvert parade violence “It is with a heavy heart that I call on a suspension of the J’Ouvert celebration,” said Assemblyman Walter Mosley (D-Brooklyn) whose district includes Prospect Heights and parts of Crown Heights. Assemblywoman Annette Robinson, whose district includes parts of Crown Heights, said J’Ouvert should be restricted like Times Square on New Year’s Eve. “It should be held in a specific area and not all over the place,” Robinson (D-Brooklyn) said. But other pols were skeptical how J’Ouvert could be suspended. NYPD safety upgrades fail to prevent J’Ouvert shooting “The only way you could cancel J’Ouvert and all those different elements is if you placed a curfew on people and enforced it with the Police Department, martial law, or the National Guard,” Councilwoman Laurie Cumbo (D-Brooklyn) said. State Sen. Kevin Parker, whose district includes Flatbush and East Flatbush (D-Brooklyn) agreed. “We have in our community a violence problem, not a J’Ouvert problem,” Parker said.

Translate to English.","output":"Alyssonlago: I had always wondered how American gymnastics is to receive basketball and hockey games. Translation: Alyssonlago is expressing curiosity about how gymnastics in the United States is connected or related to basketball and hockey games. To answer this question, let's first look at American gymnastics, basketball, and hockey as separate sports and then discuss how they can intersect or be related to each other. American Gymnastics: Gymnastics is a sport that involves a variety of physical exercises and performances, where athletes test their strength, flexibility, balance, and control through a range of events. In the United States, gymnastics is a popular sport that is particularly known for its success in the Olympic Games. It is governed by USA Gymnastics, which is responsible for overseeing the selection and training of national teams and the organization of national and international competitions. Basketball and Hockey: Basketball and hockey are both team sports played in the United States and around the world. Basketball is played by two teams of five players each, with the objective of scoring points by shooting a ball through a hoop placed at each end of the court. It is governed by USA Basketball and the NBA. On the other hand, hockey is played on ice and involves two teams of six players (including a goaltender) trying to score goals by shooting a puck into the opposing team's net. It is governed by USA Hockey and the NHL. Connections between Gymnastics, Basketball, and Hockey: While gymnastics, basketball, and hockey appear to be quite distinct sports with different focuses and a unique set of skills required, there are some ways in which they can be connected or related to each other. 1. Athleticism: All three sports require a certain level of athleticism, including strength, flexibility, agility, and endurance. In addition, many athletes often engage in cross-training to improve their overall performance, and gymnastics can be a beneficial form of cross-training for both basketball and hockey players. Gymnastics training can help improve balance, flexibility, and body control, which can benefit athletes in other sports. 2. Sports facilities: Highly developed sports facilities can often accommodate different sports under one roof. For example, a large sports complex might include a gymnasium for gymnastics events and separate courts or rinks for basketball and hockey games. In this sense, gymnastics can share the same space as basketball and hockey matches when it comes to utilizing sports facilities. 3. Seasonal overlap: Although gymnastics, basketball, and hockey seasons may not align perfectly, they can have some overlap. For example, both basketball and gymnastics typically have competitive seasons during the winter months, which may coincide with hockey games. This seasonal overlap could lead to increased attendance at all three events, as sports enthusiasts look to enjoy various athletic competitions in the colder months. 4. Sponsorship and marketing: Sports, in general, rely on sponsorship and marketing to generate revenue and promote their respective organizations and athletes. Gymnastics, basketball, and hockey organizations might collaborate, partner, or share sponsors and marketing strategies to support and grow their respective disciplines. For example, a sports apparel company may sponsor athletes from all three sports and use them together in advertising campaigns. In conclusion, while American gymnastics, basketball, and hockey are distinct sports, they share common elements and opportunities for collaboration. These connections can include cross-training benefits, shared sports facilities, seasonal overlap, and joint marketing and sponsorship strategies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

'Hate Speech' is kind of a threating statement or sometimes include call for violence while 'offensive' statement just offensds someone. 'Neither' is when it doesn't fall into Hate Speech or Offensive category. Problem:&#8220;@DrMalvo: @woods_lamar  http://t.co/ChNxcPLZWR&#8221; Hidey hidey hoe! White folk be all noyvous round coloreds Solution:","output":"Upon analyzing the given tweet, it seems like the user is portraying a certain stereotype about racial groups. This can be seen where they mimic a statement involving \\"white folk\\" and \\"coloreds\\". Although the tweet is not issuing any direct threats or calling for violence, the racial comments could be seen as offensive by some. Therefore, it falls in the category of 'Offensive'. Step 1: Analyze the tweet for any explicit threats or calls for violence. I found none, hence it doesn't fall in the 'Hate Speech' category.  Step 2: Examine the tweet for any offensive language or portrayal of stereotypes. The tweet uses the terms \\"white folk\\" and \\"coloreds\\", this could be seen as perpetuating racial stereotypes and might offend people who belong to those groups.  Step 3: After analyzing the above steps, I concluded that it doesn't fall into 'Neither' category as it could be offensive to some individuals.  Justification: Tweets or statements are usually categorized as offensive if they include disrespectful or insulting remarks, especially if these comments involve individuals or groups (based on race, religion, etc.). This tweet could potentially offend or insult some individuals due to its underlying racial undertone.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. perlite for high temperature applications in the steel and foundry industries Make this proper case.","output":"Perlite is a versatile, naturally occurring siliceous volcanic rock that has found its way into numerous applications across various industries, including the high-temperature domains of steel and foundry industries. When subjected to heating at temperatures around 850-900 degrees Celsius, perlite expands into a lightweight, porous structure, a process known as exfoliation. This striking property of perlite has made it an invaluable resource in both the steel and foundry industries, which rely significantly on high-temperature applications. Here are some key advantages and uses of perlite in steel and foundry industries: 1. High-temperature insulation: Perlite has a low thermal conductivity, making it an excellent high-temperature insulator. Expanded perlite is often used to insulate industrial furnaces, ladles and other high-temperature containment vessels. The perlite's thermal efficiency helps in minimizing heat loss, reduces fuel consumption and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. 2. Low density: Expanded perlite, due to its porous structure, has a low bulk density, which, when used in insulating applications, helps in reducing the overall weight of the equipment or structure being insulated. This light weight can lead to reduced transportation and installation costs. 3. Fire resistance: Perlite's chemical composition makes it resistant to fire and high temperatures. Its melting point is higher than the temperatures typically encountered in most industrial processes. This fire resistance makes it an ideal candidate for use in steel and foundry industries where high-temperature operations are commonplace. 4. Refractory applications: Some perlite products are designed specifically for use in refractory applications. Perlite-based materials can be used in the production of refractory bricks, linings and other high-temperature-resistant structures. 5. Slag coagulant: In the steel-making process, perlite is often employed as a slag coagulant, which helps minimize the amount of slag carryover from the furnace to the ladle. The expanded perlite's porous nature and glassy structure cause it to adsorb and trap the liquid slag from the molten steel. The end result is a cleaner steel product and less need for post-processing treatments. 6. Foundry core and mold making: Due to its lightweight nature, low thermal conductivity, and ability to withstand high temperatures, perlite is commonly used as a core or mold material in the foundry industry. It can be mixed with binders to create intricately shaped molds or cores that maintain their strength and shape during the high-temperature casting process. The perlite also aids in the even distribution of heat, ensuring that castings cool uniformly, reducing the risk of defects and cracking. 7. Alloy and flux additive: Expanded perlite can be added into metallurgical fluxes for increased efficiency in the high-temperature smelting and refining processes. The fluxes and protective gases containing perlite aid in refining, deoxidizing and degassing the molten materials, ultimately improving the quality of the finished product. In conclusion, perlite has proven to be an invaluable resource in various high-temperature applications across the steel and foundry industries. Offering excellent thermal insulation, fire resistance and lightweight properties, perlite plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency, safety, and quality of high-temperature operations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to make a classic vinaigrette","output":"To determine which solution is better for making a classic vinaigrette, we must first examine the steps involved in each solution.  Solution 1: 1. Gather ingredients: extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, honey, salt, and pepper. 2. Measure the ingredients according to desired ratios: 3 parts oil, 1 part vinegar, a small spoon of Dijon mustard, a pinch of salt and pepper, and a drizzle of honey. 3. Combine the ingredients in a small glass or stainless-steel bowl. 4. Whisk the ingredients together until emulsified. 5. Taste and adjust the flavor as needed (e.g., adding more honey for sweetness or more salt and pepper for seasoning). Solution 2: 1. Gather ingredients: extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. 2. Measure the ingredients according to desired ratios: approximately 3 parts oil, 1 part vinegar, a small spoon of Dijon mustard, and a pinch of salt and pepper. 3. Combine the ingredients in a jar with a tight-fitting lid (e.g., mason jar). 4. Shake the jar vigorously until emulsified. 5. Taste and adjust the flavor as needed (e.g., adding more mustard for tanginess or more salt and pepper for seasoning). Comparison: Both solutions involve similar steps in terms of gathering and measuring ingredients, combining them, and adjusting the flavor as needed. However, there are differences in the techniques used for combining and emulsifying the ingredients (whisking vs. shaking), as well as your choice of honey in the first solution. Justification: Solution 1 might be better for those who prefer a sweeter vinaigrette, as it includes honey as one of the ingredients. Whisking the ingredients in a bowl allows for more control over the emulsification process, which may result in a smoother, more homogenous vinaigrette. Solution 2 might be more suited for those who prefer a tangier, more traditional vinaigrette, since it omits honey. Shaking the ingredients in a jar with a lid is a faster, more convenient way to emulsify the mixture without the need for a separate whisk and bowl. Overall, both solutions are viable for making a classic vinaigrette, but the choice between them depends on personal preference regarding flavor and technique."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Stargate: The Ark of Truth Context: The ark of truth is an Ancient device programmed to un-brainwash the followers of the Ori, evil god-like beings who gain strength from the worship of their devotees. Guided by the visions of Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks), apparently remnants of his shared consciousness with Merlin, SG-1 searches for the ark. They fly the Odyssey through the supergate to the Ori galaxy. Accompanying them are Marrick (Currie Graham), a representative of the IOA, the international body that oversees the Stargate program, and Tomin (Tim Guinee), a renegade commander of the Ori forces. Tomin, like Teal'c (Christopher Judge) in the early seasons of Stargate SG-1, is tormented by the wrongs he did for his evil masters. Teal'c pitilessly tells Tomin that Tomin will never forgive himself, but he must nevertheless work to help others.Working on a tip from the anti-Ori resistance, SG-1 beams down to the Ori planet Celestis to look for the ark, but Lt. Cols. Carter (Amanda Tapping) and Mitchell (Ben Browder) return to the Odyssey when they learn that Marrick has locked himself in with the Asgard core, an advanced system installed by Earth's Asgard allies. Before they can get to him, Marrick installs a chip in the core and launches a program that synthesizes a Replicator. (Replicators are self-replicating machines that try to take over any ship or world they encounter.) The Replicator, naturally, escapes into the ship, while Marrick explains that the IOA never believed that SG-1 would find the ark. Unleashing Replicators is the IOA's plan to defeat the Ori's followers.While Carter and Mitchell struggle with the Replicators for control of the Odyssey, Jackson, Teal'c, Vala (Claudia Black), and Tomin descend into a system of tunnels pointed out to Jackson by Merlin.

Validity of the claim: Assess whether the claim is based on genuine grounds and supported by evidence. The claim should be related to a breach of contract, tort, or other legitimate reasons. 2. Restitution: Determine if the purpose of the civil action is to recover damages or losses suffered by the claimant. The compensation should be proportionate to the harm or losses incurred. 3. Proportionality: Consider whether initiating a civil action is proportional to the harm suffered. If the harm done is minor and the costs associated with the legal process is significantly higher, it may not be reasonable to pursue the case. 4. Alternatives: Evaluate if alternatives to litigation, such as mediation, arbitration, or negotiation, can be used to settle the matter. If an amicable resolution can be reached without a trial, it may be fair to choose these methods over legal proceedings. 5. Anger and confusion: Avoid making decisions influenced by anger, frustration, or confusion. A rational assessment of the situation and potential outcomes is essential to determine if pursuing a civil action is fair. 6. Precedent: Consider if your case aligns with previous similar cases that were deemed fair to pursue. This can provide guidance on whether your civil action would be considered fair by the judicial system. Ultimately, determining the fairness of instituting a civil action requires a careful assessment of the specific circumstances and potential outcomes.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: With the development of society and economy, animals and their habitats are getting pushed aside as households decrease in size and increase in number. Small numbers of people per household on average use more energy and goods per person. Greater numbers of households require more natural resources for construction. The possible result of this problem may be _ natural resources to meet consumer demand without endangering habitats important to biodiversity. Personal freedom and social choice may come at huge environmental cost. Direct costs include visible damage to animal habitats and plant life. Indirect costs include the release of more greenhouse gases. The effects of such \\"personal freedom and social choice\\" have already surfaced in south-west China's Wolong Nature Reserve. In Wolong, they found that a reduced average household size was directly tied to an increase in homes, and thus an increase in the amount of firewood consumed for cooking and heating. The rise in wood fuel use has contributed to disappearance of forests and to the loss of habitats for giant pandas. Curious about whether other parts of the world were experiencing similar phenomena, they got the support of a team of researchers including Stanford's Paul Ehrlich, well-known for his population studies, to find out the household dynamics in 141 countries between 1985 and 2000. Their study proved that the difficult choice of Wolong is part of a global trend. In the 76 countries considered biodiversity \\"hotspots\\", such as the United States, Brazil, Australia, and Kenya, the number of households grew by 3.1% every year, while the population increased just 1.8%. Meanwhile, the number of people per home dropped from 4.7 to 4.0. The decline in household size has resulted in 155 million additional households in hotspot countries, almost always limiting biodiversity.

St Kilda (Scottish Gaelic: Hiort) is an isolated archipelago situated 64 kilometres (40 mi) west-northwest of North Uist, in the North Atlantic Ocean. It contains the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The largest island is Hirta, whose sea cliffs are the highest in the United Kingdom.  Three other islands (Dùn, Soay and Boreray) were also used for grazing and seabird hunting. The islands are administratively a part of the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar local authority area.The origin of the name St Kilda is a matter of conjecture. The islands' human heritage includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and the upheaval of the First World War contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930. The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including Michael Powell's film The Edge of the World and an opera.Permanent habitation on the islands possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There are known to be 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.The entire archipelago is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. It became one of Scotland's six World Heritage Sites in 1986, and is one of the few in the world to hold mixed status for both its natural and cultural qualities....

Ford has recalled more than 10 million vehicles in past decade. CNN in 2005 began airing investigative reports on sudden fires in Ford vehicles.","output":"Title: Ford Cruise Control Switch Controversy: Understanding the Faulty Component and its Impact Introduction: A recent controversy has arisen over a faulty cruise control switch in Ford vehicles. Earl Mohlis, who lost his wife in a fire, claims that the switch was responsible for causing the blaze that led to her tragic death. Ford, however, has denied these allegations and stated that the switch was not the cause of the fire. Although Mohlis' lawsuit was eventually settled by the company, the issue continues to create concerns among Ford vehicle owners, particularly given the reports of sudden fires in some of their vehicles.  1. Earl Mohlis' Tragic Loss and Accusation: In a heartbreaking incident, Earl Mohlis lost his wife when their Ford vehicle caught fire due to a faulty cruise control switch. Mohlis claimed that it was this defect that led to the massive blaze that engulfed his wife. He sought justice by filing a lawsuit against Ford, aiming to shed light on the potential dangers that this switch posed to vehicle owners. 2. Ford's Stance on the Issue: Despite the grief and anger expressed by Mohlis, Ford has maintained that the cruise control switch is not responsible for starting the fire in question. The company contends that there is no concrete evidence linking the faulty switch to the blaze that ultimately killed Mohlis' wife. Ultimately, Ford opted to settle the lawsuit, but this decision does not seem to reflect an admission of guilt or responsibility on the company's part. 3. Extensive Recall of Ford Vehicles: Over the past decade, Ford has recalled more than 10 million vehicles for a variety of reasons. While this might be seen as a commitment to quality control and ensuring the safety of its customers, it also tends to heighten concerns around the reliability of the vehicles and the potential risk posed by faulty components. In the case of the cruise control switch, it is vital to examine whether these concerns are warranted and explore any available data on similar incidents. 4. Investigative Reports of Sudden Fires in Ford Vehicles: Adding fuel to the already burning controversy was a series of investigative reports by CNN in 2005, which highlighted the problem of sudden fires in Ford vehicles. These reports revealed that there was a potential issue with some of their vehicles catching fire without warning, potentially placing owners in grave danger. While no conclusive evidence has yet been presented that directly links the cruise control switch to these fires, the concerns raised by these reports cannot be dismissed out of hand. Conclusion: The controversy surrounding the faulty cruise control switch in Ford vehicles is undoubtedly a matter of significant concern for both the company and its customers. The devastating loss faced by Earl Mohlis serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers that faulty automotive components can pose. While Ford denies any responsibility for the incident, it is essential that further investigations are carried out to determine the root cause of such fires and ensure that the necessary steps are taken to guarantee the safety of all vehicle owners."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Two medical school students named Dan and Bob learned about the human immune system. Dan studied more about the subject, and became very interested to pursue it more in the future.  Which student learned that the infected skin area may become painful?  Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. Answer:","output":"Dan learned that the infected skin area may become painful.  Since Dan studied more about the human immune system and became very interested in pursuing it further, it is likely that he learned about the body's second line of defense against pathogens, which includes the inflammatory response.

Scottish charity Quarriers commissioned a study of experiences of epilepsy, which surveyed 505 people across the UK. One woman in Glasgow said she was mugged while having a seizure. More than two-thirds of the 505 people interviewed in the ComRes poll admitted to worrying what members of the public would say or do if they had a seizure. A third admitted this concern led to anxiety about whether to leave the house, while just over half believed discrimination was widespread. About the same amount of respondents felt others treated them differently after they revealed they had the condition. Sara Brannan, who lives in Glasgow with her 10-year-old daughter Mary-Jo and husband Paul, said she had money taken from her while she was having a seizure. She said: \\"A man, who I now think may have been a drug addict, must have been standing behind me and spotted an opportunity. \\"He told the gathering crowd I was his girlfriend and had overdosed.

Options：  A. go to church  B. speak to god  C. praise god  D. kneel  E. sincere The answer is:","output":"B. speak to god When you pray, even if you are paralyzed, the most suitable option is to speak to God. Prayer is an essential way through which people connect with the divine, regardless of their physical abilities or limitations. Speaking to God can be done silently, in a whisper, or aloud, depending on the individual's preferences and capabilities. Prayer is a personal and intimate connection with the divine. Although going to church (option A) can provide a supportive and spiritual environment for praying, those who are paralyzed may not always be able to attend services or travel to a house of worship. Nonetheless, prayer can be done from anywhere, since it is a conversation between a person and the divine. Kneeling (option D) can be a symbol of humility and submission during prayer, but it is not a mandatory physical action, especially for people with paralysis. It is important to remember that the essence of prayer lies in the individual's sincerity and devotion, rather than outward actions. Praising God (option C) is one aspect of prayer, but it does not encompass the entire experience of prayer. In many religious traditions, prayer consists of multiple components, such as praise, repentance, thanksgiving, and requests for guidance or help. Thus, limiting prayer only to praising God may not fully address a person's spiritual needs. Sincerity (option E) is a crucial element of prayer, but it does not specifically answer the question of what one does when they pray. Moreover, being sincere should be a natural part of the prayer experience and does not need to be singled out as an exclusive option. In conclusion, the most suitable option for answering the question \\"What do you do when you pray, even if you are paralyzed?\\" is \\"B. speak to god.\\" Praying involves talking with God, expressing thoughts, emotions, gratitude, and requests, regardless of physical limitations. This intimate and personal connection transcends physical boundaries and reinforces the significance of spirituality in an individual's life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (born Lawrence Joshua Chamberlain, September 8, 1828 - February 24, 1914) was an American college professor from the State of Maine, who volunteered during the American Civil War to join the Union Army. He became a highly respected and decorated Union officer, reaching the rank of brigadier general (and brevet major general). He is best known for his gallantry at the Battle of Gettysburg, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. Chamberlain was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1862 and fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Chamberlain was born in Brewer, Maine, the son of Sarah Dupee (nee Brastow) and Joshua Chamberlain on September 8, 1828. Chamberlain was of English ancestry, and could trace his family line back to twelfth century England, during the reign of King Stephen. He was the oldest of five children. It is said that he was his mother's favorite while his father was tough on him. He was very involved in his church, mostly singing in the choir. His mother encouraged him to become a preacher while his father wanted him to join the military, but he felt a reluctance towards both options. He suffered a speech impediment until shortly after graduating from Bowdoin College. He entered Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, in 1848 with the help of a local tutor, professor William Hyde. Chamberlain learned to read Ancient Greek and Latin in order to pass the entrance exam. While at Bowdoin he met many people who would influence his life, including Harriet Beecher Stowe, the wife of Bowdoin professor Calvin Stowe. Chamberlain would often go to listen to her read passages from what would later become her celebrated novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin. He also joined the Peucinian Society, a group of students with Federalist leanings. A member of the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society and a brother of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, Chamberlain graduated in 1852.  He married Fanny Adams, cousin and adopted daughter of a local clergyman, in 1855, and they had five children, one of whom was born too prematurely to survive and two of whom died in infancy. Chamberlain studied for three additional years at Bangor Theological Seminary in Bangor, Maine, returned to Bowdoin, and began a career in education as a professor of rhetoric. He eventually went on to teach every subject in the curriculum with the exception of science and mathematics. In 1861 he was appointed Professor of Modern Languages. He was fluent in nine languages other than English: Greek, Latin, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac.  Chamberlain's great-grandfathers were soldiers in the American Revolutionary War. One, Franklin Chamberlain, was a sergeant at the Siege of Yorktown. His grandfather, also named Joshua Chamberlain, was a colonel in the local militia during the War of 1812 and was court-martialed (but exonerated) for his part in the humiliating Battle of Hampden, which led to the sacking of Bangor and Brewer by British forces. His father also had served during the abortive Aroostook War of 1839. Entity:","output":"Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. The way you handle your hair makes a big difference in its texture and appearance. When you're rough with your hair, it can frizz up and start looking dull. Hair is a fragile material that should be handled with care, just like a delicate piece of fabric. Here's what to keep in mind:  When you shampoo your hair don't roughly scrub it. Massage the shampoo into your hair and distribute it with your fingers. Rinse your conditioner in the coldest water you can stand. The cold temperature seals the cuticle and helps your hair look shiny, while hot water will cause it to frizz up and look dull. Gently squeeze the water from your hair and pat it dry with a towel instead of twisting and wringing it out. Shampooing your hair every single day causes it to dry out and become brittle. The natural oil your scalp produces to nourish your hair gets rinsed away before it can do its job. If you want your hair to stay healthy and shiny, you only really need to wash it once or twice a week, depending on your hair type.  When you first cut back on how often you wash your hair, you may notice it looking oilier than normal. Your scalp is producing oil on overdrive since it's used to everyday washings. After a week or two things will balance out and your hair will look cleaner, longer. On days in between washings, when you need to perk up your hair,  try dry shampoo. It's a powder you sprinkle, or an aerosol you spray, on your hair to absorb the oil, and it works like a charm. The best way to keep your hair healthy is to let it dry naturally instead of using a hair dryer. The heat from the hair dryer damages the hair shaft, and if you do it every day you'll definitely see damage over time. Put that hair dryer away and let your hair dry the natural way.  The same goes for other heat styling tools, like curling irons, straightening irons, and hot rollers. On days when you do want to use a hair dryer or other styling tools, apply a heat protectant serum to your hair so it doesn't get quite as damaged. Running a plastic-bristled brush through your hair, especially when it's wet, is almost guaranteed to cause some damage. Brushing tends to rip your hair, while combing removes the tangles without pulling it out. Use a wide-tooth comb and work out the tangles starting close to the tips and moving up to the roots. Dyeing, bleaching, chemically straightening, and chemically curling your hair all damage the shaft. For the healthiest possible hair, it's best to stop these treatments and let your hair take on its natural color and texture. Your hair might not be the exact color you want, but it will be healthy, shiny and silky. If you do want to dye your hair, look into henna, honey, or tea dyeing. These natural dyes actually restore shine to your hair, rather than damaging it. You won't be able to achieve a dramatic color change, but you can go a few shades lighter or darker. Waves, wefts, dreads, and other styles that require permanently pulling your hair into a tight position can cause damage and hair loss. While some types of weaves are less damaging than others (sewn weaves are usually better than glue-ins, for example) your hair will be healthier if you forego them altogether.","output":"Handle hair gently, shampoo less frequently, avoid heat styling and chemical treatments, and utilize natural alternatives to maintain its health, shine, and texture."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons.

After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in Bactrian) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent. He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \\"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos. The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, \\"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble\\". A similar slaughter followed at Ora.

I have a new situation: Scientists studied water stratification in two saltwater lakes. they were trying to find out why the fish population decreased in Long lake, and was very healthy and abundant in Shoal lake. They found out the phenomenon occurred more often in Long lake, leading to very many unpleasant chain effects.  But I can use this background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.  Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  What is an answer for this question: Which lake had a lower net productivity?","output":"Based on the provided information, Long Lake had a lower net productivity compared to Shoal Lake. This conclusion is drawn from the observation that the fish population in Long Lake had decreased, while the fish population in Shoal Lake was healthy and abundant. The phenomenon of water stratification, which occurs more often in Long Lake, plays a significant role in the lower net productivity of the lake. As a result of stratification, layers of water with different properties - such as salinity, oxygenation, density, and temperature - form barriers to water mixing, potentially leading to anoxia or euxinia. These barriers prevent the efficient mixing of nutrients between the layers, which affects primary production by limiting photosynthetic processes. In the case of Long Lake, the observed water stratification would restrict the transport of nutrients from the benthos to the photic zone. This nutrient limitation causes a decrease in phytoplankton abundance, leading to a reduction in primary production. Lower primary production, in turn, results in lower net productivity within the water, as fewer resources are available for organisms higher in the food chain, including fish populations. In contrast, Shoal Lake, which does not experience the same degree of water stratification, maintains a healthy and abundant fish population. The absence or reduced levels of water stratification in Shoal Lake allows for a more effective nutrient mixing between the layers, increasing primary production and providing a more favorable environment for the growth and survival of fish populations. Thus, it can be concluded that Shoal Lake has a higher net productivity compared to Long Lake."},{"instruction":"Background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life.

Gather materials: Tallow (rendered animal fat, usually beef or sheep), a large pot or double boiler, candle wicks (with metal tabs for stability), mason jars or candle molds, a wooden spoon, and a thermometer. 2. Melt the tallow: Place the tallow into the pot or double boiler and heat it on a low setting on the stove until it melts completely. Keep an eye on the temperature, as tallow's ideal melting point is around 130°F to 140°F (54°C to 60°C). 3. Prepare the molds or jars: While the tallow is melting, arrange the molds or mason jars on a flat surface. Place a wick with a metal tab into each container's center. 4. Pour the melted tallow: Once the tallow reaches the ideal melting point, carefully pour it into each jar or mold containing the wick. Leave about ½ inch (1.27 cm) of space at the top for a more polished look. 5. Allow the tallow to cool: Let the candles cool undisturbed for several hours or overnight, until they solidify. As the tallow cools and hardens, the color will change from clear to opaque. 6. Trim the wicks: Once the candles are fully hardened, trim the wicks to about ¼ inch (0.6 cm) in length.

Competition: Heather Mills, who lost half her leg in 1993, stands with first place winner Melanie Schwartzc after competing in the Women's Slalom in New Zealand in August of this year. Mills’ management said that wearing the boot cover, which locks to her left. leg below the knee, causes a large amount of friction, painful. inflammation and blisters. She claimed that she had been 'asked to do the video' to explain her disqualification. She. said: ''While I was skiing in Pitztal last week, I was on inspection,. and I noticed Sylvana Mestre following me down the mountain, but didn't. think anything of it at the time. 'The next thing I get a phone call from my GB coach Tony saying I was disqualified. Ms. Mills said she then attended a competition technical meeting in which. her use of an unapproved prosthetic leg was being discussed, despite the. fact she was not supposed to have attended. She then claims that Ms Mestre 'stormed over', saying  'The rules are the rules', and informed her she was disqualified. She added: 'I stayed quiet... I put my hand on her shoulder to try and. explain but she just said \\"I don't care\\" and stormed back to the table. Mills lost her left leg below the knee in 1993 after she was knocked down by a police motorcycle. She set up the Heather Mills Trust which helps people who have lost limbs to landmines. She married former Beatle Sir Paul in June 2002 but split four years later in 2006. After her divorce in 2008, she began skiing and preparing for the Winter Paralympic Games in Sochi, Russia, in 2014. She is ranked 28th in the world in slalom.

What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article is about Heather Mills, who is a skier and used to be married to Paul McCartney. She was part of the UK disabled ski team but had a disagreement with the people in charge of the Paralympics. They said she couldn't use a special ski boot she had because it didn't follow the rules and needed to wear their standard boot instead. Heather Mills decided to quit the ski team because she said the standard boot would hurt her a lot. She also made a video where she talked about the disagreement and said that one of the people in charge, Sylvana Mestre, didn't like her and wanted her to leave the team."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Natural theology was not a unified doctrine, and while some such as Louis Agassiz were strongly opposed to the ideas in the book, others sought a reconciliation in which evolution was seen as purposeful. In the Church of England, some liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as \\"just as noble a conception of Deity\\". In the second edition of January 1860, Darwin quoted Kingsley as \\"a celebrated cleric\\", and added the phrase \\"by the Creator\\" to the closing sentence, which from then on read \\"life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one\\". While some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted, Darwin's view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature, and even in the first edition there are several references to \\"creation\\". If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did some commentators think about Darwin changing the phrasing in his book?","output":"Some commentators think that Darwin's decision to change the phrasing in his book, particularly by adding the phrase \\"by the Creator\\" to the closing sentence, was an attempt to appease religious critics and make his theory of evolution more palatable to a wider audience. They believe that by making this change, Darwin sought to find common ground with religiously inclined individuals who might otherwise reject his ideas or view them as a direct attack on their faith. This interpretation suggests that Darwin was being pragmatic and wanted to avoid unnecessary controversy that could hinder the acceptance of his theory. By framing evolution as a process designed or set into motion by a divine Creator, he allowed for the possibility that religious believers could reconcile their understanding of God with the idea of evolution by natural selection. However, other commentators argue that Darwin genuinely believed in a Creator who had established the laws of nature, in which evolution by natural selection operated as an integral part of those laws. From this perspective, Darwin's amendment to the text was not merely a concession to his critics or an attempt to appease religious sensibilities, but rather a genuine expression of his own beliefs about the relationship between science and religion. In either case, it is clear that Darwin's revisions to his work did influence how his ideas were received and interpreted by various groups, both religious and secular, allowing for a broader acceptance of the theory of evolution as a whole in the years that followed. Nonetheless, the debate about the extent to which Darwin intended to reconcile or challenge religious beliefs with his evolutionary theory continues among commentators today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: \\"Home Room\\" came as a total surprise. Not having a clue as to what it was all about, it paid off big time because it doesn't hold any punches and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to victimize his class mates, who are the innocent victims of his rash actions. Paul Ryan, the director, who is working and editing his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his cast. Alicia Browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school. She has been away a couple of years and doesn't seem to be in the same wave length of the other students. For one, she is a rebel with a punk look, lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her orbit. Alicia was among the students in the home room where nine students have died, supposedly killed by her boyfriend. Alicia, we realize, is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life, but we are not given any clues to that effect. What follows is the aftermath of the tragedy, as it concentrates on a young woman who has survived it. Deanna Cartwright is a wealthy teen ager who shouldn't have been at the school, at all. When a ricochet bullet hit her, she is hospitalized with more than a wound. She is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares don't let her forget. Alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal. Since she doesn't cooperate with the police, the head of the school wants her to see Deanna in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows. Alicia dislikes Deanna, but in a matter of days, both girls will make peace. We don't realize until the last sequence what really happened that horrible day in school. Busy Phillips makes an excellent Alicia and Erika Christiansen is equally good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland, and the rest of the cast play as an ensemble. The film has an intensity because it's not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred, which helps the tone that Mr. Ryan wanted to give this movie.","output":"To analyze the sentiment of this review, I will break it down into sections and evaluate the tone and opinion expressed in each.  1. The beginning describes the movie as a \\"total surprise\\" and mentions that it \\"paid off big time,\\" indicating a positive sentiment due to the unexpected quality of the movie. 2. The review praises Paul Ryan, the director, and the cast's acting, which is another positive sentiment. 3. In discussing the character Alicia Browning, the review doesn't seem to have any strong positive or negative sentiment, as it mainly focuses on describing the character without expressing a clear opinion about her. 4. The review then covers the movie's progression and aftermath, mentioning that it concentrates on a young woman who survived the tragedy. The sentiment is neutral here, as the reviewer is providing a summary of the plot rather than expressing an opinion. 5. The reviewer discusses the principal's intentions and the growing relationship between the two main characters without expressing strong sentiment, maintaining a neutral tone. 6. There is praise for the performances of the main actors, Busy Phillips and Erika Christiansen, conveying a positive sentiment. 7. The review ends by stating that the film has an intensity due to the way the shooting is portrayed and how it aligns with the director's intentions, which seems to be another positive sentiment. Overall, the sentiment of this review is mostly positive with some neutral sections. There is praise for the acting, directing, and intensity of the movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The New Yorker declared it \\"skilled, unpretentious, and totally ingenious\\", and The Atlantic Monthly's reviewer rated it as \\"pleasant, undemanding reading\\", but found the narrative voice—\\"a six-year-old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult\\"—to be implausible.

The Mongols demanded tribute, in 1271 and again in 1273. When Narathihapate refused both times, the Mongols systematically invaded the country. The first invasion in 1277 defeated the Burmese at the battle of Ngasaunggyan, and secured their hold of Kanngai . In 1283-1285, their forces moved south and occupied down to Tagaung and Hanlin. The king fled to Lower Burma in 1285 before agreeing to submit to the Mongols in June 1286. Soon after the agreement was finalised, the king was assassinated in July 1287. The Mongols once again invaded south toward Pagan.

He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogoro shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase.

She may have decided to dedicate her life to serving all other living beings, or she might be an ascetic who voluntarily chose to leave mainstream society and live her life in prayer and contemplation in a monastery or convent. The term \\"nun\\" is applicable to Catholics (eastern and western traditions), Orthodox Christians, Anglicans, Lutherans, Jains, Buddhists, Taoists, Hindus and some other religious traditions.  - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  - A convent is either a community of priests, religious brothers or religious sisters (nuns); or the building used by the community, particularly in the Roman Catholic Church and in the Anglican Communion. Etymology and usage. The term derives via Old French from Latin \\"conventus\\", perfect participle of the verb \\"convenio\\", meaning to convene, to come together. The original reference was to the gathering of mendicants who spent much of their time travelling.  Technically, a \\"monastery\\" or \\"nunnery\\" is a community of monastics, whereas a \\"friary\\" or \\"convent\\" is a community of mendicants, and a \\"canonry\\" a community of canons regular. The terms \\"abbey\\" and \\"priory\\" can be applied to both monasteries and canonries; an abbey is headed by an Abbot, and a priory is a lesser dependent house headed by a Prior.  - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments.  - Leoba ( also Lioba and Leofgyth ) ( c. 710 -- 28 September 782 ) was an Anglo - Saxon nun who was part of Boniface 's mission to the Germans , and a saint .  - Canonization is the act by which the Catholic Church and Anglican Communion declare that a person who has died was a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the canon, or list, of recognized saints. Originally, people were recognized as saints without any formal process.

Summarize this article: Taylor's 88th-minute decider came after Vale's JJ Hooper had cancelled out Aaron Phillips' opener for the hosts, with all three goals coming in the final half-hour. It was Northampton's third win on the trot and lifted them 11 points clear of fourth-bottom Vale, who themselves are now five points adrift of safety after relegation rivals Oldham defeated Oxford. Cobblers started brightly, with Michael Smith and Keshi Anderson firing over, while Luke Williams was also off target with another effort. Leonardo Fasan pulled off a smart save to deny Anderson from the edge of the box as Northampton made all the running, with John-Joe O'Toole also failing to hit the target for the hosts. Fasan denied Marc Richards in another Northampton attack before Vale created their first opening just before the break when Anton Forrester was denied by Adam Smith. After the restart, Sam Foley fired wide for Vale before the home side created further chances, Richards failing to hit the target from a tight angle in the six-yard box and Taylor having a shot blocked. It was going to take something special to break the deadlock and it came in the 63rd minute when an intended cross from full-back Phillips beat Fasan and found the top corner of the net. Boosted by the breakthrough, Cobblers went in search of the crucial second goal. Smith went close with a header, while Richards blazed over from close range before then firing wide from the edge of the box. But it was Vale who struck next, getting back on level terms in the 73rd minute when Northampton failed to deal with a corner and Hooper beat Smith from 15 yards. Vale began to get on top in the closing stages but Northampton could have reclaimed their lead only for substitute Hiram Boateng to head wide from close range. The home fans need not have worried, though, as two minutes from the end Taylor caught out Fasan from 30 yards to net home the match-winning strike. Match report supplied by the Press Association. Summary:","output":"In a thrilling football match, Northampton secured their third consecutive win after defeating Port Vale with a score of 2-1.

At the White House on Wednesday, Trump continued to speak cautiously about the coming summit, even while praising the North Korean leader for the prisoner release. “Everything can be scuttled,” Trump told reporters. “A lot of things can happen — a lot of good things can happen, [and] a lot of bad things can happen.” North Korea on Wednesday granted amnesty to three Americans of Korean descent. They had been accused of espionage or trying to overthrow the government, charges widely seen as bogus. Pyongyang has detained at least 16 Americans over the past two decades, often attempting to use them as bargaining chips. All were eventually released, although Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, died shortly after returning to the United States last year. A White House statement Wednesday praised North Korea’s latest prisoner release as a “positive gesture of goodwill” ahead of the Trump-Kim summit, which is expected to take place as soon as next month. South Korea’s presidential office said Pyongyang’s decision was a “very positive” sign for a successful North Korea-U.S. meeting.  The freeing of the prisoners coincided with a visit to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who declined to say whether the release was a U.S. precondition for holding talks with the North. “I don’t know the answer to that,” Pompeo told reporters on the flight home. “It would have been more difficult [had the prisoners not been released]. ... I’m glad that we don’t have to confront that.” It’s not clear what, if anything, the U.S. gave up in exchange for the prisoners. It’s not even clear a concession was needed, since North Korea has for decades sought the presumed legitimacy provided by a summit with a sitting U.S. president.

If your starting chemical is something like crude oil, you'll need to use distillation or fractional distillation to separate it into parts.  See if the starting and target chemicals have any groups in common.","output":"This provides a foundation for determining if any possible reactions or mechanisms will require significantly less energy or steps, as structurally similar compounds often undergo similar reactions or pathways. Next, assess which functional groups need to be converted or added to achieve the desired structure. This will allow you to identify which reagents, solvents, and catalysts may be necessary for the synthesis. Additionally, consider the stereochemistry involved in the target molecule, as it plays a crucial role in the effectiveness and desired properties of the final compound. Ensure that any transformations carried out maintain or achieve the correct stereochemistry through appropriate reaction conditions and choice of catalysts or reagents. Furthermore, evaluate if the reaction conditions will influence the regiochemistry, which concerns the specific region of the molecule undergoing transformation. This is particularly important for reactions involving larger or more complex starting materials, as regioselective reactions can greatly enhance the efficiency and yield of the final product. To guide the synthesis process, try using retrosynthetic analysis, which involves working backwards from the target molecule to visualize and plan the steps required for the synthesis. This method helps in identifying potential synthetic routes and any challenges that may arise during the process. Research and review existing literature about the synthesis of similar compounds or transformations that closely resemble your target reaction. This can provide valuable information about tested methods and possible reaction conditions that yield successful results. Moreover, ensure that the chosen synthetic route can be achieved safely, as some organic reactions may involve hazardous materials or produce toxic byproducts. Always practice safe laboratory techniques, wear appropriate protective equipment, and work in a well-ventilated area or fume hood. After designing a synthesis route, perform the reactions in the lab cautiously, starting with small-scale experiments to confirm the effectiveness and validity of the chosen synthetic route. Conduct thorough analyses of the reaction products, such as purification and characterization, utilizing techniques such as chromatography, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. Analyzing the results and data, refine the synthesis route if necessary, making adjustments to reagents, concentrations, or conditions to optimize the yield and purity of the target compound. Lastly, be prepared for setbacks or unexpected results in the process of synthesizing an organic compound. Organic synthesis can be a complex and iterative process, with multiple rounds of experimentation and analysis required to achieve the desired outcome. Remaining patient, flexible, and open to alternative approaches will ultimately contribute to success in the synthesis of your target organic compound."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What were the major contributions of the political leaders during WW1, and how are the compared to the ones during the Seven Year War? What were the major contributions of the political leaders during WW1, and how are they compared to the ones during other major armed conflicts? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Options are: (a). no; (b). yes;","output":"(a). No Although the two questions may seem similar, they have differences in terms of focus and the conflicts they ask to compare. The first question specifically asks about the major contributions of political leaders during World War 1 (WW1) and how they compare to the ones during the Seven Years' War. To answer this question, we need to discuss the contributions of political leaders in both conflicts and compare them. Major Contributions during WW1: 1. Woodrow Wilson (US President) - His role was crucial in shaping the post-WW1 world and establishing the League of Nations. He outlined his famous Fourteen Points, which became the blueprint for the Treaty of Versailles. 2. David Lloyd George (British Prime Minister) - A skilful negotiator, George was instrumental in forging the alliance between Britain, France, and the United States. He played a key role in  shaping terms of the Treaty of Versailles and securing British interests after the war. 3. Georges Clemenceau (French Prime Minister) - As the leader of France, Clemenceau ensured that the nation remained committed to a total victory against Germany. He was instrumental in shaping the Treaty of Versailles, focusing on ensuring the security for France in the post-war world. 4. Kaiser Wilhelm II (German Emperor) - He played a major role in the inception and escalation of the war. His policies and leadership led to the eventual collapse of Germany's war effort and the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. Major Contributions during the Seven Years' War: 1. William Pitt the Elder (British Prime Minister) - He oversaw Britain's strategic decisions, sought to win the war by undermining the economic power of France and Spain and expanded Britain's influence. 2. Frederick the Great (King of Prussia) - His military genius saw Prussia emerge as a major power in Europe, as he embarked on successful campaigns against Austria, France, and Russia. 3. Empress Maria Theresa (Austrian Empress) - She persisted in reclaiming the territories captured by Prussia and was instrumental in organizing the large coalition against Prussia. 4. Tsarina Elizabeth (Russian Empress) - She was crucial in building a coalition against Prussia, and her support helped turn the tide against Frederick the Great for a period of time. Comparison: During WW1, political leaders played significant roles in diplomacy and influencing the post-war world's shape, which were different from the leaders' involvement during the Seven Years' War, where political leaders focused on personal military efforts and the expansion of their empires. The second question, on the other hand, refers to the major contributions of political leaders during WW1 and how they compare to other major armed conflicts. In this case, the comparison could involve any significant conflict from history, including but not limited to the Seven Years' War. The scope of comparison is broader in the second question, as it would require an analysis of various conflicts and their political leaders, leading to a different discussion than addressing the first question only."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solution: \\"I thought that they knew it.\\" The Spanish sentence \\"Pensaba que lo sabían\\" is translated into English as \\"I thought that they knew it.\\", following the provided meanings of each individual word in the sentence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The most common colors of bell peppers are green, yellow, orange and red. More rarely, brown, white, lavender, and dark purple peppers can be seen, depending on the variety. Most typically, unripe fruits are green or, less commonly, pale yellow or purple. Red bell peppers are simply ripened green peppers, although the Permagreen variety maintains its green color even when fully ripe. As such, mixed colored peppers also exist during parts of the ripening process. Green peppers are less sweet and slightly more bitter than yellow or orange peppers, with red bell peppers being the sweetest. The taste of ripe peppers can also vary with growing conditions and post-harvest storage treatment; the sweetest fruits are allowed to ripen fully on the plant in full sunshine, while fruit harvested green and after-ripened in storage is less sweet. are green bell peppers just unripe red bell peppers?","output":"Yes, that's right! Green bell peppers are just unripe red bell peppers. As the green bell peppers keep growing on the plant, they gradually turn into yellow, orange, and eventually red bell peppers. So, green, yellow, orange, and red bell peppers are actually the same peppers, but at different stages of ripeness. The more ripe they become, the sweeter they taste. That's why red bell peppers are the sweetest among them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Make use of the article to answer the questions. Milk is a white liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.  As an agricultural product, milk is extracted from non-human mammals during or soon after pregnancy. Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011, from 260 million dairy cows. India is the world's largest producer of milk, and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder, yet it exports few other milk products. The ever increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future. The United States, India, China and Brazil are the world's largest exporters of milk and milk products. China and Russia were the world's largest importers of milk and milk products until 2016 when both countries became self-sufficient, contributing to a worldwide glut of milk.

Is Samsung About To Nail Apple In Retail? NEW YORK - OCTOBER 14: People shop in a Apple store . (Image credit: Getty Images via @daylife) Apple’s retail strategy has been one of its great successes. In fact Apple has done to retail what it did to mobile – shown other companies the way. In total, they now have around 400 stores, the majority of them in the USA, and they are wildly successful. But is it enough? Phones, the actual smart devices, are now of less importance as a differentiator than in the recent past. Everyone makes a great phone, and that’s why BlackBerry saw its share price sink, Friday. Nice phone but what else do you excel at? Apple and Samsung excel at phones, have equally phenomenal supply chains, great marketing and equally good innovation capabilities. What matters also is how you sell. Hence retail could be the next significant battleground between these two. In 2012 Apple opened 41 new stores. It is using its store openings to help develop new markets and gradually the number of international retail stores has grown – 82% of 2012 openings were international last year. But let’s be clear, that’s only about 32 stores. A recent study showed that “The percentage of sales from Apple Stores (compared to all sales) has actually dropped from 17 percent in 2007 to 12 percent in 2012.” The conclusion you can draw from that is stores don’t matter because Apple has such a great distribution network, or Apple ‘s retail strategy is lagging its overall development. Analysts Asymco point out that as sales have increased in the past five years, store openings have slowed proportionally. Yet when Apple doubled its stores in China it also doubled sales. Still Apple’s own retail presence in China is negligible (3% of stores) and in India non-existent, as yet, though Apple has added two distributors there and offers an iPhone for 98 down payment. Let’s look at arch competitor, Samsung, and evidence that you cannot afford to slouch for one minute. All this activity comes from a six month period in 2012. Samsung announced the opening of its first “Samsung Mobile Brand Store” in Delhi, in April 2012. They launched their first concept store in Pakistan also in April. The Samsung Concept Shop is a One-Stop venue for all Samsung products – Samsung 3D Smart TV’s, LED and LCD TV’s, Monitors, Plasma Display Panels, IT products, Cameras, Mobile phones, and Home Appliances. In March 2012 they partnered with mobile operator MTS in Russia to sell handsets and tablet computers on contract in MTS’s 2,000 shops. They also announced they will open 10 of their own stores in Russia’s biggest cities, In July they opened their first North American retail store, and a very Apple-like experience, in Vancouver, Canada. The store was “flooded with clean, bright lighting, a minimalist layout of products and even blue-clad Samsung ‘geniuses’ on deck to help out customers”. Also in 2012 they began an own store strategy in China aiming to develop in the second and third tier cities with a strategy of hiring local Chinese managers. In addition, they opened the first China Samsung Experience “shop-in-shop” with retailer Suning in, Pudong, Shanghai, August 2012. In regards to the future cooperation of the two parties, Suning plans to set up no less than 100 Samsung Experience Shops in its flagship stores across China. At present, the Chinese retailer is planning Samsung Experience Shops in nearly 30 outlets in Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Chongqing. They also opened a concept store in Sydney, Australia, in August 2012 just down the road from Apple. undefined They announced a partnership with Singapore’s Challenger, the leading IT retailer, to open “experience corners” in Challenger outlets. The first one opened in October 2012 and has 1500 square feet dedicated to Samsung phones, computing, and cameras. They partnered with Tesco in Malaysia in March 2012 with a shop-in-shop concept called “Samsung World”. And with Phones4Us in the UK – began a “store-in-store” program in March 2012 Apple is not standing entirely on its laurels. (Distribution) Outlets in China selling the iPhone rose to 17,000 in the period that ended Dec. 29, from 7,000 a year earlier, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said on a conference call yesterday. That helped Apple boost sales in the Greater China region to 6.83 billion, from 4.08 billion a year earlier. When Samsung opened its first store in North America the tech press accused it of copying the Apple way. And there is some truth in that. But the Korean company has a diversified strategy. It has an own-store program in key markets like India and China, and of course North America. And it has at least two different store-in-store concepts that it is pushing with major retail outlets in key growth markets. What it gets up to in North America is not its central retail strategy. Yes, it will do concept stores but its bigger push is into volume – hundreds of in-store corners and concept areas to push the Samsung brand and product quickly Samsung’s objective is to increase sales competitively, as soon as possible. Will we see Apple,, with its higher concept retail approach, accelerate its store openings in response? Follow me on Twitter @haydn1701 or join me on Facebook. I am here on Google What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the retail strategies of Apple and Samsung and speculates on whether Samsung might overtake Apple in terms of retail success. It outlines the history of Apple's retail success, with approximately 400 stores, mostly in the USA. It suggests that retail may become a crucial battlefield for these two corporations, as smartphones have become less of a differentiator in the market. The article then turns to Samsung, outlining its aggressive approach in various markets. It highlights specific instances of Samsung opening its own brand stores in places like Delhi, Russia, Vancouver, and Australia. Samsung is also partnering with other retailers to open \\"experience corners\\", where customers can try Samsung products. Finally, the article points out that Apple is not idle. It has boosted the outlets selling iPhones in China from 7,000 to 17,000. The article concludes by suggesting that while Samsung is pursuing a diversifed strategy, it's uncertain how Apple will respond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again. She found another doctor that actually treated us like we were human. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

În acelaşi timp, trebuie să luăm în considerare plata bonusurilor bancherilor, o problemă care a devenit un subiect deosebit de important în Estonia. Translate this to English?","output":"At the same time, we must take into consideration the payment of bankers' bonuses, an issue that has become particularly important in Estonia. The issue of paying bonuses to bankers has attracted significant attention in Estonia and has led to various discussions and debates. As one delves deeper into the matter, it becomes essential to consider several aspects including the circumstances surrounding these bonuses, their impact on the banking industry, and potential alternatives and solutions to address the issue. Firstly, it is important to understand the context and reasoning behind the payment of bankers' bonuses. In most cases, bonuses are awarded to employees as a form of incentive to encourage them to perform well and be more productive. Such incentives are designed to motivate employees by recognizing their efforts and achievements. The banking industry, like many other sectors, operates in a competitive environment, and banks must attract and retain highly skilled professionals to deliver quality services to their customers. Some argue that the payment of bonuses is justified as it helps retain and attract talent, ensuring that banks maintain a competitive edge. By offering attractive compensation packages, banks are able to secure the loyalty and services of professionals who help drive the overall success of the institution. In this sense, bonuses can be seen as a necessary investment in human capital, which eventually results in increased productivity and growth. However, critics of this system argue that the payment of excessive bonuses can encourage excessive risk-taking within the financial sector, ultimately leading to destabilization and potential crises. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, many countries implemented regulations aimed at curbing excessive bonus payments and linking them to long-term performance. These measures were taken to prevent a recurrence of the reckless behavior that contributed to the crisis. In Estonia, the debate on bankers' bonuses has highlighted the need for a more balanced approach to remuneration. Financial institutions must strike an equilibrium between providing sufficient incentives to employees and ensuring responsible behavior in the banking industry. To this end, several possible solutions have been proposed, ranging from the implementation of stricter regulatory frameworks to the adoption of alternative remuneration models that emphasize long-term performance and sustainability. A potential solution involves setting caps on bonus payments, preventing them from exceeding a certain percentage of an employee's base salary. By doing so, banks could continue to offer incentives while limiting their scale, thereby reducing the risk of financial instability. Additionally, linking bonuses to long-term performance can further promote a responsible approach, as employees would be rewarded based on the sustained success of their actions, rather than short-term gains. Alternatives to traditional bonus payments could include offering additional benefits and perks to employees. These could range from providing extra vacation days, offering flexible work arrangements, and promoting a stronger work-life balance. Implementing a more comprehensive incentive package that encompasses various aspects of an employee's life could lead to greater satisfaction and loyalty, without the potential hazards associated with excessive bonus payments. In conclusion, the issue of paying bankers' bonuses in Estonia is a complex and multifaceted matter that warrants careful consideration. While bonuses can be effective in motivating employees and securing talent, they also carry risks and potential negative consequences. By striking a balance between incentivizing employees and promoting responsible behavior, Estonia can ensure the long-term success and stability of its banking industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After Martos, a GEO operator, is killed and infected encountering some of the infected, Owen uses religious mantra and rosary to hold him off in a room. It turns out that Owen is actually a priest sent by the Vatican to get a blood sample from a possessed girl named Tristana Medeiros, the same attacker from the end of the previous film.

White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. Question: Who said the national guard will help with border surveillance? === The answer to the above question is Possible answers:  * Jones  * Walters  * not enough information  * Nielsen The answer is:","output":"Nielsen.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Teenagers who drink alcohol are at higher risk of becoming victims of violence, a Cardiff University study has found. A team from the School of Dentistry's Violence Research Group studied drinking habits in children aged 11 - 16 in England. They found not only a link between drink and violence but also that children who drank were more likely to be hit, even if they weren't violent themselves. The researchers are now calling for measures to prevent alcohol misuse to reduce injury risk. Current policy focuses on reducing aggression but this research shows that there should be equal effort to reduce victimization. More than 4,000 children were surveyed at 13 schools at four local authorities in the North, the Midlands, London, and the South. The study found that 25% of 11-year-olds were drinking monthly and 3.6% daily, with 12.8% admitting to getting drunk 3 to 5 times a year. By the age of 16, 40% were drinking weekly and 6.2% were drinking every day. The research also showed 22.6% of 16-year-olds were getting drunk more than 21 times a year. The study, which has just been published in the Journal of Adolescence, found a strong link between frequency of drinking and frequency of hitting other people. However, children who reported drinking monthly were also three times more likely to be hit. Adolescents  who drank but didn't get into fights were more likely to be hit than those who did fight. Professor Jonathan Shepherd, who led the research, said a lot of previous alcohol-related violence work had focused on the offenders  rather than the victims. His team is calling for more prevention work from parents and teachers in the first two years of secondary school by taking advantage of the \\"teachable moment\\", that is, immediately after a student has missed school because of drunkenness. Previous work by Professor Jonathan Shepherd has shown drinkers may be more at risk of violence because of reduced physical co-ordination, poor decision-making in threatening situations and isolation while out late at night.

Write highlights for this article: Two stories of America -- one about its sometimes perverse capacity for reinvention, the other about the most tragic period in the country's history -- were among the leaders Thursday for the nominations for the 86th Academy Awards. \\"American Hustle,\\" a story about con artists based loosely on the late 1970s Abscam scandal, tied for the lead with 10 nominations. The movie was nominated in several major categories, including picture, director (David O. Russell), actor (Christian Bale), actress (Amy Adams), supporting actor (Bradley Cooper), supporting actress (Jennifer Lawrence) and adapted screenplay. And \\"12 Years a Slave,\\" based on Solomon Northup's 19th-century narrative about being taken from freedom into slavery, earned nine nods, including picks for best picture, best director (Steve McQueen), best actor (Chiwetel Ejiofor), best supporting actor (Michael Fassbender) and best supporting actress (Lupita Nyong'o). \\"This has been an amazing ride, and to receive nine nominations from the academy is testament to all of the hard work. And for that I am truly grateful,\\" McQueen said. The complete list of nominees. \\"Gravity,\\" about a space mission gone wrong, also received 10 nominations, including picks for best picture, best director (Alfonso Cuaron) and best actress (Sandra Bullock). \\"I am particularly moved by Sandy's nomination,\\" said Cuaron in a statement. \\"She is the heartbeat of our film. I thank her for her grace, her trust and her dedication to finding the truth of this character.\\" The academy nominated nine films for best picture overall.

In one instance, according to a story that quickly gained currency in Hollywood, an academy member heckled director Martin Scorsese after a screening. But Oscar sided with the film, giving it five nominations, all in big categories: best picture, best director, best actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), best supporting actor (Jonah Hill) and best adapted screenplay (Terence Winter). 5 things we learned from Oscar nominations. Love for 'Dallas Buyers Club' There was also good news for \\"Dallas Buyers Club,\\" the story of an HIV-positive man in the 1980s who rallies others to battle the AIDS crisis. The low-budget film, which cost 5 million, received six nominations, tying it with \\"Nebraska\\" and \\"Captain Phillips.\\" Matthew McConaughey, who won a Golden Globe for a performance that required him to lose 45 pounds, was among the best actor nominees. The film was also nominated for best supporting actor (Jared Leto, another Globe winner) and best original screenplay, along with best picture. The academy also smiled on director Alexander Payne, a two-time Oscar winner whose films include \\"Sideways,\\" \\"The Descendants\\" and \\"About Schmidt.\\" His \\"Nebraska,\\" the story of a curmudgeon and his son who make a trip to the Cornhusker State in the possible vain pursuit of a sweepstakes prize, included nominations for picture, director, original screenplay, supporting actress (June Squibb) and best actor. The last went to 77-year-old film veteran Bruce Dern, whose only other nomination was for 1978's \\"Coming Home.\\" Another sleeper, \\"Philomena,\\" received nominations for picture, adapted screenplay and star Judi Dench as well as music (original score). As expected, Cate Blanchett also was nominated for best actress as a modern-day Blanche DuBois in \\"Blue Jasmine.\\" She already has won the Golden Globe (drama), National Society of Film Critics Award and New York Film Critics Circle Award for her role in the Woody Allen film. The tireless Meryl Streep was recognized yet again by the academy, receiving a best actress nomination for \\"August: Osage County.\\" It's Streep's 18th nomination. She has three wins, for \\"Kramer vs. Kramer,\\" \\"Sophie's Choice\\" and \\"The Iron Lady.\\" Hanks, Oprah missing. But not everyone ended up touched by Oscar's golden glow. Perhaps the biggest shocker was the lack of a nomination for Tom Hanks, who pretty much carries \\"Captain Phillips\\" as the titular seaman. The film did receive nominations for best picture, best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor (for former limo driver and Somalia native Barkhad Abdi), but neither Hanks nor director Paul Greengrass ended up with nods. (It also was nominated for film editing, sound editing and sound mixing.) Hanks' other major film, \\"Saving Mr. Banks,\\" was almost entirely snubbed. Though Emma Thompson was nominated for a Golden Globe for her portrayal of \\"Mary Poppins\\" author P.L. Travers, the academy overlooked her in the best actress race, and the film failed to earn a best picture nomination. Oprah Winfrey and the film she starred in, \\"Lee Daniels' The Butler,\\" also came up empty. And Robert Redford was expected to make a run at best actor for his almost wordless performance in \\"All Is Lost,\\" about a lone sailor lost at sea when his boat is damaged. But the 77-year-old actor didn't get a nomination. Pixar, which once a sure thing in the animated feature category, was left off the nominations list again. The nominees for best animated feature are \\"The Croods,\\" \\"Despicable Me 2,\\" \\"Frozen,\\" \\"The Wind Rises\\" and \\"Ernest & Celestine.\\" DeGeneres promises fun again as Oscar host. The Oscar race now shapes up as a battle between \\"Hustle\\" and \\"12 Years.\\" Both have their critics. For all the praise \\"Hustle\\" has received -- including a Golden Globe for best musical or comedy film -- it's been called slick and hammy. McQueen's \\"12 Years\\" (which received the Golden Globe for best drama) has fewer naysayers, but even those who liked the film noted it's difficult to watch. Slate's Dana Stevens described it as \\"overpowering,\\" and admitted she was having a hard time finding critical distance from the film's portrayal of brutality. Awards season: Does diversity matter more than wins? \\"Buyers Club\\" could sneak in. Like \\"12 Years,\\" it has a high-minded subject the Oscars tend to like, and McConaughey and Leto have been widely touted for their performances. \\"Gravity\\" may be a longer shot for best picture, but Cuaron's amazing direction -- juggling state-of-the-art, computer-generated imagery with moving performances by Bullock and George Clooney -- has been greatly admired. Of course, as much as the Oscar is about designating the best of Hollywood, it's also supposed to be an entertaining show. This year, Ellen DeGeneres returns as host, and given a short ad shown just before the nominations announcement -- which featured DeGeneres dancing through a back lot accompanied by a growing army of tuxedoed dancers -- it could be a lot of fun.

The two teams were level by the end of the first quarter, following 1-yard touchdown runs from both Chargers running back LaDainian Tomlinson and the Vikings' Adrian Peterson. The second quarter then went scoreless until the very last play of the half, when kicker Ryan Longwell came up short on a 57-yard field goal attempt, which Antonio Cromartie returned 109&#160;yards for a touchdown, the longest possible play in the game. The Vikings scored a pair of long touchdowns in the third quarter, as Peterson scored on a 64-yard run, followed by a 40-yard pass from Brooks Bollinger to Sidney Rice.

Building architecture and building design can createecho -filled classrooms that make hearing difficult. Children with hearingimpairments suffer most from noisy classrooms. They sometimes can't hear questions that other students ask in class. Compared with kids with healthy hearing, they have a harder time picking up new vocabulary words by hearing them in talking. Even kids with normal hearing have a harder time in the classroom when there's too much noise. Younger children in particular have trouble separating important sounds - like a teacher's voice - from background noise. Kids with learning disabilities and speechimpediments and kids for whom English is a second language also have a harder time learning in noisy situations. In recent years, scientists who study sound have been asking schools to reduce background noise, which may include loud air-conditioners and pipes. They're also targeting outdoor noises, such as highway traffic. Noise reduction is a big deal. Why? Because quieter classrooms might make you smarter by letting you hear your lessons better. \\"It's so obvious that we should have quiet rooms that allow for access to the lesson,\\" says Dan Ostergren, a hearing scientist. \\"Sometimes it surprises me that we spend so much time discussing this topic.

It combines elements of shooting, survival, and building to create a unique and exhilarating gaming experience. The game has continuously evolved through various seasons and updates, which introduced new gameplay features, in-game cosmetics, and overall improvements. These changes have made the game stay fresh and engaging for millions of players around the world. Over time, the Fortnite community has reminisced on earlier versions of the game, particularly the earlier seasons. These versions had a less complicated meta-game and map, with fewer items and mechanics, which some players preferred. In response to the interest in the older version of Fortnite, Epic Games introduced a limited-time mode called Classic, where players could experience the gameplay of the first two seasons.

I also wish there was a tip jar in front because I would have loved to tip her for her awesome customer service!   This place not only had great customer service, but also great food! I got my food to-go but this is pretty much how the place works: you have different options on the size of the bowl you can get to fill up. I got the small bowl but it was enough for two meals for me. They have good meat choices, yes the meat is raw and cold but that is why it stays fresh! Then they have different veggies to choose from and 3 types of noodles. You pile as much food as you can inside that bowl and they actually encourage you to cheat to get more food! They give you pieces of wax paper so that you can literally smash the food down and fit more inside the bowl. You can pile it up as high as you want...just as long as it isn't spilling all over the place. Then there is the AWESOME sauce bar. You can make your own sauce by mixing them together, or you can follow their easy instructions that show you how to make specific sauces! I told the cook that I was allergic to peanuts and without hesitation he cleaned the entire grill for me to make sure I didn't get any traces in my food.

I got the chicken arriabiatta sandwich, and while it was good there was some less-than-great quality chicken in there.  The desserts are perfectly sized for lunch (espresso cup-sized for 2).  It is almost impossible to resist dessert when it's that cheap and that small. We have also tried the pork chop, the tuna appetizer, and an omelet at brunch - all items were good, but too pricey to be worth it. I'll save this one for when I'm using the expense account. Is this review positive or negative? pick from the following. - negative - positive Answer:","output":"negative The review is negative because the person mentioned that the food is overpriced, the chicken quality was not great, and the items were too pricey to be worth it. While they did mention some positive aspects like the dessert size, the overall tone shows dissatisfaction and a preference to only go there when using an expense account, which implies they wouldn't spend their own money there."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"what type of compounds produced by a person's pancreas help cells take up compounds\\" and the following answer choices:  - Energy  - natural  - mineral  - endogenous  - Break down food  - it needs them  - sweat glands  - Energy.

Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin.  - In chemistry, pH (potential of hydrogen) is a numeric scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It is approximately the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration, measured in units of moles per liter, of hydrogen ions. More precisely it is the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the activity of the hydrogen ion. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. Pure water is neutral, at pH 7, being neither an acid nor a base. Contrary to popular belief, the pH value can be less than 0 or greater than 14 for very strong acids and bases respectively.  - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.  - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to . The logarithm of to \\"base\\" , denoted , is the unique real number such that For example, as , then:  - Petroleum (from : \\"rock\\" + \\"oleum\\": \\"oil\\". ) is a naturally occurring, yellow-to-black liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface, which is commonly refined into various types of fuels. Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation.  - Sunset Yellow FCF ( also known as Orange Yellow S , or C.I. 15985 ) is a petroleum - derived orange azo dye with a pH dependent maximum absorption at about 480 nm at pH 1 and 443 nm at pH 13 with a shoulder at 500 nm . When added to foods sold in the US it is known as FD&C Yellow 6 ; when sold in Europe , it is denoted by E Number E110 .  - Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions, separating chemical compounds by their boiling point by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the compound will vaporize. It uses distillation to fractionate. Generally the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25 °C from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere. If the difference in boiling points is greater than 25 °C, a simple distillation is typically used.  - A hydrogen ion is created when a hydrogen atom loses or gains an electron. A lone positively charged hydrogen ion (or proton) can readily combine with other particles and therefore is only seen isolated when it is in a gaseous state or a nearly particle free space. Due to its extremely high charge density of approximately 2×10 times that of a sodium ion, the bare hydrogen ion cannot exist freely in solution as it readily hydrates, i.e., bonds quickly. The hydrogen ion is recommended by IUPAC as a general term for all ions of hydrogen and its isotopes.  Depending on the charge of the ion, two different classes can be distinguished: positively charged ions and negatively charged ions.  - Distillation is a process of separating the component or substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture. In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of the mixture's components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction.  - A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena.  - A mordant or dye fixative is a substance used to set dyes on fabrics or tissue sections by forming a coordination complex with the dye which then attaches to the fabric or tissue. It may be used for dyeing fabrics, or for intensifying stains in cell or tissue preparations. The term mordant comes from the present participle of French \\"mordre\\", \\"to bite\\". In the past, it was thought that a mordant helped the dye bite onto the fiber so that it would hold fast during washing. A mordant is often a polyvalent metal ion. The resulting coordination complex of dye and ion is colloidal and can be either acidic or alkaline.  - Molar concentration, also called molarity, amount concentration or substance concentration, is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution, or of any chemical species, in terms of amount of substance in a given volume. A commonly used unit for molar concentration used in chemistry is mol/L. A solution of concentration 1 mol/L is also denoted as 1 molar (1 ).  - A dye is a colored substance that has an affinity to the substrate to which it is being applied. The dye is generally applied in an aqueous solution, and may require a mordant to improve the fastness of the dye on the fiber.  - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene.  - An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant chemical formula. For example, a solution of table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), in water would be represented as Na(aq) + Cl(aq). The word \\"aqueous\\" means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally abundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Oleum (Latin \\"oleum\\" = \\"oil\\"), or fuming sulfuric acid, is a solution of various compositions of sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid, or sometimes more specifically to disulfuric acid (also known as pyrosulfuric acid). Oleum is idenfied by the CAS number 8014-95-7.  - In computer science, ACID (\\"Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability\\") is a set of properties of database transactions. In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.  - E numbers are codes for substances that are permitted to be used as food additives for use within the European Union and Switzerland. The \\"E\\" stands for \\"Europe\\". Commonly found on food labels, their safety assessment and approval are the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority.  - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion).  - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is the agency of the European Union (EU) that provides independent scientific advice and communicates on existing and emerging risks associated with the food chain.

Given the question: I can use this background: Like water in the ocean, air in the atmosphere exerts pressure that increases with depth. Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth’s surface by gravity. As a result, air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes. This is illustrated in Figure below . Air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest. At higher altitudes, the pressure is less because the depth of the atmosphere is less. For example, on top of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. At such high altitudes, low air pressure makes it hard to breathe and is dangerous to human health.  Now, I have a new situation: There are two neighboring cities, Brampton and Filtroy. The two towns depend on each other by trading supplies and goods regularly. Filtroy is located on top of a very tall mountain, and Brampton is situated at the base of this hill. For this reason, it can sometimes be difficult to traverse the roads to trade goods, but it's important to do it so both cities can thrive.  Answer this question please: Which city has lower air pressure? The answer is:","output":"Filtroy has lower air pressure.  This conclusion can be drawn from the information provided in the background text on air pressure and the given situation of the two neighboring cities, Brampton and Filtroy. To better understand why Filtroy experiences lower air pressure, let's revisit some key points about air pressure and altitude.  Air pressure is the force exerted by the weight of air molecules on a given area. In the Earth's atmosphere, most of these gas molecules are pulled close to the surface due to the force of gravity. As you ascend or move to higher altitudes, for instance, when climbing a mountain, the number of air molecules above you decreases. Consequently, the air pressure at higher altitudes is less than that at lower altitudes, since there is less atmosphere pressing down upon you.  Coming back to the situation of Brampton and Filtroy, it is mentioned that Brampton is located at the base of the mountain, while Filtroy is situated at the top of the mountain. Based on the relationship between altitude and air pressure, it is evident that Filtroy, being at a higher altitude than Brampton, experiences lower air pressure due to its elevation.  In addition to the lower air pressure, the residents of Filtroy may experience difficulty in breathing and other altitude-related health issues. This is because, as mentioned in the background text, at high altitudes, low air pressure can make it hard to breathe and pose a danger to human health. Therefore, it is important to be mindful of these health risks when traveling between the two cities, especially for those journeying to Filtroy from Brampton. In conclusion, the city of Filtroy, which is at a higher altitude atop the mountain, experiences lower air pressure compared to Brampton, which is situated at the base of the mountain. This difference in air pressure is related to the altitude and consequently impacts human health and well-being in the two cities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Traditionally, historians have believed that the Dorian invasion caused the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, but it is likely the main attack was made by seafaring raiders (sea peoples) who sailed into the eastern Mediterranean around 1180 BC. The Dorian invasion was followed by a poorly attested period of migrations, appropriately called the Greek Dark Ages, but by 800 BC the landscape of Archaic and Classical Greece was discernible.

Here's the step-by-step solution: 1. The original equation is:    13 = 4*w + 25 2. We need to get rid of the constant term 25 on the right side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 25 from both sides of the equation:    13 - 25 = 4*w + 25 - 25 3. Performing the subtraction on both sides, we get:    -12 = 4*w 4. Now, we have only the term with the variable w on the right side of the equation. To isolate w, we need to divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable w, which is 4:    (-12) / 4 = 4*w / 4 5.

Question: Information:  - Gaius Julius Caesar (13 July 100 BC  15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.  - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.  - Eppillus ( Celtic : \`\` little horse '' ) was the name of a Roman client king of the Atrebates tribe of the British Iron Age . He was the son of Commius , the Gaulish former ally of Julius Caesar who fled to Britain following the uprising of Vercingetorix , or possibly of his son . After Commius 's death in about 20 BC , based on numismatic evidence , Eppillus seems to have ruled jointly with his brother , Tincomarus . Eppillus 's capital was Noviomagus ( Chichester ) in the south of the kingdom , while Tincomarus ruled from Calleva Atrebatum ( Silchester ) in the north . Eppillus became ruler of the whole territory a little before AD 7 , and Tincomarus appears as a supplicant to the emperor Augustus in his Res Gestae , so he would seem to have been driven out in some sort of domestic intrigue . After this , Eppillus 's coins are marked \`\` Rex '' , indicating that he was recognised as king by Rome . In about AD 15 Eppillus was succeeded as king of the Atrebates by another brother , Verica . At about the same time coins of the Cantiaci stamped with the name Eppillus start to appear in Kent , replacing those of Dubnovellaunus . It is possible that Eppillus was deposed by Verica , fled to Kent and established himself as king there , but equally possible that he was invited to become king by the Cantiaci , peacefully handing the rule of the Atrebates to his brother , or that he died and was succeeded by Verica , and that Eppillus of Kent was another man of the same name .  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities. In North America, archaeology is considered a sub-field of anthropology, while in Europe archaeology is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines.  - Vercingetorix (or  82 BC  46 BC) was a king and chieftain of the Arverni tribe; he united the Gauls in a revolt against Roman forces during the last phase of Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars.   - The Atrebates (singular \\"Atrebas\\") were a Belgic tribe of Gaul and Britain before the Roman conquests. However it is possible that the Atrebates were a family of rulers (dynasty), as there is no evidence for a major migration from Belgium to Britain.  - A dynasty is a sequence of rulers from the same family, usually in the context of a feudal or monarchical system but sometimes also appearing in elective republics. The dynastic family or lineage may be known as a \\"house\\"; which may be styled \\"royal\\", \\"princely\\", \\"comital\\", etc., depending upon the chief or present title borne by its members. Historians periodize the histories of many sovereign states, such as Ancient Egypt, the Carolingian Empire and Imperial China, using a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term \\"dynasty\\" may be used to delimit the era during which the family reigned and to describe events, trends, and artifacts of that period (\\"a Ming-dynasty vase\\"). The word \\"dynasty\\" itself is often dropped from such adjectival references (\\"a Ming vase\\").  - Commius (Commios, Comius, Comnios) was a historical king of the Belgic nation of the Atrebates, initially in Gaul, then in Britain, in the 1st century BC.  - The Iron Age is an archaeological era, referring to a period of time in the prehistory and protohistory of the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) when the dominant toolmaking material was iron. It is commonly preceded by the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia with exceptions and the Stone Age in Africa. Meteoric iron has been used by humans since at least 3200 BC, but ancient iron production did not become widespread until the ability to smelt iron ore, remove impurities and regulate the amount of carbon in the alloy were developed. The start of the Iron Age proper is considered by many to fall between around 1200 BC to 600 BC, depending on the region. In most parts of the world, its end is defined by the widespread adoption of writing, and therefore marks the transition from prehistory to history.  - The British Iron Age is a conventional name used in the archaeology of Great Britain, referring to the prehistoric and protohistoric phases of the Iron Age culture of the main island and the smaller islands, typically excluding prehistoric Ireland, which had an independent Iron Age culture of its own. The parallel phase of Irish archaeology is termed the Irish Iron Age. The Iron Age is not an archaeological horizon of common artefacts, but is rather a locally diverse cultural phase.  - The Gallic Wars were a series of military campaigns waged by the Roman proconsul Julius Caesar against several Gallic tribes. Rome's war against the Gallic tribes lasted from 58 BC to 50 BC and culminated in the decisive Battle of Alesia in 52 BC, in which a complete Roman victory resulted in the expansion of the Roman Republic over the whole of Gaul (mainly present-day France and Belgium). While militarily just as strong as the Romans, the internal division between the Gallic tribes helped ease victory for Caesar, and Vercingetorix's attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late. The wars paved the way for Julius Caesar to become the sole ruler of the Roman Republic.  - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\"    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'occupation'.

(CNN) -- I had hopes that with the talent of the two leads and the good buzz on director Ruben Fleischer's previous film, \\"Zombieland,\\" \\"30 Minutes or Less\\" would be more than it eventually ended up being, which is an occasionally funny, more often stupid, diversion. It's a decent way to spend 90 minutes if you have nothing else to do, but it doesn't exactly scream \\"See me in the theater!\\" The story is simple enough. Jesse Eisenberg's Nick delivers pizzas for a living, committing every moving violation in the book to get the pies to their destination on time, even when the location is clearly miles away. If he doesn't, it comes out of his pay, and one has to imagine that his pay isn't very high.","output":"One day, Nick receives a mysterious delivery order to a remote location, where he encounters two bumbling criminals, Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson). The duo, harboring delusions of grandeur, have concocted an elaborate plan to force Nick into robbing a bank for them by strapping a bomb to his chest. Threatened with his life, Nick reluctantly agrees and recruits his best friend, Chet (Aziz Ansari), a well-intentioned but bungling school teacher, to help him pull off the improbable heist. As Nick and Chet embark on their frantic race against the clock, the dynamic between the two friends is tested at every turn, offering a few genuine laugh-out-loud moments amid the high stakes. Meanwhile, Dwayne and Travis struggle with their own ineptitude, further complicating an already chaotic scenario. Deeper into their chaotic journey, it becomes apparent that the key to overcoming this seemingly insurmountable challenge might just lie in the friendship and trust forged between Nick and Chet. Throughout their ordeal, they learn to rely on one another, even as the tension between them reaches new heights. While \\"30 Minutes or Less\\" falls short of reaching the comedic heights of director Ruben Fleischer's previous hit, \\"Zombieland,\\" it does manage to deliver its fair share of chuckles. The chemistry between Eisenberg and Ansari is solid, if not occasionally overshadowed by the outrageous antics of McBride and Swardson. Although it doesn't quite succeed in replicating the magic of its predecessor, it does offer enough laughs to make it a passable distraction. Despite its shortcomings, \\"30 Minutes or Less\\" manages to entertain with its fast-paced action sequences, coupled with a touch of heart through the friendship between its protagonists. Unfortunately, the film misses the mark when it comes to generating genuine excitement or memorable moments, ultimately relegating itself to the category of \\"mindless entertainment.\\" As the credits roll on \\"30 Minutes or Less,\\" one can't help but feel slightly disappointed, given the raw talent on display and the potential for a truly great comedy. Instead, we're left with an acceptable, if forgettable, cinematic experience that falls short of greatness.

Washington (CNN) -- Preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon is a national security interest of both Israel and the United States, President Barack Obama said Sunday in calling for continued diplomatic efforts but also pledging that all options -- including a military effort -- remain viable. \\"All elements of American power\\" remain an option to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear power, including \\"a military effort to be prepared for any contingency,\\" Obama told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobby group. At the same time, Obama made clear that he preferred diplomacy over war both as a principle and in the case of Iran, and he warned that \\"too much loose talk of war\\" with Iran only benefits the Iranian government by driving up the price of oil. Israel \\"does not seek\\" war,","output":"but it will also do whatever is necessary to protect itself, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in response to Obama's speech. The two leaders agreed on the importance of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and pledged to continue close cooperation and diplomatic efforts. Over the next several months, diplomatic efforts between the United States, Israel, and Iran intensified. Sanctions on Iran were tightened, further crippling its economy. These increased pressures sparked internal protests and criticism of the Iranian regime's pursuit of a nuclear program. Realizing that their position was becoming increasingly untenable, Iranian leaders reluctantly agreed to engage in negotiations with the international community. With the United States and Israel maintaining a strong military presence nearby as a deterrent, a series of tense negotiations took place. Various leaders within the European Union and the United Nations joined the discussion to solidify a united front against Iran's nuclear ambitions. After several weeks of negotiation, a breakthrough occurred: Iran agreed to halt uranium enrichment and dismantle key aspects of its nuclear program. In return, the United States, Israel, and the European Union agreed to gradually lift economic sanctions on Iran, allowing the country's economy to recover from years of isolation. This agreement, which many deemed a near-impossible feat, was hailed as a significant diplomatic success. Yet, the agreement was met with skepticism among some international observers who worried that Iran might secretly continue its nuclear program. To address these concerns, the deal included a comprehensive inspection regime to verify Iran's compliance with the agreement. Struggling to regain its footing, Iran's economy slowly started to recover as they abided by the terms of the agreement. The success of the diplomatic efforts helped reduce tensions in the region, and the possibility of an armed conflict involving Iran, the United States, and Israel began to recede. Years later, it became clear that the diplomatic efforts made at that time had, indeed, averted the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the Middle East. The world had narrowly avoided the brink of a devastating conflict, and as a result, a relatively more peaceful era in Middle Eastern relations had begun."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Striking the wasps can greatly alter the effectiveness of your insecticide. Providing a flying strike allows you to quickly injure the wasps.. (2).

Wasps are called ticks because they possess special electrodes that you placed around their backs that utilize the fly-control function.. (3). Note that this is a very risky tactic, however. Wasps are quick, and if you have slow reflexes, you are likely to get stung when the wasp flies away and tries to defend itself.. (4).

Continue writing the following text. Felicia asked Lindsey to go the basement for her because  Possible answers: a. Felicia isn't scared of it.. b. Lindsey isn't scared of it..","output":"Felicia asked Lindsey to go to the basement for her because Lindsey isn't scared of it. Unlike Felicia, who always felt a shiver down her spine when she thought about venturing into the dark, damp space beneath their house, Lindsey approached it with an air of casual confidence. To Lindsey, the basement was just another part of their home that served a practical purpose, aiding in her understanding of the request.  Throughout their childhood, the two girls had always had contrasting attitudes towards the basement. For Felicia, it harbored an unsettling energy that seemed to emanate from the darkness that enveloped the room. She vividly remembered the stories her older siblings told her about creatures lurking in the shadows and how she, as the youngest child at the time, was their most vulnerable target. These childhood fears continued to linger, and even though Felicia now understood that those tales were nothing more than fabrications meant to scare her, she still couldn't suppress her discomfort whenever the basement was mentioned. On the other hand, Lindsey had never been one to back down from a challenge, and she considered the basement to be just that. In her mind, the basement represented a space of independence and resourcefulness. She had spent hours down there, searching for makeshift materials to craft into something new and exciting. Lindsey relished the idea of exploring the unknown, and to her, the basement was her own personal sanctuary in which to do so; an underground maze filled with potential treasures waiting to be discovered.  Their differences, in many ways, proved to be an advantage as they learned to divide and conquer various household tasks. In times when something needed to be retrieved from or stored in the basement, Lindsey was always the first to take on the responsibility. Likewise, Felicia tackled tasks with which Lindsey was less comfortable. The two complemented each other well, each balancing out the other's reservations. This particular day was no exception. As Lindsey descended the creaky wooden stairs into the basement, she thought about her sister upstairs. At the request of their parents, the girls had been asked to retrieve some important documents stored in a box in one of the basement's many nooks. Although Felicia had initially fought to overcome her fear, it was clear that her heart just wasn't in it. And so, in the spirit of sisterly protection, Lindsey graciously volunteered to be the one to venture down instead. It wasn't long before Lindsey found the desired box, and with a satisfied grin, she began her ascent back up the stairs. With pride and courage, she carried the documents back up to the safety of the main floor, where Felicia eagerly awaited her return. Grateful for her sister's bravery and reassured by her safe arrival, Felicia thanked Lindsey sincerely. In the end, it was not about who was scared of the basement or who was not. It was about two sisters knowing and understanding each other's fears and capabilities, and supporting each other when needed. This shared experience, along with many others, helped Felicia and Lindsey form an unbreakable bond, one that they would cherish throughout their lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bathroom: A bathroom is a room containing a toilet and typically other fixtures like a sink and a bathtub or shower. However, not all bathrooms are accessible to the general public, as many are located inside private residences or restricted areas. 2. Apartment: An apartment refers to a self-contained housing unit within a building. Toilets in an apartment are intended for use by the apartment's occupants and their guests, rather than the general public. 3. Stall: A stall refers to an enclosed space or partition, typically within a public restroom, which contains a toilet. While this would be an appropriate place to find a toilet for public use, the term \\"stall\\" refers more to the enclosure rather than the entire accessible area where the public can find and use the toilet. 4. Hospital: A hospital is a medical facility where toilets are available, but they are primarily intended for patients, staff, and visitors. Some hospitals might have public restrooms, but since hospitals are mainly focused on providing healthcare services, it is not the primary place people would think of when looking for a public restroom. 5. Rest area: A rest area is a facility usually found along highways or major roads, designed for travelers to pull over and take a break, use restroom facilities, and access other amenities such as vending machines or picnic areas. Public restrooms are one of the main features of rest areas, making them the best choice for finding a toilet that anyone can use.

Harry Reid, retiring but betting big on Nevada for Democratic Senate majority LAS VEGAS — The formidable political machine Harry M. Reid built in Nevada will face its most difficult task to date when it tries to hold on to the Senate seat being vacated by the retiring minority leader next year. After getting crushed in the 2014 midterm elections, Senate Democrats have a chance to win back the majority a year from now. If successful, they would set the chamber’s agenda and, more important in the short run, control the nomination process for the next president’s Cabinet. That would require a four-seat gain if the Democratic candidate wins the presidency or a five-seat gain if the GOP retakes the White House. With Reid’s retirement, Nevada has the only Democratic-held seat in jeopardy in 2016, and if Democrats can retain it, a lot of pressure would be placed on the five freshman Republicans who are seeking reelection in states that President Obama won twice: Illinois, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Replacing Reid on the ballot will be Catherine Cortez Masto, a former state attorney general whose campaign will rely heavily on the political infrastructure the outgoing senator assembled in the past decade. The collection of labor unions, particularly casino workers, and burgeoning populations of Hispanics and Asian Americans have turned a state that traditionally tilted Republican in presidential elections toward Democrats in recent years. The question is whether the machine can deliver the state’s electoral votes for the Democratic presidential nominee for a third straight election, while also retaining the Senate seat with Masto, a political figure who represents a sharp departure from Reid. There’s no doubt that Reid, 75, a Mormon with more than four decades of statewide campaigns under his belt, presents a different profile from Masto, 51, who is attempting to become the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate. “I’m younger and Latino with a different voice and different issues that we’ve worked on,” Masto said recently at the state party’s headquarters south of this city’s famed Strip. Those differences became clear Monday, when Masto broke from Obama and congressional Democratic leaders to “share the concerns of some Republicans in Congress” about the vetting process for Syrian refugees, in light of Friday’s attacks in Paris and the potential connection of terrorists exploiting the refu­gee crisis to move into western Europe. In the interview, she signaled a more hawkish foreign policy than Obama or her mentor, Reid, supporting a more robust arming of rebels, such as the Kurds in Iraq. That position will test whether this next-generation candidate can maintain the same support as Reid and Obama, while distancing herself from them on certain issues to demonstrate her independence. Given the stakes, Republicans in Nevada are just as energized. A GOP win here by their likely candidate, Rep. Joe Heck, would probably ensure their majority for two more years. And there is no discounting the desire among some Republicans for the symbolic victory of grabbing the seat held by a political enemy for the past 12 years. Party leaders would like to play down that notion, however. “I don’t think of it in those terms,” said Sen. Roger Wicker (Miss.), chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “I think it’s a great opportunity for a pickup. We’re looking at defending our majority and building on it. It’s a very important seat for that reason.” The climate of the 2016 Senate race is relatively rare; Reid and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is leaving the Senate to run for president, are the only two senators retiring from competitive swing seats. Most critical races will feature a first-term Republican trying to win reelection in a much different climate from the 2010 midterms, when the GOP seized the House majority and cut deep into Reid’s majority at the time. To some degree, Reid is back where he started as the Democratic leader in 2005, serving in the minority trying to regain the majority while also trying to shore up his home flank. He said that he is “devoting a huge amount of my time” to helping Masto win at home and to assure that his likely successor, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), takes the baton from Reid with a new majority. “It’s so much better to be majority leader than minority leader,” Reid said at The Washington Post’s “2016 Pregame” event on the eve of last month’s presidential debate here. [Watch Harry Reid discuss the 2016 races and Nevada’s role in national politics] Although Reid won reelection in 2004, President George W. Bush also was reelected and carried Nevada, the eighth Republican in the previous 10 presidential campaigns to do so. Republicans held a slight edge in voter registration at the time, and Reid realized he needed to rebuild the state’s Democratic Party. His idea was to push Nevada from the middle of the pack on the presidential primary and caucus calendar closer to the front of the line. Officially, the effort was about placing a diverse western state and a heavily African American state, South Carolina, behind the small states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Those two traditional early-voting states did not, Reid explained, “demonstrate what America is all about, for a lot of different reasons. Nevada does that.” Not only was Nevada early on the calendar in the 2008 contest, it became a brutal primary battle between Obama and then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.), in which each candidate raced to register as many new voters as possible, particularly Latino workers in Las Vegas who had never been considered part of a crucial voting bloc. By the end of the 2008 primary season, Democrats held a voter registration edge of more than 100,000 over Nevada Republicans, a stunning turnaround that played a key role in giving Obama a 12 percentage-point victory in the general election. Moreover, that effort, led by Reid’s top political adviser Rebecca Lambe, fortified his own advantage heading into the 2010 election, which Reid won handily. In 2014, however, the state was less friendly toward Democrats. Republicans won the most prominent statewide offices and the GOP has cut the voter registration deficit to less than 60,000. If Heck becomes the Senate nominee, Republicans will have landed a candidate who will run more heavily on his biography than on his experience serving three terms in the House. “A general, a doctor, small-business person, a great legislator, a good vote-getter in a swing district,” Wicker said, rattling off the résumé of the brigadier general in the Army Reserve. “I like our chances.” Masto, however, intends to make the race very much about Heck’s record in Washington, particularly the positions he has taken on immigration. Hispanics now account for about 15 percent of the votes in Nevada — and nearly 30 percent of the entire population — so Heck’s support for revoking birthright citizenship for all immigrants will be a frequent refrain from Masto and her outside supporters. Heck has opposed efforts to block Obama’s executive action that stopped the deportation of children brought to the United States illegally by adults, trying to walk a fine line between that and opposing other immigration-related executive orders. She wants to focus the race on her record as attorney general of prosecuting sex traffickers and business fraud that led to the mortgage crisis. Republicans accuse her of marching to Reid’s orders in at least one instance, the prosecution of a Republican in a corruption case that was later dropped, when that GOP official was considering challenging Reid in 2010. Back then, Reid benefited from a far-right conservative opponent, Sharron Angle, who won a heavily contested primary; Democrats are again trying to bait Angle into a primary campaign against Heck. Two years later, in 2012, Sen. Dean Heller (R) edged his way past the Reid machine in a presidential election year, defeating Democrat Shelley Berkley by 1 percent. In that case, Berkley was battling ethics issues and Heller’s plurality victory, at 46 percent, was aided by an unusual state law that allows Nevadans to vote “none of the above.” Ultimately, Masto is trying to thread the needle to run under the full auspices of that massive political infrastructure Reid built for Democrats, but also run as her own person. “I’m a different voice,” she said.

Dip the strands into a small bowl of coke for a few minutes. (ii). Dip the strands into a small bowl of baking soda for a few minutes. Answer:","output":"Answer: (ii). Dip the strands into a small bowl of baking soda for a few minutes. Step 1: Assess the situation and gather required materials The first step is to determine the extent of gum stuck in the hair and gather the necessary materials, such as a small bowl, baking soda, water, and a comb. Step 2: Create a baking soda paste Mix baking soda and water in a small bowl to form a paste. The consistency should be thick enough to stick to the hair without dripping. Step 3: Apply the baking soda paste to the gum-infested hair Using your fingers or a small brush, gently apply the baking soda paste to the gum-infested hair strands. Make sure to cover the gum entirely with the paste, as well as the hair around the gum to ease removal. Step 4: Let the paste sit for a few minutes Allow the baking soda paste to work on the gum for a few minutes. The baking soda helps to break down the sticky residue while also making the gum more brittle so that it is easier to remove. Step 5: Gently comb out the gum Using a comb or your fingers, gently start to comb or slide out the gum from the hair strands. Be patient and take your time to avoid damaging the hair. Step 6: Rinse and wash the hair Once the gum is successfully removed, rinse and wash the hair to remove any remaining baking soda paste. Make sure to condition the hair after washing, as the baking soda can sometimes be drying."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please briefly summarize this news article: Review of Louie season 3 premiere, \\"Something Is Wrong\\" Louis CK and Gaby Hoffmann in the season premiere. Spoilers for last night’s Louie below: In “Something Is Wrong,” the the season premiere of Louie, Louis CK’s alter ego protagonist bought himself a motorcycle. I’ve seen the first five episodes of the third season by now, and it’s clear that Louis CK is driving a powerful vehicle, as well, and the accelerator is jammed: after an already strong second season (#1 on my best-shows list for 2011), each episode is better than the previous one. I am beginning to worry that if it gets any better, it will break my TV. The return episode is strong enough in its own right, and plays like a kind of sampler of Louie’s strengths. I was weeping at the opening masturbation / reading glasses joke, capped off by the guilty assumption about the sales clerk at the pharmacy. (“You ain’t readin’ shit!”). There was the surreal comedy of the parking gag, with the just-ever-so-off street signs. There was the midlife-crisis and physical comedy with the motorcycle (accompanied by one of the show’s occasional montage-love-letters to Manhattan). And above all, there was the brilliant breakup exchange in the diner, with Louie’s girlfriend guessing that he wants to split, and Louie only able to confirm that she’s right–or realize that she’s right only because she brought it up?–only through his silence. From the conversation, we get that April and Louie have been a thing for a while, though he’s been hesitant to get too serious. But the genius of the scene is how the dialogue–or near-monologue–gives us the sense, just through the language, of how old and tiring this relationship is, even though we’ve just been dropped in the middle of it. (“Oh, god, why does it have to be like this? What is this, a game of relationship charades?”) It’s a fine performance by Gaby Hoffmann as April, and another good example of how well the show casts actors who look and sound like everyday Manhattanites. It may be a stretch to say that individual seasons of Louie are “about” something. But if the first season was one in which we met the character, adjusting to life after divorce (the guy we saw start crying on a date), and the second showed Louie gaining confidence as a single father and expanding the community around him, the third seems to show him putting himself out there, dating and venturing into the larger world. (Again, I’ve seen five episodes, but won’t spoil anything for you from them.) After Louie wipes out on his bike (an accident he admits to his ex-wife but is too embarrassed to relate to April), one of the last things April tells him is that he could spare them both a few years of their lives wasted by being honest about his feelings before he commits. Which is to say that getting back on that bike—literally, or metaphorically in dating—means exposing himself to the possibility of injury, either physical or emotional. It may not be painless for Louie, but it’s exciting for us. Over two previous seasons, Louis CK has built himself quite the machine here. Let’s see what this baby can do. A quick hail of bullets: * We see Louie’s ex-wife for the first time, which is quite a surprise since we’ve never seen her before and also because she’s black. (Hispanic? In any case, darker-complected than we would expect from his sister’s description of the ex in last season’s “Pregnant” as a “pasty, big-titted, black-eyed guinea bitch.” When I interviewed Louis CK last year, he said he deliberately avoided showing his character’s ex on the show at the time, and that he took care to change real-life details in any references to her, so as not to seem to depicting his actual ex-wife. I suspected when I first watched the episode that the color-blind casting was a distancing attempt for that reason–and/or an outgrowth of the fact that he’s never cared a lot about some elements of continuity. In an interview with Indiewire, his explanation is a little of both—that, he says, and he simply really liked Susan Kelechi Watson’s audition. * Speaking of continuity, or lack thereof: his niece? Not around, as far as we can see. Pamela? Still off somewhere, or out of the picture? * Having dropped a giant water jug through the roof of a car its first season, Louie now destroys one with construction equipment. Here’s hoping they find another way to wreck a car next season. (And given the show’s tiny budget, good thing the first take evidently worked.) * As mentioned before, I’m on vacation, and Robo-James is posting this while I’m away. So I probably won’t be able to join in the comments section, but have at it. Summary:","output":"In the season 3 premiere of Louie, titled \\"Something is Wrong,\\" protagonist Louie, played by Louis CK, buys a motorcycle and faces the consequences of his actions. The episode showcases the show's strengths, including moments of both surreal comedy and heartfelt drama. In the episode's most notable scene, Louie goes through a realistic and relatable breakup with his girlfriend, portrayed by Gaby Hoffmann. As the third season progresses, the show explores Louie's growth as a single father, dating, and venturing into the world. The premiere introduces Louie's ex-wife, who viewers had yet to see and serves as an example of the show's excellent casting choices. Overall, the season 3 premiere is a powerful and promising opening for the critically acclaimed show."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton's lead over Sen. Barack Obama, her chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, is growing among African-American voters who are registered Democrats, and particularly among black women, a poll said Wednesday.

That's up from 53 percent for Clinton and 36 percent for Obama in a poll carried out in April. The 26-point difference between black women and men underscores the fact that the nation's vote is divided not only by race, but also by gender, said CNN political analyst Bill Schneider. \\"Black women don't just vote their black identity,\\" he said. \\"They also vote their identity as women.\\" Watch","output":"Bill Schneider discuss the poll results and the impact on the Democratic race The increasing gap between Clinton and Obama in the African-American voter demographic can be attributed to a variety of factors.

This goes to show that as the Democratic race heats up, candidates need to consider the intersectionality of voters' identities in order to effectively appeal to their target electorate. As the campaign progresses, ensuring African-American voters’ concerns and needs are addressed will be crucial for both candidates, recognizing the importance of winning over this demographic for the Democratic nomination. The CNN poll results highlight the need for a nuanced, targeted approach in appealing to the multifaceted identities of voters, in order to secure their support and ultimately, clinch the nomination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Children are known to be very keen observers and once they are interested in something, it is very likely to stay with them for life. They tend to look at life through the eyes of the person they are close to or want to be like. If their role model is optimistic, there are more chances of them optimistic. The role model becomes their standard of measurement. Because they follow the actions of their role models so closely, children adopt the personality and attitude of their role models. Children learn to like or dislike certain things by _ the personality and attitude of the people they admire. One reason why children keep changing their answers to \\"what would you like to be when you grow up\\" is that they are influenced by individuals in a certain field. Children view the social relationships (family or public) mainly in the light of the importance these relationships hold in the life of their role models. Their expression of their feelings is many times a reflection of their role model's outlook. According to a study, around 56% of teenagers identified with the role models. Out of these, those having personal or direct contact with their role models had higher self-esteem and were better at academics compared to those who didn't. As such, children who have positive role models, have more self-confidence and are more optimistic about their future. They learn to handle themselves well in social settings and positively interact with those around them. Of course, children who have their parents as positive role models have a well-rounded outlook towards life. They find it easier to deal with the highs and lows of life because they have seen their parents do it before. They find a sense of stability and security knowing that they will overcome failures just like their parents before them. Besides, it becomes easier for parents to discipline and guide children. So it is no wonder why children who have parents as their role models have fewer behavioral issues. Question: This article is mainly about  _  .

Haley's comments came during an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, where she urged for the \\"strongest possible measures\\" against North Korea. Nuclear Test On Sunday, North Korea conducted a nuclear test by detonating a thermonuclear warhead underground. Expert analysis suggests that the explosive had a power range of between 50 and 150 kilotons. This is a significant increase in comparison to the power of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima at the end of World War II. Pyongyang's Claims North Korea claims to have the capability to reduce the size of the warhead and attach it to an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the US mainland. Some analysts, however, are skeptical about the truthfulness of this claim. US Response In response to the latest test, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis stated that the US will respond to North Korean threats with a \\"massive military response – a response both effective and overwhelming.\\" Ambassador Haley emphasized that US patience with North Korea is \\"not unlimited.\\" Sanctions and Diplomacy Haley called for the strongest sanctions possible to help resolve the issue through diplomacy. \\"Enough is enough,\\" she said, acknowledging that the incremental approach taken thus far has failed. \\"We have kicked the can down the road long enough.

George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties.

Article:","output":"Title: Monmouthshire Mansion Renovation Scandal: Developer's Use of Alleged Children's Gravestones for Wall Plaques Introduction A shocking discovery has been revealed in the ongoing criminal trial involving a property developer who stands accused of illegally altering a 16th-century Monmouthshire mansion. The court was told that wall plaques found on the premises appeared to have been made from children's gravestones, adding a layer of macabre to an already contentious case. This article delves into the details of this deeply disturbing incident, shedding light on an unconscionable act that has shaken the community and sparked widespread outrage. The Mansion and its Historic Significance The Monmouthshire mansion in question, a magnificent structure dating back to the 16th century, has captured the imagination of historians and architecture enthusiasts alike. Its storied past and architectural grandeur make it an invaluable piece of British heritage. Consequently, any attempts to alter or renovate such a structure must adhere strictly to preservation guidelines set forth by local authorities to maintain its historical integrity. The Property Developer's Unscrupulous Actions The defendant at the center of this unfolding scandal is a property developer who reportedly disregarded these guidelines in a relentless pursuit of profit. The court heard allegations of unauthorized alterations and renovation work carried out on the historic mansion, including demolitions of sections deemed to be of significant historical value. These acts of destruction were allegedly carried out without obtaining the necessary permissions from local authorities, rendering them unlawful in addition to being deeply disrespectful of the mansion's unique place in history. Gravestone Wall Plaques: A Morbid Discovery During the investigation into the property developer's actions, a shocking revelation emerged: wall plaques found inside the mansion appeared to be made from children's gravestones. This disturbing discovery adds an even darker element to this already sordid tale. The utilization of what are widely considered sacred memorials of the deceased for decorative purposes not only raises serious ethical questions but also may have legal ramifications for the defendant. If proven true, this would be a callous display of utter disrespect for the sanctity of life. Community Reaction and Legal Implications The shocking details of this case have caused ripples of anger and disbelief throughout the local community and beyond. Historians and preservation experts have expressed dismay at the defendant's blatant disregard for the historical importance of the Monmouthshire mansion. Similarly, residents are not only appalled by the illegal renovations but are also horrified by the alleged use of children's gravestones as mere decorative items. Legally, the defendant faces numerous charges related to breaching preservation guidelines and carrying out unauthorized alterations to a historic building. Additionally, if it is proven that the gravestones were indeed acquired and repurposed illegally, further charges may be levied against the defendant. Conclusion The case of the Monmouthshire mansion and its desecrated gravestone wall plaques serve as a harrowing reminder of the lengths some individuals may go to in the name of profit. This disturbing event highlights the importance of vigilant oversight and preservation efforts to protect invaluable historical structures from the unsavory acts of unscrupulous individuals. As this case continues to unfold, it stands as a testament to the fact that the allure of financial gain can sometimes overshadow the most basic principles of human decency and respect for history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"What error of attribution was made by Chesterfield, Warburton, and others?\\"  Context: \\"Burke claimed that Bolingbroke's arguments against revealed religion could apply to all social and civil institutions as well. Lord Chesterfield and Bishop Warburton (and others) initially thought that the work was genuinely by Bolingbroke rather than a satire. All the reviews of the work were positive, with critics especially appreciative of Burke's quality of writing. Some reviewers failed to notice the ironic nature of the book, which led to Burke stating in the preface to the second edition (1757) that it was a satire.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The error of attribution made by Lord Chesterfield, Bishop Warburton, and others concerning the work of Edmund Burke lies in their mistaken belief that the authorship belonged to Lord Bolingbroke rather than recognizing it as a satire by Burke. To provide a comprehensive understanding of this error, we need to delve into the context in which these misattributions took place. In 1756, Edmund Burke wrote a book titled \\"A Vindication of Natural Society,\\" which served as a satirical critique of Lord Bolingbroke's ideas. Lord Bolingbroke was a prominent British statesman and political philosopher who voiced strong criticisms against revealed religion, arguing that religious doctrines should be derived merely from reason and the observation of nature. Burke employed satire to expand Bolingbroke's arguments beyond religion, demonstrating that if Bolingbroke's rationalistic approach were applied to other social and civil institutions, it would lead to the collapse of organized society. However, this satirical intent was not immediately evident to some readers, including Lord Chesterfield and Bishop Warburton. They wrongly believed that the work was an authentic representation of Bolingbroke's ideology, displaying an error of attribution by crediting the book's authorship to the wrong individual. The failure to recognize the satirical nature of the work is an example of \\"irony blindness,\\" where some individuals struggle to discern underlying irony in a text or statement. The reviews of \\"A Vindication of Natural Society\\" were generally positive, with many critics praising the quality of Burke's writing. However, even some reviewers overlooked the ironical nature of the book, which might have contributed to the confusion surrounding authorship. To clarify the true intent of his work, Burke added a preface to the second edition in 1757, explicitly stating that the book was a satire. In conclusion, the error of attribution made by Chesterfield, Warburton, and others regarding Burke's work can be attributed to irony blindness and the failure to recognize the text as a satirical critique of Lord Bolingbroke's ideas. Consequently, they mistakenly identified Bolingbroke as the author instead of the true author, Edmund Burke."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In Rebecca's case, she had a bad home life which made it difficult for her to stay any longer than necessary. Growing up, she constantly experienced volatile situations that left her feeling unsafe and uncomfortable, longing for stability and a sense of normalcy. Rebecca's bad home life stemmed from a variety of factors, including her parents' tumultuous relationship, emotional and verbal abuse, and a feeling of utter neglect. Unable to cope with the constant stress and anxiety that these issues burdened her with, she knew that the only way to escape was by leaving as soon as she could. On the other hand, Monica had her own set of challenges that made her home life unbearable too. Although her circumstances were different from Rebecca's, the outcome was still the same - the desire to flee from a toxic environment. In Monica's situation, her parents were overly critical and controlling, never respecting her autonomy or allowing her to make her own decisions. As an older sister, Monica always tried to protect and support Rebecca, even while dealing with her own struggles. She hoped that one day, they could both break free from the chains of their painful past and find a more fulfilling and contented life elsewhere. Monica, having dealt with the constricting atmosphere for years, was finally able to gather the courage and resources needed to leave home when she was older. Once she made the life-altering decision to escape, she took her younger sister Rebecca along with her, nervous but determined to start anew. Their journey was a challenging one, but they made it through each step of the way, every obstacle they encountered bringing them closer to a better life.

According to reports, suspect Fernando Castro, 19, was killed in a shootout with Search for kidnapped Vallejo girl shifts to Sonoma County coast The search for a kidnapped Vallejo girl shifted to the Sonoma County coastal town of Jenner on Friday, a day after the suspect in her abduction was killed in a police shootout nearly 400 miles to the south in Santa Barbara County. Solano County Sheriff’s Department officials worked with the Sonoma County Sheriff’s office to conduct a search for 15-year-old Pearl Pinson in an area near Willow Creek Road in Jenner, said sheriff’s Deputy Christine Castillo, a spokeswoman for the agency. Castillo would only say that the focus of the search shifted to Jenner “based on information we have received during our investigation.” She declined to discuss what evidence investigators uncovered that prompted them to search in Jenner. Earlier Friday, investigators were combing an area under the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, where a security camera caught Pearl’s alleged abductor, Fernando Castro, 19, driving around Thursday — hours before he was killed in a Santa Barbara County gunbattle with police. Solano County Sheriff’s Department officials said Castro was spotted about 9:30 a.m. Thursday driving a 1997 Saturn in the area of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard near the Marin County side of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. An automatic license plate reader triggered a traffic camera to pick up the car in the area after an Amber Alert was issued for Pearl and authorities sent out an all-points-bulletin with a photo of the Saturn and its license plate number, said Solano County Sheriff Tom Ferrara. The security footage showed Castro apparently alone in the car, but officials said the missing girl could have been lying down in the back seat and not visible to the camera. Detectives spent Friday morning in the area searching for more surveillance footage, hoping it will help them find Pearl alive. Pearl never made it to school Wednesday morning and was last seen about 7 a.m. She was wearing a black-and-turquoise backpack, according to the Solano County Sheriff’s Office. Later Wednesday morning, several witnesses called police and reported seeing a girl bleeding, screaming and being dragged into a car on the Interstate 780 overpass near Home Acres and Taylor avenues. Police said witnesses saw the abductor holding a gun. Officials believe Castro and Pearl were acquainted. “I’m overwhelmed and I’m worried sick about her,” Rose Pinson, a sister of the missing girl, told reporters at a vigil in Vallejo Thursday night. “So much is going through my mind, I don’t know what to believe. I just want her found.” On Thursday afternoon sheriff deputies in Santa Barbara spotted Castro driving alone around Solvang and gave chase. He drove into a mobile home park, where he jumped into another vehicle and fired shots at law enforcement officers before being fatally shot by return fire, authorities said. “Obviously, this ramps up the search efforts,” Ferrara said Thursday. “We continue our search and hope Pearl Pinson is alive.” Anyone with information can call Solano County sheriff’s deputies at (707) 784-1963, and urgent matters can be directed to (707) 421-7090 or 911.

Given the question: The night when she thought she would finally be a star, Maria Isabella du'l Cielo struggled to calm the trembling of her hands, reached over to cut the tether that tied her to the ground, and thought of that morning many years before when she'd first caught a glimpse of Lorenzo du Vicenzio ei Salvadore: tall, thick-browed and handsome, his eyes closed, oblivious to the cacophony of the accident waiting to occur around him. Maria Isabella had just turned sixteen then, and each set of her padrinos had given her (along with the sequined brida du caballo, the dresses of rare tulle, organza, and seda, and the diadema floral du'l dama -- the requisite floral circlet of young womanhood) a purse filled with coins to spend on anything she wanted. And so she'd gone past the Calle du Leones (where sleek cats of various pedigrees sometimes allowed themselves to be purchased, though if so, only until they tired of their new owners), walked through the Avenida du'l Conquistadores (where the statues of the conquerors of Ciudad Meiora lined the entirety of the broad promenade) and made her way to the Encantu lu Caminata (that maze-like series of interconnected streets, each leading to some wonder or marvel for sale), where little musical conch shells from the islets near Palao'an could be found. Those she liked very much. In the vicinity of the Plaza Emperyal, she saw a young man dressed in a coat embroidered with stars walk almost surely to his death. In that instant, Maria Isabella knew two things with the conviction reserved only for the very young: first, that she almost certainly loved this reckless man; and second, that if she simply stepped on a dog's tail -- the very dog watching the same scene unfold right next to her -- she could avert the man's seemingly senseless death. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How long after the event is the story being probably told by Maria? Options:  A. One year later.  B. The following day.  C. Many years later.  D. not enough information The answer is:","output":"C. Many years later. This is implied in the text when Maria Isabella thinks of that morning \\"many years before\\" when she first saw Lorenzo, the man she loved. The usage of the words \\"many years before\\" suggests that Maria is recalling these events a significant length of time after they actually occurred."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: How does Sam know the person who gets his head crushed by a statue? , can you please find it?   Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense. Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand.

Choose from:  A). place a clean pan on the burner of your stove and, after turning on the stove, heat up food or drink in it;  B). place a clean pan on the burner of your stove and, before turning on the stove, heat up food or drink in it;","output":"Option A is the better solution for achieving the goal of using a pan, which involves cooking or heating up food or drink in the pan. To fully understand why this is the case, we will go into detail on both of the steps involved in the two options. Option A: Step 1 - Place a clean pan on the burner of your stove Step 2 - After turning on the stove, heat up food or drink in it Option B: Step 1 - Place a clean pan on the burner of your stove Step 2 - Before turning on the stove, heat up food or drink in it Let's examine each step in both options and compare them for effectiveness in achieving the goal. In Option A, placing a clean pan on the burner of your stove ensures that the pan is ready to begin cooking and that there is no leftover residue from previous cooking sessions. This helps to maintain the quality of the food and ensures that it is prepared in a clean and safe environment. In the second step of Option A, turning on the stove and then heating the food or drink in the pan is the correct method for cooking. When the stove is turned on, the burner heats up, and the heat is then transferred to the bottom of the pan, raising the temperature of the pan and its contents. As the heat continues to increase, the food or drink in the pan will cook, achieving the goal of using the pan. In Option B, the first step of placing the clean pan on the burner of the stove is the same as Option A, providing a clean and ready-to-cook surface. However, the second step of Option B is problematic, as it suggests heating up food or drink in the pan before turning on the stove. Without a heat source, it is not possible to cook, warm up or achieve the desired temperature for the food or drink that is placed in the pan. This method would render the pan useless for achieving the goal of using it. In conclusion, considering the effectiveness of each option in reaching the goal of using a pan to cook or heat up food or drink, Option A is clearly the better solution. This method includes placing a clean pan on the burner of your stove and then turning on the stove to heat up the food or drink in the pan properly, enabling efficient cooking and achieving the desired results."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the evolutionary significance of communisim and how has it changed modern society? What is the evolutionary significance of marketing and how has it changed modern society? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Step 1: Understand the tasks The tasks given are to discuss the evolutionary significance of communism and marketing and how they have changed modern society. Step 2: Clarify the concepts and questions In order to perform the task, it's important to have a good understanding of communism, marketing, and the concept of evolutionary significance. Communism: A political and economic system where the means of production are publicly owned, and wealth is distributed according to the needs of individuals. Marketing: The process of promoting, selling, and distributing a product or service to consumers. Evolutionary significance: Refers to how a certain characteristic, behavior, or phenomenon has influenced or impacted the development or progress of a species or society over time. Considering these definitions, the given questions are: - What is the evolutionary significance of communism, and how has it changed modern society? - What is the evolutionary significance of marketing, and how has it changed modern society? Step 3: Analyze the questions It is clear that the two questions are not paraphrases of each other since they refer to different phenomena (communism and marketing). However, they do share a common structure. Both questions are asking about the evolutionary significance of a particular phenomenon and how that phenomenon has impacted modern society. Step 4: Perform the task Discussing the evolutionary significance of communism and how it has changed modern society: Communism has had a significant impact on human societies, particularly during the 20th century. Its evolutionary significance lies mainly in its attempts to challenge and overturn existing power structures and create a more equitable society. In this regard, communism has served as an alternative model to capitalism, contributing to the development of different political and economic systems. The spread of communist ideas, however, has also led to conflict and competition between nations, effecting the global political landscape. Discussing the evolutionary significance of marketing and how it has changed modern society: Marketing has a strong evolutionary significance, as it has its roots in human communication and social interaction. It has driven competition and growth in economic systems and has a critical role in the dissemination of ideas, products, and services. Marketing has become an integral part of modern society, shaping consumer behavior, influencing economies, and connecting people around the world. Through its evolution, marketing has contributed to the globalization of products and services and has fostered rapid technological advancement by creating demand for innovative solutions and improvements. As a conclusion, both communism and marketing have their own evolutionary significance and impact on modern society. They are distinct and unrelated phenomena, addressing different aspects of human society and development."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","output":"The given data represents a golf player's performance in a sports event, breaking down the scores obtained in each round and calculating the total score. The player in question here is Grégory Havret, a professional golfer. He has finished the competition tied for the 4th (T4) place. Let's break down the data and analyze it further: 1. Score breakdown: The data provides us with three individual scores: 73, 71, and 69. These are likely the number of strokes Grégory Havret took in three different rounds of the competition. Golf scoring is based on the number of strokes a player takes to complete each hole, with the objective being to complete the course in the lowest possible number of strokes.      - The first round score is 73, meaning Grégory took 73 strokes to finish the first round.   - The second round score is 71, indicating he took 71 strokes to complete the second round.   - The third round score is 69, in which Grégory took 69 strokes to conclude the third round. 2. Total score calculation: The data provides us with the combined sum of the scores from all three rounds, which is 213. This means that Grégory Havret needed a total of 213 strokes to complete the entire event.       - Formula for calculating the total score: 73 (First Round) + 71 (Second Round) + 69 (Third Round) = 213 3. Acronyms and placements: There are two abbreviations mentioned in the data, which provide additional context to Grégory Havret's performance:    - TO_PAR E: This signifies that Grégory Havret's total score is 'Even' (E) in relation to the course 'par,' meaning his cumulative score is equal to the expected total score (par) for the entire course. Generally, the term 'par' refers to the number of strokes that an expert golfer is expected to take to complete a hole or round.        - T4: This acronym indicates that Grégory Havret has finished the event in a tie for the 4th (T4) place. T4 means that Grégory Havret and some other players shared the cumulative score of 213, resulting in a tie for the same position, which, in this case, is the 4th place. In conclusion, the given data describes the performance of professional golfer Grégory Havret in a sports event. During the competition, he played three rounds, achieving scores of 73, 71, and 69 strokes, respectively. His total score for the event was 213 strokes, which placed him in a tie for the 4th place. This performance is considered 'Even' in relation to the course par, indicating that Grégory finished the course with the expected expert golfer score."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise states that Hindus believe Varanasi is the oldest city in the world because Shiva is said to have poured a river down onto the plains from the Himalayas. 2. The hypothesis states that the Hindu faith holds that Delhi is the second oldest city. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis: A. The premise provides information about the belief in Varanasi being the oldest city. B. The hypothesis provides information about the belief in Delhi being the second oldest city. To determine if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis, we need to see if there is a logical connection between these two beliefs. As it stands, the premise and the hypothesis are independent statements that provide information about different cities and their respective ages according to Hindu belief. The truth of the premise does not provide any direct information about the hypothesis. Therefore, the answer is (II) it is not possible to tell whether the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. There is no direct logical connection that guarantees the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise alone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other. The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest.  Was the breakdown of complex molecules lesser or greater in Valley Forest? A:","output":"The breakdown of complex molecules in Valley Forest would be lesser compared to Peak Forest. This is because the rate of wood decay is significantly reduced in Valley Forest due to the drier conditions and the efficient drainage system composed of ditches. In contrast, Peak Forest has a higher rate of decay in wood due to the greater water saturation, providing more suitable conditions for fungi to thrive. Fungi play a crucial role in breaking down complex organic molecules like cellulose and lignin found in wood, which means that the higher presence of fungi in Peak Forest will contribute to a greater breakdown of complex molecules. Therefore, the breakdown of complex molecules will be lesser in Valley Forest in comparison to Peak Forest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The farming world Akir is threatened by the tyrannical warlord Sador, who rules the sinister Malmori Empire and, his body parts deteriorating, is capturing and appropriating them from others. Sador's huge dreadnaught (nicknamed \\"Hammerhead\\") mounts a \\"Stellar Converter\\", a weapon that turns planets into small stars. He demands that the peaceful Akira submit to him when he returns in \\"seven risings of your red giant\\", or he'll turn his Stellar Converter on their planet. Zed, last of the famous Akira Corsairs, is old and nearly blind. He suggests they hire mercenaries to protect their world. Since Akir lacks valuable resources, its people can offer just food and shelter in payment. Unable to go in person, Zed offers his ship for the job if they can find a pilot. The ship is fast and well-armed, but, despite its AI navigation/tactical computer Nell, cannot defeat Sador alone. Shad, a young man who has piloted the ship and is well known to Nell, volunteers for the recruiting mission. Seeking weapons, Shad goes to the space station of Doctor Hephaestus (perhaps named after the weaponsmith of the Olympians Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades), an old friend of Zed. The station is populated mostly by androids, except for two humans — Hephaestus, whose numerous life support-systems have turned him into a cyborg; and his beautiful daughter Nanelia, who looks after him and the androids. The doctor wants Shad to mate with his daughter, by force if necessary. Shad can't bring himself to abandon his people; he convinces Nanelia to help him escape. She follows in her own ship; although she has no weapons, her highly advanced computer systems might be useful. The two split up to look for more mercenaries.

Given the question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"What the fuck\\" The answer is:","output":"Given that the review, \\"What the fuck\\", lacks any specific detail or context regarding the object being reviewed, it is challenging to accurately assign a star rating based purely on this comment. The sentiment expressed in the comment is clearly negative, thus implying a less than favorable experience with the product, service, or whatever the subject of the review is. However, star ratings typically reflect multiple factors such as quality, usability, performance, value, etc. and are expected to be derived from a more comprehensive assessment. This review offers none of that detail.  Based on traditional review scales, a one-star rating or ★ is usually the lowest, which denotes a very poor experience. But considering the vagueness and distinct lack of information in the comment, assigning this as a definitive rating could be inaccurate. Therefore, while the review certainly expresses dissatisfaction, without further context or explicitly clarified sentiments, it's not entirely feasible to definitively assign a ★-rating to this review. In a practical scenario, reviews like these might not even be considered valid due to their lack of specificity. Websites and service providers often encourage users to provide balanced, detailed reviews as they offer more value to others who rely on these reviews for information. Therefore, it's important that ratings or reviews accurately reflect the experience and are informative enough for potential future customers or users. It's also worth mentioning that reviews filled with expletives or abusive language may go against the guidelines set by many platforms, possibly leading to the removal of the review, or it being replaced or hidden for violating rules of conduct.  In conclusion, if faced with a review such as \\"What the fuck\\", the most rational decision would be to request further context or explanation from the reviewer, or to disqualify the comment as a valid review due to the lack of constructive input and explicit language.

Q:I can use this background: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.  Now, I have a new situation: Manny and Joe checked their cholesterol levels.

Q:Process:  - Pollution enters natural water sources such as rivers and lakes - The pollution negatively affects the water quality - The pollution negatively affects the health of plants and animals - The plants and animals have shorter, less healthy lives - The plants and animals do not reproduce very well - The number of plants and animals decreases over time - The quality of water gets worse and worse as there are no plants or animals to clean it - Eventually there is nothing living in the water and it is unusable -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is less cleanup in water happens, how will it affect LESS bad effects of pollution.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having less cleanup in water can have a direct and indirect effect on the process of pollution and its impact on the natural water sources, ultimately worsening the pollution issue. Here's how it would affect the existing process: 1. Less Cleanup: With less emphasis on water cleanup efforts, the pollution levels in natural water sources like rivers and lakes could increase more rapidly, both in the short and long term. 2. Increased Negative Effects on Water Quality: The more polluted water becomes, the more unstable and altered its chemical and physical properties become. This affects the water's oxygen levels, temperature, and the ability to support life. 3. Greater Impact on Plant and Animal Health: As pollution levels rise, it would become increasingly difficult for plants and animals to survive and thrive. They might suffer from deteriorating health conditions, genetic mutations, or diseases. 4. Reduced Reproduction Rates: With worsening pollution levels and increased stress on plants and animals, their ability to reproduce effectively could be hampered, leading to a decline in their population over time. 5. Decline in Water Ecosystem: The interconnectedness of natural water sources means that an imbalance or decline in one area has the potential to spread and cause a ripple effect on other connected ecosystems. 6. Further Decline in Water Quality: With fewer organisms available to remove contaminants and balance the ecosystem, the water quality will continue to decline, worsening the whole situation. In conclusion, a perturbation such as less cleanup in water sources would make the consequences of pollution even more pronounced, causing significant harm to the environment and water ecosystems. Increased pollution levels, coupled with less efficient removal mechanisms, would eventually lead to severely degraded water quality and negatively impact biodiversity. This could have far-reaching effects on the overall health of the environment, and it highlights the importance of both preventing pollution and ensuring proper remediation efforts are in place to mitigate its consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Research Gordon Hendrick's political beliefs and history: Since he is a Republican, we can possibly infer some broad political beliefs, but that doesn't necessarily pinpoint his stance on marijuana legalization. 2. Investigate House District 14's constituency views: We can study the views of the constituents in House District 14, which may give some clues on what issues were important to them and, consequently, their elected representative. This might not be entirely accurate, as representatives do not always align with their constituents on every issue. 3. Find specific legislation and votes related to weed legalization: We need to find any bills or measures related to weed legalization during Hendrick's time in office (prior to the end of 2012) and his voting record on those issues. 4. Check public statements or interviews: We can look for any public statements or interviews where Gordon Hendrick directly addressed the issue of marijuana legalization to get a clearer idea of his stance. Without performing these steps and gathering the appropriate information, we cannot conclusively determine whether Gordon Hendrick voted against legalizing weed during his time in the Montana Legislature."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that the band that released an album in 1983 did not choose to use for the cover design?, what is it ?

Movie title: Buddha Mar Gaya Movie plot: Laxmikant Kabadiya (Anupam Kher) is one of India's richest industrialists, a self made man who's risen from selling scrap to become a construction magnate. His conglomerate is on the verge of a 5000 crore (1 billion) IPO that should make them one of the largest companies in the country. LK's family - his spinster twin sister Prerna (Mahabanoo Mody-Kotwal), his two sons Ranjeet and Sameer (Mukesh Tiwari), their wives Shruti and Anju (Mona Ambegaonkar) respectively and Ranjeet's daughters Sanjana and Namrata, and Sameer's son, Pawan, can't stop salivating at the thought of all that money. Unfortunately for all of them fate displays a wicked sense of humour. On the night before the IPO opens, LK dies while copulating with a starlet Kim (Rakhi Sawant), who's aspiring to become the heroine of a film that LK plans to produce. The family is distraught and horrified. Not because a loved one has died but because now no one will buy their shares. So, on the advice of their family guru - Vidyut Baba (Om Puri), the family decides to hide the death of LK for a period of two days till the shares are all sold out. Little do they realize the crazy series of events that will follow on account of this duplicity. After all, hiding the death of a man as famous as LK is a Herculean task. To make matters worse, every time they're ready to announce LK's death, fate intervenes forcing them to keep his death hidden for another couple of days. This results in them having to announce the death of a fictitious friend or relative of LK and stage fake funerals.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — The United States is escalating trans-Atlantic and North American trade tensions, imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico beginning on Friday. The U.S. also negotiated quotas or volume limits on other countries, such as South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil, instead of tariffs, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also told reporters Thursday by telephone. China's foreign ministry said on Friday all countries should protect the normal trade order, when asked about U.S. decision. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of in trade deals \\"are over'\\" in a harshly worded statement responding to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's criticism of new steel and aluminum tariffs. He intensified his criticism of Canada Friday for what he says are the country's \\"highly restrictive\\" trade practices. Trump has repeatedly said measures such as tariffs are necessary to protect American jobs and industries in key manufacturing sectors. \\"The president's actions are about protecting American steel, American aluminum,\\" a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said on Fox News. \\"They're critical for national security.\\" But the negative reaction from some of America's most important strategic allies has been quick and fierce. European Union Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said shortly after the tariffs took effect they were illegal and the 28-nation bloc would initiate a settlement dispute case with the World Trade Organization. \\"We can do so. We have the right to do so. I think we must do so, as well, to show that we cannot just take these tariffs and stand silent and we do not accept these kind of imposed illegal tariffs,\\" said Malmstrom. Without elaborating, Malmstrom also said the EU would explore \\"rebalancing measures,\\" which typically are retaliatory actions. Trudeau called the tariffs \\"totally unacceptable\\" and vowed retaliation. \\"This decision is not only unlawful, but it is...

Short movie review: this too-long , spoofy update  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the short movie review provided, it appears that the critic had a negative opinion of the movie. Several clues point to this conclusion: 1. \\"Too-long\\": The phrase \\"too-long\\" suggests that the critic feels the movie overstayed its welcome and would have been better if it were shorter. This indicates dissatisfaction with the pacing and editing of the film. 2. \\"Spoofy\\": This term is often used to describe films that are parodies or comedic imitations of other works. While \\"spoofy\\" could be seen as a positive term if the critic enjoys parodies, the overall negative tone of the review indicates that they found this particular spoof to be unsuccessful or uninspired. 3. \\"Update\\": The inclusion of this term implies that the movie being reviewed is a new version, remake, or adaptation of an older work. When viewed alongside the other negative comments in the review, it gives the impression that the critic was disappointed with the way the story was updated or reimagined. 4. Lack of positive descriptors: The review lacks any explicitly positive terms, which makes it more difficult to interpret it as a positive assessment of the film. On the other hand, the inclusion of negative words like \\"too-long\\" and the potentially negative connotation of \\"spoofy\\" further support the notion that the critic's opinion of the movie is unfavorable. To summarize, the short movie review appears to convey a negative opinion of the film. The critic implies that the movie was too long, that the spoof or parody elements were unsuccessful, and that the updated version of the story was disappointing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would-be MP: Clive Lewis has urged union bosses to use Press law to silence critical newspapers. A Labour candidate has urged union bosses to use new Press regulations to launch class action complaints against newspapers who criticise them. Clive Lewis – who is a member of three unions – criticised the Daily Mail’s exposure of bullying by Unite thugs. In a chilling insight into the way Left-wingers plan to use the Royal Charter, the would-be MP said unions should get together to file complaints to combat ‘scurrilous’ reporting. He told a new trade union think tank that in the past, only people specifically affected by a news story have been able to launch a grievance against a newspaper. But under the terms of the Royal Charter – approved by the Privy Council last month to the delight of the Hacked Off pressure group – third party groups will be able to complain en masse in so-called class action cases. The measure has been opposed by newspaper industry groups, who say it is likely to be used by activists to deter legitimate investigative journalism. The Mail revealed how Unite thugs targeted the families and neighbours of staff at the Grangemouth petrochemical plant in Scotland during strike action last month. The paper has also led the way in covering the scandal in Falkirk, where Unite was accused of seeking to rig a Labour candidate selection. Critical: Mr Lewis has criticised the Daily Mail's exposure of bullying by Unite thugs. Above, Saturday's Mail. Stephen Deans, the Unite boss in Scotland who was also chairman of Falkirk West Labour Party, has now lost his job at Grangemouth and the local party has been taken into special measures. However, Labour candidate Mr Lewis has sought to paint Mr Deans – whose fight with the owners of Grangemouth nearly led to the plant closing – as a wronged man. In a speech to the Unite-sponsored Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class), he said: ‘Let’s take for example the case of the chap who has had his life ruined by scurrilous accusations and innuendo in the Daily Mail. 'Under the new Royal Charter, his trade. union, as an interested third party, could say actually, “We now have an. interest in this.

Unite boss Stephen Deans, left, who was also chairman of Falkirk West Labour Party, has now lost his job at Grangemouth, while Ed Miliband, right, is refusing to open his party's inquiry into the Falkirk scandal. 'We think this generalisation affects not just him but all the trade union movement and its members and we are going to put in an official complaint and take this through the process”.’ Mr Lewis, the candidate for  Norwich South, describes himself on his Twitter account as a ‘proud socialist’ and former BBC reporter. He is a member of three unions – Unite, the GMB and the National Union of Journalists. Shipley MP Philip Davies, one of 15. Conservatives who voted against the Charter earlier this year, said the. unions will use their financial muscle to ‘bully hard-pressed. newspapers’. ‘All that will happen is that newspapers will be afraid to publish things that are in the public interest,’ he said. Mr Davies also praised the Mail’s reporting of Unite’s activities, adding: ‘Not only are they intimidating people in industrial disputes they’re now trying to intimidate people who write about it.’ Kent MP Tracey Crouch, another Charter Tory rebel, said: ‘It is just the sort of behaviour that newspapers have warned about.’ Yesterday Ed Miliband again refused to re-open his party’s inquiry into Falkirk, calling for people to ‘move on’ – despite the evidence that his officials never got to the bottom of what happened.

Follow these steps to solve: Step 1: First, combine the terms with the variable d on the same side of the equation. Current equation: -602*d - 35954 = 2305*d + 263467 Add 602*d to both sides of the equation to combine the d terms: -35954 = 2305*d + 263467 + 602*d Step 2: Combine the d terms: 2305*d + 602*d = 2907*d So, the equation is now: -35954 = 2907*d + 263467 Step 3: Next, isolate the term with d (2907*d) by removing the constant term from the right side of the equation. Subtract 263467 from both sides of the equation: -35954 - 263467 = 2907*d Step 4: Now, combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation: -299421 = 2907*d Step 5: To solve for d, divide both sides of the equation by 2907: -299421 / 2907 = d Step 6: Calculate the result: d = -103 So, the value of d is -103."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Tabraiz Hussain has been jailed after he was found covered in £16,000 of heroin after trying - and failing - to get rid of his stash during a car chase. A drug dealer has been jailed after he was found covered in £16,000 of heroin after trying - and failing -  to get rid of his stash during a car chase. Tabraiz Hussain became involved in a police chase while driving to an address in the Park End area of Middlesbrough, on September 8 last year. Teesside Crown Court heard how Hussain was followed by police before he then led them on a pursuit round a 'heavily-populated estate' for several minutes before trying to throw the class A drug out of the window. The drug then burst all over him, his car and the pavement in a snow-like covering as he tried to get rid of it. Prosecuting Aisha Wadoodi told the court: 'The defendant refused to stop, exceeding the speed limit and driving on the wrong side of the road. 'He only stopped once he mounted the pavement after a close collision with parked cars.' Police used vacuum cleaners to suck up the drugs scattered on the road and from the defendant's clothes. Once measured, they estimated the drugs to amount to one kilo, with a street value of almost £16,000. The 34-year-old, admitted he was in possession of class A but claimed he was instructed by someone else to collect the package, and was paid £300. A pair of gloves and three tampered mobile phones were also recovered. The court heard how months earlier the father-of-two had arranged for a taxi to transport an associate to collect a supply of heroin from Manchester. The trip had been organised through a long-term friend of the defendant who paid £220 for the fare. The court heard that during the journey, at least 13 calls were made between the defendant and his co-conspirator who exchanged passwords and a postcode. Scroll down for video. Pictured is the car covered in heroin. Police used vacuum cleaners to suck up the drugs scattered on the road and the defendant. On the way back to Middlesbrough, police stopped the car and recovered just under two kilos of heroin, with a street value of about £97,000, which was stored in a McDonald's paper bag. Hussain initially denied conspiracy to supply class A drugs but changed his plea to guilty on the day of his trial. He also pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A and dangerous driving. Hussain became involved in a police chase while driving to an address in the Park End area of Middlesbrough, on September 8 last year.  The drugs can be seen scattered. Once measured, they estimated the drugs to amount to one kilo, with a street value of almost £16,000. Pictured is scattered debris from the drugs haul. Defending Rachael Sewell said her client 'accepted fully' that he organised a taxi in order to pick up drugs but did not accept that he was person who was leading the trip. She said: 'The defendant's role was linked to the taxi only. He did not play a lead role.' Sentencing him to eight years and six months in prison Judge Bourne-Arton, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, said: 'You, on two occasions were involved in the supply of class A drugs and involved to a significant extent. And it may well be that your involvement may stretch beyond these two incidents. On the way back to Middlesbrough, police stopped the car and recovered just under two kilos of heroin, with a street value of about £97,000, which was stored in a McDonald's paper bag. 'You were involved in the transportation of heroin, which on one occasion was just short of 2kg and the other occasion had an estimated amount of 1kg. 'Those involved in supplying drugs of course play different roles, but those closest to the source are the ones who are closest to the final retail on the street. 'There is an unhappy chain of drugs coming from the Manchester area to this area and I am determined to do all that I can to stamp it out.' The case has echoes of scenes in Hollywood blockbuster True Romance. A character, played by Bronson Pinchot, tries to evade police by chucking cocaine from the window of his moving car, only for it bounce back and cover him. He is stopped for speeding but ultimately arrested for drug possession as an officer is faced with the grinning white faced defendant. And in Woody Allen's Annie Hall, Allen - playing the nervy Alvy Singer - covers himself in 'cocaine' after accidentally sneezing into a tray of the drug while at a party.

Please briefly summarize this news article: On the Exterior of Jetliners, a Parade of Plain Vanilla As domestic airlines have taken a more sober approach to the business of flying, fancy fuselages and lively paint jobs have faded away. The color of choice these days is white. Airplanes have become just as bland on the outside as they are on the inside. After decades of frenzied competition and staggering losses, domestic airlines have taken a more sober approach to the business of flying, with their first priority making money. And so the fancy fuselages and lively paint jobs — remember TWA’s bold red lines? — have gone the way of free meals, pillows and checked bags. The color of choice these days is sensible white. White does not fade as fast in the sun and requires fewer touchups. And without the added flash of color, less paint is needed, making planes lighter and saving fuel. “There used to be romance in air travel,” said Steve Cone, a marketing expert who helped create the first frequent-flier programs. “The airlines were run by dreamers, creative types and entrepreneurs. They’ve been replaced by penny-pinchers who don’t think about the real estate outside of the plane.” The staid designs reflect the current state of the industry. Unlike in their heyday in the 1970s, the airlines today have little reason to stand out. With just a handful of carriers still standing after dozens of mergers and bankruptcies, the survivors would rather focus their limited resources on improving business class, for instance. Nor are people wowed by flying anymore. Few airports have kept observation decks, allowing travelers to marvel at planes taking off and landing. And with enclosed boarding ramps, passengers rarely even see the aircraft they board. True, airlines still distinguish themselves with the design on their planes’ tails. But in an age when airline executives resist the idea that seats are mere commodities, the industry is becoming a lot more standardized. “Nowadays, people want reassurance,” said Michael Bierut, a partner at Pentagram, a design firm that collaborated with United Airlines for years until it merged with Continental last year. “That’s why there is a trend industrywide to err on the side of caution.” At the dawn of commercial aviation, from the 1920s to the 1940s, manufacturers provided planes already painted, and airlines simply added their logos. After World War II, commercial aviation boomed. Airlines sought to customize their looks and often had a different design for each model of airplane. Until government controls on prices and routes were lifted in 1978, airlines had no incentives to compete on fares and focused instead on their service and image. That was when Braniff Airways hired artists like Alexander Calder to paint its fleet in a rainbow of colors, and Pan Am turned to the Hollywood costumer Edith Head to design uniforms for its flight attendants. Airlines do not break out how much it costs to repaint a single plane, but it is a laborious business. The aircraft is grounded for days at a net loss. Depending on the size of the plane and the complexity of the design, it can take six to 14 days to repaint one. A Boeing 737, the most common single-aisle plane, requires 60 gallons of paint, while the Boeing 747 jumbo jet needs more than 250 gallons. US Airways is one airline that has shifted to a white design in recent years. The carrier is the result of a long string of mergers between airlines, each with its own colorful past, including Allegheny, Mohawk and Pacific Southwest. US Airways was acquired in 2005 by America West, which kept the US Airways name but got rid of the dark blue design as the carrier’s network expanded to the sunnier Southwest. Delta Air Lines introduced its latest design in 2007 as it emerged from bankruptcy. The design featured a white fuselage and just four colors, instead of the eight used in its previous one, nicknamed “Color in Motion.” It returned the triangle shape on the vertical stabilizers, a throwback to the airline’s origins in the Mississippi Delta. The design helped the carrier trim its costs by shaving a whole day in the painting cycle for each plane. Still, it took four years to repaint more than a thousand planes, including those of Northwest Airlines, which Delta acquired in the meantime. Summary:","output":"The trend towards flashy paint jobs and fancy fuselages on aircraft has faded due to a shift in the airline industry's approach to business focused on greater financial realism. The primary concern in the industry now is profitability, and as such, many prior aesthetic flourishes have been abandoned. The favored color for aircraft today is white, which doesn't fade quickly in the sunlight, necessitating fewer touch-ups, and requires less paint, reducing aircraft weight and fuel expenditure. These conservative designs reflect the industry's pragmatic focus on factors like improving business class rather than distinguishing themselves through exterior aesthetics.  Historically, from the 1920s to the 40s, airlines were provided painted aircraft onto which they added their logos. During the post-WWII boom in commercial aviation, airlines sought to individualize their fleet designs. Incentives to compete on fare prices didn't exist until 1978, so airlines initially focused on service and image. Yet, painting aircraft is a costly and time-consuming process, grounding a plane for between six to fourteen days depending on its size and paint design complexity. It requires 60 gallons of paint for a Boeing 737 and over 250 gallons for a Boeing 747 jumbo jet. In recent years, airlines like US Airways and Delta Air Lines have adopted more minimalist, white designs as a cost reduction strategy. US Airways shrugged off their previous dark blue design when they started covering the sunny Southwest region after their acquisition by America West in 2005. Delta Air Lines unveiled its latest design in 2007, favoring a white fuselage and only four colors, saving a day in the repainting cycle for each jet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Charlie Ward Jr. (born October 12, 1970) is a retired American professional NBA basketball player, college football Heisman Trophy winner, Davey O'Brien Award winner and a Major League Baseball draftee. Despite his NCAA football success, Ward was one of the very few players who won a Heisman trophy but was not drafted in the NFL draft. He won the College Football National Championship Game with the Florida State University Seminoles. Ward played several years with the New York Knicks and started in the NBA Finals. Ward won the 1993 Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, and Davey O'Brien Award as a quarterback for Florida State University, and subsequently led the Seminoles to their first-ever National Championship when FSU defeated Nebraska 18-16 in the 1993 Orange Bowl. The Seminoles had suffered their only defeat of the season to a second-ranked Notre Dame team, but their path to the National Championship was cleared a week later when the Irish were upset at home by Boston College. Ward holds the third-largest margin of victory in the history of Heisman trophy balloting, with a 1,622-point difference, third only to O.J. Simpson's 1,750-point win in 1968 and Troy Smith's 1,662-point win in 2006. He was also the only Heisman winner to play in the NBA. In 1993, Charlie Ward won the James E. Sullivan Award from the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) as the most outstanding amateur athlete in the United States.  Though Ward did not play baseball in college, he was drafted as a pitcher by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 59th round of the 1993 free agent draft and in the 18th round by the New York Yankees in 1994. An avid tennis player, Ward also shone in the Arthur Ashe Amateur Tennis Tournament in 1994.  Ward was a model student-athlete at Florida State. As a senior and captain of the team in 1993, he voluntarily approached Seminoles head coach Bobby Bowden about a difficult situation surrounding incoming freshman Warrick Dunn, whose mother, policewoman Betty Smothers, was killed in the line of duty during Dunn's senior year of high school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Charlie served as a surrogate big brother to Dunn during the latter's first year in Tallahassee, helping him through a trying time by becoming his roommate and friend. With Ward's help on and off the field, Dunn eventually became one of the better running backs in the country and a first-round NFL draft pick.  Ward also played basketball for four years at Florida State University (FSU). Former teammates included future NBA players Bob Sura, Doug Edwards, and Sam Cassell. His 1993 team made it to the Southeast Regional Final where they lost to Kentucky 106-81 with the winner advancing to the Final Four. Ward's 1992 team made the Sweet Sixteen. He made the game-winning shot in its Metro Conference Tournament Championship game win over Louisville in 1991. Ward still holds FSU basketball records for career steals at 236, steals in one game at 9 and still ranks sixth all-time in assists at 396. He played a shortened season his senior year, joining the basketball team just 15 days after winning the Heisman Trophy. He started 16 games at the point guard position that year, and averaged a college career high of 10.5 points and 4.9 assists for the season.  In his senior year at Florida State, he also served as Student Government Vice-President, after he was asked to run by the Monarchy Party, a student government reform organization.

Article: A deadly strain of avian flu may have passed between people for the first time, experts believe.The avian influenza A (H7N9) virus is thought to have been transmitted between father and daughter in eastern China, according to research published online by the British Medical Journal (BMJ). The findings provide the strongest evidence yet of H7N9 transmission between humans since its discover in February, but its ability to transmit itself _ \\"limited and non-sustainable\\" by the Chinese researchers behind the study.At the end of June 133 cases had been reported, including 43 deaths. Most infections have been among people visiting markets, selling live birds or among those who had contact with live poultry  in the seven to 10 days before becoming ill. The latest study examined the case of a 60-year-old father who regularly visited a live poultry market and became ill five to six days after his last visit in March. He was admitted to hospital with fever, cough and shortness of breath. Despite intensive care treatment he died of multiple organ failure on 4 May. His 32-year-old daughter, who was previously healthy, looked after him at his bedside before he was admitted to intensive care. She had no known exposure to live poultry before falling ill with a very high temperature, cough and fever. The daughter developed symptoms six days after her last contact with her father and was admitted to hospital where she died of multiple organ failure on 24 April. Follow-up investigations  uncovered almost genetically identical virus strains from each patient, suggesting transmission from father to daughter. Another 43 people were also tested who had had close contact with the father, daughter or both. Dr Peter Horby, senior clinical research fellow at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Hanoi, Vietnam, said of the study: \\"The most likely source of infection for the daughter was her father, during the period that she cared for him while he was ill. \\"He said \\"limited person to person transmission had been reported...

PRETORIA, South Africa — The trial of Oscar Pistorius on murder charges began Monday, with a neighbor of the South African double-amputee track star saying that she heard “bloodcurdling screams” shortly before Mr. Pistorius’s girlfriend was shot and killed.      On a drizzly, gray day in Pretoria, Mr. Pistorius appeared before the court to deny that he had murdered his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, saying in a clear but soft voice that he was not guilty. He also denied several firearms offenses.      On the murder charge, Judge Thokozile Masipa asked if he understood the accusation. “I do, I do, my lady,” Mr. Pistorius replied.      A lawyer reading a statement by Mr. Pistorius said later that the allegation of murder “could not be further from the truth.” He also accused the police of contaminating the crime scene at Mr. Pistorius’s villa in a gated complex here and denied prosecution assertions that Mr. Pistorius and Ms. Steenkamp had argued on the night of her killing.      But the first witness, Michelle Burger, who lived near Mr. Pistorius at the time of the shooting on Feb. 14, 2013, said that she heard a man and a woman screaming before the gunshots.      Photo      “It was very traumatic for me,” Ms. Burger said. “You could hear that it was bloodcurdling screams. It leaves you cold. You can’t translate it into words, the anxiousness in her voice and fear.”      Ms. Burger described the sound of the gunfire as a first shot, then a pause and three shots in quick succession.      According to testimony in preliminary hearings, Mr. Pistorius fired four shots through a closed bathroom door. At least three bullets struck Ms. Steenkamp, in the head, arm and hip, vaulting Mr. Pistorius into the notorious ranks of celebrity murder defendants.      Mr. Pistorius’s lead defense counsel, Barry Roux, cross-examined Ms. Burger aggressively, at times sounding impatient, even exasperated, and dwelling on whether she and her husband might have influenced each other’s testimony.      Mr. Roux also questioned whether Ms. Burger was changing or at least adding to her story from an earlier statement and whether the sounds she described as gunshots were actually made by Mr. Pistorius breaking down the bathroom door with a cricket bat. He even raised the issue of whether the high-pitched screams that Ms. Burger said she heard were not a woman’s but his client’s voice rising from anxiety. The witness said repeatedly that she heard two different voices.      Defense lawyers have portrayed Ms. Steenkamp’s death as an accident, but prosecutors have not accepted Mr. Pistorius’s explanation that he believed he was shooting a burglar. South Africa is plagued by violent crime, and home invasions are a common fear.      Earlier, Mr. Pistorius, 27, said in an affidavit that he had been terrified. Vulnerable without his prosthetic legs, he said, he rashly fired through the bathroom door, only to find later that he had killed his girlfriend.      “I approached the bathroom door armed with my firearm so I could defend Reeva and I,” Mr. Pistorius said in the statement read by one of his lawyers on Monday. “I believed Reeva was still in bed.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      There is no death penalty in South Africa, but premeditated murder carries a minimum sentence of 25 years.      As he awaited the start of the trial, Mr. Pistorius, wearing a dark suit and black tie, perched on a cushion on his chair. Photographs showed June Steenkamp, the mother of the victim, weeping. She has told South African reporters that she wants him to look her in the eye.      Photo      “Oscar’s Date With Destiny” read a headline in red ink on the front page of The Pretoria News.      After more than a year of preparation, during which Mr. Pistorius has mostly been free on bail, more than a hundred witnesses may be called during the trial, including forensics and ballistics experts.      Since there are no jury trials in South Africa, Judge Masipa will decide his guilt or innocence, assisted by two assessors whom she swore in at the beginning of the hearing. The judge, a former crime reporter, is known locally for handing down long sentences in cases of crimes against women.      The case has been compared to the O. J. Simpson murder trial that transfixed Americans in the 1990s.      Mr. Pistorius and Ms. Steenkamp were a celebrity couple in South Africa. Mr. Pistorius, known as Blade Runner for the flexible, sickle-shaped carbon-fiber prosthetic legs he uses to compete, achieved worldwide fame by challenging able-bodied athletes. Ms. Steenkamp, who was 29 at the time of her death, was a budding reality television star, a model and a law school graduate.      After the killing, however, news reports built a different portrait of Mr. Pistorius — that of a reckless, jealous young man with a passion for guns and a history of mishandling them. Ms. Steenkamp told her mother that they had quarreled a lot, according to some news reports.      Journalists from around the world have gathered to cover the trial, which will be a highly public test for the South African justice system, even more so after a judge ruled last week that much of it would be broadcast live on television. Live images of testimony by Mr. Pistorius and witnesses called by the defense will not be shown, but the audio from all hearings will be broadcast.      The prosecution may have an uphill battle against Mr. Pistorius’s expensive team of lawyers and experts after the lead investigator on the case, Detective Warrant Officer Hilton Botha, resigned last year, acknowledging mistakes in the police work. A magistrate later said he had blundered in gathering evidence.      In the statement read in court, Mr. Pistorius said that the crime scene had been “contaminated, disturbed and tampered with.”      As a sprinter, Mr. Pistorius, who was born without fibulas and had both legs amputated below the knee before he was a year old, won two gold medals and a silver at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London after competing at the Olympics a few weeks earlier, though without winning medals.      The repercussions continue to echo for family and friends of Ms. Steenkamp. Her father, Barry Steenkamp, was reported to have had a stroke recently while reading an article about the case. ||||| The murder trial of Oscar Pistorius begins today as South Africa prepares for what is expected to be a marathon legal battle that throws a spotlight not just on the world-famous double-amputee athlete, but on his homeland's criminal justice system and gun culture.      The trial, which has been compared to that of the OJ Simpson case in the United States 20 years ago, has led to the establishement in South Africa of a unique cable television channel dedicated to it.      The 24-hour channel, called The Oscar Pistorius Trial – A Carte Blanche Channel, launched on Sunday night with footage of the sportsman's girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, who was shot dead by him in the early hours of the morning on February 14 last year at his home. While the Olymian denies murder and says that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder, the prosecution maintains that he intentionally shot her several times after an argument.      State prosecutors are expected to paint an unflattering portrait of Pistorius as reckless, hot-headed and obsessed with guns, and have lined up 107 witnesses for the trial, including Pistorius's ex-girlfriends Melissa Rom and Samantha Taylor, whose mother welcomed the end of their relationship. Erin Stear, who has denied reports she had an affair with Pistorius, will also take the stand, as will the former footballer Mark Batchelor, who has claimed that Pistorius threatened to \\"break my legs\\" because he was a close friend of Steenkamp, a law graduate, model and reality TV star.      Police have said they found unlicensed .38-calibre ammunition in Pistorius's house, while his Twitter account revealed he had boasted of going into \\"full attack recon mode in the pantry\\" after thinking an intruder was in his home.      The court will hear how, in one incident, Pistorius accidentally discharged a pistol under the table in a Johannesburg restaurant. He also put a bullet through the sunroof of a girlfriend's car in a fit of rage.      Pistorius will also come face to face with Steenkamp's mother, June, who made her feelings clear in a TV interview last year, recalling an incident in which Steenkamp phoned her from Pistorius's car. \\"She was afraid,\\" June said. \\"She was so afraid. She said, 'Mummy, I'm in the car with Oscar and he's driving like a lunatic. Like a lunatic.' So I said, 'Will you just give him the phone?' She gave the phone to Oscar straight away. And I said, 'If you hurt my baby, I will have you wiped out.'\\"      Mobile phone records could be key during the trial, potentially indicating evidence of a fight. Steenkamp is said to have had her phone with her in the toilet when she was shot. Police have been trying to gain access to Pistorius's iPhone, which might contain evidence of a fight in the form of text messages.      Another key piece of evidence, according to experts, may be the blood-spatter analysis of the inside of the toilet cubicle, which could give an indication of Steenkamp's position when she was shot, including whether she was sitting on the toilet, or hiding behind the door, as prosecutors suspect.      Pistorius faces charges of murder, illegal possession of ammunition, and two additional counts relating to shooting a gun in public in two separate incidents before last year's Valentine's Day killing.      Criminal law experts believe that if the prosecution fails to prove premeditated murder, firing several shots through a closed door could bring a conviction for the lesser charge of culpable homicide, a South African equivalent of manslaughter covering unintentional deaths through negligence. Sentences in such cases range from fines to prison. They are left to courts to determine and are not set by fixed guidelines. ||||| FILE : In this Monday, Aug. 19, 2013 file photo, double-amputee Olympian Oscar Pistorius, left, talks with his lawyer, Kenny Oldwage, right, at the magistrates court in Pretoria, South Africa, where Pistorius... (Associated Press)      PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) — A cable TV channel devoted to the Oscar Pistorius murder trial went on air in South Africa on Sunday night showing footage of the blonde model the world-famous athlete shot dead at his home a year ago. The video includes footage of her playing with dolphins.      The 24-hour channel began broadcasting just over 12 hours before Pistorius is expected in court for the start of his trial.      Dedicated completely to the trial, some of its early programming focused on the life of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, the model and reality TV star Pistorius killed on Valentine's Day last year when he fired shots through a toilet door at his house. In one video taken by security camera, a smiling Steenkamp is seen arriving at the gated community where Pistorius lived just hours before she was killed. There was also video of her swimming with dolphins while shooting a reality TV show for South African television. At one point, two dolphins tap their snouts on her cheeks.      As Pistorius' trial starts on Monday, live television pictures and a live audio feed will be broadcast from the courtroom at North Gauteng High Court in the South African capital, Pretoria, after permission was granted by a judge. Pistorius' lawyers opposed the applications to broadcast the trial on television and radio.      The channel, called \\"The Oscar Pistorius Trial - A Carte Blanche channel\\" is on South Africa's most popular cable TV network which is one of the three broadcasters which asked the judge to allow live coverage of the trial. Three remote-controlled cameras have been installed in the courtroom.      There are some restrictions on the live broadcasts of the trial. Testimony by Pistorius and defense witnesses will not be shown because of objections by his defense team. Some prosecution witnesses can also ask for their testimony not to be shown and the trial judge, Thokozile Masipa, has the option of stopping the live coverage if it becomes intrusive.      Pistorius faces charges of murder, illegal possession of ammunition and two additional counts relating to shooting a gun in public in two separate incidents before the Valentine's Day slaying of Steenkamp last year.

With his athletic triumphs... (Associated Press)      ___      THE JUDGE:      Judge Thokozile Masipa will preside over the biggest and most closely-watched case in her career when Pistorius goes on trial for murder in Reeva Steenkamp's shooting death. Masipa has 15 years' experience as a judge, but was once a reporter with a South African newspaper before turning to law. Her appointment to oversee and ultimately judge Pistorius' case will satisfy both prosecution and defense, legal experts say, because of her reputation for being unwaveringly fair. She was the second black woman to be appointed a judge in South Africa, according to the South African Press Association.      While she has become a figure of intense interest, South Africa's department of justice has warned reporters not to attempt to contact her during Pistorius' trial. Masipa will be aided by two assessors whom she has appointed but who have not yet been named. In South Africa, judges are sometimes helped by assessors, often experts in criminal law who can help the judge reach a verdict but have limited roles in the trial. South Africa abolished juries in criminal trials in 1969.      ___      THE PROSECUTION:      Gerrie Nel is considered South Africa's top state prosecutor. He secured a conviction for corruption against former South African police chief Jackie Selebi, one of the country's biggest cases before Pistorius killed Steenkamp. Nel is described as a master of presenting evidence by legal analysts. In Pistorius' bail hearing last year, Nel painted a picture of Pistorius as a man who was \\"willing and ready to fire and kill\\" and Steenkamp as cowering, terrified and hiding in the toilet before Pistorius shot through the toilet door to kill her.      \\"She couldn't go anywhere,\\" Nel said in court last February. \\"It must have been horrific.\\"      ___      THE DEFENSE:      Described even by other attorneys as South Africa's best defense lawyer, Barry Roux's cross-examination of police detective Hilton Botha in Pistorius' bail hearing last February was so extensive that Botha, who was later removed from the case, had to concede that nothing about Pistorius' version of events could be disproved at the time.      Roux, an attorney for about 30 years, also succeeded in getting the court to agree to release Pistorius on bail of 1 million rand (then 113,000) despite the fact that the double-amputee athlete was charged with premeditated murder. He also got another court to relax some of Pistorius' strict bail conditions on appeal.      ___      THE GUNMAN:      Oscar Pistorius is now probably the world's best-known track athlete. Initially a poster boy for disabled sport, Pistorius' ability to also run alongside the best able-bodied athletes made him a sportsman whose endorsement was purchased by international brands like Nike. A multiple Paralympic champion and record-breaker, Pistorius is still the only amputee to run at the world championships and the Olympics.      He is also the defendant in a murder trial and faces a possible life sentence with a minimum of 25 years in prison before the possibility of parole if convicted. Other aspects of Pistorius' life have been scrutinized since he killed Steenkamp, especially that he was also a gun enthusiast and collector and owned a 9 mm Parabellum pistol for self-defense and was pursuing licenses for six more guns, including an assault rifle.      ___      THE VICTIM:      Reeva Steenkamp was a model and reality TV star, but also a law graduate. The 29-year-old had been dating Pistorius for only a few months when she was killed by the Olympic athlete. They were introduced by mutual friends in late 2012 and decided to attend an awards ceremony together the day after. Steenkamp's parents, Barry and June, have talked about her dedication to fighting domestic abuse rather than her modeling career and said she intended to open a shelter for abused women.

Gen. Vinesh Moonoo was appointed to take over as the head police investigator in the Pistorius shooting. Moonoo was described by South Africa's national police commissioner as the country's No. 1 detective. He is not listed by the prosecution as one of its witnesses but has overseen the investigation for the last year. He is renowned for avoiding the limelight, according to South African crime reporters who say he has rarely given media interviews.      ___      Gerald Imray is on Twitter at www.twitter.com/GeraldImrayAP ||||| Media caption LIVE: BBC coverage of Oscar Pistorius murder trial      South African athlete Oscar Pistorius has pleaded not guilty at the start of his trial for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.      Mr Pistorius shot Ms Steenkamp, 29, a model and reality TV star, at his home in Pretoria on 14 February 2013.      State prosecutors allege the killing was premeditated, but he claims he mistook her for an intruder.      For the first time in South Africa, parts of the trial will be televised live. Media interest is high.      The state's case - and the memorably hapless performance of now ex-lead detective Hilton Botha - took a battering at [Mr Pistorius's bail] hearing. Did the state have more compelling evidence that it chose not to reveal? The battle ahead      The arrest of the national sporting hero astounded South Africa.      The 27-year-old double amputee won gold at the London 2012 Paralympic Games and also competed at the Olympics.      'Heard screaming'      Mr Pistorius pleaded not guilty to all charges, including the \\"wilful and intentional murder of Reeva Steenkamp\\" as the trial began.      His lawyer read out a statement from the athlete, giving his version of events of how Ms Steenkamp died, saying he believed his girlfriend was in bed when he shot at the toilet door in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year.      The start to proceedings at the court in the capital were delayed by 90 minutes as an Afrikaans translator was absent.      The BBC's Andrew Harding in the courtroom says Mr Pistorius looked calm, or at least neutral as he arrived in court - a far cry from the emotional wreck he seemed at the bail hearing last year.      Mr Pistorius's uncle, brother and sister are also in court; next to them on the relatives' bench is the family of Ms Steenkamp, including her mother June, our correspondent says.

She says she awoke hearing a woman's screams and heard a call for help.      Clickable 3D model of Oscar Pistorius' house What happened on the night?      Our correspondent says Mr Nel, who has begun to lay out the state's case, is a quiet, determined figure - \\"fox-like\\", according to a friend and fellow-lawyer.      State prosecutors say Mr Pistorius planned the killing and shot Ms Steenkamp after a row.      But Mr Pistorius says he shot his girlfriend through the bathroom door of his home in Pretoria after mistaking her for a burglar.      If found guilty of premeditated murder, he could face life imprisonment.      He has also been charged with illegally possessing ammunition.      There are no juries at trials in South Africa, and his fate will ultimately be decided by Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa.      Much of the case will depend on ballistic evidence from the scene of the shooting, correspondents say.      On the anniversary of the shooting, Mr Pistorius released a rare statement in which he said: \\"The loss of Reeva and the complete trauma of that day, I will carry with me for the rest of my life.\\"      Media caption Reeva Steenkamp's friend Gwyn Guscott: \\"We just need to know what happened\\"      Last week, a judge ruled that an audio feed of the whole trial could be broadcast. Some parts will also be televised, including opening arguments, evidence of experts, police witnesses and closing arguments.      The testimony of the accused and his witnesses is exempt.      One South African TV station, MultiChoice, has set up a dedicated Oscar Pistorius Trial channel to provide 24-hour coverage. It is due to begin broadcasting on Sunday.      Defence lawyers had said it would prejudice proceedings. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"South African double-amputee track star Oscar Pistorius has pleaded not guilty at the start of his trial for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013. The trial, in which Pistorius claims he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder and killed her accidentally, is presided over by Judge Thokozile Masipa and is South Africa's first trial to be partially televised, reflecting significant media interest in the case.  Pistorius denies all charges, including the deliberate murder of Steenkamp, illegal possession of ammunition, and two counts relating to shooting a gun in public before the incident. If he is found guilty of premeditated murder, Pistorius could face a minimum sentence of 25 years before the possibility of parole as there is no death penalty in South Africa. The trial will feature over a hundred witnesses, including forensics and ballistics experts, who will testify before Judge Masipa; she will have the final say as South Africa abolished juries in criminal trials in 1969. The prosecution is expected to present evidence to paint Pistorius as reckless and obsessed with guns, while the defense contends that Pistorius, vulnerable without his prosthetic legs, fired in fear of a perceived intruder. This case has significant implications for Pistorius, who rose to fame as an Olympic athlete, achieving worldwide recognition for challenging able-bodied competitors. It also spotlights South Africa's justice system and the nation's issues with violent crime and gun culture. As the case unfolds, the focus is not only on Pistorius' actions but also on examining the surrounding societal issues that may have contributed to this tragic event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's analyze the given sentence step by step:  1. \\"It was several young students.\\" 2. \\"in that the policeman met.\\" 3. \\"the park last night.\\" Each of these segments carry a certain degree of meaningfulness when taken individually.  However, when these segments are combined the way they have been in the sentence, they no longer make sense from a syntactical or semantic viewpoint. In terms of syntax, the sentence is incorrect because it does not follow regular English sentence structure norms. Additionally, it is difficult to determine what is meant to relate to what in the sentence, hence concluding that the sentence is also semantically unacceptable.  A more acceptable version of the sentence could be: \\"It was several young students that the policeman met in the park last night.\\" In this revised sentence, syntactical rules are observed as each part of the sentence relates logically and grammatically to another. Semantically, it's clear that the policeman met several young students in the park the previous night, leading the reader or listener to have a clear understanding of what occurred.

Which country had fewer people with whooping cough?  Hint: Many respiratory diseases are caused by pathogens. A pathogen is an organism that causes disease in another organism. Certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi are pathogens of the respiratory system. The common cold and flu are caused by viruses. The influenza virus that causes the flu is pictured below ( Figure below ). Tuberculosis, whooping cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. The pathogens that cause colds, flu, and TB can be passed from person to person by coughing, sneezing, and spitting. Illnesses caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics. Those caused by viruses cannot. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Iraq had fewer cases of whooping cough as compared to Iran.  This can be explained by the fact that whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. As mentioned in the passage, Iran predominantly had respiratory diseases caused by fungi and viruses, whereas Iraq had more cases of respiratory diseases stemming from bacterial infections. Since whooping cough is a bacterial infection, it is more likely that Iraq had a higher number of cases compared to Iran, resulting in fewer whooping cough cases in Iran. Additionally, it is worth noting that bacterial infections such as whooping cough can be effectively treated using antibiotics. Though antibiotics do not guarantee complete eradication of the disease, the availability and effectiveness of these medications can help manage and reduce the spread of whooping cough in a population. In contrast, illnesses caused by viruses have limited treatment options and cannot be cured through antibiotics, which may contribute to a higher prevalence of these types of infections in the population. In summary, based on the prevalence of bacterial infections in Iraq and the nature of whooping cough as a bacterial infection, it can be deduced that Iraq had fewer cases of whooping cough in comparison to Iran."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For instance, they may want a particular file size or format, or they may want you to style them in a particular way. It will also tell you how they prefer for you to submit and how much they pay. If you can't find submission guidelines, you can still submit to the magazine by finding an email or physical address. Generally, you can find this information on their website. When looking through staff members' emails, look for the photo editor or art director, and direct your query to that person, if the magazine is big enough to have such a person. Get an idea of what kind of photos they want, so you know what to submit. Make sure they are good quality and fit the style and subject matter of the magazine. If you don't have any that fit their style, choose another magazine, or try a photo shoot to capture what they want. The letter should explain who you are and what you want (to have your photos printed or to receive future assignments or both). You can do so in print or online but follow any guidelines the magazine offers. If you submit in print, be sure to include both printed images and a CD with high-resolution images, so they are ready to go if the magazine wants them.  You should also include a thumbnail page, a caption sheet, and a picture of yourself. You can also send a sample of your work so you are placed on their mailing list. You show a collection of your photos, and they may contact you when they have assignments. Keep your letter professional and to the point. For instance, you could write something like: \\"Dear Ms. (name), My name is Jo Jones, and I am a freelance photographer. I have been a fan of your magazine for over 10 years.

The Met's parliamentary liaison and investigation team saw cases of hate-filled messages, harassment and criminal damage between August and early February.

Cynthia had a more vivid imagination.;","output":"The soothsayer said Emily had more fantastical dreams than Cynthia because Emily had a more vivid imagination. This doesn't undermine Cynthia's imaginative prowess at all, but it was merely the level of vividness in their imaginative capacity that set them apart, especially in creating fantasy. This difference was quite trackable in the way their dreams materialized and how they recounted each episode. Imagination, as it pertains to Emily and Cynthia, needs to be understood as a spectrum rather than an absolute capability. Each individual dream they chalked down on the canvas of their subconscious was a direct reflection of their imagination at that time. Like two artists with different styles, the differences between Emily and Cynthia's dreams were not indicative of a greater or lesser ability, simply a different methodology. Emily's dreams were sculpted with a vibrant shade of inventive brilliance, encapsulating eccentricities, and intricate details that seemed plucked from the pure ether of fantasy. Her dreams weren't just stories; they were rich narratives brimming with a multitude of diverse characters, otherworldly landscapes, and unpredictable events. These details sprouted from a vivid imagination that worked overtime, weaving an elaborate tapestry of different elements, all contributing to the conception of a spectacularly fantastical world within her mind. Her dreams were like grand epics, fantasy fiction novels that wove an intricate tale of mysterious creatures and mythical landscapes. The soothsayer took note of the astounding detail, the remarkable coherence, and the gripping suspense that characterized Emily's dreams. This isn't to say that Cynthia lacked an imaginative spirit. Cynthia, too, had a remarkable capability to dream up scenarios and weave stories from her subconscious. Her dreams, however, ran on a different wavelength. They were more rooted and grounded in reality, with an artistic interpretation of the metaphorical aspect of existence. Cynthia's dreams had a kind of mystical realism. They were nuanced versions of reality with surreal tinges, emphasizing more on emotional depth, metaphorical interpretations, and psychological elements. Cynthia's imagination was more oriented toward introspective thought and abstract concepts.  To sum it up, Emily and Cynthia were two sides of the same coin. Emily adorned the side of vibrant extensive imagination that crafted vast, grand, and detailed fantasies, while Cynthia represented the other side, with grounded, in-depth, and introspective dreams highlighting elements of life and the self's abstract aspects. It was this difference between Emily's vibrantly vivid fantasies and Cynthia's more grounded imaginative dreams that led the soothsayer to make his observation. The amalgamation of Emily's unconventional plots with those of Cynthia's introspective themes creates a comprehensive representation of the wonders of human imagination. This combination serves as a reminder that creativity and imagination know no boundaries; whether fantastical or introspective, each dream carries its unique beauty, starring as a testament to the boundless potentials of the human mind."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","output":"\\"Pistol Grip Pump\\" is a song by the American hip-hop group Volume 10. Hailing from Los Angeles, California, the group was a part of the West Coast hip-hop scene during its heyday in the 1990s. The lead vocalist and primary member responsible for this song is Theodore \\"Volume 10\\" Dudley, who is supported by his fellow group members. \\"Pistol Grip Pump\\" was initially released as a single in 1993 and later appeared on Volume 10's debut album, \\"Hip-Hopera,\\" which was released in 1994. The song quickly gained prominence due to its unique sound and hard-hitting lyrics. Volume 10's \\"Pistol Grip Pump\\" is known for its catchy beat, infectious hook, and aggressive lyrics that portray street life in Los Angeles during the 1990s. The song's title refers to the type of shotgun grip, hinting at the firearm's presence as a constant companion for protection in the rough urban landscape. This theme resonated with many listeners at the time, leading to its popularity within the West Coast hip-hop community and beyond. Over the years, \\"Pistol Grip Pump\\" has maintained its status as a hip-hop classic. It has been covered, sampled, and interpolated by various artists, the most notable example being Rage Against the Machine's 2000 cover on their album \\"Renegades.\\" In summary, \\"Pistol Grip Pump\\" is performed by Los Angeles hip-hop group Volume 10, with the lead vocalist, Theodore \\"Volume 10\\" Dudley, at the forefront. This iconic track remains a beloved piece of the West Coast hip-hop legacy and a testament to the expressive power of music in documenting life and culture during that time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Complete the following sentence. Amy was more calm in this situation than Megan was so  Choices: (a). Amy ran from the police officers.. (b). Megan ran from the police officers..","output":"(b). Megan ran from the police officers. This sentence choice logically completes the original sentence because it contrasts Amy's calm demeanor with Megan's panicking action of running away from the police officers. The initial proposition of the sentence indicates a comparison between Amy's and Megan's reactions in a specific situation. It seems to suggest that Amy's calmness led to a different behavior than Megan's. The first part of the sentence, \\"Amy was more calm in this situation than Megan was,\\" builds up a premise of Amy and Megan reacting differently to the same situation. Here, we are presented with their emotional states - Amy being calm and Megan, by implication, being less calm or agitated. To complete such a sentence, we need an action that would reflect this discrepancy in their emotional states. Option (b) \\"Megan ran from the police officers\\" accomplishes this. It presents Megan reacting in a more panicked or agitated manner, which runs counter to Amy's calmness. The action of running from police officers generally portrays fear or panic, which would be less expected of someone who is calm - like Amy in this case. However, the sentence does leave some implicit implications or questions. While we know Megan's reaction, Amy's reaction or behavior isn't detailed. Yet, by contrasting Megan's action with Amy's calmness, we can deduce that Amy probably dealt with the situation in a more composed, and possibly effective manner. On the other hand, option (a) \\"Amy ran from the police officers,\\" contradicts the initial setup. It implies that even though Amy was more calm, she acted in a way that would typically indicate panic or fear, which contradicts the calmness attributed to her. This choice could potentially confuse the reader as it doesn't follow a logical progression in the comparison between Amy's and Megan's reactions.  Therefore, option (b) \\"Megan ran from the police officers\\" forms the most coherent, logical, and detailed completion of the sentence, effectively contrasting Megan's fearful reaction with Amy's calmness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\"The Tomb of Tutankhamun (number 62) is without a doubt the most famous, but the interior is disappointing.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Tutankhamun's tomb is not famous at all. \\"?","output":"Imagine you have a box of cookies that everyone loves and talks about because it has a very fancy wrapper.

Now, the hypothesis says that \\"Tutankhamun's tomb is not famous at all.\\" This is like saying that no one talks about the fancy cookie box. But we already know that everyone loves and talks about the cookie box, which means it's famous.

Hoffman, the pro bono coordinator at Washington, D.C.'s Crowell  and  Moring, regularly receives queries from non-profit organizations via email.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Susan M. Hoffman answers many questions for non-profits.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, it is reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis \\"Susan M. Hoffman answers many questions for non-profits\\" is likely true. However, it is essential to analyze the statement and its implications in a more detailed and comprehensive manner. The premise states that Susan M. Hoffman, who holds the position of a pro bono coordinator at Washington D.C.'s Crowell and Moring, regularly receives queries from non-profit organizations via email. This information provides sufficient evidence to support the notion that Susan M. Hoffman is, indeed, involved in interactions with non-profit organizations and is the point of contact for their questions and concerns.  Being a pro bono coordinator, her role typically involves managing and supervising legal services provided to clients who cannot afford legal representation and other similar services. In this context, it is safe to assume that Susan M. Hoffman's job would entail assisting non-profit organizations with their legal matters, as these organizations often operate with limited budgets. The premise's inclusion of the word \\"regularly\\" further strengthens the hypothesis by indicating that Susan M. Hoffman interacts with non-profits with a certain level of frequency. This implies that she likely addresses a significant number of questions from non-profit organizations. Consequently, her role as a pro bono coordinator and the frequency of her interactions with these organizations support the hypothesis that Susan M. Hoffman answers many questions for non-profits. However, it is important to note a few caveats. The premise does not specify the exact scope and volume of the questions Susan M. Hoffman receives. The term \\"regularly\\" is subjective and subject to interpretation, and as a result, might not necessarily be interpreted as indicative of large numbers of queries. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the premise only states that she receives queries from non-profit organizations. While it can be assumed that Susan M. Hoffman answers those questions as part of her role, there is no explicit mention of her response to those queries. Although it is highly probable that Susan M. Hoffman would answer and offer assistance to these non-profits, the hypothesis's validity cannot be indisputably confirmed considering this potential limitation. In conclusion, based on the provided information, it is reasonable to infer that the hypothesis \\"Susan M. Hoffman answers many questions for non-profits\\" is likely true. Although there are some minor limitations that could slightly weaken the strength of the hypothesis, the overall evidence strongly supports the idea that Susan M. Hoffman does, in fact, answer numerous questions for non-profit organizations, particularly in her position as a pro bono coordinator."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After the sediment has been transported by the river and dumped through tributaries into lakes and the ocean, over time, the sediment will settle at the bottom of these bodies of water. This is due to a decrease in velocity or energy of the water which can no longer support the sediment, gravity then pulls it down to the bottom.  Sediment is usually sorted by size during the deposition process—larger particles settle first, with smaller particles and silt settling after. This accumulated sediment eventually hardens or compacts into a solid form creating strata or layers over time, in a process known as lithification, which is the creation of sedimentary rock. This entire process is a key part of the rock cycle, which involves the weathering, transport, deposition, and transformation of rock and soil."},{"instruction":"Question: Given the following context:  With seven nations competing, the first Eurovision Song Contest took place in Lugano, Switzerland in May 1956. Sweden's first contest was the third, in 1958. Without broadcasting a public selection, Sveriges Radio (SR) chose to send Alice Babs to the contest in Hilversum, Netherlands. The song selected was \\"Samma stjärna lyser för oss två\\" (The same stars shine for the two of us), later renamed \\"Lilla stjärna\\" (Little star). It finished fourth at Eurovision on 12 March 1958. The first Melodifestival, incorporated into the Säg det med musik radio series, took place on 29 January 1959 at Cirkus in Stockholm; eight songs participated. Four \\"expert\\" juries in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, and Luleå decided the winner. The competition was won by Siw Malmkvist performing \\"Augustin\\", but SR decided that the winning song—regardless of its original performer—would be performed by Brita Borg at Eurovision. This policy, of selecting the artist for Eurovision internally and having other artists perform potential Swedish entries at Melodifestivalen, was stopped in 1961. The competition became a stand-alone television programme in 1960, known as the Eurovisionschlagern, svensk final. In the event's early years, it was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network. The competition adopted its current name, Melodifestivalen, in 1967. The Melodifestival has failed to be staged on three occasions. In 1964, the competition was cancelled due to an artist's strike; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year. Sweden was absent at Eurovision for a second time in 1970 because of a Nordic boycott of the voting system, which had led to a four-way tie for first place at the 1969 contest. After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm, left-wing groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again. This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti-commercial Alternativfestivalen.

Article:","output":"Title: An Easy DIY Lip Gloss Recipe You'll Love Introduction: Do you love experimenting with makeup and trying out new beauty products? Are you tired of spending a fortune on store-bought lip glosses that may contain questionable ingredients? If your answer to these questions is yes, then this article is perfect for you!  Here, we present a quick and easy DIY lip gloss recipe that you can make at home using just a few simple ingredients. Not only will you save money, but you'll also have full control over the quality of the ingredients you use. So, let's get started! Step 1: Boil Water The first step in making your DIY lip gloss is to boil some water. Boiling water is essential for two reasons. First, it will help to sanitize and clean any tools or containers you'll be using for your lip gloss, ensuring that no bacteria or germs are present. Second, you'll be using the heat from the boiling water to melt the ingredients together in the next step. Fill a pot with water and place it on the stove over medium heat. Allow the water to come to a rolling boil before continuing. Step 2: Melt The Ingredients Once your water is boiling, you'll need to gather and melt your lip gloss ingredients. For a basic lip gloss recipe, you'll need: - 2 tablespoons of coconut oil - 1 tablespoon of beeswax or candelilla wax (use candelilla wax for a vegan option) - 1 teaspoon of sweet almond oil  - A few drops of your favorite essential oil for fragrance and flavor (optional) Place these ingredients in a heat-resistant glass container like a measuring cup or a Pyrex bowl. Then, create a double boiler by placing the container into the pot of boiling water, gently stirring the ingredients until they melt and blend together. This process ensures that your ingredients melt evenly without overheating or burning. Step 3: Put It In A Container Once your ingredients have melted, carefully remove the glass container from the pot of boiling water using oven mitts or a towel to protect your hands. Let the mixture cool down for a few moments, during which you can add a few drops of your favorite essential oil. Next, pour the melted lip gloss mixture into small, sterilized containers or empty lip gloss tubes. You can find these containers at beauty supply stores or online retailers. Be sure to work carefully and quickly, as the mixture will begin to solidify as it cools. Step 4: Use Your Lip Gloss After pouring the lip gloss into containers, allow it to cool completely and solidify. Once it has reached room temperature and is fully set, your homemade lip gloss is ready to use! Simply apply the lip gloss using your finger or a lip brush, and enjoy the natural, moisturizing benefits of your new DIY creation. Feel free to experiment with different scents, flavors, and even tints by adding natural pigments like beetroot powder or cocoa powder. Conclusion: Making your own lip gloss at home is an easy and cost-effective way to create a beauty product that's customized to your preferences. This simple recipe is a great starting point for anyone who wants to explore the world of DIY beauty. With a little creativity and experimentation, you'll be on your way to building a collection of lip glosses that's uniquely yours!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is the southernmost district of Transnistria, located mostly south of Tiraspol. Its seat is the city of Slobozia, located at , on the river Dniester. The district contains 4 cities/towns and 12 communes (a total of 24 localities, including small villages/hamlets):  - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.  - Tîrnauca (Romanian \\"Ternivka\\", , \\"Ternovka\\") is a commune and village in the Slobozia District of Transnistria, Moldova, situated on the east bank of the river Dniester, between Tighina and Tiraspol. It is notable for being home to the largest bottle-shaped building in the world, the Butylka hotel and museum.  - A is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features a large number of extremely small \\"rooms\\" (capsules) intended to provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require the services offered by more conventional hotels.  - Tiraspol (Russian and ) is internationally recognised as the second largest city in Moldova, but is effectively the capital and administrative centre of the unrecognised Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria). The city is located on the eastern bank of the Dniester River. Tiraspol is a regional hub of light industry, such as furniture and electrical goods production.  - Butylka ( Russian for bottle ) is the name of a museum and hotel , sometimes also called the Spirit Museum Hotel . It is located in the village Tîrnauca ( Ternovka ) , 10 km from Tiraspol , the capital of Transnistria . The museum is notable for being housed inside a five - story structure shaped like a giant bottle . It is listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest building in the world in the shape of a bottle . The museum features owner Grigory Korzun 's vast collection of liquor .  - The Dniester River, or Dnister River ( translit. \\"Dnister\\", , ) is a river in Eastern Europe. It runs first through Ukraine and then through Moldova (from which it separates the breakaway territory of Transnistria), finally discharging into the Black Sea on Ukrainian territory again.  - Moldavia (or \\"\\", Romanian Cyrillic alphabet: ) is a historical region, and former principality in Eastern Europe, corresponding to the territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Dniester river. An initially independent and later autonomous state, it existed from the 14th century to 1859, when it united with Wallachia as the basis of the modern Romanian state; at various times, Moldavia included the regions of Bessarabia (with the Budjak) and all of Bukovina.   - A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a fridge and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flatscreen television and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours. In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.  - A bottle is a rigid container with a neck that is narrower than the body and a mouth. By contrast, a jar has a relatively large mouth or opening which may be as wide as the overall container. Bottles are often made of glass, clay, plastic, aluminium or other impervious materials, and typically used to store liquids such as water, milk, soft drinks, beer, wine, cooking oil, medicine, shampoo, ink, and chemicals. A device applied in the bottling line to seal the mouth of a bottle is termed an external bottle cap, closure, or internal stopper. A bottle can also be sealed by a conductive \\"innerseal\\" by using induction sealing.  - A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public.  - Transnistria (Moldovan: ), officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR ); also called Transdniester, Trans-Dniestr, Transdniestria, or Pridnestrovie, is a self-proclaimed republic on a strip of land between the River Dniester and the border with Ukraine, recognised only by three non-United Nations (UN) states. The region is considered by the UN to be part of Moldova. The PMR controls most of the territory to the east of the River Dniester, and also the city of Bender and its surrounding localities on the west bank, in the historical region of Bessarabia.  - Moldova (or sometimes ), or Moldavia, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. The capital city is Chiinu.  - Bessarabia (; \\"Bessarabiya\\"; \\"Besarabiya\\") is a historical region in Eastern Europe, bounded by the Dniester river on the east and the Prut river on the west. Today Bessarabia is mostly occupied by modern-day Moldova, with the Ukrainian Budjak region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian Chernivtsi Oblast covering a small area in the north.  - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world.  - Clay is a fine-grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter. Clays are plastic due to their water content and become hard, brittle and nonplastic upon drying or firing. Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilicate minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure. Depending on the soil's content in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red. Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 45 m, and colloid chemists use 1 m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 m and silt particles as being larger.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.    What is the relationship between 'butylka ' and 'moldova'?

Question: Most surfers used Wide beach because of the areas of shallow water, but some surfers were happy with Sandy beach, although the water was much deeper at the shore there.  Which beach had better and larger waves?  Hint: When waves travel into areas of shallow water, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. The free orbital motion of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position. As the water becomes shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. After the wave breaks, it becomes a wave of translation and erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies. Answer:","output":"Wide beach had better and larger waves due to the areas of shallow water which cause the swell to become higher and steeper, ultimately forming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape that surfers prefer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.  Now, I have a new situation: Dan and Fred were friends. they studied Biology at the same University. Fred studied bird reproduction this semester, while Dan studied fish reproduction.  Answer this question please: Which friend studied less about female fish increasing the chances of fertilization?","output":"Dan and Fred were both friends who studied Biology at the same university, and they each focused on the reproduction of different organisms in their respective semesters. Fred learned about bird reproduction, while Dan dedicated his time to studying fish reproduction. Based on the information provided, Dan was the friend who studied more about female fish increasing the chances of fertilization, as his focus was specifically on fish reproduction. This topic includes the various ways in which fish reproduce, such as laying eggs, external and internal fertilization, and the strategies female fish employ to increase the chances of fertilization, such as releasing a high number of eggs into the water.  Fred, on the other hand, focused on bird reproduction, which would delve into the reproductive behaviors, mating rituals, and different strategies used by birds to ensure successful reproduction. While both types of reproduction share some similarities, Fred's studies would not have concentrated as much on the specific ways in which female fish increase their chances of fertilization, since his focus was on bird reproduction. In conclusion, neither friend studied \\"less\\" about female fish increasing the chances of fertilization because only Dan studied fish reproduction.

The county administration is in Oslo, which is not part of the county \\"per se\\".  - Bærum is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Sandvika. Bærum was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838. A suburb of Oslo, Bærum is located on the west coast of the city.  - Oslo is the capital and the most populous city in Norway. It constitutes both a county and a municipality. Founded in the year 1040, and established as a \\"kaupstad\\" or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada, the city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Fortress during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and renamed Christiania in his honour. It was established as a municipality (\\"formannskapsdistrikt\\") on 1 January 1838. Following a spelling reform, it was known as Kristiania from 1877 to 1925, at which time its original Norwegian name was restored.  - Statkraft is a hydropower company, fully owned by the Norwegian state.

This technology mainly saves utility providers the expense of periodic trips to each physical location to read a meter. Another advantage is that billing can be based on near real-time consumption rather than on estimates based on past or predicted consumption. This timely information coupled with analysis can help both utility providers and customers better control the use and production of electric energy, gas usage, or water consumption.  - Christian IV (12 April 1577  28 February 1648), sometimes colloquially referred to as Christian Firtal in Denmark and Christian Kvart or Quart in Norway, was king of Denmark-Norway and Duke of Holstein and Schleswig from 1588 to 1648.

To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Telenor Group (or ) is a Norwegian multinational telecommunications company headquartered at Fornebu in Bærum, close to Oslo.

The investment cost NOK 1.1 billion , but Telenor failed to correctly estimate the cost of installing the readers in each home . In 2007 , the company lost NOK 300 million .  - Eastern Europe, also known as East Europe, is the eastern part of the European continent. There is no consensus on the precise area it covers, partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical, geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic connotations. There are \\"almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region\\". A related United Nations paper adds that \\"every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct\\".  - History. The introduction of self-government in rural districts was a major political change. The Norwegian farm culture (\\"bondekultur\\") that emerged came to serve as a symbol of nationalistic resistance to the forced union with Sweden. The legislation of 1837 gave both the towns and the rural areas the same institutions: a minor change for the town, but a major advance for the rural communities. The significance of this legislation is hailed by a nationalistic historian, Ernst Sars:  - Lillehammer is a town and municipality in Oppland county, Norway.

It differs from a federation in that each constituent state has an independent government, whereas a unitary state is united by a central government. The ruler in a personal union does not need to be a hereditary monarch.  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Fornebu (local form \\"Fornebo\\") is a peninsular area in the suburban municipality of Bærum in Norway, bordering western parts of Oslo.  - The 2016 Winter Youth Olympics (Norwegian: \\"Vinter-OL for ungdom 2016\\"), officially known as the II Winter Youth Olympic Games, took place in and around Lillehammer, Norway, between 12 February and 21 February 2016.

Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What individual drive did Locke believe would control man if belief in a higher power were abandoned?\\"  Context: \\"A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"According to Locke, if belief in a higher power were abandoned, the individual drive that would control man is his own self-interest and will. In this scenario, every individual would have no law but his own will and no end but himself, leading to moral anarchy."},{"instruction":"Q: Title: Loved it! Review: Loved it!

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Nuclei in the midbrain are to the eye muscles as motor systems are to what? Context: Motor systems are areas of the brain that are directly or indirectly involved in producing body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the first names of the people who purchased a complete set of prints, over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads?  Despite being one of the most significant anti-war works of art, The Disasters of War had no impact on the European consciousness for two generations, as it was not seen outside a small circle in Spain until it was published by Madrid's Royal Academy of San Fernando in 1863. Since then, interpretations in successive eras have reflected the sensibilities of the time. Goya was seen as a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.The series' impact on Dalí is evident in Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War), painted in 1936 in response to events leading to the Spanish Civil War. Here, the distorted limbs, brutal suppression, agonised expressions and ominous clouds are reminiscent of plate 39, Grande hazaña! Con muertos! (A heroic feat! With dead men!), in which mutilated bodies are shown against a backdrop barren landscape.In 1993, Jake and Dinos Chapman of the Young British Artists movement created 82 miniature, toy-like sculptures modelled on The Disasters of War. The works were widely acclaimed and purchased that year by the Tate gallery. For decades, Goya's series of etching served as a constant point of reference for the Chapman brothers; in particular, they created a number of variations based on the plate Grande hazaña! Con muertos!. In 2003, the Chapman brothers exhibited an altered version of The Disasters of War. They purchased a complete set of prints, over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads. The Chapmans described their \\"rectified\\" images as making a connection between Napoleon's supposed introduction of Enlightenment ideals to early-19th-century Spain and Tony Blair and George W.

She was born in Farnborough, Hampshire, England, the daughter of Edward Digby, 11th Baron Digby, and his wife, Constance Pamela Alice, the daughter of Henry Campbell Bruce, 2nd Baron Aberdare. Pamela was educated by governesses in the ancestral home at Minterne Magna in Dorset, along with her three younger siblings. Her great-great aunt was the nineteenth-century adventurer and courtesan Jane Digby (1807-1881), notorious for her exotic travels and scandalous personal life. Pamela was to follow in her ancestor's footsteps, being frequently cited as \\"the 20th-century's greatest courtesan.\\" In 1939, while working at the Foreign Office in London doing French-to-English translations, Pamela met Randolph Churchill, the son of Winston Churchill. Randolph proposed to her on the very evening they met, and they were married on 4 October 1939. Two days after Randolph Churchill took his seat in the House of Commons, their son Winston was born. Shortly after giving birth, Pamela and the newborn were photographed by Cecil Beaton for Life magazine, its first cover of a mother with baby.  In February 1941, Randolph was sent to Cairo for military service, where he accrued large gambling debts. His letter to Pamela asking her to make good on his liabilities, along with her affair with W. Averell Harriman, combined to shatter their marriage, but the fault probably lay on both sides. Harriman was known at Chequers by the French phrase habitue de la maison for his frequent stays there in 1941. Harriman was one of the aristocratic set from the US Embassy, charming, suave and sophisticated. They had developed a friendship during the London Blitz, so that by 17 April 1941 they were already close and intimate friends. Jack Colville, Churchill's private secretary was well aware of the affair, but their clandestine relationship had to wait thirty years before consummation in marriage. She completed the circle by becoming a US citizen. Her father-in-law however, was too busy visiting bombed-out Blitz sites to be overly-concerned in 1941.  During 1944 she worked in the Cabinet's war rooms on a secretive SOE mission for Operation Bodyguard working with Robert E. Sherwood. \\"The days at the office were very sorry,\\" wrote Bobby Bevan, a spy who was directly involved with Bodyguard's activities; long days stretched into lonely nights, when they frequently indulged the senses on champagne and Russian caviar. Bodyguard went ahead without allied knowledge or approval, which upset the Soviets. At a critical point prior to the Top Secret D-Day Normandy landings, allied intelligence feared Germany's strength in the Mediterranean; a diversionary attack on the Balkans was designed to distract the Nazis in France. This further encouraged Churchill to switch sides to Tito's Partisans. After the war, Randolph had an affair with Bevan's wife. Eventually, Pamela filed for divorce in December 1945 on the grounds that Randolph had deserted her for three years. Later, after having converted to Catholicism, she obtained an annulment from the Catholic Church.

Given the question: We had a light bulb that stopped working and when a new bulb was placed it wouldn’t light up. We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system. So what started out for changing a light bulb was going to end up costing 10K. We did later get it looked at by someone else that is qualified in this field,m who was there working on some other project and he said there was nothing wrong with what we had.

Alpha Force Testo generally contains a blend of natural ingredients, such as herbs, vitamins, and minerals. Some of the common ingredients found in this supplement include: 1. Fenugreek Extract: This herbal ingredient is known to help increase testosterone production by stimulating the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland. Luteinizing hormone, in turn, signals the testes to produce and release more testosterone. 2. Tribulus Terrestris: This plant extract is believed to support the natural production of testosterone by increasing the levels of luteinizing hormone in the body. Additionally, Tribulus Terrestris may improve athletic performance, sexual stamina, and libido. 3. D-Aspartic Acid: This amino acid is essential for testosterone production, as it helps the body release crucial hormones, such as luteinizing hormone. It also increases the production of follicle-stimulating hormone, which contributes to sperm count and overall male fertility. 4. Vitamin D3: Adequate levels of Vitamin D3 are vital for maintaining healthy testosterone levels. This vitamin has been linked to the promotion of testosterone production and optimal hormonal balance. 5. Zinc: This essential mineral is necessary for testosterone production and plays a key role in the body's ability to convert free cholesterol into testosterone. 6. Magnesium: Magnesium is another vital nutrient for testosterone health, as it helps regulate the testosterone levels in the body. It also improves overall athletic performance and endurance. The synergistic combination of these ingredients allows Alpha Force Testo to perform its primary function of boosting testosterone levels in the body. By increasing testosterone levels, the supplement assists users in achieving enhanced muscle growth, improved muscle strength, and increased endurance during workouts. This, in turn, allows users to experience better performance both in and out of the gym. In addition to supporting testosterone production and optimizing physical performance, Alpha Force Testo may also improve users' sexual health. Increased testosterone levels have been associated with improved libido, enhanced sexual stamina, and better overall sexual performance. To summarize, the answer to both questions is the same: Alpha Force Testo works by combining various natural ingredients that together help increase testosterone levels in the body, thus contributing to improved muscle growth, physical strength, and sexual performance. The supplement achieves this goal by stimulating the release of hormones essential for testosterone production, providing the body with the necessary nutrients for optimal testosterone synthesis, and promoting overall hormonal balance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This House believes that Europe should weaken its austerity measures to guarantee its citizens greater social support. What argument could one make about this debate topic?","output":"The argument for the motion posits that Europe should shift some of its focus away from strict austerity measures and towards providing more social support for the citizens, since continued austerity policies have led to several negative consequences for European societies. Although these measures have helped combat fiscal and sovereign debt crises in the past, their impact on the overall well-being of the citizens cannot be ignored. There are several primary arguments that can be made in favor of weakening European austerity measures in order to prioritize the well-being of citizens. 1. Exacerbated inequality: One of the most critical consequences of austerity measures is an increase in income and wealth inequality among the population. When public spending is cut, it disproportionately impacts the economically disadvantaged, since they are most reliant on such support. By reducing the austerity measures, Europe can allocate more resources towards addressing inequality, promoting a more inclusive society where nobody is left behind. 2. Unemployment and underemployment: Austerity measures often involve the reduction of public sector jobs, which tends to increase unemployment rates. This not only causes financial distress to the individuals directly affected but also increases the risk of social and political instability. When people are unable to secure decent paying jobs, they turn to part-time or low-skilled work, contributing to the problem of underemployment. Loosening austerity measures would allow for the creation of more jobs, reduce unemployment and raise living standards. 3. Mental and physical health implications: Austerity measures often affect the delivery and quality of healthcare services, as budget cuts directly impact hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities. In some cases, austerity has led to reductions in mental health services and increased the cost of essential medications. By lessening austerity measures, European nations can allocate more funding towards healthcare, dramatically improving the health and well-being of their citizens. 4. Education and social mobility: Cuts to public education and training have long-term consequences for the European workforce, as austerity policies limit the opportunities for personal and professional development. By re-allocating resources towards education and professional training, Europe can enhance social mobility and create more opportunities for citizens to improve their lives and escape the poverty cycle. 5. Economic growth: A strong argument against austerity measures is that Europe's economic growth is stifled by the focus on fiscal consolidation, as it limits public investment in key areas such as infrastructure, education, and research and development. By adopting a more balanced approach, Europe can invest in measures that contribute to long-term economic growth, benefiting both the individual citizens and the broader economy. 6. Avoiding a lost generation: Among the most concerning consequences of austerity measures has been the impact on young people in Europe. The combination of high youth unemployment and reduced investment in social programs threatens to create a lost generation, with long-lasting implications on Europe's economy and society. By reconsidering austerity policies and prioritizing the needs of the younger population, Europe can avoid this scenario, creating a better future for all its citizens. In conclusion, the argument for weakening austerity measures in Europe is driven by a concern for the social wellbeing and economic sustainability of European societies. By prioritizing the needs of citizens, Europe can foster a more inclusive, equitable, and prosperous future for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was occupied intermittently from the mid 1920s until around 1938? from the following article ?  Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since... The answer to this question is:","output":"The last name of the person who was occupied intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938 mentioned in the article is Sibelius. The referred individual is Jean Sibelius, a well-known composer from Finland. He was working on his Symphony No. 8 during this time period but never published it."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: Given the sentence, generate \\"yes, and\\" response. \\"Yes, and\\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\\"Yes\\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\\"and...\\"). 1 In short, a \\"Yes, and\\" is a dialogue exchange in which a speaker responds by adding new information on top of the information/setting that was constructed by another speaker. Note that a \\"Yes, and\\" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange, although it could be the case if it agrees with the description above.

Options：  A. enjoyed  B. skip  C. sleep  D. awesome  E. watch television A:","output":"B. skip When children are happy, they often exhibit their happiness through various forms of physical activity, play, and emotional expressions. One such common and suitable manifestation of happiness in children is skipping. Skipping is a playful, energetic movement where a child alternates between hopping on one foot and then the other, often with bursts of laughter and joy. Happy children may also engage in other activities, aside from skipping, that showcase their excitement and contentment. These can include: 1. Laughing and smiling: When children are happy, they will naturally display emotions through laughter and smiling, which are key indicators of happiness. 2. Playing games: Happy children love to play games, whether alone or with peers. These games can range from simple ones like tag or hide-and-seek to more complex games that involve imagination and creativity. 3. Dancing: Joyful music and rhythm can be enticing to children, prompting them to express their happiness through spontaneous dancing, bouncing, and swaying to the beat. 4. Hugging: Happy children often display their affection and happiness through warm hugs to their friends, siblings, or parents. Hugging is a fundamental way to strengthen bonds and share the feeling of happiness with others. 5. Enjoying hobbies: As children explore and discover their interests, they become happy when engaging in their favorite hobbies, such as drawing, painting, playing an instrument, or reading. 6. Excited chatter: When children are happy, they have a lot to say. They may engage in animated conversations, share stories, or ask questions to express their curiosity and happiness. 7. Showing kindness and empathy: Happy children are more likely to exhibit kind and empathetic behaviors, such as sharing, helping others, and displaying concern for their friends and family members. In conclusion, although children can partake in various activities when they are happy, skipping (option B) is a classic example of how children physically express their joy and energy in response to positive emotions. Activities such as laughing, playing, dancing, hugging, engaging in hobbies, excited chatter, and showing kindness and empathy are additional ways in which children exhibit their happiness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Skirts are 'high-waisted' and collars so tight they make them bleed. Virgin Atlantic said the new outfits were 'comfortable and practical' Claimed uniforms had undergone a trial and staff had provided feedback. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Virgin Atlantic's New Vivienne Westwood Uniforms Cause Controversy Among Cabin Crew Subtitle: Striking outfits receive complaints of discomfort and impracticality from staff Step 1: Introduce the subject and designer Virgin Atlantic recently unveiled its striking new cabin crew uniforms, a collaboration with renowned designer Vivienne Westwood. The uniforms, which were launched on September 1, have garnered both admiration and criticism, as some crew members claim the outfits are uncomfortable and impractical for work. Step 2: Address the issues raised by the staff Several cabin crew members have reported issues with the new uniforms, including excessively tight clothing that hampers movement and shoes that cause painful blisters. Furthermore, female employees have complained about the high-waisted skirts, while both male and female staff members have expressed discomfort with collars so tight, they've experienced bleeding. Step 3: Include Virgin Atlantic's response Despite the complaints, Virgin Atlantic maintains that the Vivienne Westwood uniforms are \\"comfortable and practical.\\" The airline claims that the outfits underwent extensive trials during which cabin crew had ample opportunity to provide feedback. Virgin Atlantic representatives stated that the airline took the employees' concerns into account and made any necessary adjustments before rolling out the final designs. Step 4: Discuss the implications of the controversy The controversy surrounding the new uniforms highlights the challenges that airlines face when trying to marry style and functionality. While Virgin Atlantic aimed to make a bold fashion statement with its partnership with Vivienne Westwood, the resulting designs seem to have compromised the comfort and practicality crucial for cabin crew members during their long shifts. Step 5: Conclude the article In light of the mixed reviews, it remains to be seen whether Virgin Atlantic will make further adjustments to the current uniforms or if the airline will stand by its initial claim that the outfits are comfortable and practical despite the concerns from its staff. Either way, the collaboration with Vivienne Westwood has undoubtedly drawn attention to the airline, while also sparking a conversation about the importance of balancing form and function in uniform design."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period.

Title: People in Richmond, VA love it Review: People in Richmond, VA love it. If you know anything about Richmond....well, an open mind would be an endangered species there. Perhaps I have said enough on that subject. More specifically, if you are looking for a book based in historical facts, look somewhere else. Is this product review negative?","output":"The product review provided is indeed negative in its essence. The reviewer expresses a critical opinion about both the people in Richmond, VA, as well as the book being reviewed. Let's analyze the review in more detail to understand the reasons behind the negative perception. 1. The reviewer starts by mentioning that people in Richmond, VA love the book, but this is immediately followed by a negative judgment about Richmond itself. The phrase \\"an open mind would be an endangered species there\\" is an implicit way of implying that people in the town are likely to be close-minded or lack intellectual curiosity, which may not be a fair generalization. The statement could potentially lead readers to assume that people from Richmond love the book due to their lack of open-mindedness, influencing the way they perceive the book. This sets a negative tone for the review, despite briefly stating that people in the town love it. 2. The reviewer then emphasizes that they have said enough on the subject of Richmond, demonstrating reluctance to discuss it further. This implies that the opinions shared about Richmond are strong and, to some extent, reinforces the negatively charged stereotype mentioned earlier. 3. Finally, the reviewer addresses the book in question and expresses dissatisfaction with its historical accuracy. The statement \\"if you are looking for a book based in historical facts, look somewhere else\\" is a clear indication that the reviewer doesn't believe the book provides accurate information. This assertion can be seen as the most significant critique of the product itself and will likely leave a lasting impression on potential buyers, who may then perceive the book as unreliable or not worth their time. Overall, the product review is negative because it casts doubt on the opinions of people who enjoy the book, insinuates that the book may not be accurate in its historical facts, and does not offer any redeeming qualities or points of praise. It dismisses the book's value in a notable way, which could deter potential readers from considering it as a viable option."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Determine the sentiment: After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep, I decided that I may as well be entertained while I suffered from sleep deprivation. This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it. What a mistake! Here is the plot (potential spoilers, if you even care) : a neurotic man with an addiction to candy (Josh Kornbluth) works as a temp for some ridiculous company. Suddenly, he is offered the chance to \\"go perm,\\" which seems to be the favorite catch-phrase of this movie. But with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp, Josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he doesn't want to do it. He hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt. His inability to send several \\"very important\\" letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious, but is merely stupid. Josh meets and deceives a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together (obviously a fantasy of Josh's in real life, as such a thing would never happen). A bunch of other stuff happens, but it's too trite and inane to go into now. Despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy, I only laughed twice during it; the first time was the opening shot of Josh Kornbluth (my initial reaction was one of stifling fear) and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman (yeah, right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying-looking person I have ever seen in my life. He is an unattractive, overweight, balding Jewish man who I am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women. I do not at all sympathize with Josh's character. He is lazy and unmotivated and I just don't appreciate the failed attempts at humor. Skip it, even if your life depends upon it.","output":"This review can be characterized as expressing a predominantly negative sentiment.  Here are the steps I took to determine this: 1. Gloss the entire text: The first step in sentiment analysis is to look at the text as a whole and try to understand the general tone. 2. Identify emotional words or expressions: The reviewer uses phrases like 'What a mistake!', 'stupid reason', 'filled me with contempt', 'merely stupid', 'too trite and inane', and 'failed attempts at humor'. These phrases imply dissatisfaction or disapproval which represent negative emotions. 3. Analyze the emotion intensity: The use of extreme language, such as 'the most terrifying-looking person I have ever seen in my life', 'skip it, even if your life depends on it', indicate a high intensity of negative feelings. 4. Identify the sentiment target: The negative sentiment is not just about the character or actor, keywords like 'movie', 'plot' indicate the sentiment is about the movie itself. Hence, the negative sentiment from the review is not just about a specific actor or character in the movie, but extends to the script, plot and overall structure of the movie as well. The user expresses strong negative sentiments throughout the comment, indicating a sense of frustration, disappointment, and contempt."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What movie does the accountant watch?, using the article: A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film. Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies. The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting \\"the factory\\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket.  Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime.

Input: Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to HIV-1 can evolve after years of an iterative process of virus escape and antibody adaptation that HIV-1 vaccine design seeks to mimic. To enable this, properties that render HIV-1 envelopes (Env) capable of eliciting bnAb responses need to be defined. Here, we followed the evolution of the V2 apex directed bnAb lineage VRC26 in the HIV-1 subtype C superinfected donor CAP256 to investigate the phenotypic changes of the virus populations circulating before and during the early phases of bnAb induction. Longitudinal viruses that evolved from the VRC26-resistant primary infecting (PI) virus, the VRC26-sensitive superinfecting (SU) virus and ensuing PI-SU recombinants revealed substantial phenotypic changes in Env, with a switch in Env properties coinciding with early resistance to VRC26. Decreased sensitivity of SU-like viruses to VRC26 was linked with reduced infectivity, altered entry kinetics and lower sensitivity to neutralization after CD4 attachment. VRC26 maintained neutralization activity against cell-associated CAP256 virus, indicating that escape through the cell-cell transmission route is not a dominant escape pathway. Reduced fitness of the early escape variants and sustained sensitivity in cell-cell transmission are both features that limit virus replication, thereby impeding rapid escape. This supports a scenario where VRC26 allowed only partial viral escape for a prolonged period, possibly increasing the time window for bnAb maturation. Collectively, our data highlight the phenotypic plasticity of the HIV-1 Env in evading bnAb pressure and the need to consider phenotypic traits when selecting and designing Env immunogens. Combinations of Env variants with differential phenotypic patterns and bnAb sensitivity, as we describe here for CAP256, may maximize the potential for inducing bnAb responses by vaccination.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are asking two different things related to accessing Kik messenger. Question 1 asks about how to access Kik at school when the website is blocked. Question 2 is focused on how to get Kik messenger on a MacBook Pro. Detailed answer for Question 1: Getting onto Kik at school when the website is blocked might be challenging, as it requires bypassing the network restrictions put in place by your school administrators. It is important to note that bypassing these restrictions may violate your school's policies, and you should consider the potential consequences before attempting to do so. Here are several methods to access Kik when the website is blocked: 1. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN): A VPN allows you to create a secure, encrypted connection to a different network, typically in another country. Once connected to a VPN, your internet traffic is routed through that network, bypassing any local restrictions. There are a variety of VPN providers available, including both free and paid options. Keep in mind that using a VPN might slow down your internet connection. 2. Use a Proxy Server: A proxy server acts as an intermediary between you and the website you want to access, in this case, Kik. By routing your web traffic through the proxy server, you may be able to bypass your school's block on the Kik website. You can find a list of free proxy servers online, but the reliability and safety of these services may vary. 3. Use a Mobile Hotspot: If you have a smartphone with mobile data, you can create a Wi-Fi hotspot and connect your device (such as a laptop) to the hotspot. This will allow you to access the internet outside of your school's network, potentially enabling you to access Kik. Note that this will consume your mobile data and may incur additional charges, so be mindful of any data limitations on your plan. Detailed answer for Question 2: Unfortunately, Kik messenger does not have an official application for macOS or MacBook Pro. However, there are alternative ways to run the Kik app on a MacBook Pro using an Android emulator. Here's a step-by-step guide: 1. Download an Android emulator. There are a few popular options available, such as BlueStacks (https://www.bluestacks.com) or Nox Player (https://www.bignox.com). 2. Install the Android emulator on your MacBook Pro by following the installation instructions provided on the emulator's website. 3. After installation, launch the emulator, and sign in with your Google account. If you don't have a Google account, you will need to create one. 4. Open the Google Play Store within the emulator and search for \\"Kik Messenger.\\" 5. Download and install the Kik Messenger app within the emulator. 6. Launch the Kik Messenger app within the emulator, then sign in or create a new Kik account. 7. You can now use Kik Messenger on your MacBook Pro through the Android emulator. Please note that using an Android emulator may cause your MacBook Pro to consume more system resources, potentially affecting its performance. Additionally, while these emulators are popular and generally considered safe, there is always some risk when downloading and using third-party software. Use caution when choosing an emulator and be sure to download it from official sources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

His hair reached to his neck . Options:  A). The narrator is much tanner than the man ..  B). The narrator is olive skinned ..  C). None of the above choices ..  D). The narrator is very tan .. Q: Why may the narrator be self conscious next to the man ?","output":"The narrator may be self-conscious next to the man due to various reasons, outlined below: 1. Contrast in skin color: From the description provided, it is apparent that there is a noticeable difference between the narrator's skin color and that of the man. The statement \\"I was as white as a ghost\\" suggests that the narrator is very pale, while the man has a healthy skin tone. This contrast may make the narrator feel self-conscious since they might be comparing themselves to the man and possibly feeling like they lack the same vibrancy and energy that the man's healthy color portrays. Therefore, none of the given options (A, B, or D) accurately describe the narrator's skin tone. 2. Differences in overall appearance: The mention of the man's hair reaching his neck suggests that he might have a distinct and possibly fashionable or trendy hairstyle. If the narrator perceives themselves as having a less attractive or plain hairstyle, they might feel self-conscious due to the visual disparity between them and the man. This dissimilarity in appearance can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and self-consciousness. 3. Perception of attractiveness: The healthy color of the man might be associated with attractiveness and vitality. In contrast, the narrator's self-description as \\"bloodless\\" and \\"colorless\\" implies they may consider themselves to be less attractive or less visually appealing. This belief could be an underlying cause of their self-consciousness while standing next to the man. 4. Social expectations and norms: In many cultures, having a tan or healthy skin color is considered desirable. The narrator, being very pale, might feel like they do not meet these societal standards and expectations, resulting in a sense of self-consciousness. It is also possible that they have faced teasing or negative comments about their skin tone in the past, which has left them more self-aware and anxious about their appearance. 5. Personal insecurities: The narrator's self-consciousness might not solely be due to the specific situation or the man's appearance. They could be generally insecure about their looks or have low self-esteem, causing them to feel self-conscious in various social situations. In conclusion, the narrator may feel self-conscious next to the man due to the contrast in skin color, differences in overall appearance, perceived attractiveness, social norms, and personal insecurities. These factors, combined with the comparison between the two, could result in the narrator feeling inadequate or uncomfortable in the situation."},{"instruction":"- known for is ammonite evolution    - fields is paleontology -lrb- paleomalocology -rrb-    - work institutions is museum für naturkunde , berlin      - birth date is 1958      - nationality is german    - birth place is sundern -lrb- westphalia -rrb-    Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

It's simple to teach a horse how to bow Possible answers: a. Yes. b. It's impossible to say. c. No.","output":"c. No. To teach a horse to bow, follow these steps: 1. Prepare the environment: Choose a flat and quiet area with good footing, away from distractions. This will help your horse focus on the training session. 2. Warm up your horse: Before starting any training session, it's crucial to warm up your horse. This will stimulate blood flow, improve flexibility, and prevent injuries. Walk and trot your horse in both directions for approximately 10 minutes. 3. Build trust: Start your session by spending quality time with your horse. Grooming, petting, and speaking calmly to your horse can help build trust and establish a positive bond. This will make your horse more receptive to your instructions. 4. Train with positive reinforcement: When attempting to teach your horse to bow, use positive reinforcement to reward good behavior. This will encourage your horse to cooperate. Food rewards, such as apples or carrots, are particularly effective as they provide a clear incentive for your horse to learn. 5. Teach the cue: Begin with a verbal cue or command, such as \\"bow\\" or \\"down.\\" Then, pair this with a physical gesture, like touching the horse's foreleg. Repeat the verbal cue and touch the horse in a consistent manner, so the horse learns the association between the cue and the action. 6. Apply gentle pressure: While giving the cue, apply gentle pressure with your hand on the horse's chest, encouraging the horse to lower its head and neck. Maintain this pressure until the horse bows. Be patient with this step and adjust accordingly to your horse's individual personality. 7. Reward correct behavior: As soon as your horse bows, reward the behavior with a treat and praise. This will help the horse make a strong connection between the bowing behavior and your cue. 8. Gradually increase the bow's depth: As your horse becomes more accustomed to bowing, gradually ask for a deeper bow by applying more pressure on the chest. Remember to be patient and consistent with your cues. 9. Practice regularly: Practicing the bow regularly, both in training sessions and during everyday interactions, will help reinforce the behavior and make it more natural for your horse. 10. Be patient and consistent: Teaching a horse to bow requires consistency and patience. Allow your horse to progress at its own pace while maintaining a positive and encouraging attitude. In summary, the statement \\"It's simple to teach a horse how to bow\\" does not follow the preceding text, as teaching a horse to bow requires patience, consistency, practice, and regular training sessions in a suitable environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here).

Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do?

Here is a news article: Hours after opening her eyes for the first time, doctors are performing “aggressive physical therapy” on U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and are nothing short of astounded by her progress.      Doctors have her up in bed with her legs dangling over the side.      “She is starting to become aware of her surroundings,” said Dr. Michael Lemole.      “This is a major leap forward, this is a major milestone,” he said.      Doctors hope that tomorrow she’ll be up in a chair.      She can move both of her legs and both her arms, and is keeping her eyes open for 10-15 minutes at a time, doctors said.      Her recovery is so miraculous that Lemole said it can’t all be chalked up to modern medical care.      \\"Yes, miracles happen every day,” he said. Doctors like to attribute progress to science, he said, but “ we would be wise to acknowledge miracles.” ||||| FILE - In this Jan. 11, 2011 file photo, Dr. Peter Rhee, Trauma and Critical Care Emergency Surgery doctor at University Medical Center, describes in more detail the gunshot wound Rep. Gabrielle Giffords,... (Associated Press)      FILE - In this Jan. 8, 2011 file photo, emergency personnel and Daniel Hernandez, an intern for U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, second right, move Giffords after she was shot in the head outside a shopping... (Associated Press)      Few people who take a bullet to the brain _ just 10 percent _ survive such a devastating wound.      Yet doctors say the critically injured congresswoman has been making steady progress each day since an attempted assassination Saturday.      Giffords is moving both legs and both arms, has opened both eyes and is responding to friends and family, doctors said Thursday. They've helped her sit up and dangle her legs from the bed, and she is able to lift her legs on command.      With her closest friends from Congress holding her hand Wednesday evening, Giffords opened her left eye and tried to focus on loved ones for the first time.      \\"It was raw courage. It was raw strength. It was so beautiful and so moving,\\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. \\"She wanted us to know that she was with us a hundred percent and understood everything we were saying.\\"      Giffords' neurosurgeon, Dr. Michael Lemole, called it \\"a major milestone,\\" and said the congresswoman was clearly responding to the gathering of friends and family.      After five days of pushing for caution, Lemole acknowledged: \\"We're wise to acknowledge miracles.\\"      The next milestone will be removing her breathing tube, and perhaps have her sit in a chair on Friday, said Dr. Peter Rhee, trauma chief at University Medical Center, who has treated soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.      It's a far cry from Saturday when a shocked nation braced for the worst for the 40-year-old Arizona congresswoman. Several news outlets erroneously declared her dead soon after the shooting rampage that killed six. Stunned by the day's events, crowds held candlelight vigils outside the hospital and Giffords' Tucson office.      After her surgery, Dr. Richard Carmona, the former surgeon general and family friend who looked at Giffords' brain scans, gave a bleak outlook.      \\"With guarded optimism, I hope she will survive, but this is a very devastating wound,\\" he said.      But as the days ticked by, doctors shared signs of improvement even as they cautioned about a long and uncertain path to recovery. There was a glimmer of hope early on: Giffords was able to squeeze a doctor's hand in the emergency room.      By Sunday, her neurosurgeon Dr. Michael Lemole said he was \\"cautiously optimistic\\" about her survival. She could follow basic commands when they briefly eased up on her sedation.      Giffords' condition was unchanged Monday, which doctors took as a good sign. There was no further brain swelling. She could raise two fingers of her left hand and even flashed a thumbs-up, doctors reported.      The following day, doctors said Giffords was breathing on her own, but still connected to a respirator as a precaution. She was also moving both arms. Doctors gave their most confident prognosis yet: She will survive. Rhee said he was \\"101 percent\\" sure she'd pull through.      \\"She has no right to look this good and she does,\\" Lemole said.      As her sedation was scaled back, Giffords became more alert and moved on her own _ touching her wounds and fixing her hospital gown. She even scratched her nose, Lemole said.      The encouraging news continued when Gillibrand and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., stood in the hospital room Wednesday, talking, joking and touching their friend.      \\"She was rubbing our hands and gripping our hands so ... we knew she could hear and understand what we were saying and she moved her leg, and so we knew she was responding,\\" Gillibrand said. \\"And the more we joked about what we were going to do, she started to open her eyes.\\"      Giffords' husband, Mark Kelly, realized the significance of the moment. \\"Gabby, open your eyes, open your eyes,\\" he said, according to Gillibrand.      Said Schultz: \\"It felt like we were watching a miracle.\\"      So how did Giffords survive the gunshot wound? The path of the bullet, quick and quality medical care, and a stroke of luck meant the difference between life and death, say her doctors and brain experts.      Doctors think the bullet pierced the front of Giffords' head and exited the back, slicing the left side of the brain, which controls speech abilities and muscles on the right side of the body.      Had the bullet damaged both sides of the brain or struck the brain stem, which connects to the spinal cord, the outcome would likely be worse _ extensive permanent damage, vegetative state or death.      \\"So far, she's passed with flying colors of each stage\\" of her recovery, said neurologist Dr. Marc Nuwer of the University of California, Los Angeles, who is not involved in the congresswoman's treatment.      Most gunshot victims are not that fortunate. Several years ago, a Tucson police officer was shot in the head during a chase. His heart was beating when he was rushed to University Medical Center, but doctors couldn't control the bleeding in the brain and he died, Rhee said.      When Giffords arrived at the hospital, doctors first checked to make sure she didn't have any other injuries. They took a brain scan and wheeled her to the operating room in a swift 38 minutes.      The same attack in the desert many miles away from a trauma center may have led to a different ending.      \\"She's just lucky in so many ways,\\" said UCLA's Nuwer. \\"The breaks have been in her favor.

Before bringing Supernatural to television, creator Eric Kripke had been developing the series for nearly ten years, having been fascinated with urban legends since he was a child. He had originally envisioned Supernatural as a movie. He later developed it as a TV series and spent a few years pitching it before it was picked up by The WB. The concept went through several phases before becoming the eventual product, shifting from the original idea of an anthology series to one of tabloid reporters driving around the country in a van \`\`fighting the demons in search of the truth''. Kripke wanted it to be a road trip series, feeling that it was the \`\`best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories exist in these small towns all across the country, and it just makes so much sense to drive in and out of these stories.'' Is it true that is the tv show supernatural based on a book?","output":"No, the TV show Supernatural is not based on a book. The concept of the show was created and developed by Eric Kripke. As mentioned earlier, Kripke had been fascinated with urban legends since his childhood, and these legends served as a primary inspiration for the show. Although not based on a specific book, the series does draw from various sources, including folklore, mythology, religion, and popular culture. Throughout its 15-season run, Supernatural followed the lives of two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester, as they embarked on a journey to hunt and eliminate various supernatural entities, such as demons, ghosts, and even deities. Starting as a monster-of-the-week format, the show eventually evolved into exploring more complex storylines and themes, focusing on the brothers' relationships with each other and other characters. In the process of creating this rich universe, the writers of Supernatural often took inspiration from other works, such as famous pieces of literature (e.g., Dante's Inferno) and real-life subjects like demonology, angelology, and magical artifacts. However, the series as a whole is an original creation and not a direct adaptation of a book or series of books. That said, due to the popularity of the show, several tie-in novels, comic books, and other supplementary materials have been published since the beginning of the series. These additional works expand on the show's mythos and characters and can provide fans with even more stories set in the Supernatural universe. But it is essential to note that these were created as a result of the show's success and not the other way around."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When the war began, however, it declared its neutrality, arguing that because Austria-Hungary had itself declared war on Serbia, Romania was under no obligation to join the war. When the Entente Powers promised Romania Transylvania and Banat, large territories of eastern Hungary, in exchange for Romania's declaring war on the Central Powers, the Romanian government renounced its neutrality. On 27 August 1916, the Romanian Army launched an attack against Austria-Hungary, with limited Russian support. The Romanian offensive was initially successful, against the Austro-Hungarian troops in Transylvania, but a counterattack by the forces of the Central Powers drove them back. As a result of the Battle of Bucharest, the Central Powers occupied Bucharest on 6 December 1916. Fighting in Moldova continued in 1917, resulting in a costly stalemate for the Central Powers. Russian withdrawal from the war in late 1917 as a result of the October Revolution meant that Romania was forced to sign an armistice with the Central Powers on 9 December 1917.

Step-by-step translation process and justification: 1. Translating the main subject of the sentence: \\"The conflict that has erupted between Russia and Ukraine\\" translates to \\"Venäjän ja Ukrainan välinen konflikti\\", which directly references the conflict that occurred between the two countries.     2. Describing the main subject further: The phrase \\"is not merely a private bilateral legal dispute\\" translates to \\"ei ole pelkkä yksityinen kahdenvälinen oikeudellinen erimielisyys\\" in Finnish. The phrase refers to the distinction that the conflict shouldn't be considered as just a private dispute between two countries and emphasizes this with the use of \\"pelkkä\\" (meaning \\"merely\\" or \\"just\\"). 3. Connecting the effect on a broader group of people: \\"Given the fact that it affects hundreds of millions of EU citizens\\" translates to \\"koska se vaikuttaa satoihin miljooniin EU-kansalaisiin\\". The phrase \\"given the fact that\\" translates to \\"koska\\" in Finnish, which is used to provide the reason for the previous statement.

Write a title for this article: A US judge has cleared the way for a former Salvadoran colonel to face charges in Spain that he helped plan the 1989 slayings of six Jesuit priests during El Salvador’s civil war. The approval of extradition for Inocente Orlando Montano Morales marks a significant step in efforts to prosecute high-level Salvadoran military officials on charges of murdering the priests, most of whom were Spanish natives. Related: El Salvador ex-colonel fights extradition for notorious murder of Jesuit priests Montano has been the only one within reach of Spanish authorities because of legal issues in El Salvador where most of them still live. Federal magistrate judge Kimberly Swank ordered that US marshals take custody of Montano so he can be turned over to Spain, pending final approval by the State Department. The step is largely seen as a formality because lawyers for the diplomatic agency had already reviewed the case before turning it over to federal prosecutors. “In short, the government’s evidence shows (Montano) was a decision-maker and member of a group of officers who collectively ordered the unlawful killings of Jesuit priests,” Swank wrote. Montano, 73, has denied involvement in the killings. His lawyer also questioned a Spanish court’s findings on the nationalities of the five priests supposedly born in Spain and whether the “terrorist murder” counts against Montano align with similar charges in the US. Swank rejected those arguments, writing the defense was asking her to “disregard the Spanish magistrate’s interpretation and application of Spanish law ... This is no small request”. The judge also cited evidence that Montano provided information to the killers, including the location of a priest who was considered a primary target, then later threatened a witness’ wife to help conceal the crime. Montano served as the country’s vice-minister of public security and was part of an inner circle of powerful military officers. Patty Blum, a human rights lawyer who helped persuade Spanish authorities to take up the case, praised the judge for advancing a complex case with international implications. “It’s a significant finding about the role of these kinds of illegal acts committed conspiratorially by military regimes,” said Blum, a senior attorney for the nonprofit Center for Justice and Accountability. The unusual extradition fight began in 2011 when a Spanish judge issued an indictment charging Montano with the murder counts. Nineteen others were charged by Spain, with most still living in El Salvador. Blum said efforts to bring the others to Spain are essentially at a “stalemate” because of questions by Salvadoran authorities about international warrants, as well as El Salvador’s amnesty law for the war that ended in 1992. Court documents say that early on the morning of 16 November 1989, members of the Salvadoran military killed the six priests, their housekeeper and her daughter at a university in the country’s capital. The priests had been calling for discussions to end the fighting, with one of them serving as an intermediary between the government and a leftist group. The killings sparked international outrage and helped erode US support – which had included money, weapons and training – for the rightwing Salvadoran government. While two officers served short sentences in El Salvador, Montano and other high-level officials were never charged by authorities there in the priests’ killings. Montano arrived in the US in the early 2000s and worked for six years at a candy factory in a Boston suburb. He was arrested in 2011 and sentenced to nearly two years for immigration fraud and perjury. He served his time in a federal prison in North Carolina, which is why his extradition fight played out in the state. A lawyer who represented Montano during the extradition process did not immediately return a message seeking comment.","output":"\\"Big Step to Justice: US Judge Says Former Colonel Can Face Trial in Spain for Bad Things He Did Long Ago\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: In the period between the two world wars, the Danish navy  had low priority for the politicians, especially between 1929 and 1942 under Thorvald Stauning. During the first year of the German occupation , the navy assisted the occupying German forces with minesweeping, because of the political demand of keeping the infrastructure  up and running. The tensions between the German soldiers and the Danish armed forces rose slowly and, on 29 August 1943, they managed to scuttle 32 of its larger ships, while Germany succeeded in seizing 14 of the larger and 50 of the smaller vessels. This was due to a secret order, given directly to the captains by word of mouth by commander of the navy, Vice Admiral A. H. Vedel \\"to try to flee to the nearest neutral or nazi-opposed port. If that was not possible, the ship should be scuttled at as deep a location as possible\\". The Germans later succeeded in raising and refitting 15 of the sunken ships. A number of vessels had been ordered to attempt to escape to Swedish waters, and 13 succeeded. The fleet flagship, Niels Juel, attempted to break out in the Battle of Isefjord but the crew was forced to beach and partly scuttle her. The score for the larger vessels was therefore: 32 vessels were sunk, 2 were in Greenland, 4 reached Sweden, 14 were captured by the Germans. As for the smaller vessels: 9 \\"patruljekuttere\\" reached Sweden, 50 others were captured by the Germans. By the autumn of 1944, these ships officially formed a Danish naval flotilla in exile. In September 1943, A. H. Vedel was fired by order of the prime minister Vilhelm Buhl because of his hostile actions towards the Germans. Question: How many years did Thorvald Stauning run the Danish navy? Answer:","output":"Thorvald Stauning did not directly run the Danish navy; however, he was the Prime Minister of Denmark during the period between 1929 and 1942. This means he served as the Prime Minister for 13 years, during which the Danish navy had low priority in the political agenda."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance.

Write some highlights for the following article: Jennifer Lawrence ‘blindsided’ Chris Martin by breaking up with him after an intense four-month romance, it has been revealed. Friends said today that Oscar-winner Lawrence, 24, split with Martin, 37, late last week, leaving the Coldplay frontman ‘really sad’. She made the decision to end the relationship before embarking on a six-week promotional tour around the world for her new movie Mockingjay, the latest episode in the Hunger Games series, prompting the announcement on Monday. Scroll down for video. Out again: Jennifer Lawrence looked downcast as she headed to dinner with her dad Gary on Monday night in LA - just hours after confirming she had split from Chris Martin. Her main man: Jennifer turns to father Gary Lawrence after splitting with boyfriend Chris Martin. The actress is believed to have been speaking openly about the problems in the relationship to friends while promoting Mockingjay in the US. One friend said: ‘Chris wanted to spend all his free time with Jen – there was a discrepancy between how they viewed their relationship, she’s so easy going and he’s quite intense.’ And she also told friends that the Coldplay frontman, 37, was so keen on their being together that he wanted to spend all his free time with her. But throughout the brief relationship, Martin remained close to his estranged wife Paltrow, with whom he has two children, daughter Apple, ten, and Moses, eight - another source of strain for the pair. He and Paltrow, 42, announced in March that they were 'consciously uncoupling' after ten years of marriage. The source told MailOnline: ‘Jennifer said Chris is an all or nothing kind of guy, so she chose nothing. She broke up with him late last week. ‘He was completely blindsided, he was really sad about it. ‘Jen is contractually obliged for the next six weeks to promote Mockingjay and she just couldn’t see how it was going to work. ‘. Starring role: Jennifer Lawrence plays heroine Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games franchise. She is about to embark on a six-week global promotional tour ahead of the release of Mockingjay. Not enough time: Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence told friends she could not devote enough time to smitten Chris Martin. The couple were first publicly linked  in August, shortly after Jennifer split from her long-term boyfriend, British actor Nicholas Hoult, but are believed to have first struck up a romance as early as June. They quickly became a hot item and were spotted enjoying an intimate afternoon for two at the Wolffer Estate Vineyard just a few days before Jennifer’s birthday on August 15. A source told E! News at the time: 'They were there on a date. They were very low-key, nobody realised who they were. The setting was super-romantic.' The pair were seen sampling wines together, with the source adding: ‘They watched the sun go down together, then quietly left.' They then shared a string of quiet date nights at Martin's Malibu home and the romance seemed to move further into the spotlight on September 19, when Lawrence attended Coldplay's performance at the iHeartRadio music festival in Las Vegas. But throughout everything, Chris stayed close to his ex-wife Gwyneth. The ex-couple were even pictured enjoying an intimate sushi dinner in LA last week with Oscar winner Gwyneth tenderly stroking Chris's face as she left. The singer met up with Jennifer later that night. And another source claimed to MailOnline on Monday: 'Jen got tired of watching Chris play happy families with Gwyn and was annoyed that he was trying to keep her hidden away.' Still close: Gwyneth Paltrow reached out of her car to caress her ex-husband Chris Martin's face as they stopped for a chat on the side of the road following their family dinner in LA last week. Not herself: The usually bubbly actress failed to crack a smile as she headed out with her father in LA on Monday night. But a source close to Martin told US Weekly that their relationship had been ‘rocky’ due to their ‘insane’ schedules, adding: ‘They really like each other, but it’s just so complicated with so much going on.’ And while Lawrence is believed to have had a crush on Martin since she was a teenager, another source told US that the British singer was equally enamored and believed she was ‘the real deal’. Hours after the split was confirmed, a rather downcast looking Jen was seen going to dinner with her dad Gary in LA. A source confirmed to People magazine that  it was indeed Jennifer who did the dumping, saying: ‘Jen is the one who broke it off with Chris.’ Mockingjay, the first part of the final two movies from the Hunger Games series, is released on November 21 by Lionsgate. Representatives for both Jennifer and Chris declined to comment. Caught out: Jennifer and Chris enjoyed a very secretive relationship, but she was pictured in Las Vegas after attending his iHeartRadio Music Festival performance in September. Happy man: Chris looked like a transformed man in the months that he was dating Jennifer, walking through Malibu in bare feet on one occasion. Highlights:","output":"1.

In the 51 years prior to the Empire Stadium opening, the final (including 8 replays) was held in a variety of locations, predominantly in London, and mainly at the Kennington Oval and then Crystal Palace. It was played 22 times in the Oval (the inaugural competition in 1872, and then all but two times until 1892). After the Oval, Crystal Palace hosted 21 finals from 1895 to 1914, broken up by 4 four replays elsewhere. The other London venues were Stamford Bridge from 1920 to 1922 (the last three finals before the move to Empire Stadium); and Oxford University's Lillie Bridge in Fulham for the second ever final, in 1873.

The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation (if we consider the perturbation to be the occurrence of a situation in which the air is not breathable) would have a direct effect on the lung's ability to absorb air.  In the provided process, the lungs are responsible for taking in air, extracting oxygen, and releasing waste gases like carbon dioxide. This process is essential for the proper functioning and survival of the organism. When the air becomes unbreathable, it means that either the oxygen levels in the air are too low or the air is contaminated with toxic substances that can harm the lungs or impede gas exchange. In such a case, the lungs would not be able to effectively extract oxygen from the air or may fail to carry out the gas exchange process altogether. This scenario would significantly impact the organism's ability to provide oxygen to the cells and tissues, which could lead to potential health issues or even fatal consequences. Therefore, the perturbation of unbreathable air directly affects the lung's ability to absorb air and perform its essential functions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose lung is not healthy happens, how will it affect the lung is not able to expand.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of respiration if the lungs are not healthy and unable to expand properly. The main components of the respiration process are inhalation, gas exchange, and exhalation. If the lungs cannot expand fully, this will impact each stage of the process as detailed below: 1. Inhalation: When the lungs are unable to expand properly, the volume of air that can be drawn in during inhalation is limited. This can result in insufficient oxygen intake for the body's needs, potentially leading to shortness of breath, fatigue, and other symptoms. 2. Gas Exchange: In healthy lungs, oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream through the alveoli (tiny air sacs in the lungs), while carbon dioxide in the blood diffuses into the alveoli and is subsequently exhaled. If the lungs cannot expand fully, the surface area for gas exchange may be reduced, leading to decreased efficiency in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. This can cause a buildup of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream and reduced levels of oxygen, which can have negative effects on various bodily functions. 3. Exhalation: If the lungs are unable to expand adequately, the muscles responsible for exhalation may have to work harder to expel the air from the lungs to create space for fresh air. This can lead to increased breathing effort and an overall decline in respiratory efficiency. The direct effects of the perturbation would include reduced oxygen intake, impaired gas exchange, and increased breathing effort. Indirectly, these effects could lead to a range of health issues, including fatigue, dizziness, impaired cognitive function, decreased exercise tolerance, and even organ damage due to sustained low oxygen levels. In severe cases, respiratory failure could occur if the lungs are incapable of providing sufficient oxygen or removing carbon dioxide from the body. It is essential to address any underlying lung conditions or factors causing reduced lung expansion to maintain optimal respiratory function and overall health. Some common conditions that can cause lung problems include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, and lung cancer."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Article: The most popular names in the west Every year in Englishspeaking countries,people list the most popular names. Here are some examples. In the United States at the moment the three most popular names for girls are Emily,Emma and Madison. For boys,they are Michael,Joshua and Mathew. In Britain a parent today might call their little girl Grace,Jessica or Ruby. If they have a little boy they could call him Jack,Thomas or Oliver. In China names have very clear meanings. If a girl is called Mei,her name means \\"beautiful\\". If a boy is called Wu,his name means \\"like a soldier\\". Names in Englishspeaking countries are like this too. The girl's name Joy is probably partly chosen because the parents wish their daughter to be joyful and bring joy to others. If a girl is called Ruby,it may be because of the beautiful red precious stone. Parents often pick names that can be shortened. This can be confusing for Chinese people. Parents might choose such names because they want to be able to speak to their kid in a personal way. For example,a popular name is William. But William can be shortened to Will,Willy,Bill and Billy. The same is true of the favourite old name for a girl,Elizabeth. Elizabeth can be shortened to Beth,Liza and Liz. Another reason why kids get the names they do is that parents want to name their boy or girl after someone who is famous,such as an actor,a pop music star or a sports star.
