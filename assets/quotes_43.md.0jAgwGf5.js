Our task is equivalent to proving: ( T = ) IntegerConvexHull ( (T) ). 5. **State the lemma:**    Lemma: ( T = { (L, lfloor L frac{n}{z+n} rfloor) | L in {0,ldots,z+n}} bigcup { (L, lceil L frac{n}{z+n} rceil) | L in {0,ldots,z+n}} ). 6. **Prove the lemma:**    - For any ( L in {0,ldots,z+n} ), consider all arcs of length ( L ).    - The minimum and maximum ( N )-values of those arcs differ by at most 1.    - The average ( N )-value of those arcs is ( a := L frac{n}{z+n} ).    - If ( a ) is an integer, then all arcs of length ( L ) must have ( N )-value ( a ).    - If ( a ) is not an integer, their ( N )-values must be ( lfloor a rfloor ) or ( lceil a rceil ) (both must occur for the average to be ( a )). 7. **Conclude from the lemma:**    The lemma implies that ( T ) equals its IntegerConvexHull because it shows that ( T = T' bigcap mathbb{Z}^2 ) where ( T' = { (L, y) | 0 leq L leq z+n,  |y - L frac{n}{z+n}| < 1} ), which is a convex set. 8. **Final conclusion:**    Since ( T = ) IntegerConvexHull ( (T) ), it follows that ( S = ) IntegerConvexHull ( (S) ).

This row must be either ( ABABA ) or ( BABAB ). The adjacent rows must then be composed of ( C ) and ( D ) in a similar alternating pattern. This pattern propagates throughout the table, ensuring all rows (or columns) have only two distinct letters.    - **Claim 2:** If one row (or column) has three or four distinct letters, then all columns (or rows) have only two distinct letters.      - **Proof:** Assume a row has three distinct letters, say ( A, B, C ). The only way to satisfy the ( 2 times 2 ) subtable condition is for the adjacent rows to have the remaining letter ( D ) and repeat the pattern.

First Solution: 1. **Identify the Neighbors and Divisibility by 2**:     - Every prime number greater than 3 is not divisible by 3 and is an odd number.      - Therefore, its neighbors (one less and one more) will both be even numbers since the prime itself is odd. 2. **Divisibility by 3**:     - In every sequence of three consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 3. This is because every third integer is a multiple of 3.     [     a, a+1, a+2 quad text{with one divisible by 3}     ] 3. **Combination of 2 and 3**:     - Since one of the neighbors is divisible by 2 and one in every three consecutive numbers is divisible by 3, the product of these two facts means at least one of the neighbors must be divisible by 6 (since (2 times 3 = 6)). This follows because the even number divisible by 3 would meet the condition.  Second Solution: 1. **Form of Prime Numbers Greater than 3**:     - Any prime number greater than 3 can be represented in the form (6n pm 1).     - As for other forms:         - (6n), (6npm 2) are even.         - (6n+3), (6n-3) are divisible by 3. 2. **Prime Representation (6n pm 1)**:     - For a prime number (p) represented as (6n pm 1), its direct neighbors in the sequence are (6n) and (6n+2) or (6n-2) and (6n). 3. **Divisibility by 6 of Neighbors**:     - Analyzing the neighbors (6n) (the number itself divisible by 6) confirms the statement that the prime’s neighbors include a multiple of 6.

First, let's recall the definition of an odd function: f(-x) = -f(x). However, for logarithmic functions, we use the property that f(-x) + f(x) = 0 to find the condition for a because the sum of the function evaluated at x and at -x should equal 0 if the function is odd. Given f(x)={log_a}({sqrt{{x^2}+3a}-x}), let's evaluate f(-x) and then sum it with f(x): 1. f(-x) = log_a(sqrt{x^2+3a}+x) because replacing x with -x changes the sign inside the function. 2. Adding f(x) and f(-x), we get:    [    f(x) + f(-x) = log_a(sqrt{x^2+3a}-x) + log_a(sqrt{x^2+3a}+x)    ] 3.

To find out how many days it will take for p and q to complete the 2400 units of work together, we divide the total work by the combined work per day: 2400 units / 160 units per day = 15 days Therefore, it will take p and q boxed{15}  days to complete the work together."},{"instruction":"Let v_n be the n^text{th} term of the sequence [2,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,7,,,,,,,8,,,,,,,12,,,,,,,15,,,,,,,16,,,,,,,20,,,,,,,24,,,,,,,27,,,,,,,28,ldots,] where the first term is the smallest positive integer that is 2 more than a multiple of 5, the next two terms are the next two smallest positive integers that are each three more than a multiple of 5, the next three terms are the next three smallest positive integers that are each four more than a multiple of 5, the next four terms are the next four smallest positive integers that are each five more than a multiple of 5, and so on: [underbrace{2}_{1text{ term}},,,,,,,underbrace{3,,,,,,,7}_{2text{ terms}},,,,,,,underbrace{8,,,,,,,12,,,,,,,15}_{3text{ terms}},,,,,,,underbrace{16,,,,,,,20,,,,,,,24,,,,,,,27}_{4text{ terms}},,,,,,,underbrace{28,ldots}_{5text{ terms}},,,,,,,ldots.] Determine v_{1005}.","output":"First, identify the pattern of the sequence: - Difference between consecutive terms within a group equals 5. - Difference between the first term of the group with n+1 terms and the last term of the group with n terms is 1.

The product of all 10 terms can be simplified using the properties of geometric sequences: begin{align*} a_1a_2dots a_{10} &= a_1(a_1cdot r)(a_1cdot r^2)dots(a_1cdot r^9)  &= a_1^{10} cdot r^{1+2+dots+9}  &= a_1^{10} cdot r^{45}. end{align*} We can also express a_5^2 cdot r as (a_1 cdot r^4)^2 cdot r: begin{align*} a_5^2 cdot r &= (a_1 cdot r^4)^2 cdot r  &= a_1^2 cdot r^{8+1}  &= a_1^2 cdot r^9. end{align*} Since a_5^2 cdot r = 81 and 81 = 3^4, we have: a_1^2 cdot r^9 = 3^4, and therefore: a_1^{10} cdot r^{45} = (a_1^2 cdot r^9)^5 = (3^4)^5 = 3^{20}. Now, let's find log_3(a_1a_2...a_{10}): begin{align*} log_3(a_1a_2dots a_{10}) &= log_3(3^{20})  &= 20. end{align*} Therefore, the sum of logarithms we want to find is boxed{20}."},{"instruction":"Rachel is an artist.

We need to show that the quadrilateral ABDG is cyclic. To do this, we will show that the angles subtended by the chord AD at points B and G are equal. **Step 3: Angle Calculation and Proof of Concyclicity** 1. By construction, we know FD perp BC at D and EG perp BH at G. 2. Let line CH meet AB at point X.     3. Since H is the orthocenter of triangle ABC, angles BHC and BAC are supplementary.     4. Angle BHC = 180^circ - angle A and since F is on the extension of CH, HFC forms a straight line, thus angle BHF = angle HFB. 5. Now, consider triangle BFD: Since FD perp BC, angle BDF = 90^circ and angle BFD = angle EFB (as HF = CE by construction). 6. As a result, angle BFD = angle EFD. 7. Consider triangle BEG: Since EG perp BH, the angle angle BEG subtended by the chord BG in the circle around triangle ABG is also subtended at A. 8. Now, the angles angle BDF and angle BEG are equal since they subtend the same arcs BG and BA respectively. Thus, A, B, D, G are concyclic since angle BAD = angle BGD as they subtend the same chord. **Step 4: Prove that O_1, O_2, M, N are concyclic** 1. Here, we need to show that points O_1, O_2, M, and N lie on the same circle. **Step 5: Employing Circle Properties and Definitions** 1. By definition, O_1 and O_2 are the circumcenters of circles odot O_1 and odot O_2 respectively. 2. Consider triangle MNO_1: M is the midpoint of CF, so M lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment CF. 3. Point N is another intersection of odot O_1 and odot O_2, implying that N lies on the radical axis of odot O_1 and odot O_2, meaning all power of point properties are equivalent. 4. Since M is equidistant from both O_1 and O_2, this implies that MO_1 = MO_2. 5. Therefore, quadrilateral O_1O_2MN is a cyclic quadrilateral since all angle sums satisfy the cyclic property.

For clarity, we reflect the table across its borders to visualize a straight path of ball P. By reflecting the 4 times 6 table four times, the moving direction of ball P can be depicted on a larger grid where ball P travels in a straight line through multiple reflections of the table. This helps us compute the required trajectory directly. 4. Since the table reflects four times, the vertical distance covered is 4 times 4 = 16 and the horizontal distance covered is 6 times 1 = 6. 5. The line connecting ball P's initial position to ball Q's position within this expanded grid passes through grid points that correspond to valid positions on the original table. 6. When ball P is struck, the positions it would initially reflect off of are studied. Because the ball must hit the sides in the order AB rightarrow BC rightarrow CD rightarrow DA and finally hit ball Q, the point on AB must be chosen such that this sequence leads directly to ball Q. 7.

Given that 0 < A, C < frac{pi}{2}, we know sin A > 0 and sin C > 0. Therefore, we can divide both sides by sin A sin C (which are positive), yielding:    [    cos B = frac{1}{2}    ] 6. From the above, we deduce that B = frac{pi}{3}. 7. Using the sine rule, frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}, we can find expressions for b and c:    [    b = frac{a sin B}{sin A} = frac{2sqrt{3} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2}}{sin A} = frac{3}{sin A}    ]    [    c = frac{a sin C}{sin A}    ] 8. The perimeter of triangle ABC is a + b + c. Substituting the expressions for b and c, we get:    [    a + b + c = 2sqrt{3} + frac{3}{sin A} + frac{2sqrt{3} sin(frac{2pi}{3} - A)}{sin A}    ]    Simplifying further using trigonometric identities, we find:    [    a + b + c = frac{3}{tanfrac{A}{2}} + 3sqrt{3}    ] 9. Given the constraints on A, we find that frac{pi}{12} < frac{A}{2} < frac{pi}{4}, which implies 2 - sqrt{3} < tanfrac{A}{2} < 1. 10. Therefore, the range of the perimeter of triangle ABC is in the interval (3 + 3sqrt{3}, 6 + 6sqrt{3}).

Given that the slope of the tangent at x = e is 3, we have f'(e) = 3, thus a + ln e + 1 = 3. Knowing that ln e = 1, we find a + 1 + 1 = 3, so a = boxed{1}. (2) To prove the given inequality, let's use the value of a from (1). Now we have f(x) = x + xln x. Define a new function g(x) = frac{f(x)}{x - 1} = frac{x + xln x}{x - 1}. Then the derivative of g(x) is given as g'(x) = frac{x - ln x - 2}{(x - 1)^2}. Now consider another function h(x) = x - ln x - 2 (where x > 1), and its derivative is h'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x} = frac{x - 1}{x} > 0 for x > 1. This shows that h(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (1, infty). Since h(3) = 1 - ln 3 < 0 and h(4) = 2 - 2ln 2 > 0, it means the equation h(x) = 0 has a unique real root x_0 in the interval (3, 4). When 1 < x < x_0, we have h(x) < 0, which implies that g'(x) < 0. When x > x_0, we have h(x) > 0, which implies that g'(x) > 0. Therefore, the function g(x) = frac{x + xln x}{x - 1} is monotonically decreasing on the interval (1, x_0) and monotonically increasing on the interval (x_0, infty). The minimum value of g(x) occurs at x = x_0 and is calculated as g(x_0) = frac{x_0(1 + ln x_0)}{x_0 - 1} = frac{x_0(x_0 - 1)}{x_0 - 1} = x_0.

We will use Burnside's Lemma to count the number of distinct colorings. 1. **List the Group of Rotations:**     The group of rotations of a regular tetrahedron has order 12 and can be decomposed as follows:     - The identity rotation.     - 8 rotations by (120^circ) or (240^circ) around axes passing through a vertex and the center of the opposite face (there are 4 such axes, each contributing 2 rotations).     - 3 rotations by (180^circ) around axes passing through the midpoints of opposite edges (there are 3 such axes). 2. **Counting Fixed Colorings for Each Type of Rotation:**     - **Identity rotation:** Every coloring remains unchanged. Thus, it has (n^4) fixed colorings.     - **120-degree and 240-degree rotations:** These rotations cycle 3 faces among themselves while fixing one face. To be unchanged, the 3 cycled faces must have the same color. Thus, there are (n cdot n cdot n = n^2) fixed colorings for each rotation. With 8 such rotations in total, this gives (8 cdot n^2).     - **180-degree rotations:** These rotations include switching pairs of opposite faces. For the coloring to remain the same, each pair of opposite faces must be the same color. Hence, there are (n cdot n cdot n cdot n = n^2) fixed colorings for each rotation, and with 3 such rotations, this gives (3 cdot n^2). 3. **Apply Burnside's Lemma:**     Burnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct objects under a group of symmetries is the average number of fixed points of each group element. Thus, we calculate:     [     text{Number of distinct colorings} = frac{1}{12} left( n^4 + 8n^2 + 3n^2 right) = frac{1}{12} left( n^4 + 11n^2 right)     ] 4. **Equation Setup:**     Given that there are (n^3) distinct colorings, we set up the equation:     [     frac{1}{12} left( n^4 + 11n^2 right) = n^3     ] 5. **Simplify and Solve:**     Multiply both sides by 12 to clear the fraction:     [     n^4 + 11n^2 = 12n^3     ]     Rearrange terms:     [     n^4 - 12n^3 + 11n^2 = 0     ]     Factor out (n^2):     [     n^2 (n^2 - 12n + 11) = 0     ]     Solve the quadratic equation:     [     n^2 - 12n + 11 = 0     ]     Use the quadratic formula (n = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}) where (a = 1), (b = -12), and (c = 11):     [     n = frac{12 pm sqrt{144 - 44}}{2} = frac{12 pm sqrt{100}}{2} = frac{12 pm 10}{2}     ]     Thus, the solutions are:     [     n = frac{12 + 10}{2} = 11 quad text{and} quad n = frac{12 - 10}{2} = 1     ] # Conclusion: The possible values of (n) that satisfy the given conditions are: (boxed{1 text{ and } 11})"},{"instruction":"the diagram, points A, B, C, D, E, and F lie on a straight line with AB=BC=CD=DE=EF=3.

Repeat this operation until the minimum distance becomes zero (i.e., the chips coincide), which will happen eventually given that distances are integers.    - If the required chips have been aligned, the goal is achieved. Otherwise, take one of the required chips that coincided and shift it to align with the remaining one.    - Lemma is thus proven as blacksquare. 3. **Main Proof:**    - Consider the chips A, B, C, D on the coordinate plane.    - Project these chips onto one of the axes, say the x-axis.    - The projections will also move according to the same rule, i.e., if a chip is shifted by a vector, its projection is shifted by the projection of this vector.    - Use the lemma to align the projections of chips A and B by considering the projection of chip C as the third chip.    - Treat chips A and B as a single entity X (moving X means moving A and B sequentially along the required vector; their projections remain aligned).    - Align the projections of X and C.

Therefore, (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c})^2 ≤ frac{49}{36}, and hence frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} ≤ frac{7}{6}. Thus, the maximum value of frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} is boxed{frac{7}{6}}.    The equality holds if and only if frac{1}{a} = frac{4}{b} = frac{9}{c}, which gives a = frac{7}{6}, b = frac{14}{3}, and c = frac{21}{2}."},{"instruction":"Prove that for any triangle, the segment connecting the centers of the inscribed and escribed circles is bisected by the circumcircle.","output":"1.

Let the extension of the bisector of angle ( B ) intersect the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ) at point ( M ). 3. We need to prove ( MO = MO_b ).     4. Consider angles involving point ( M ) and points ( O ) and ( O_b ) where:    [    angle AOM = angle OAC + angle CAM = frac{angle A + angle B}{2}    ]    and    [    angle OAM = angle OAC + angle CAM = frac{angle A}{2} + frac{angle C + angle B}{2} = frac{angle A + angle B + angle C}{2} = frac{180^{circ}}{2} = 90^{circ}    ] 5.

Now, let's find out how many boxes each worker on the day crew and night crew loaded. Each worker on the day crew loaded: (Day crew boxes) / (Number of day crew workers) = [(2/3)B] / D Each worker on the night crew loaded: (Night crew boxes) / (Number of night crew workers) = [(1/3)B] / N Now, we substitute N with (2/3)D: = [(1/3)B] / [(2/3)D] = (1/3)B * (3/2) / D = (1/2)B / D Now, we want to find the ratio of boxes loaded by each worker on the night crew to each worker on the day crew: (Night crew per worker) / (Day crew per worker) = [(1/2)B / D] / [(2/3)B / D] When we divide fractions, we multiply by the reciprocal of the second fraction: = [(1/2)B / D] * [D / (2/3)B] The D in the numerator and denominator cancels out, as does the B: = (1/2) * (3/2) = 3/4 So, each worker on the night crew loaded boxed{3/4}  as many boxes as each worker on the day crew."},{"instruction":"The average weight of a group of people increases by 2.5 kg when a new person comes in place of one of them weighing 65 kg.

The discount on the shoes is 10% of 95, which is: 0.10 * 95 = 9.50 So the discounted price of the shoes is: 95 - 9.50 = 85.50 Now we need to calculate the sales tax on the discounted price, which is 5%: 0.05 * 85.50 = 4.275 The total price Tobias paid for the shoes after adding the sales tax is: 85.50 + 4.275 = 89.775 Since we can't have a fraction of a cent, we'll round this to the nearest cent, which is 89.78. Now let's calculate how much money Tobias had before buying the shoes.

The sequence ( f_n ) will be linear polynomials, and their roots will always be real. Thus, the base case holds. 2. **Inductive Step:**    - Assume the statement is true for all polynomials of degree ( d-1 ). We need to show it holds for a polynomial ( f ) of degree ( d ). 3. **Assumption:**    - Assume ( f' ) has only real roots. Let the roots of ( f' ) be ( x_1 > x_2 > cdots > x_{d-1} ). 4. **Lemma 1:**    - We claim that ( |x_1|, |x_2|, ldots, |x_{d-1}| = O(n) ). This means that the absolute values of the roots of ( f' ) grow at most linearly with ( n ).    **Proof of Lemma 1:**    - Consider the polynomial ( f_n(x) = A_0(n)x^d + A_1(n)x^{d-1} + cdots + A_d(n) ) where ( A_i(n) ) are polynomials in ( n ) with ( deg A_i(n) leq i ). This implies that the coefficients of ( f_n ) grow polynomially with ( n ), and hence the roots of ( f_n ) grow at most linearly with ( n ). 5. **Lemma 2:**    - We claim that ( |f(x_1)|, |f(x_2)|, ldots, |f(x_{d-1})| ) are unbounded with respect to ( n ).    **Proof of Lemma 2:**    - By induction on ( d ), assume that between ( x_i ) and ( x_{i+1} ), there is some ( y_i ) with ( |f'(y_i)| geq 1 ). Using the convexity argument, we can show that there exists some ( z_i in [x_{i+1}, x_i] ) such that ( |(f + f')(z_i) - f(x_i)| > frac{D}{n} ) for some constant ( D ). This implies that the sequence ( |f(x_i)| ) grows at least like ( sum frac{1}{n} ), thus diverging, proving Lemma 2. 6. **Monotonicity and Alternating Signs:**    - Note that ( f(x_1), f(x_2), ldots, f(x_{d-1}) ) are monotonous. As their absolute values are unbounded, their signs must be constant from some point. Observing the direction of monotonicity, we see that the signs are alternating. 7. **Conclusion:**    - Since the signs of ( f(x_1), f(x_2), ldots, f(x_{d-1}) ) are alternating and their absolute values are unbounded, it follows that ( f_n ) will have real roots for sufficiently large ( n ). Thus, there exists a number ( N ) such that for every ( n ge N ), all roots of ( f_n ) are real.

There are several possible relationships between two circles: 1. Separate: d > R_1 + R_2 2. Tangent externally: d = R_1 + R_2 3. Intersecting: |R_2 - R_1| < d < R_1 + R_2 4. Tangent internally: d = |R_2 - R_1| 5. One circle contained within the other: d < |R_2 - R_1| We see that d = 3. The sum of the radii is R_1 + R_2 = 1 + 3 = 4. Since d is less than the sum of the radii, we check if they are intersecting or one circle is contained within the other: Since d is equal to R_2 and greater than R_1, we have:  d = R_2 > R_1  From this, we know that the larger circle (O_2 with radius 3) encloses the smaller circle (O_1 with radius 1), and that they are tangent internally since the distance between their centers is equal to the radius of the larger circle.

We start by understanding that the total probability is 1. The probability of xi being less than or equal to 5 can be seen as the complement of it being greater than 5. Thus, we can write: [ P(xi leq 5) = 1 - P(xi > 5) = 1 - P(xi leq 1) = 1 - 0.23 = 0.77 ] Therefore, Option A is correct. **For Option B:** Given X sim B(5, frac{2}{3}), we first find the variance of X, Var(X): [ Var(X) = n cdot p cdot (1-p) = 5 cdot frac{2}{3} cdot frac{1}{3} = frac{10}{9} ] For the transformation 3X+1, the variance is affected by the scale factor but not by the shift, so: [ Var(3X+1) = 9 cdot Var(X) = 9 cdot frac{10}{9} = 10 ] However, the question incorrectly states Var(3X+1) = 11.

Let's consider the given scenario: We have 12 points on a plane such that the distance between any two points is at most 3 meters. 2. We need to determine whether it is always possible to select 4 points from these 12 points such that the distance between any two of these selected 4 points does not exceed 2 meters. 3. We can construct a counterexample to show that it is not always possible. Suppose we place the 12 points on the circumference of a circle with diameter 3 meters. 4. If we label these 12 points as A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{12}, they form a regular dodecagon (a polygon with 12 equal sides). Hence, the distance between each pair of adjacent points is less than or equal to A_1A_2 = frac{3}{2} approx 1.5 meters. 5. Through calculations, we observe:    [    begin{aligned}    A_1A_2 & < A_1A_3 = frac{3}{sqrt{2}} approx 2.12     & = A_1A_4 < ldots < A_1A_6 < A_1A_7 = 3.    end{aligned}    ] 6. Now, considering any 4 points, no matter how we choose them, we observe the distances between these points. For instance, if we select A_1, A_2, A_3, and A_4, the maximum distance is A_1A_4 = frac{3}{sqrt{2}} > 2 meters. 7. That is, the farthest pair of points among these four points on the arc will always have at least one pair where the distance exceeds 2 meters. 8. Therefore, in this configuration, it is clear that it is not possible to select four points out of the twelve such that the pairwise distance between any two of the four points does not exceed 2 meters. # Conclusion: Thus, it is not always possible to select 4 points from these 12 points satisfying the given distance condition. boxed{text{No}}"},{"instruction":"One angle of a parallelogram is 150 degrees, and two consecutive sides have lengths of 5 inches and 20 inches.

Since ( k ) divides both terms, ( p ) must divide ( k ) as well.      3. **Consider ( p = 2 )**:     - If ( m ) and ( n ) are both greater than 1, they must both be odd (since ( p = 2 )).     - Therefore, ( m ) and ( n ) are odd, implying the sum ( 1 + m + cdots + m^{n - 1} ) is also odd.     - However, ( 2^m mid m^n - 1 leq m^m - 1 ), which means:       [       2^m leq m^m - 1       ]     - This is impossible because ( 2^m > m - 1 ) for any ( m > 1 ). Hence, ( k ) cannot be divisible by 2.      4. **Consider ( p ) is an odd prime**:     - First observe that ( p^m mid m^n - 1 leq m^m - 1 ), thus ( p < m ).     - Let ( omega ) be the order of ( m mod p ), a result from number theory indicates:       [       p mid m^omega - 1       ]     - Applying the Lifting The Exponent (LTE) lemma gives:       [       v_p(m^n - 1) = v_p(m^omega - 1) + v_pleft(frac{n}{omega}right) = v_p(m^omega - 1)       ]     - This implies:       [       p^m mid m^omega - 1       ]     - Choose ( omega leq p - 1 ), thus:       [       p^m < m^omega leq m^p       ]     - For ( p geq 3 ), the inequality ( p^m > m^p ) holds due to exponential growth properties, yielding a contradiction. 5. **Conclusion**:     - From part 3 and 4, ( k ) cannot have any prime divisors. Therefore, ( k = 1 ).     - The solutions are ( (m, n, 1) ) for any positive integers ( m ) and ( n ), and ( (1, 1, k) ) for any positive integer ( k ).

The function f(x) = -x^2 + 2x has a parabolic graph that opens downward, with the axis of symmetry being x=1. Therefore, this function is not an odd function. The function f(x) is a decreasing function on (1, +∞), and the graph of f(x+1) is obtained by shifting the graph of f(x) one unit to the left.

Since f(-x) = |-x-1|^(1/2) = |x+1|^(1/2) ≠ |x-1|^(1/2) = f(x), f(x) is not an odd function.    f(x+1) = |x+1-1|^(1/2) = |x|^(1/2), which is an increasing function on (0, 1).    f(frac{1}{2}) = |frac{1}{2} - 1|^{frac{1}{2}} = (frac{1}{2})^{frac{1}{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} > frac{1}{2}    Since f(x+1) = |x|^(1/2) is an even function with a graph symmetric about x=0, the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the line x=1. In summary, propositions r and s hold true for all three functions. Answer: boxed{text{C}} 1. The first function is a quadratic function. From its axis of symmetry (x=1) and the fact that it opens downward, we can determine that it is neither an odd nor an even function. Its monotonicity on (1, +∞) helps us determine the monotonicity after shifting it one unit to the left. 2. The second function simplifies to sin(πx/2) using the cofunction identity, after which we can evaluate each proposition. 3. The third function utilizes the definition of odd and even functions to determine its symmetry, and finding f(x+1) helps us determine its monotonicity on (0, 1). We use the graph's translation to determine the function's axis of symmetry. This problem tests our understanding of the truth or falsity of propositions and their application, as well as the composite function's odd/even properties, monotonicity, and symmetry.

This gives us the inequality: [x + 2 geqslant 0] 2. The fraction frac{1}{x-1} requires the denominator x-1 to be non-zero to avoid division by zero.

Strategy: We'll split the solution into two approaches for thoroughness. # Approach I:  Step 1: Assumption and Initial Configuration 1. Assume that red beads (denoted as ( R )) have the highest count among the colors. 2. Arrange all of the beads in sequence, starting with all the red beads, followed by blue, yellow, and then green beads.  Step 2: Create Sub-arrays and Rearrange 3. Divide this sequence into two equal parts, say part A and part B. 4. Rearrange the sequence by placing part B directly underneath part A (without reversing the beads). [ begin{array}{cccccccccc} R & R & R & R & cdots & R & B & B & B & cdots  B & B & B & B & cdots & Y & Y & Y & Y & cdots end{array} ]  Step 3: Interweaving the Sub-arrays 5. Form the final necklace by interweaving the two parts. This ensures that beads from part A alternate with beads from part B.  Verification: 6. The necklace starts with a red bead. Since no color has more than 50 beads and the total count is 100, the second part shouldn’t have any red beads if red is the most frequent color. 7. This method ensures that no two beads of the same color are adjacent since the only potential conflict would require both beads from part A and B to be of the same color at the same position, which is avoided by alternating between the two exact halves. Thus, this configuration successfully avoids adjacent beads of the same color, proving the statement. # Approach II:  Step 1: Notation and Assumption 1. Let ( p, k, s, z ) represent the counts of red, blue, yellow, and green beads, respectively. 2. Assume ( p geq k geq s geq z ).  Step 2: Create a Primary Sequence 3. Create an initial sequence just as in Approach I, but this time, cut the sequence into pieces where each piece contains ( p ) beads (except possibly the last piece which may have fewer beads if ( p ) does not divide the total exactly). [ begin{array}{cccc} R & R & R & cdots & B & B & cdots & G  B & B & Y & Y & cdots & Y & G & G  end{array} ]  Step 3: Rearrange the Sequence 4. Stack these pieces one below the other and start interweaving from the top towards the bottom.  Step 4: Analysis of Patterns 5. Given ( p leq 50 ), this ensures that at least some colors (those with counts less than ( p )) cannot appear in full length in each piece. 6. As a result, no two same colored beads from different parts will align directly above or below each other, ensuring no same color beads are adjacent.      Conclusion: Thus, whether using either approach I or II, we obtain that we can construct a necklace with no two adjacent beads of the same color, given the conditions.

Let's call the number of welders who left X. Therefore, the number of welders remaining is 36 - X. The remaining welders need 3.0000000000000004 more days to complete the rest of the order.

Then:     [     y = frac{2 + frac{m^2}{2}}{2} = frac{m^2 + 4}{4}, quad x = frac{frac{m^2}{2} - 2}{2} = frac{m^2 - 4}{4}.     ] 6. **Conclusion for Infinite Sequence**:     By repeatedly applying the above results, starting from any square (m_1 = a_1^2 > 4), we can construct an appropriate sequence. At each step, we can always find an appropriate (a_{k+1}^2) such that the sum of squares remains a perfect square. Therefore, an infinite sequence of such squares exists. 7. **Example Recurrence**:     Suppose the sequence starts with (a_1^2 = 16) (where (a_1 = 4)).

Seventeen customers bought one melon each, so that's 17 * 1 = 17 watermelons. Ten customers bought two melons each, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 watermelons. Now, let's add the number of watermelons sold to customers who bought one or two melons: 17 (one melon each) + 20 (two melons each) = 37 watermelons.

Let the length of this path be ( ell ). 2. **Relative Positioning:**    - Without loss of generality (WLOG), assume that robot ( B ) is above robot ( A ). This means that robot ( B ) is either directly above or to the right of robot ( A ). 3. **Movement Analysis:**    - When robot ( A ) moves one square along the path towards ( B ), two scenarios can occur:      - **Scenario (i):** Robot ( B ) moves in the same direction as robot ( A ). In this case, the path length ( ell ) remains constant because the distance decreased by one on ( A )'s side and increased by one on ( B )'s side.      - **Scenario (ii):** Robot ( B ) cannot move in the same direction as ( A ). In this case, the path length ( ell ) decreases because ( A ) moves closer to ( B ). 4. **Path Traversal:**    - Move robot ( A ) to the original position of robot ( B ) along the path. If at any point ( A ) coincides with ( B ), we have achieved our goal.    - If ( A ) does not coincide with ( B ), continue moving ( A ) to ( B )'s new position and repeat the process. 5. **Contradiction Argument:**    - Suppose, for the sake of contradiction (FTSOC), that scenario (ii) never occurs. This implies that both robots ( A ) and ( B ) are making the same moves, and ( B ) is always above ( A ).    - Consequently, every time ( A ) moves to ( B )'s previous location, both robots are moving upwards by at least one square.    - This leads to an absurd situation where ( B ) would move upwards by ( m ) squares, which is impossible since the grid has height ( m ) and ( B ) cannot start from the bottom row. 6. **Conclusion:**    - Therefore, scenario (ii) must occur at least once, causing the path length ( ell ) to decrease.    - By repeating the process described in steps 3 and 4, the path length ( ell ) will eventually reduce to zero, meaning that robots ( A ) and ( B ) will coincide. 7. **Induction Step:**    - By induction, if we can bring two robots to the same square, we can extend this argument to any number of robots by iteratively applying the same process to pairs of robots.

Given that g(2+x) is an even function, we have: begin{align*} g(2+x) &= g(2-x)  end{align*} This implies that g(x) is symmetric about x=2.

Let's consider the given problem. We need to determine if the statement \\"If two sides and three angles of one triangle are equal to two sides and three angles of another triangle, then such triangles are congruent\\" is true. 2. To solve the problem, let's examine the concept of similarity and congruence of triangles:    **Similarity of Triangles**:     - Triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are equal and the lengths of their corresponding sides are proportional.        **Congruence of Triangles**:    - Triangles are congruent if they have exactly the same three sides and angles. This means they are identical in shape and size. 3. Consider two triangles triangle ABC and triangle DEF where the sides are given as follows:    [triangle ABC: 8, 12, 18 ]    [triangle DEF: 12, 18, 27] 4.

Check the angles:    - In similar triangles, all corresponding angles are equal. Therefore:      [      angle A = angle D, quad angle B = angle E, quad angle C = angle F      ] 6. Since the corresponding angles are equal and the sides are proportional, the two triangles are similar but not necessarily congruent. 7. As an example, we can see that the given triangles with sides 8, 12, 18 and 12, 18, 27 do exist:    - Verify the triangle inequality theorem for both triangles to ensure they are valid triangles:      [      8 + 12 > 18, quad 8 + 18 > 12, quad 12 + 18 > 8 quad (text{True})      ]      [      12 + 18 > 27, quad 12 + 27 > 18, quad 18 + 27 > 12 quad (text{True})      ] 8.

We will derive the area of each type separately. 4. **Formation of Alternate Triangular Arrangement**:    By symmetry and rearrangement, we can consider an octagon whose sides alternate between 3 and 2. This formed octagon will be equivalent to the original one’s area. 5. **Designing an Equivalent Octagon**:    Visualize a large square with side length considered as a potential side including diagonal perturbations introduced by the octagon's sides. 6. **Calculating the Square Equivalent**:    - The side length summation due to triangles setup gives us insight into a composite structure:      [ text{Side length} = 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10 text{ (4 sides of 3 and 2 each.)}] 7. **Building the Composite Square**:    - Each large octagon formed effectively shapes out corners.

Consider the boundary conditions. For a square in the interior of the board (not on the edge or corner), there are 4 neighbors. For a square on the edge but not a corner, there are 3 neighbors. For a corner square, there are 2 neighbors. 3. Let's denote the average of all the integers on the chessboard by ( A ). Since each integer is the average of its neighbors, we can write:    [    a_{i,j} = A quad text{for all } (i,j)    ] 4. To prove that all ( a_{i,j} ) are equal, assume for contradiction that there exist two squares ( (i_1, j_1) ) and ( (i_2, j_2) ) such that ( a_{i_1, j_1} neq a_{i_2, j_2} ). Without loss of generality, assume ( a_{i_1, j_1} > a_{i_2, j_2} ). 5. Since ( a_{i_1, j_1} ) is the average of its neighbors, and ( a_{i_1, j_1} ) is greater than at least one of its neighbors (otherwise, it would not be the average), there must be a neighboring square ( (k,l) ) such that ( a_{k,l} < a_{i_1, j_1} ). 6. Similarly, since ( a_{i_2, j_2} ) is the average of its neighbors, and ( a_{i_2, j_2} ) is less than at least one of its neighbors (otherwise, it would not be the average), there must be a neighboring square ( (m,n) ) such that ( a_{m,n} > a_{i_2, j_2} ). 7. This creates a contradiction because if ( a_{i_1, j_1} ) is greater than all its neighbors, it cannot be the average of its neighbors. Similarly, if ( a_{i_2, j_2} ) is less than all its neighbors, it cannot be the average of its neighbors. 8. Therefore, our assumption that ( a_{i_1, j_1} neq a_{i_2, j_2} ) must be false.

The answer is negative. 1. Assume that there exists a red number r. Since r is red, we must also have 2r = r + r as red because the sum of two red numbers must be red.     - By induction on n, we can show that nr is red for any positive integer n. The base case (n=1) holds by assumption, assume for n=k, that kr is red. Then:          [      (k+1)r = kr + r      ]      Since both kr and r are red, their sum (k+1)r must also be red.

Consider the product ac = (bc)p and ac = (ad)k.     - By our assumption, (bc)p must be red, as p is red and bc is positive.    - Similarly, (ad)k must be blue because k is blue and ad is positive.     4.

Let's demonstrate a way to color the positive rational numbers to satisfy the condition regarding the product of red and blue numbers. 1. Let all positive rational numbers less than 1 (excluding 1) be colored red. 2. Let all positive rational numbers greater than or equal to 1 be colored blue.

(2) A nuclide is an atom with a certain number of protons and neutrons, so the type of nuclide is determined by the number of protons and neutrons. (3) In the arrangement of electrons outside the nucleus of an element atom, the outermost electrons determine the chemical properties of the element. For example, generally, elements with fewer than 4 electrons in the outermost shell are metals, which tend to lose electrons; elements with more than 4 electrons in the outermost shell are non-metals, which tend to gain electrons. (4) If an element atom has n electrons in the outermost shell, it generally loses up to n electrons (except O, F) in chemical reactions, showing a +n valence.

Alice goes first, and they take turns filling in the entries of the matrix with real numbers. Alice wins if the determinant of the final matrix is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins. 2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob aims to ensure that the determinant of the final matrix is zero. To achieve this, Bob can use a mirroring strategy to create two identical columns in the matrix, which will guarantee that the determinant is zero. 3. **Mirroring Strategy**:    - If Alice writes a number (a) in the entry ((i,1)), Bob writes the same number (a) in the entry ((i,2)).    - If Alice writes a number (a) in the entry ((i,2)), Bob writes the same number (a) in the entry ((i,1)).    - If Alice writes a number (a) in any entry ((i,j)) where (j geq 3), Bob writes (0) in any empty entry ((i,j)) where (j geq 3). 4. **Ensuring the Strategy**: Since the matrix is (2016 times 2016) and (2016) is an even number, Bob can always find an empty entry to mirror Alice's move or to place a zero in the columns (j geq 3). 5. **Resulting Matrix**: By the end of the game, the matrix (A) will have the first two columns identical because of Bob's mirroring strategy. This means that columns 1 and 2 of the matrix (A) are the same. 6. **Determinant Calculation**: A matrix with two identical columns has a determinant of zero. This is a fundamental property of determinants: if any two columns (or rows) of a matrix are identical, the determinant of that matrix is zero.

Consequently, he computes the six possible products of these numbers. Let us determine the maximum number of perfect squares among these products. 1. **Consider the product a(a+2):**    - If a is odd:      - Let a = 2k+1 where k is an integer. Then:        [        a(a+2) = (2k+1)(2k+3) = 4k^2 + 8k + 3        ]        Notice that this cannot be a perfect square since the difference between consecutive squares is always at least 2k+1. Therefore, a(a+2) is not a perfect square if a is odd.        - If a is even:      - Let a = 2k. Then:        [        a(a+2) = 2k(2k+2) = 4k^2 + 4k = (2k+1)^2 - 1        ]        This expression is one less than a perfect square, Thus a(a+2) is not a perfect square if a is even. 2. Similarly, consider the product b(b+2):    - By the exact logic used for a(a+2), we conclude that b(b+2) is not a perfect square for any positive integer b. 3. Now let’s analyze the other products ab, b(a+2), a(b+2), and (a+2)(b+2):    - Given that a(a+2) and b(b+2) are not perfect squares:       - We note that ab and ab+2 cannot both be perfect squares for the same reasoning as for a(a+2). If one of them is a perfect square, the other cannot be because it would force a(a+2) to be a perfect square, which we've established cannot happen. 4. Summarizing the constraints:    - ab, b(a+2), a(b+2), and (a+2)(b+2) are the possibilities for perfect squares, avoiding a(a+2) and b(b+2).    - No two products that involve using b(a+2) and (a+2)(b+2) or ab and a(b+2) can both be perfect squares at the same time as they contradict our previous analysis. 5. Let's demonstrate that only up to 2 perfect squares can be derived:    - Consider an example when a = b = 1:       - Products: 1 cdot 1 = 1, 1 cdot 3 = 3, 1 cdot 1 = 1, 3 cdot 1 = 3, 3 cdot 3 = 9, 1 cdot 3 = 3.       - Here, 1 and 9 are perfect squares, yielding two perfect squares {ab text{ and } (a+2)(b+2)}.

It involves the idea of transformation and is considered a medium-level question. 1. By using the transformed form of the tangent sum formula tan A + tan B = tan (A + B)(1 - tan A tan B), we simplify the expression. 2. Knowing that triangle ABC is an acute triangle, we get A + B > 90^{circ}, which transforms to B > 90^{circ} - A.

By the monotonicity of the tangent function and the values of trigonometric functions for special angles, we determine the range of angle C, and then use the internal angle sum theorem to compare their sizes. **Solution** 1. Since tan A + tan B = tan (A + B)(1 - tan A tan B),    Therefore, tan A + tan B + tan C = tan (A + B)(1 - tan A tan B) + tan C = tan A tan B tan C,    Therefore, if triangle ABC is an obtuse triangle, we have: tan A tan B tan C < 0, hence it is incorrect; 2. Since triangle ABC is an acute triangle,    Therefore, A + B > 90^{circ}, B > 90^{circ} - A,    Therefore, cos B < sin A, sin B > cos A,    Therefore, cos B - sin A < 0, sin B - cos A > 0,    Therefore, cos B - sin A < sin B - cos A, we get cos A + cos B < sin A + sin B, hence it is incorrect; 3.

Given tan C = frac{3}{4}, we find 0 < C < 90^{circ}, and since tan 30^{circ} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} < frac{3}{4} < 1 = tan 45^{circ},    Because the tangent function is increasing in (0,90^{circ}), we get 30^{circ} < C < 45^{circ};    Given sin B = frac{2}{5}, we find 0 < B < 90^{circ} or 90^{circ} < B < 180^{circ},    When 0 < B < 90^{circ}, sin 30^{circ} = frac{1}{2} > frac{2}{5}, because the sine function is increasing in (0,90^{circ}), we get 0 < B < 30^{circ};    When 90^{circ} < B < 180^{circ}, sin 150^{circ} = frac{1}{2} > frac{2}{5}, but the sine function is decreasing in 90^{circ} < B < 180^{circ}, we get B > 150^{circ}, then B + C > 180^{circ},    which is a contradiction and does not hold.

In any circle, the perpendicular drawn from the midpoint of a chord to the chord will pass through the center of the circle. Let's assume ( M ) is the midpoint of chord ( DE ). 5. **Step 5:** Draw the perpendicular ( PM ) from ( M ) intersecting the circumcircle at the circle center, which is also the midpoint of the third side.    Since ( PM ) passes through the center of the circle and is perpendicular to ( DE ), it must also intersect the third side ( AB ) of the triangle at its midpoint. Conclusion: The perpendicular drawn from the midpoint ( M ) of segment ( DE ) (bases of the heights from vertices ( A ) and ( B )) will bisect the third side ( AB ) of the triangle.

So, we can write the following equations: 1. ( 386 = 35k + 1 ) for some integer ( k ) 2. ( 386 = xj + 1 ) for some integer ( j ) From equation 1, we can find the multiple of 35 that is just below 386: ( 386 - 1 = 385 ) ( 385 ) is a multiple of 35, so ( k = frac{385}{35} = 11 ). Now, we need to find the value of ( x ) such that ( 386 = xj + 1 ) for some integer ( j ). Since 386 is 1 more than a multiple of ( x ), we can say: ( 386 - 1 = 385 ) is a multiple of ( x ).

The volume (V) of the prism is: [ V = frac{1}{2} times 6 times b times h times sin(pi/3) = 3bh. ] From (6h + bh + 3b = 36), solving for (bh) gives: [ bh = frac{36 - 3b}{1 + 6/b}. ] Substituting (bh) in the volume equation (V = 3bh): [ V = 3 left( frac{36 - 3b}{1 + 6/b} right). ] Finding the maximum volume (V) by differentiating and setting the derivative to zero can be complex, so instead, we use trial values for (b) and (h) which satisfy (6h + bh + 3b = 36) and check for maximum (V).

We will project this solid onto a plane perpendicular to the diagonal AC_{1}. From the projection, we can better visualize the relationships between vertices and distances. 2. **Identification of Distances**: Let us denote the distances from vertices A_{1}, B, and D to the diagonal AC_{1} as the lengths of the sides of the desired triangle. These distances correspond to the line segments AA_{1}, AB, and AD respectively in the projection. 3. **Triangle Side Lengths**: Recognize that by the construction of the projection, the sides of triangle AA_{1}B actually represent the distances from A_{1}, B, and D to the diagonal AC_{1}.  4. **Surface Area Analysis**: Given that the area of triangle AA_{1}B is denoted by (S), it is stated that the volume of the parallelepiped is (2dS), where (d) is the length of the diagonal (AC_{1}). This helps us understand the proportionate relation between the area of the triangle and the volume of the parallelepiped. 5. **Application of Theorem (Problem 2.1)**: Refer to Problem 2.1, which informs that if M is the point of intersection of the plane passing through the vertices A_{1}, D, B with the diagonal AC_{1}, then AM is a fraction frac{d}{3} of the diagonal d. 6. **Volume Calculation with Theorem (Problem 3.5)**: According to Problem 3.5, the volume of the tetrahedron AA_{1}DB is frac{dS}{3}. This result supports our structure by verifying the volume through different proportional calculations.  7. **Volume Consideration of Parallelepiped**: Since the volume of the tetrahedron AA_{1}DB represents one-sixth of the total volume of the parallelepiped, it confirms:  text{Volume of tetrahedron} = frac{1}{6} times text{Volume of parallelepiped}  8. **Summing Up**: Given these relationships and proofs, the constructed triangle indeed has side lengths equal to the distances from points A_{1}, B, and D to the diagonal AC_{1}, thus satisfying all required conditions and confirming the initial conditions about the volume and area.

The outer band consists of the outermost unit on each side, forming a border strip around the central area.     Since the outer band covers the outer strip, we will calculate the \`area\` of these strips:          - The entire plot is (8 times 8 = 64) square units.     - The central square (ABCD) formed by connecting the midpoints has side lengths (frac{8}{2} = 4) units, thus creating a (4 times 4 = 16) square unit area in the center. 3. **Calculating the Area Occupied by Planting Strips:**     The outer band's area is calculated by subtracting the inner square's area from the entire plot:          [     text{Area of outer band} = 64 , text{sq units} - 16 , text{sq units} = 48 , text{sq units}     ]     Given there are 12 planting strips in the outer band, the combined area of these strips is:          [     text{Area of 12 strips} = 48 , text{sq units}     ] 4. **Area of the Central Strip:**     The central square actually forms by connecting midpoints of the sides, thus the strips align starting at these midpoints and extend inward.

Therefore, the minimum value of 2^{x}+2^{2-x} is indeed 4, making option B correct. **Option C: frac{1}{sin^{2}x}+frac{1}{cos^{2}x}** We use the identity sin^{2}x + cos^{2}x = 1 and the AM-GM inequality: begin{align*} frac{1}{sin^{2}x}+frac{1}{cos^{2}x} &= frac{cos^{2}x + sin^{2}x}{sin^{2}xcos^{2}x}  &= frac{cos^{2}x}{sin^{2}x}+frac{sin^{2}x}{cos^{2}x}+2  &geq 2sqrt{frac{cos^{2}x}{sin^{2}x} cdot frac{sin^{2}x}{cos^{2}x}} + 2  &= 4 end{align*} Equality holds when tan^{2}x = 1, which is true for tan x = pm 1. Thus, option C is also correct. **Option D: 4ln(sqrt{x^{2}+1}-x)+ln(sqrt{x^{2}+1}+x)** Substituting x = 0: begin{align*} 4ln(sqrt{0^{2}+1}-0)+ln(sqrt{0^{2}+1}+0) &= 4ln(1) + ln(1)  &= 0 end{align*} Since we found a value of the expression that is not 4, and we are looking for the minimum value to be exactly 4, option D is incorrect.

We start by proving that the equation ( x^2 + y^2 = 5^k ) has exactly ( 4(k+1) ) integer solutions for any ( k ). For ( k = 0 ) and ( k = 1 ), this is evident as follows:     - For ( k = 0 ): ( 5^0 = 1 ), and the equation ( x^2 + y^2 = 1 ) has the solutions ((pm 1, 0)) and ((0, pm 1)), which total to 4 solutions, thus ( 4(0+1) = 4) solutions.     - For ( k = 1 ): ( 5^1 = 5 ), and the equation ( x^2 + y^2 = 5 ) has the solutions ((pm 2, pm 1)) and ((pm 1, pm 2)), which total to 8 solutions, thus ( 4(1+1) = 8) solutions. 2. We now prove by induction that the equation ( x^2 + y^2 = 5^k ) has exactly 8 solutions ((x, y)) such that neither ( x ) nor ( y ) is divisible by 5, and combining these with ( 4(k-1) ) solutions of the form ((5a, 5b)) where ( a ) and ( b ) are solutions of the equation ( a^2 + b^2 = 5^{k-2} ), yields the required number of solutions.     - Base case ( k = 2 ):         Let's consider ( k = 2), where ( x^2 + y^2 = 5^2 = 25 ). As shown above, our non-trivial solutions count is 8.              - Induction step:         Assume for ( k = n ), there are exactly ( 4(n+1) ) solutions to ( x^2 + y^2 = 5^n ). We need to show there are ( 4(n+2) ) solutions to ( x^2 + y^2 = 5^{n+1} ).     Through algebraic manipulation and properties of divisibility, it can be shown that each non-trivial solution to ( x^2 + y^2 = 5^{n} ) can generate new non-trivial solutions to ( x^2 + y^2 = 5^{n+1} ) through the transformations:     [     (x+2y, 2x-y), quad (x-2y, 2x+y)     ]          Only one of these generated solutions contributes non-trivially, thus adding the required solutions for each increment in ( k ).  3. Next, we consider the specific problem. We need to show whether there exists a circle with exactly ( n ) integer solutions.     - For odd ( n = 2k+1 ):         Consider a circle of radius ( frac{5^k}{3} ) centered at (left( frac{1}{3}, 0 right)). This circle aligns with the lattice such that:         [         x^2 + y^2 = 5^{2k}         ]         This circle equation mod 3 properties results in a unique distribution of lattice points intersecting with the integer grid, yielding ( 2k+1 ) integer points uniquely determined by the mod property.     - For even ( n = 2k ):         Consider a circle of radius ( frac{5^{(k-1)/2}}{2} ) centered at (left( frac{1}{2}, 0 right)). Similar reasoning as above based on symmetry and lattice intersection properties will show it contains exactly ( 2k ) integer points due to the pairing property detailed in steps.

At the same time, the tank is losing water from two drains at a rate of 1 kiloliter every 4 minutes and every 6 minutes. It takes 60 minutes to fill the tank completely. What is the capacity of the tank in liters?","output":"Let's calculate the net flow rate into the tank. The pipe fills the tank at a rate of 1 kiloliter every 2 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.5 kiloliters per minute. The first drain removes water at a rate of 1 kiloliter every 4 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.25 kiloliters per minute. The second drain removes water at a rate of 1 kiloliter every 6 minutes, which is equivalent to approximately 0.1667 kiloliters per minute. Now, let's calculate the net flow rate by subtracting the drain rates from the fill rate: Net flow rate = Fill rate - (Drain rate 1 + Drain rate 2) Net flow rate = 0.5 - (0.25 + 0.1667) Net flow rate = 0.5 - 0.4167 Net flow rate = 0.0833 kiloliters per minute It takes 60 minutes to fill the tank completely with this net flow rate. Therefore, the amount of water added to the tank in 60 minutes is: Amount of water added = Net flow rate * Time Amount of water added = 0.0833 kiloliters/minute * 60 minutes Amount of water added = 5 kiloliters Since the tank was half-full when the filling started, the total capacity of the tank is twice the amount of water added to fill it: Total capacity = Amount of water added * 2 Total capacity = 5 kiloliters * 2 Total capacity = 10 kiloliters Since 1 kiloliter is equal to 1,000 liters, the capacity of the tank in liters is: Total capacity in liters = Total capacity in kiloliters * 1,000 Total capacity in liters = 10 * 1,000 Total capacity in liters = 10,000 liters Therefore, the capacity of the tank is boxed{10,000}  liters."},{"instruction":"A school arranges 5 classes to go to 4 factories for social practice.

These numbers have (k) or fewer digits.    - For numbers with exactly (i) ones, there are (binom{k}{i}) ways to choose the positions of the ones.    - The remaining (k-i) positions can be filled with any of the 9 digits that are not one, giving (9^{k-i}) combinations.    - Therefore, there are (binom{k}{i}9^{k-i}) numbers with exactly (i) ones.    - Each of these numbers contributes (i) ones to the function (f(n)).    - Summing over all possible (i) from 1 to (k) and adding one for (10^k) itself, we get:      [      f(10^k) = sum_{i=1}^{k} i binom{k}{i} 9^{k-i} + 1      ] 3. **Simplification**:    - Using the identity (i binom{k}{i} = k binom{k-1}{i-1}), we can rewrite the sum:      [      sum_{i=1}^{k} i binom{k}{i} 9^{k-i} = k sum_{i=1}^{k} binom{k-1}{i-1} 9^{k-i}      ]    - Recognizing that (binom{k-1}{i-1}) is just a shifted binomial coefficient, we can rewrite the sum:      [      k sum_{i=0}^{k-1} binom{k-1}{i} 9^{k-1-i}      ]    - By the binomial theorem, (sum_{i=0}^{k-1} binom{k-1}{i} 9^{k-1-i} = (1+9)^{k-1} = 10^{k-1}).    - Therefore:      [      k cdot 10^{k-1}      ]    - Adding the one for (10^k) itself, we get:      [      f(10^k) = k cdot 10^{k-1} + 1      ] 4. **Conclusion**:    - For (k = 100):      [      f(10^{100}) = 100 cdot 10^{99} + 1 = 10^{101} + 1      ] The final answer is (boxed{10^{101} + 1})"},{"instruction":"a market, a dozen eggs cost as much as a pound of rice, and a halfliter of kerosene costs as much as 8 eggs.

From the information given, we have the following relationships: 1. A dozen eggs cost as much as a pound of rice: E = R 2. A half-liter of kerosene costs as much as 8 eggs: Since a dozen eggs is 12 eggs, the cost of 8 eggs would be (8/12)E or (2/3)E. Therefore, K = (2/3)E 3. A liter of kerosene costs 48 cents: Since a half-liter of kerosene costs K, a full liter would cost 2K. Therefore, 2K = 48 cents Now, let's solve for K using the third relationship: 2K = 48 cents K = 48 cents / 2 K = 24 cents Now we can use the second relationship to find the cost of a dozen eggs (E): K = (2/3)E 24 cents = (2/3)E E = (24 cents) * (3/2) E = 36 cents Since a dozen eggs cost as much as a pound of rice (E = R), the cost of a pound of rice is also 36 cents.

Let's start by noting that there is at least one such prime number, for instance, 2.  2. **Assumption for Contradiction**: Assume contrariwise that there are only a finite number of such prime numbers, and let these be ( p_{1}, p_{2}, ldots, p_{k} ). 3. **Construction of ( n )**: Let ( n ) be the product of all these primes:    [    n = p_{1} cdot p_{2} cdot ldots cdot p_{k}    ]     4. **Remainder Analysis**: Each prime ( p_i ) leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. Therefore, when considered modulo 3:    - ( p_i equiv 2 pmod{3} )        The product rule for congruences tells us:    [    p_1 cdot p_2 cdot ldots cdot p_k equiv 2 cdot 2 cdot ldots cdot 2 pmod{3}    ]    This is the same as:    [    n equiv 2^k pmod{3}    ]     5. **Odd/Even ( k ) Analysis**:    - **Case 1: ( k ) is even**:      [      2^k equiv 1 pmod{3}      ]      Hence,      [      n equiv 1 pmod{3}      ]    - **Case 2: ( k ) is odd**:      [      2^k equiv 2 pmod{3}      ]      Hence,      [      n equiv 2 pmod{3}      ] 6. **Generation of a New Prime**:    - **If ( k ) is even** and so ( n equiv 1 pmod{3} ), consider ( n+1 ):      [      n+1 equiv 1+1 equiv 2 pmod{3}      ]      ( n+1 ) is not divisible by any of the primes ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ), and thus, ( n+1 ) either is a new prime that leaves a remainder 2 when divided by 3, or it factors into primes all of which leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. This contradicts the assumption of a finite number of such primes.        - **If ( k ) is odd** and so ( n equiv 2 pmod{3} ), consider ( n+3 ):      [      n+3 equiv 2+3 equiv 2 pmod{3}      ]      Again, ( n+3 ) would not be divisible by any ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) and must either be a new prime or factor into primes with a remainder 2 modulo 3, contradicting our finite assumption. 7. **Conclusion**: As both cases lead to a contradiction of the initial assumption, we conclude there must be an infinite number of prime numbers which leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3.

Since all sides of ( Delta BCD ) are equal to 1, it is an equilateral triangle.     - The area of ( Delta BCD ) is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ). 2. **Changing Edge Length and Height**:     - The edge ( AB = x ) changes while other edges remain 1.     - The height ( AO ) from vertex ( A ) to the base ( Delta BCD ) changes as well. 3. **Domain of ( x )**:     - For the lengths to form a valid tetrahedron, ( x ) must lie within the range where it's possible to have ( AB = x ) perpendicular to the base at some configuration:     - This valid range for ( x ) is discovered through geometric constraints and comes out to be ( (0, sqrt{3}) ). 4. **Expression and Variation of Volume ( F(x) )**:     - The volume ( V ) of the tetrahedron is given by:         [         V = frac{1}{3} times text{Area of base} times text{Height from apex to base}         ]     - Here, base area ( Delta BCD ) remains ( frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ).     - Therefore,         [         F(x) = frac{1}{3} times frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times AO(x)         ]     - As ( x to 0 ) or ( x to sqrt{3} ), the height ( AO to 0 ), leading to ( F(x) to 0 ). 5. **Non-Monotonic Behavior**:     - Because ( F(x) ) varies with the height ( AO ) in a non-linear and non-monotonic manner, it is not an increasing function throughout its domain. 6. **Maximum Value**:     - There is an optimal configuration where the plane ( Delta ACD ) is perpendicular to ( Delta BCD ), which maximizes the height ( AO ) and thus ( F(x) ) achieves its maximum value. 7. **Conclusion**:     - From the above analysis, while ( F(x) ) is not an increasing function, it does attain a maximum value within its domain.

Using the formula for the area of a triangle, text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = 100.    - Here, the base AB = 12, thus the height h from line AB to point C must satisfy frac{1}{2} times 12 times h = 100 Rightarrow h = frac{200}{12} approx 16.67.    - Therefore, point C's y-coordinate must be ±16.67. 3. **Perimeter Condition**:    - The perimeter of triangle ABC must be 52 units.

Setting (alpha) to its maximum possible value ((120^circ)):     [     alpha = 120^circ, quad beta_1 = 30^circ, quad beta_2 = 68^circ 32', quad beta = 98^circ 32', quad gamma = 111^circ 28'     ]     This value of (alpha) keeps all angles within the permissible range. 9. For decrementing (alpha):     - (beta_1) increases monotonically as (alpha) decreases.     - Consequently, (beta_2) also increases as (alpha) decreases because (cos(beta_2)) decreases monotonically.     - (gamma) decreases as (alpha) decreases since (cos(gamma)) increases monotonically.     Hence,     [     alpha_{text{max}} = 120^circ, quad beta_{text{min}} = 98^circ 32' quad (text{rounded}), quad gamma_{text{max}} = 111^circ 28' quad (text{rounded})     ] 10.

The midpoints of triangles triangle AHE, triangle BEF, triangle CFG, and triangle DGH are W, X, Y, and Z respectively. Prove that the areas of quadrilaterals ABCD and WXYZ are equal. We start by identifying the conditions that map this geometric problem to a known function property. 1. **Determine f Function:**    Let us consider a function ( f: mathbf{Z} rightarrow mathbf{Z} ) such that:    [    (f(m) - f(n))(m - n)    ]    is always a perfect square integer. We need to show that ( f ) must be of the form ( A^2x + B ) where ( A ) and ( B ) are integers. 2. **Initial Observation:**    Given any prime ( p ) and any integer ( n ), since ( p((f(n+p) - f(n)) ) is always a perfect square, we can infer that:    [    p mid (f(n+p) - f(n))    ]    This observation is crucial because it implies that ( f ) modulo ( p ) must follow a certain structure. 3. **Analysis modulo ( p ):**    For convenience, let ( bar{A} equiv A mod{p} ).

For any ( s in S ):    [    (n-s)(f(n)-f(s)) equiv (n-s)(f(n)-r) notequiv 0 pmod{p}    ]    This non-zero quadratic residue leads us to:    [    left(frac{n-s}{p}right) = left(frac{f(n)-r}{p}right) neq 0    ]    where ( left(frac{x}{p}right) ) denotes the Legendre symbol.

If either (A) or (B) is zero, the function becomes a standard trigonometric function whose maximum is well-known.    2. **Express (f(t)) using trigonometric identities**:    [    f(t) = A sin t + B sin 2t = A sin t + 2B sin t cos t = sin t cdot (A + 2B cos t)    ] 3. **Non-Negativity and Square Function**:    We define ( g(t) = f^2(t) ).

Since the IDs are distinct, one squid will have ID 1 and the other will have ID 2. The squid with ID 2 can declare that they have the larger ID and win immediately. Thus, the sum of the numbers announced is 0. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**    - Assume that for ( n = 2^k ), the squids can always win with the sum of the numbers announced being no larger than ( k-1 ). 3. **Inductive Step:**    - We need to show that for ( n = 2^{k+1} ), the squids can always win with the sum of the numbers announced being no larger than ( k ).    - Consider the first squid, who has some number ( A ). If ( A = 1 ) or ( A = 2^{k+1} ), the squid can immediately declare the larger ID and win.    - Otherwise, we divide the range ( [1, 2^{k+1}] ) into ( k ) ranges of size ( 2^i ) for ( 1 leq i leq k ):      - ( [2, 2^{k-1}+1] rightarrow 1 )      - ( [2^{k-1}+2, 2^{k-1}+2^{k-2}+1] rightarrow 2 )      - Continue this pattern until all ranges are assigned.    - Based on which range ( A ) falls into, the first squid announces the assigned number. By the induction hypothesis, the remaining numbers can be handled with a sum of ( (k-i-1) + i = k-1 ). 4. **Bound:**    - We need to show that ( n = 2^k + 1 ) requires at least ( k ).    - For ( k = 1 ), this is obviously true.    - Suppose ( 2^k + 1 ) can be done with ( k-1 ). Then in this strategy, we have ( f(1) + f(2) + cdots + f(k-1) = 2^k + 1 ).    - There must be some ( i ) for which ( f(i) geq 2^{k-i} + 1 ).

The only way this can happen is if the argument of the logarithm, x+3, is equal to a^1 because that would result in y=1-1=0. Thus, x+3 = a. For the graph to consistently pass through the fixed point A when a changes, the value of x must be such that x+3 is always a, which leads to the conclusion that x = -2.

Assume every triplet of points in S forms a non-degenerate obtuse-angled triangle. 2. **Selection of points and formation of obtuse triangles**:    Take any two points A and B from S. According to the problem's conditions, for any third point C from S which doesn't lie on the line AB and is outside the strip formed by perpendiculars to AB through points A and B, the triangle ABC must be a non-degenerate obtuse triangle (refer to Fig 1). 3. **Construction of strips and lines**:    For every pair of points from the finite set S, construct a strip and a line perpendicular as shown in Fig 1. Only a finite number of such strips and lines are formed. 4. **Existence of a new point outside all constructed strips**:    Since the number of strips is finite, they do not cover the entire plane. Therefore, it is possible to find at least one point outside all these strips. Select such a point. 5. **Formation of the new obtuse triangle**:    By adding this point to the set S, we can form new triangles with each pair of points from S. Due to the specific choice of the new point, all these newly formed triangles will still be non-degenerate and obtuse-angled.    Hence, we can always add a point to a finite set while preserving the property that every triplet forms a non-degenerate obtuse triangle. # Conclusion for (a): [ blacksquare ] # (b) 1. **Introduction to infinite sets**:    We now consider an infinite set of points in a plane and check if the same property holds - that is, each triplet forms a non-degenerate obtuse triangle. 2. **Selection of an initial infinite set**:    Consider an infinite set of points on the semicircle excluding one endpoint of its diameter (refer to Fig 2). This set satisfies the problem's condition - any three points chosen form an obtuse-angled triangle. 3. **Analysis with additional points**:    Suppose a point X is added to this set. If X lies inside the semicircle or on its diameter (Fig 3), there is always a point C on the semicircle making triangle ACX acute. This violates the initially specified property. 4. **Exclusion of points lying away from the semicircle**:    If X lies outside the semicircle or in the plane outside its diameter (Fig 4 and 5), there will always be points making non-obtuse triangles with X. Thus, confirming that no point can be added to retain the required property.    Therefore, the infinite extension of the property does not hold.

If the last ( M ) is placed at the end, it must be followed by a ( U ), reducing the problem to ( f(m-1, u-1) ).    - Therefore, ( f(m, u) = f(m, u-1) + f(m-1, u-1) ). 4. **Using the recurrence relation**:    - We need to show that ( f(m, u) - f(2u - m + 1, u) = f(m, u - 1) - f(2u - m + 1, u - 1) ).    - Using the recurrence relation, we have:      [      f(m, u) = f(m, u-1) + f(m-1, u-1)      ]      [      f(2u - m + 1, u) = f(2u - m + 1, u-1) + f(2u - m, u-1)      ] 5. **Substituting the recurrence relation**:    - Substitute these into the left-hand side of the identity:      [      f(m, u) - f(2u - m + 1, u) = (f(m, u-1) + f(m-1, u-1)) - (f(2u - m + 1, u-1) + f(2u - m, u-1))      ]    - Simplify the expression:      [      f(m, u) - f(2u - m + 1, u) = f(m, u-1) - f(2u - m + 1, u-1) + f(m-1, u-1) - f(2u - m, u-1)      ] 6. **Matching terms**:    - For the identity to hold, we need:      [      f(m-1, u-1) = f(2u - m, u-1)      ]    - This equality holds because the number of valid words with ( m-1 ) ( M )'s and ( u-1 ) ( U )'s is the same as the number of valid words with ( 2u - m ) ( M )'s and ( u-1 ) ( U )'s due to the symmetry in the problem.

The sum of the numbers is at least n. 2. The sum of the squares of the numbers is at least n^2. Let us denote the numbers by x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n. We are given: [ sum_{i=1}^n x_i geq n ] [ sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 geq n^2 ] To argue our case, we should first examine an example that meets these criteria tightly: Let (x_1 = x_2 = cdots = x_{n-1} = 2) and (x_n = 2 - n). Then: [ sum_{i=1}^n x_i = (n-1) cdot 2 + (2 - n) = 2n - 2 + 2 - n = n ] [ sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 = (n-1) cdot 4 + (2 - n)^2 = 4(n-1) + (4 - 4n + n^2) = 4n - 4 + 4 - 4n + n^2 = n^2 ] This shows that the above conditions are satisfied exactly with x_n = 2 - n.  Next, suppose for contradiction that the result is false. That is, the maximum element ( max x_i < 2 ). Now consider that if all numbers were non-negative and less than 2, then: [ sum_{i=1}^n x_i leq n cdot 2 - n = n ] Since at least one ( x_i ) must be negative to meet sum_{i=1}^n x_i = n and satisfy sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 geq n^2, let's denote this negative number as ( x_j ). Assuming sum_{i=1}^n x_i > n, we let ( z < 0 ) be one of the numbers such that sum_{i=1}^n x_i = n and sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 geq n^2 still hold allowing reducing values maintaining the primary constraints. Consider altering values by pair replacement for two numbers (x) and (y) both less than 2, and introduce: [ x' = 2 quad text{and} quad y' = x + y - 2 ] then the sum remains: [ x + y = x' + y' ] But the sum of squares increases because: [ (x')^2 + (y')^2 = 2^2 + (x + y - 2)^2 ] Since ( (x + y - 2) < 2): [ 4 + (x + y - 2)^2 > x^2 + y^2]    Carrying this process successively until all values converged at a single number satisfying our bounds forced an inferred contradiction proving the initial assumptions negated hence must hold values exceeding no matter replacement steps summing squares n strong.

Our goal is to study the behavior of g(x) over the interval (1, +infty). 3. **Find the Derivative of g(x)**: Calculate g'(x) to understand how g(x) changes: [ g'(x) = frac{(x-1)(ln x+1+frac{1}{x})-(x+1)ln x}{(x-1)^2} = frac{-2ln x + x - frac{1}{x}}{(x-1)^2} ] This step is crucial for determining whether g(x) is increasing or decreasing. 4. **Analyze the Derivative**: Define M(x) = -2ln x + x - frac{1}{x} and find its derivative: [ M'(x) = -frac{2}{x} + 1 + frac{1}{x^2} = frac{(x-1)^2}{x^2} ] Since M'(x) > 0 for x in (1, +infty), M(x) is monotonically increasing in this interval. Consequently, g'(x) > 0 because M(x) > M(1) = 0. 5. **Conclude Monotonicity**: Since g'(x) > 0, g(x) is monotonically increasing on (1, +infty). 6. **Apply L'Hopital's Rule**: To find the limit of g(x) as x approaches 1 from the right, use L'Hopital's Rule: [ lim_{x to 1^+} g(x) = lim_{x to 1^+} frac{(x+1)ln x}{x-1} = lim_{x to 1^+} frac{ln x + 1 + frac{1}{x}}{1} = 2 ] This calculation establishes the lower bound for a. 7. **Determine the Range of a**: Since g(x) is monotonically increasing and approaches 2 as x approaches 1 from the right, the inequality frac{(x+1)ln x}{x-1} > a holds for all a leq 2.

When A and B work together in one day, they can do: (1/15) + (1/20) of the work. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 60 (the least common multiple of 15 and 20).

Then:       [       (p-1)! + 1 = p^m       ]       Therefore,       [       p^m - 1 = (p-1)!       ] 4. **Divisibility Property**:     - Since ((p-1)^2 mid (p-1)!), by rearranging the original equation, it follows that:       [       (p-1)^2 mid p^m - 1       ] 5. **Simplifying the Expression**:     - Dividing both sides of ( p^m - 1 equiv 0 pmod{(p-1)^2} ) by ( p-1 ), we conclude:       [       p-1 mid p^{m-1} + p^{m-2} + cdots + p + 1       ] 6. **Periodic Properties of Exponents**:     - Utilizing the property ( p - 1 mid p^k - 1 ) for ( k = 0, 1, 2, ldots ), we have:       [       p equiv 1 pmod{p-1}       ]       Therefore:       [       p^{m-1} + p^{m-2} + cdots + p + 1 equiv 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 equiv m pmod{p-1}       ]       It follows that:       [       p-1 mid m       ] 7. **Bounding ( m )**:     - From the previous step, we infer ( m geq p-1 ). Thus:       [       p^m geq p^{p-1}       ]       By Bertrand's postulate, ( p > p-1 > e^{(p-1)/2} ). Therefore:       [       p^{p-1} > (p-1)^{p-1}       ] 8. **Upper Bound of Factorials**:     - We know p^{p-1} > (p-1)! because (p-1)^{p-1} > (p-1)! for sufficiently large p. Hence:       [       p^m geq p^{p-1} > (p-1)^{p-1} > (p-1)!       ]       Consequently:       [       p^m > (p-1)! + 1       ] 9. **Contradiction**:     - The inequality p^m > (p-1)! + 1 contradicts the initial assumption (p-1)! + 1 = p^m.     - Therefore, there are no solutions to the original equation. # Conclusion: Thus, the equation (p-1)! + 1 = p^m has no solutions for any prime number ( p > 5 ) and integer ( m ). blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given positive numbers x and y satisfying 2x+y=1, and the minimum value of frac{a}{x} + frac{1}{y} is 9, find the value of the positive number a.

In our case, A=1, B=-1, and C_1=1 (from the equation x-y+1=0), and C_2=c (from the equation x-y+c=0).

When the man is rowing downstream, the speed of the boat will be the sum of the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the stream. So, the downstream speed is 9 kmph + 1.5 kmph = 10.5 kmph. When the man is rowing upstream, the speed of the boat will be the difference between the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the stream. So, the upstream speed is 9 kmph - 1.5 kmph = 7.5 kmph. The time taken to row downstream to the place is the distance divided by the downstream speed, which is D / 10.5 hours. The time taken to row upstream back to the starting point is the distance divided by the upstream speed, which is D / 7.5 hours.

It is known that the medians of a tetrahedron are divided by the point of intersection of the medians in a ratio of (3:1) when measured from the vertex of the tetrahedron.        Let (DE) and (CF) be the medians of the tetrahedron, with (R) as the radius of the circumscribed sphere. We have:    [    DE = frac{4}{3} DO = frac{4}{3} R = frac{4}{3} CO = CF    ] 3. **Intersection and Equal Thirds**:    Since (E) and (F) are the points of intersection of the medians of the triangles (ABC) and (ABD), the extensions of segments (CE) and (DF) intersect at the midpoint (G) of edge (AB). Given the equivalence of triangles (COE) and (DOF) (by two sides and the angle between them), it follows that:    [    CG = frac{3}{2} CE = frac{3}{2} DF = DG    ]    Thus, triangle (DGC) is isosceles, and since its altitude (GH) is also the median, (H) is the midpoint of edge (CD) of tetrahedron (ABCD). 4. **Orthogonality and Rectangularity**:    Similarly, the perpendicular dropped from the midpoint of (CD) onto (AB) passes through the midpoint of (AB). Therefore, the segments joining the midpoints of the opposite edges of tetrahedron (ABCD) are perpendicular to these edges and, consequently, to the faces of parallelotope (AKBLNDCM). Hence, parallelotope (AKBLNDCM) is rectangular.     5. **Equalizing Tetrahedron Faces**:    Consequently, all faces of tetrahedron (ABCD) are equal triangles. 6. **Reverse Argument - All Faces Are Equal**:    Now, assume that all faces of the tetrahedron are equal triangles (as shown in Figure 2). Then, the opposite edges of tetrahedron (ABCD) are pairwise equal, i.e., (AB = CD), (AC = BD) and (AD = BC). Therefore, all faces of parallelotope (AKBLNDCM) are rectangles, implying that parallelotope (AKBLNDCM) is rectangular. 7. **Coincidence of Circumcenter and Median Intersection**:    The center of its circumscribed sphere coincides with the point of intersection of the diagonals. Simultaneously, this sphere is the circumscribed sphere of the tetrahedron (ABCD). Assume diagonal (AM) of the parallelotope intersects the plane of face (BCD) of the tetrahedron at point (T). It is known that (T) is the point of intersection of the medians of triangle (BCD), and (MT = frac{1}{3} AM). If (O) is the center of the sphere, then:    [    OT = OM - MT = frac{1}{2} AM - frac{1}{3} AM = frac{1}{6} AM = frac{1}{3} cdot frac{1}{2} AM = frac{1}{3} AO    ]    Therefore, (O) is the point of intersection of the medians of tetrahedron (ABCD).

Given that the graph of f(x) passes through the point (0, -5), we can determine the value of c: f(0) = 0^4 - 2 cdot 0^2 + c = -5, which gives us c = -5. Therefore, the function is: f(x) = x^4 - 2x^2 - 5.

First let's examine the criteria: 1. **Multiple of 63**: A number that is a multiple of 63 is a multiple of both (7) and (9). For a number to satisfy these conditions, it must meet the following: 1. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9. 2. **Divisibility by 7**: There is no simple rule like the sum of digits as for 9, so we must check each permutation. **Step-by-Step Analysis** 1. **Divisibility by 9**: This condition must hold for all permutations of the number. The sum of the digits of the number must be a multiple of 9. 2. **Divisibility by 7**: Additionally, the number must be divisible by 7. Given this, solving rearranged digits becomes slightly complex. We begin by understanding that the number must meet both conditions above. **Exploring Digit Choices**: 1. **All digits being the same**:    - The simplest case would be using the smallest set of repeated digits, such as using repunits (numbers like (1, 11, 111, ldots)). 2. **Repunits and Multiples of 7**:     - The smallest repunit that is a multiple of 7 is 111111 (since (10 mod 7 = 3) and 3 is a generator modulo 7). We can verify this by calculating the powers of (3 mod 7):     [      3^1 mod 7 = 3      3^2 = 9 equiv 2 mod 7      3^3 = 27 equiv 6 mod 7      3^6 = 729 equiv 1 mod 7     ] 3. **Sum of Digits as a Multiple of 9**:    - For (111 cdots 111) of 6 digits to be a multiple of 63, the digit sum needs to be a multiple of 9. Hence, for a six-digit repunit (111111), the sum is (6 times 1 = 6), which isn’t sufficient. Considering digit sets with (6) numbers: - Digits such as {0, 7}, {1, 8}, and {2, 9} will have to be evaluated. For a set consisting of digits ({1, 8}): - As (8 = 1 (mod 7)), these numbers are equivalent to repunits modulo 7. - The six-digit number 111888 has a digit sum of (1 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 27). Since 27 is a multiple of 9, it satisfies the divisibility by 9 condition. We also look at permutations: - 111888 rearranged will still be a multiple of 63 because each permutation retains divisibility features.

Given the property of equilateral triangles, this implies that every side of one triangle is parallel to a corresponding side of the other triangle. Therefore, parallelism, in this context, is an equivalence relation among the set of equilateral triangles in the plane. 2. **Understanding the Problem:**    The problem states that we need to color each equilateral triangle such that adjacent triangles (triangles that share a side) are of different colors. It is specified that triangles that only share a point can be of the same color. 3. **Observing the Equivalence Partition:**    Each triangle can only share a side with another triangle if they belong to the same \\"class of parallelism.\\" Therefore, our coloring strategy can be applied independently within each equivalence class (cluster of parallel triangles). 4. **Introducing Orientation:**    To facilitate the coloring, we introduce the concept of orientation.

We label these polynomials as \\"weakly symmetric\\". 3. **Simplifying Expressions**:    - Consider the polynomial x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz. Notice that this expression is preserved under the transformations given (though it might change the order of appearance of x, y, and z). Hence, any polynomial in x, y, z that can be written in this manner would satisfy the above conditions. 4. **Expression as General Polynomial**:    - To demonstrate that P(x, y, z) = F(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz) for some polynomial F(t), we will show that any highest degree symmetric term in P(x, y, z) must involve x, y, z symmetrically. 5. **Highest Degree Terms**:    - Suppose P(x, y, z) has a highest degree term mu x^a y^b z^c. By definition of our conditions, this term must be symmetric under the transformations provided. For this to hold, a, b, c must be such that:      - a + b geq c      - a + c geq b      - b + c geq a    - This implies symmetric roles for a, b, c typically balancing the polynomial out across x, y, and z. 6. **Constructing Lower Degree Polynomials**:    - Constructing auxiliary polynomials and using the original conditions help in reducing and simplifying further. For instance, reducing terms left(z - frac{1}{2} xyright)^2 give combined symmetric effects that in total hold the conditions. 7. **Degenerating Steps and Patterns**:    - As the steps progressively degrade the polynomial (in terms of degree), they show consistency which can always be pointed back to a function of x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz. 8. **Conclusion by Induction on Degree**:    - We conclude by mathematical induction on the degree of polynomial. Start with trivial base case degree 0 polynomial holding obviously. Assuming it holds for any degree n, show it holds true for n+1. Progressive step simplifications inherently reduce back to terms involving x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz.

Let's partition these \\"two-digit\\" numbers into two arbitrary groups. We'll color all the squares in the top row of the grid (which is not completely filled) black, and similarly, we'll consider a square (S) to be black if there exists a broken line (L(S)) starting from the center of (S) and ending in the center of a square in the top row, where all segments of this broken line connect the centers of neighboring squares containing numbers from the first group.

Thus, ( c = d ). 3. **Using the Circle Properties:**    - Since the circle is inscribed in the trapezoid, the sum of the lengths of the bases is equal to the sum of the lengths of the legs:    [    a + b = 2c    ] 4. **Set Up Ratio Using ( k ):**    [    a = kb    ]    Substituting ( a = kb ) into the equation ( a + b = 2c ):    [    kb + b = 2c    ]    Factor out ( b ):    [    b(k + 1) = 2c    ] 5. **Solve for ( c ):**    [    c = frac{b(k + 1)}{2}    ] 6. **Finding the Angle Using Properties:**    Recall that the angles in a trapezoid inscribed around a circle are related due to the cyclic nature of the shape.

This is the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the radius R of its circumcircle. Given that 2R(sin^2 A - sin^2 B) = (sqrt{2}a - c)sin C, we can substitute the Law of Sines into this equation. By the Law of Sines, we have a = 2Rsin A, b = 2Rsin B, and c = 2Rsin C. Substituting these into the given equation, we get: [2R(sin^2 A - sin^2 B) = (sqrt{2}(2Rsin A) - (2Rsin C))sin C] Simplifying this equation, we get: [2Rsin^2 A - 2Rsin^2 B = 2Rsqrt{2}sin Asin C - 2Rsin^2 C] Dividing both sides by 2R and rearranging, we find: [sin^2 A - sin^2 B = sqrt{2}sin Asin C - sin^2 C] This simplifies to: [a^2 - b^2 = (sqrt{2}a - c)c] Given the cosine rule, which states cos B = frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}, we substitute a^2 - b^2 + c^2 = sqrt{2}ac into the cosine rule to get: [cos B = frac{sqrt{2}ac}{2ac} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}] Since cos B = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} and considering that angle B is within the range (0, pi), we conclude that: [B = frac{pi}{4}] Therefore, the measure of angle B is boxed{frac{pi}{4}}."},{"instruction":"What is the number of degrees in the acute angle formed by the hands of a clock at 3:37?","output":"Each hour mark on a clock represents 360^circ / 12 = 30^circ.

Minute 37 is frac{37}{60} of the way around the clock from the top (0 minutes), which equals frac{37}{60} times 360^circ = 222^circ from the 12 o'clock position. The hour hand at 3:37 is a bit more than halfway between 3 and 4. Since there are 30 degrees between each hour, and the hour hand moves as well with the minutes, it moves frac{37}{60} times 30^circ = 18.5^circ past the 3 o'clock position. Therefore, the hour hand is at 3 times 30^circ + 18.5^circ = 108.5^circ from the 12 o'clock position. To find the angle between the hands, we subtract the smaller angle from the larger angle: 222^circ - 108.5^circ = 113.5^circ. As we are interested in the acute angle, which is the smaller angle formed, we must consider that the full circle is 360^circ. Thus we compute 360^circ - 113.5^circ = 246.5^circ.

The cosine of a right angle (angle B) refers to the ratio of the adjacent side over the hypotenuse when considering angle C, making cos B = frac{AB}{AC}. But since angle B = 90^circ, cos B = 0.

The discriminant ( Delta ) of ( P(x) ) is given by:    [    Delta = prod_{i < j} (z_i - z_j)^2    ]    Since ( P(x) ) has integer coefficients and is monic, the discriminant ( Delta ) is a non-zero integer. This can be shown by induction on the degree of the polynomial. 2. **Vandermonde Matrix:**    The discriminant can be expressed as the square of the determinant of the Vandermonde matrix ( V ) whose ( i )-th row is ( (1, z_i, z_i^2, ldots, z_i^{n-1}) ). Explicitly, the determinant of ( V ) is:    [    det(V) = prod_{i < j} (z_i - z_j)    ]    Therefore, the discriminant ( Delta ) is:    [    Delta = (det(V))^2    ] 3. **Translation Invariance:**    The discriminant of a polynomial is invariant under translations. We can assume without loss of generality that the center of the disk containing all roots is at the origin. Thus, for all ( i ), ( |z_i| leq 0.99 ). 4. **Hadamard's Inequality:**    Hadamard's inequality states that the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix is bounded by the product of the Euclidean norms of its column vectors. For the Vandermonde matrix ( V ), the column vectors are:    [    (1, 1, ldots, 1), (z_1, z_2, ldots, z_n), (z_1^2, z_2^2, ldots, z_n^2), ldots, (z_1^{n-1}, z_2^{n-1}, ldots, z_n^{n-1})    ]    The norm of the ( k )-th column vector is:    [    left| (z_1^{k-1}, z_2^{k-1}, ldots, z_n^{k-1}) right| leq n times (0.99)^{k-1}    ]    Therefore, by Hadamard's inequality:    [    |det(V)| leq prod_{k=1}^{n} left( n times (0.99)^{k-1} right) = n^n times (0.99)^{0 + 1 + 2 + ldots + (n-1)} = n^n times (0.99)^{frac{n(n-1)}{2}}    ] 5. **Asymptotic Behavior:**    As ( n ) goes to infinity, the term ( (0.99)^{frac{n(n-1)}{2}} ) approaches zero exponentially.

This means that (d) is a common divisor of (a), (b), and (c). Since (d) is a common divisor, it must divide each term in the equation:    [    d^2 mid (a^2, b^2), quad d mid (a, bc), quad d mid (b, ac), quad d mid (c, ab).    ]    Given that (d > 1) and (d mid 199), we conclude that (d = 199).

This can be shown by letting ((b, c) = d), and writing (b = db_1) and (c = dc_1) where ((b_1, c_1) = 1). Since ((a, b, c) = 1), we have ((a, d) = 1).

However, since ((a, b)), ((a, c)), and ((b, c)) are all at least (1), it is impossible for the product of two sums of these terms to equal (199). 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, there are no positive integer solutions to the given equation.

Let’s say this radius intersects circle (C_2) at point (R).  Step 2: Extend the Chord Extend (RP) such that it intersects circle (C_1) again at another point (Q).  Step 3: Establish Triangle Relationships We will now consider the triangles formed by these points. - Triangle (C_2PR) is isosceles, as (C_2P = C_2R), since both are radii of circle (C_2). - Similarly, triangle (C_2PQ) is also isosceles, as (C_2P = C_2Q).  Step 4: Verify Angle Equality Since triangles (C_2PR) and (C_2PQ) are isosceles, the angles at the base of these triangles are equal. Therefore, [ angle C_2PR = angle C_2QP ] Furthermore, since (C_1PQ) and (C_2PR) are essentially constructed using radii at (P) that are parallel (by construction), it follows that  [ angle PC_1Q = angle PC_2R ]  Conclusion Therefore, we have demonstrated that the central angle corresponding to chord (QP) in circle (C_1) is equal to the central angle corresponding to chord (PR) in circle (C_2).  (boxed{angle PC_1Q = angle PC_2R}) This completes our proof."},{"instruction":"A basement has a 30foot by 40foot rectangular floor. The basement is flooded with water to a depth of 24 inches.

Mathematically, this is represented as x leq 300. 2. If buying 60 more pencils than the number of students allows Xiaoming to pay at the wholesale price, it means the total pencils bought is more than 300. This gives us x + 60 > 300. Combining these two conditions, we have: [x leq 300] [x + 60 > 300] Solving the second inequality for x gives: [x > 300 - 60] [x > 240] Therefore, combining both conditions, we have: [240 < x leq 300] So, the range for the total number of 8th-grade students in the school is boxed{240 < x leq 300}.  Part 2: Finding the Exact Number of 8th-Grade Students Given that buying 360 pencils at the wholesale price costs the same as buying 300 pencils at the retail price, we can set up the following equation based on the cost per pencil: Retail price per pencil = frac{120}{x} yuan   Wholesale price per pencil = frac{120}{x + 60} yuan The equation representing the total cost for both scenarios is: [frac{120}{x + 60} times 360 = frac{120}{x} times 300] Simplifying both sides: [4 times frac{120}{x + 60} = 3 times frac{120}{x}] Cross-multiplying to solve for x: [4x = 3(x + 60)] [4x = 3x + 180] [x = 180] However, upon rechecking the setup, it appears there was a mistake in the simplification step. The correct approach to solve the equation frac{120}{x + 60} times 360 = frac{120}{x} times 300 is: [360 = 3(x + 60)] [120(x + 60) = 120 cdot 300] [x + 60 = 300] [x = 240] This is incorrect based on the initial setup.

This group of three can be arranged with the other two remaining individuals in 3! = 3 times 2 times 1 = 6 ways. Thus, multiplying these possibilities, we get a total number of ways as 12 times 6 = 72 ways. However, upon revisiting and validating the original solution, the correct factor for the arrangement of the remaining two people should actually be included in the 3! calculation for the entire group of five, and not as a separate 2!. This oversight means the corrected formula should be: The correct total number of arrangements is 3 (ways to choose the person between A and B) times 2 (ways to arrange A and B) times 3! (ways to arrange the entire group including A and B and the middle person) = 3 times 2 times 3! = 3 times 2 times 6 = 36 ways.

Here, ((i,j)) denotes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of ( i ) and ( j ). 2. **Initial Observations:**    - If ( i = j ), then (frac{i+i}{(i,i)} = frac{2i}{i} = 2), which implies that ( 2 in S ) if ( S ) contains any repeated element.    - If ( i neq j ), then (frac{i+j}{(i,j)}) must be an integer and an element of ( S ). 3. **Lemma 1:**    - Define ( f(i,j) = frac{i+j}{(i,j)} ).    - We need to check if ( f(i,j) ) is involutive, i.e., if ( f(i,j) = i ) or ( f(i,j) = j ). 4. **Case Analysis:**    - **Case 1: ( gcd(i,j) = 1 ):**      - Here, ( f(i,j) = i + j ).      - Since ( i ) and ( j ) are distinct, ( i + j ) is greater than both ( i ) and ( j ). This implies that ( S ) must contain larger elements, leading to an infinite set, which contradicts the finiteness of ( S ).    - **Case 2: ( gcd(i,j) = k > 1 ):**      - Let ( i = k cdot i' ) and ( j = k cdot j' ) where ( gcd(i', j') = 1 ).      - Then, ( f(i,j) = frac{k(i' + j')}{k} = i' + j' ).      - Since ( i' ) and ( j' ) are coprime, ( i' + j' ) must be an element of ( S ). 5. **Finite Set Construction:**    - Consider ( S = { n } ) for any positive integer ( n ). This trivially satisfies the condition since there are no distinct pairs ( i, j ) to consider.    - Consider ( S = { n, n(n-1) } ) for ( n > 2 ):      - For ( i = n ) and ( j = n(n-1) ), we have ( gcd(n, n(n-1)) = n ).      - Then, ( f(n, n(n-1)) = frac{n + n(n-1)}{n} = frac{n^2}{n} = n ).      - This implies ( n in S ), which is already true. 6. **Verification:**    - For ( S = { n } ), the condition is trivially satisfied.    - For ( S = { n, n(n-1) } ), the condition is satisfied as shown above. 7. **Conclusion:**    - The only finite nonempty sets ( S ) that satisfy the given condition are of the form ( S = { n } ) and ( S = { n, n(n-1) } ) for ( n > 2 ).

First, let's find the number of ways to choose one negative integer from set m and one positive integer from set t. Since all integers in set m are negative, we have 5 choices from set m. From set t, we have 5 positive integers (1, 2, 3, 4, and 0 is neither positive nor negative, so we don't count it). So, there are 5 * 5 = 25 ways to choose one negative from m and one positive from t. Next, let's find the number of ways to choose one positive integer from set m and one negative integer from set t. However, since set m does not contain any positive integers, this case is not possible. Therefore, the total number of ways to get a negative product is 25. Now, let's find the total number of possible pairs of integers we can choose, one from set m and one from set t. There are 5 choices from set m and 8 choices from set t (including 0), giving us a total of 5 * 8 = 40 possible pairs. Finally, the probability that the product of the two integers will be negative is the number of ways to get a negative product divided by the total number of possible pairs: Probability = Number of negative products / Total number of pairs Probability = 25 / 40 Probability = 5 / 8 So, the probability that the product of the two integers will be negative is boxed{5/8} ."},{"instruction":"Let ( C ) be the circle centered at ((0, 0)) with radius 1.

The sequences (a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{2015}) and (b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots, b_{2015}) are both permutations of the same set of integers.  2. Consider the product ( prod_{i=1}^{2015} (a_i - b_i) = 2017^{2016} ). 3. Since (2017 = 2 times 1008 + 1), it follows that 2017 is an odd number. Hence (2017^{2016}) is also odd (since the power of an odd number remains odd). 4. Therefore, each term (a_i - b_i) must be an odd integer because the product of any number of even integers cannot be odd – it would be even. 5. Next, we derive an important property of odd integers: the sum of an odd number of odd integers results in an odd sum. Essentially,    - Let odd integers be defined as ( a_{i} = 2k_{i} + 1 ) and ( b_{i} = 2m_{i} + 1 ) for integers ( k_{i} ) and ( m_{i} ). Then ( a_{i} - b_{i} = (2k_{i} + 1) - (2m_{i} + 1) = 2(k_{i} - m_{i}) ). 6.

The only way the sum of the differences that are all odd can be zero is if there's an equal number of positive and negative values.

We need to find the sum of the angles inscribed in the five segments outside the pentagon. 1. **Identify the Segments and Angles**:    - The five segments outside the pentagon are the regions outside ABCDE but inside the circle.    - Let alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon be the angles inscribed in the segments outside ABCDE near vertices A, B, C, D, E respectively. 2. **Angle Properties**:    - Each angle inscribed in a segment measures half the degree measure of the arc it subtends.    - The total degree measure of the circle is 360^circ. 3. **Arcs Subtended by Pentagon Angles**:    - The angle at vertex A subtends an arc equal to 360^circ - text{arc } BCDE.    - Similarly, the angles at vertices B, C, D, E subtend arcs 360^circ - text{arc } CDEA, 360^circ - text{arc } DEAB, 360^circ - text{arc } EABC, and 360^circ - text{arc } ABCD respectively. 4. **Sum of Angles in Segments**:    - Angle alpha subtends the arc BCDE, so alpha = frac{1}{2}(360^circ - text{arc } BCDE), and so on for beta, gamma, delta, epsilon. 5. **Calculate the Total Sum**:    - The sum of these angles is:      [      alpha + beta + gamma + delta + epsilon = frac{1}{2}[(360^circ - text{arc } BCDE) + (360^circ - text{arc } CDEA) + (360^circ - text{arc } DEAB) + (360^circ - text{arc } EABC) + (360^circ - text{arc } ABCD)]      ]    - Since the sum of the arcs BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC, ABCD is 360^circ, the equation simplifies to:      [      alpha + beta + gamma + delta + epsilon = frac{1}{2}[5 times 360^circ - 360^circ] = frac{1}{2} times 1440^circ = 720^circ      ] Thus, the sum of the five angles inscribed in the segments outside the pentagon is 720^circ.
