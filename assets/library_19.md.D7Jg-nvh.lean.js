We have this equation: 3 * b - 24 = -33 1. First, let's add 24 to both sides to get rid of the -24 in the equation. This is like saying, if we have 3 apples and take away 24 candies, we are left with -33 toys. To find out how many toys we have without the candies, we add 24 candies back. 3 * b - 24 + 24 = -33 + 24 Now, the -24 and the +24 on the left side cancel each other out: 3 * b = -9 2. Now, we have 3 * b = -9. This means 3 times some number (b) is equal to -9. To find out what 'b' is, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3. It's like saying, we have three groups of toys that equal -9 toys, so if we separate them evenly, how many toys are in each group? To do this, we do: (3 * b) ÷ 3 = -9 ÷ 3 3 and 3 cancel each other: b = -3 So, b equals -3.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Parents' Guide To College Depression Most parents of college-bound kids are likely caught up this month in thoughts of shopping lists, what to pack and how they'll say goodbye. But given the growing number of college-aged kids reporting that they're dealing with depression, it may also be worth it to think about how these kids will handle the sometimes overwhelming transition to being on his or her own--and, should it trigger a mental health disorder, what parents can do. Everything from the way parents talk to their kids on the phone at school to their own attitudes about seeking mental health counseling can have an impact, experts say. The rate of students reporting ever having been diagnosed with depression increased 56% between 2000 and 2005, from 10% to 16%, according to the American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment. But just how common is the problem? The organization's fall 2007 survey showed that, of more than 20,000 students questioned at 48 schools, 36% were so depressed that it had caused difficulty functioning on one to 10 occasions during the previous year. Why Now? Depression has likely grown among college-aged students in the U.S. due to more diagnoses (an effect of increased awareness), more campus mental health resources and a greater willingness to discuss the problem and seek treatment for it, says Dr. Rachel Glick, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan and former co-chair of the Presidential Task Force on Mental Health on College Campuses. Kids today are also being treated for psychological problems earlier than ever before, enabling them to attend college when it might not have been possible otherwise. There's also a lot to be said about the powder keg that can be a young adult's transition to college. Not only are kids aged 18 to 22 experiencing a flood of developmental changes, they're also usually living on their own for the first time, dealing with the stresses of figuring out their careers and staying up all night. Some are experimenting with drugs and alcohol. And then there are all of those expectations. \\"There are a lot of notions that this is the way college has to be, this is the way I've planned on it to be my whole life,\\" says Todd Sevig, a psychologist who directs counseling and psychology services for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Michigan. \\"When that starts to change, it's disconcerting.\\" What You Can Do While many parents are aware of their college-bound children's vulnerabilities, whether due to past experiences with depression or a family history, others are caught by surprise. \\"Some people are quite vulnerable [to depression], but it doesn't emerge until the highly stressful years of separation and trying to grow into adulthood,\\" says Dr. Chris Martin, staff psychiatrist and team leader of the Menninger Clinic's Compass Program, an inpatient hospital program for 18- to 30-year-olds struggling with psychiatric disorders. That's why it's crucial for parents to keep an eye out for changes in their child's attitude and behavior during the transition to college, as well as other periods of change such as the times leading up to summer break and graduation. This can be tricky to do, especially from afar, but the key is to look for unusual changes in your child's appetite, sleeping habits (such as a sudden onset of insomnia), ability to concentrate and energy levels, Martin says. If you spend a lot of time talking with your child about his or her hopes for college, consider discussing the problems he or she might encounter too, suggests Dr. Flynn O'Malley, the Compass Program's program director. Bringing up the topic now can make it easier for your child to open up about problems later. Sharing the fact that there's no weakness in seeking counseling to get through a period of depression can also, in a subtle way, influence your child to get help if he or she ever needs it. Sending a child off to school? How are you handling the transition? Weigh in. Post your thoughts in the Reader Comments section below. Parents whose children are currently dealing with depression would also be wise to compare the mental health resources at the schools on their child's wish list, Sevig says. If a child's problem is severe, it might mean asking if he or she would be able to work with a psychiatrist or inquiring about whether students are ever hospitalized if their illnesses progress. It's smart to look into what your health insurance covers in terms of mental health care in different states, too. With some planning, parents can position themselves so they're better able to help their children deal with depression and get as much as possible out of the college experience. \\"Kids with depression and anxiety disorders should be able to succeed with good treatment,\\" Glick says. \\"I think it's harder, but it shouldn't be a block to their being successful.\\"","output":"This news article emphasizes the importance of parents being aware of and addressing the potential for college-related depression in their children. The rate of students reporting diagnosed depression has increased significantly; a survey showed that 36% of over 20,000 students at 48 schools were so depressed that it had caused difficulty functioning at least once during the previous year. Factors contributing to this issue include increased awareness and willingness to discuss mental health concerns, greater accessibility of campus mental health resources, and the significant developmental changes and stressors faced by college students. Parents can play an essential role in helping their children manage depression by being aware of any changes in their child's behavior or attitude during the college transition and discussing potential challenges with them. Encouraging openness about mental health issues and emphasizing the importance of seeking professional help can also provide a safety net for students who may experience depression. Additionally, parents should research and compare the mental health resources at each school on their child's list, as well as understand the scope of mental health care coverage provided by their health insurance in different states. With proper planning and support, children with depression and anxiety disorders can succeed in college with appropriate treatment and assistance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: If your parents have different Rh factors (or if they are both positive and you want to know for sure that you are also positive), you can request a blood typing test. This outpatient procedure is fast and should not be very painful. You can go home afterwards. A nurse or physician will clean a spot on your inner elbow or wrist with an antiseptic towelette. He/She will locate an easily accessible vein in this area. After wrapping a tourniquet around your upper arm to pool the blood, he/she will stick your vein with a needle. The needle is usually connected to a syringe, which removes your blood. Once he/she has taken enough blood, he/she will take out the needle and gently press the injection site with a sterile swab. You will then receive a bandage. Afterwards, the nurse will label your sample and send it to a lab for testing.  Doctors test children’s blood through the back of their hands.  If you feel like you might pass out, tell the medical professional. He/She can help you recline.  You might feel a prick, sting, or mild pain when your nurse sticks you. After the test, you might bruise at the puncture site. This pain should not last long. At the laboratory, a technician will test your sample for its Rh factor. He/She will combine a sample of your blood with an anti-Rh serum. If your cells clot, you have Rh+. On the other hand, if your blood cells do not stick together, you are Rh-. It is likely that the lab will run tests to determine your ABO blood type as well during this time. Record your blood type in a safe place and share this information with your emergency contacts. You will need this information if you require a blood transfusion or organ transplants. Additionally, if you are or plan to be pregnant, knowing your Rh factor is essential. If you are female and Rh-, you will need to have your partner test his Rh factor. If you are Rh- and he is Rh+, you can experience Rh incompatibility. This means that if your baby inherits his father’s Rh+, your antibodies can attack the baby's red blood cells. This can cause extreme anemia and possible death for the baby.  During your pregnancy, if you are Rh-, you will take blood tests to see whether your body is producing antibodies against Rh+ blood. The first will happen in your first trimester and the second will occur when you are 28 weeks pregnant. If no antibodies have developed, you will receive a shot of Rh immune globulin. This shot will prevent your body from producing harmful antibodies against your child.  If your body has produced antibodies against Rh+ blood, you will not receive an immune globulin shot. Instead, doctors will keep a close eye on your baby as he/she develops. Either before or after his/her birth, your child might receive a blood transfusion.  Once your baby is born, doctors can test his/her Rh factor. If your baby shares your Rh factor, you will need no further treatment. If you are Rh- negative, however, and your baby is Rh+, you must receive another immune globulin shot.","output":"If your mom and dad have different blood types, you might need a test to find out your own blood type. This test is quick and not too painful. A nurse or doctor will take a small sample of your blood using a needle. They will then send that blood to a lab to find your blood type. Knowing your blood type is important if you ever need a blood transfusion, organ transplant, or are planning to have a baby. If a mom has a certain blood type called Rh- and the dad has Rh+, their baby might have a health problem called Rh incompatibility. This can make the baby very sick or even cause them to die. During pregnancy, the mom will take tests to see if her body is making things that can harm the baby. If not, she will get a special shot to keep the baby safe.

Question: Given the background: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  and the situation: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess.  Answer the following question: Does lake Mahoe have more or less chemicals in it than lake Tresco? Answer:","output":"Given the background information and the situations of both lakes, it is likely that Lake Mahoe has more chemicals in it than Lake Tresco. The reason for this conclusion is as follows: 1. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows various crops for the town, which implies they may be using significant amounts of fertilizers and pesticides to ensure good crop production. These chemicals can potentially run off the farm fields and enter the lake. 2. The owner of the farm at Lake Mahoe also rents out his barn for celebrations, indicating that there might be more visitors and activities on the farm. These visitors could inadvertently contribute to chemical pollution by spilling food, drinks, or other products during their celebrations. Lake Tresco, on the other hand, is located near a school and is primarily used by children during recess. While children may inadvertently contribute to pollution, the sources and amounts would likely be less significant than those at Lake Mahoe. Based on this analysis, I conclude that Lake Mahoe likely has more chemicals in it than Lake Tresco."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Brussels Airport reopens to thin stream of passengers BRUSSELS, April 3 (Reuters) - Brussels Airport reopened to a thin stream of passengers on Sunday, 12 days after suicide bombers destroyed its departure hall and killed 16 people. SEE ALSO: Two additional US citizens confirmed killed in Brussels attack Belgium's main airport had not handled passenger flights since two suspected Islamist militants carried out the suicide attacks. Those bombs and a separate one on a metro train in the capital killed 32 people, excluding the three bombers. The first of three scheduled flights set for Sunday was due to depart for Faro in Portugal at 1:40 p.m. local time (1140 GMT), with only about 60-70 passengers. Planes will also go to Turin and Athens later in the day, with three return flights set for the evening. The first passengers for nearly two weeks fed into a vast temporary marquee housing security controls and check-in facilities. Arnaud Feist, the airport's chief executive, said Sunday would be an emotional day for many airport staff, but described the partial reopening as a sign of hope.

(Photo by Dursun Aydemir/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) On Monday, the airport will serve a far wider range of destinations, including one plane also due out to New York and two more to cities in Cameroon, Gambia and Senegal. Many flights have been rerouted to Belgium's regional airports or other nearby hubs such as Amsterdam and Paris, with high-speed trains to and from Brussels packed. Brussels Airport has warned passengers to arrive three hours before their flights due to increased security and to come by car. The normal train and bus services are not running. Special cameras will be set up to read number plates, there will be random checks of vehicles and the drop-off zone will not be accessible. Passengers and their baggage will be checked on arrival and there will be increased patrols of armed police and military. The airport is one of the largest in Europe, handling 23.5 million passengers per year. It links the Belgian capital, headquarter city of the European Union and NATO, with 226 destinations worldwide through 77 airlines. With its temporary check-in zone, it will only be able to handle some 800 departing passengers or about five to six flights per hour, around 20 percent of previous capacity. The airport says it aims to return to maximum capacity before the start of summer holidays at the end of June or early July, with some check-in desks restored in the departure hall, followed by a full reopening of that space. Brussels Airlines, Belgium's largest carrier and 45 percent owned by Germany's Lufthansa, has estimated the closure of its Brussels hub is costing it 5 million euros (5.7 million) per day. The city's association of hotel operators pointed to the closed airport as one of the main reasons for a more than 50 percent drop in overnight stays in the week following the bombings.

More cars are produced every year and the streets are getting more and more crowded. So during \\"rush hours\\", when people are going to or from their work, traffic is brought to a standstill. It has been suggested that commuters--the people who travel to work every day from outside the city--should share their cars and give each other lifts. So each car would carry four or five people instead of only one. It is an excellent idea., however, so far nobody has been able to think of a way to make people do so. To discourage motorists from leaving their cars in the streets all day, parking meters  are used. When you park at a meter, you must put a coin in the slot . This pays for a certain amount of time. The meter records this and it shows when the time that you have paid for is finished. If the car is still there then, you have to pay a fine. Traffic wardens  look after the meters. They walk around the streets and check that every meter shows that money has been paid for the car parked there. If a meter shows 'TIME EXPIRED', the motorist who has left his car there is fined. Of course, the traffic warden can not wait for the owner of the car to return. He carries many printed forms, and on one of these he writes down all the details, such as the number of the car, where it is parked, how much the driver must pay and where he must send the money. He leaves this form on the car, where the driver will be able to see it easily; he usually pushes it under one of the windscreen wipers  so that it will not be blown away. And in case it rains before the motorist returns, the form is put in a little plastic envelope to protect it. When the driver comes back, he gets an unpleasant surprise, but it is his own fault for leaving his car too long at parking meter.

Given the question: Question: Where does Ave meet Vincent Cadby? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls Context: After failing the rescue attempt of a raccoon in the Himalayas (a parody of the opening to the film Cliffhanger), Ace Ventura undergoes an emotional breakdown and goes on a personal soul-searching quest by becoming a Tibetan monk. He is approached by Fulton Greenwall, a British correspondent working for a provincial consulate in the fictional African country of Nibia. Being that Ace's influence is disruptive to the monastery, the Grand Abbot eagerly gives Ace excuses by which to justify his departure.Greenwall asks Ventura to find a sacred animal called Shikaka, which has become a point of contention. Shikaka, which is a great white bat, is a sacred animal for the Wachati and Wachootoo tribes of Nibia; whenever its name is spoken, the tribesmen must bow. Accompanied by his capuchin monkey, Spike, Ace travels to Africa and returns to his pet detective work.After arriving in Nibia and meeting with the head of the consulate, Vincent Cadby, Ace begins learning about his case as well as the possible suspects. Ace, normally an animal lover, must overcome his fear of bats in order to continue studying the case. He travels to the Wachati tribal village, where he learns that Shikaka is meant as a wedding present from the Wachati Princess, who is set to wed the Wachootoo Prince. If the bat is not returned in time, the Wachootoo will declare war on the Wachati tribe instead. Much of Ace's activity involves eliminating various suspects and enduring the problems of dealing with the Wachati and the Wachootoo, who refer to him as the \\"white devil\\". This proves difficult, and is made more so by other incidents including attempts to kill him. Reduced to the limit of his ability to solve mysteries, Ace consults the Grand Abbot via astral projection.Advised by the Abbot, Ace finally discovers that Vincent Cadby had taken the bat and hired Ace as a cover for his own crimes. Cadby plans to let the tribes destroy each other and take possession of their land, using the numerous bat caves containing guano to sell as fertilizer. Ace...

Această problemă se referă la modul în care piața muncii nu se adaptează eficient la schimbările și performanțele individuale și colective în ceea ce privește productivitatea. O piață a muncii rigidă tinde să mențină anumite structuri salariale și condiții, fără a ține cont în mod corespunzător de creșterea sau scăderea productivității, ceea ce conduce la discrepante între nivelurile salariale și efortul depus de angajați. Într-o piață a muncii flexibilă, salariile și condițiile ar trebui să se adapteze în funcție de schimbările în productivitate și cererea de forță de muncă, astfel încât oamenii să poată lucra în proporție cu cât vor să câștige și să ducă o viață decentă. Acest lucru ar implica un salariu mai mare pentru acei angajați care contribuie la creșterea productivității și, de asemenea, ar oferi oportunități de a munci mai mult pentru a câștiga mai mult. Aspectele legale, precum reglementările privind salariul minim, protecția locului de muncă și normele de sănătate și securitate în muncă, pot contribui la rigiditatea pieței muncii în cazul în care nu sunt adaptate la necesitățile specifice și rezultatele angajaților și angajatorilor. De exemplu, un salariu minim prea ridicat ar putea să nu țină cont de productivitate și ar putea duce la creșterea raportului dintre salariile angajaților și costurile angajatorilor, în vreme ce protecția excesivă contra concedierii ar putea îngreuna ajustarea condițiilor de muncă la cerințele pieței. Având în vedere toate aceste aspecte, este important ca piața muncii să fie mai flexibilă și să țină cont de diferențele de productivitate și nevoile angajaților și angajatorilor.

No-slip is another way of saying the items has a lot of friction. In Figure 1.9, the blades of the skates are very smooth. Thats why you cant slide across ice with shoes. The soles of your shoes are much rougher than skates. The rougher surface of shoes causes more friction and slows you down. Heavier objects also have more friction. A heavy object presses down with more force. The surfaces are held together more tightly. This makes the surfaces harder to slide past each other.

To understand why this is the most plausible explanation, let's first briefly discuss the physics behind color and light reflection. The color of an object is determined by the wavelengths of light that it reflects. When white light (which is a combination of all colors) strikes an object, the object absorbs certain wavelengths and reflects others. The wavelengths that are reflected determine the color that we perceive the object to be. In the case of a white stove, it appears white because it reflects all wavelengths of visible light. A white surface scatters all photons away from it without absorbing any, so it is not selectively reflecting any particular color. Instead, it reflects the whole spectrum of visible light, leading our eyes to perceive it as white. Now, let's analyze the other options and their lack of sensibility: Option 2: A chef specified white makes food cook better While it's true that the color of a surface can affect heat absorption (e.g., darker colors absorb more heat), this option is not sensible in terms of the appearance of the stove. The purpose of a stove is to provide a functional way to cook food, and its color wouldn't directly impact the cooking process. A chef's preference for the color of a stove would be more related to aesthetics or design rather than cooking performance. Option 3: It was black until someone scrubbed all the blood off it and it turned white This option is quite far-fetched and holds no scientific or logical basis. The color of an object is determined by its material and its interaction with light, not by unassociated, external factors like the presence of blood. Option 4: Confining a stove to any specific color is color-shaming and indicates white privilege This option is irrelevant in the context of explaining why a stove appears white. The question at hand is about the physics of light reflection and the color that an object appears based on that interaction, not about social or political issues. In conclusion, among the available options, Option 1: it scatters all photons away from it without absorbing any is the most sensible reason for a stove being white. It is based on the science of light reflection and the properties of materials that determine the color of an object."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Bailey married a pretty woman after years of dating a man.

Ken (left) and Harry Akune served in the U.S. military during World War II. Not long after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Harry and Ken Akune were sent to live in an internment camp in Amache, Colorado. When the U.S. Army's Military Intelligence Service came to their camp to recruit Japanese-speaking volunteers as interpreters, they joined so they could prove their loyalty to their country. Across the world in Japan, their father Ichiro was raising the rest of his large family -- which had returned to his home country after the death of his wife -- in a fishing village, Kagoshima, on the island of Kyushu. The youngest brothers, Saburo and Shiro, were just teenagers when they were drafted into the Imperial Japanese Navy. It's only right to be loyal to the","output":"country that's raised you, even if your blood ties may lie elsewhere. As the war raged on, the Akune brothers found themselves fighting on opposite sides of the battlefield, each doing their duty for their respective countries. Ken and Harry spent their days in the United States, working tirelessly to decipher and translate information that would prove vital in the fight against Japan. As dedicated and skilled linguists, they became increasingly valuable assets to the U.S. military, all the while knowing that their efforts could potentially harm their brothers in Japan. Across the sea, Saburo and Shiro gave their all to serve the Imperial Japanese Navy. Training in harsh conditions and putting their lives on the line, they carried out their missions with the determination and loyalty expected of them. Despite the distance, the brothers couldn't help but think of the family they left behind in America – and the painful knowledge that they were now enemies. As World War II drew to a close, the devastation wrought across the globe was immense. Both the United States and Japan had seen unthinkable losses, and the Akune brothers were not spared. In the months following the end of the war, both sides searched eagerly for their missing family members, seeking some sign of their well-being. In the end, it was a letter from Ken and Harry, sent in 1946, that finally reached Saburo and Shiro. They received the letter on Kyushu Island, having survived the ordeal but carrying the scars of the struggle both physically and emotionally. The heartfelt message detailed the brothers' sorrow and relief that the war was over, offering hope for a reunion and better days ahead. Despite having been on opposite sides of the war, the love between the brothers remained unwavering. In 1949, an opportunity for a reunion presented itself as Saburo and Shiro were granted permission to visit Harry and Ken in the United States. Although anxious about meeting their family members after years of combat and adversity, the emotional reunion was a symbol of forgiveness, understanding, and the power of familial bonds. The Akune brothers spent precious time healing and reconnecting as a family in the years that followed. They shared stories of their experiences during the war, the internment camp, and life in Japan. They rebuilt their relationships and continued to do their best to help ameliorate the wounds inflicted by the conflict. In time, the Akune brothers started their own families, embedding the importance of loyalty and love in their children and grandchildren. The immense sacrifices they made during the war, along with the pain they endured, became a testament to the strength of the human spirit and the unbreakable bond between family. The story of the Akune brothers finally ends with a lesson that transcends national boundaries and generations – that love and family can triumph over adversity, no matter how divisive the circumstances may seem."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film. Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies. The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting \\"the factory\\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket.  Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good.

Answer this question: when does singin in the rain take place??","output":"\\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is a 1952 American musical romantic comedy film directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, and starring Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor. The movie's story takes place in Hollywood during the late 1920s, which is a transitional era for the entertainment industry as movies transitioned from silent films to \\"talkies\\" (films with sound). The time period portrayed in the film is marked by an atmosphere of excitement and change, as sound revolutionized the film industry. The story centers around the three main characters - Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), a famous silent film actor, Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), an aspiring actress, and Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), Don's best friend and a composer and pianist. This historical backdrop is crucial to the narrative. Silent film stars like Don Lockwood are grappling with the new technology as they must adapt to speaking roles in movies. These changes bring some turbulence to Lockwood's career, and he is forced to reinvent himself and his work to stay relevant in the evolving industry. As the movie unfolds, Don Lockwood's studio decides to convert his latest film, \\"The Dueling Cavalier,\\" into a talkie. However, the transition is not smooth, as the leading actress, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), has an inappropriate voice for sound films. In an effort to save the movie and their careers, the protagonists come up with the idea of transforming it into a musical called \\"The Dancing Cavalier\\" and having Kathy dub Lina's voice. While \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" initially takes place in the late 1920s, it should be noted that the film itself was made in 1952, which added a layer of nostalgia to its portrayal of a bygone era. As a result, it serves as both an ode to the talent and resilience of early Hollywood actors and filmmakers, and a fascinating exploration of the filmmaking processes and challenges of that time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which territory did Roman von Ungern-Sternberg's forces and the Transbaikal fight over? Answer:","output":"Roman von Ungern-Sternberg's forces and the Transbaikal fought over the territory of Outer Mongolia during the chaotic period that followed the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent Russian Civil War. To better understand the circumstances leading to this conflict, one must delve into the background of the involved parties and the historical context of the era. Lieutenant General Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, a Baltic German-Russian noble and military leader, earned a reputation for his brutal, fanatic, and autocratic style. He served the Russian Empire during the First World War and later fought with the White Movement against the Bolshevik forces in the Russian Civil War. Due to the revolution's profound impact on Russia, its borders, and territories, the power vacuum created an ideal opportunity for ambitious forces to fight for control over various regions. The Transbaikal, also known as Zabaykalsky Krai, is a vast region located in the Russian Far East, bordering Mongolia. In the wake of the Russian Revolution, the Transbaikal region became a hotbed of political unrest and a site of power struggle between various factions, including the White Movement, the Bolsheviks, and regional warlords seeking autonomy. At the same time, the Bogd Khanate (Outer) Mongolia was established in 1911 after the fall of the Qing Dynasty in China. However, its autonomy was fragile due to the continuous influence exercised by both the Russian Empire and the Republic of China. With the onset of the Russian Revolution, the situation in these territories became even more muddled. Ungern-Sternberg, who was serving in the Russian Civil War in Siberia as a part of the Asiatic Cavalry Division, eventually set his sights on Mongolia as a potential base for anti-Bolshevik operations. Additionally, he sought to reinstate the Bogd Khan's rule as Mongolian leaders had reached out to the White Movement for military assistance against Chinese forces that occupied parts of Mongolia in 1919.  Ungern-Sternberg's forces clashed with the Transbaikal Cossacks throughout the border regions between Mongolia and the Transbaikal, including the Siberian border. The conflict intensified in 1920 as Ungern-Sternberg launched a series of military campaigns and successfully took control of much of Outer Mongolia, expelling the Chinese forces and reinstating the Mongolian ruler Bogd Khan in early 1921. Despite this success, Ungern-Sternberg's harsh rule and unrealistic dreams of forming a pan-Mongolian Empire quickly led to his downfall. Soviet Russia, now under the rule of the Bolsheviks, supported a Mongolian communist movement called the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP). In mid-1921, a joint Soviet-Red Mongolian Army defeated Ungern-Sternberg's forces and ultimately led to his capture and execution. In conclusion, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg's forces and the Transbaikal fought over the territory of Outer Mongolia during a tumultuous period of political upheaval and power struggle following the Russian Revolution. The shifting alliances and conflicting interests among the various actors, both regional and international, further exacerbated the situation, yielding a complex and violent conflict that pursued territorial control and political domination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was born in 1947 in Imam Sahib District of the Kunduz province, northern Afghanistan, a member of the Kharoti tribe of the Ghilji Pashtun. His father, Ghulam Qader, who migrated to Kunduz, is originally from the center of Ghazni province. Afghan businessman and Kharoti tribal leader Gholam Serwar Nasher deemed Hekmatyar to be a bright young man and sent him to the Mahtab Qala military academy in 1968, but he was expelled due to his political views two years later. From 1970 to 1972, Hekmatyar attended Kabul University's engineering department. After the 9/11 attacks in the United States Hekmatyar, who had allegedly \\"worked closely\\" with bin Laden in early 1990s, declared his opposition to the US campaign in Afghanistan and criticized Pakistan for assisting the United States. After the U.S. entry into the anti-Taliban alliance and the fall of the Taliban, Hekmatyar rejected the U.N.-brokered accord of 5 December 2001 negotiated in Germany as a post-Taliban interim government for Afghanistan. As a result of pressure by the U.S. and the Karzai administration, on 10 February 2002 all the offices of Hezb-e-Islami were closed in Iran and Hekmatyar was expelled by his Iranian hosts.  The United States accuses Hekmatyar of urging Taliban fighters to re-form and fight against Coalition troops in Afghanistan. He is also accused of offering bounties for those who kill U.S. troops. He has been labeled a war criminal by members of the U.S.-backed President Hamid Karzai's government. He is also a suspect behind the 5 September 2002 assassination attempt on Karzai that killed more than a dozen people. In September 2002, Hekmatyar released a taped message calling for jihad against the United States. On 25 December 2002 the news broke that American spy organizations had discovered Hekmatyar attempting to join al-Qaeda. According to the news, he had said that he was available to aid them. However, in a video released by Hekmatyar 1 September 2003, he denied forming alliances with the Taliban or al-Qaeda, but praised attacks against U.S. and international forces.  On 19 February 2003 the United States State Department and the United States Treasury Department jointly designated Hekmatyar a \\"global terrorist.\\" This designation meant that any assets Hekmatyar held in the USA, or held through companies based in the U.S., would be frozen. The U.S. also requested the United Nations Committee on Terrorism to follow suit, and designate Hekmatyar an associate of Osama bin Laden. In October 2003, he declared a ceasefire with local commanders in Jalalabad, Kunar, Logar and Surobi, and stated that they should only fight foreigners.  In May 2006, he released a video to Al Jazeera in which he accused Iran of backing the U.S. in the Afghan conflict and said he was ready to fight alongside Osama bin Laden and blamed the ongoing conflicts in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan on U.S. interference. In September 2006, he was reported as captured, but the report was later retracted. In December 2006, a video was released in Pakistan, where Gulbuddin Hekmatyar claimed \\"the fate Soviet Union faced is awaiting America as well.\\" In January 2007 CNN reported that Hekmatyar claimed \\"that his fighters helped Osama bin Laden escape from the mountains of Tora Bora five years ago.\\" BBC news reported a quote from a December 2006 interview broadcast on GEO TV, \\"We helped them [bin Laden and Zawahiri] get out of the caves and led them to a safe place.\\" Have there been any assassination attempts?","output":"Yes, there have been assassination attempts in the past. One significant attempt mentioned in the article was the assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai on September 5, 2002. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is suspected to be behind this attempt, which resulted in the death of more than a dozen people. As a result of his alleged involvement in such activities and his opposition to the US-backed government, Hekmatyar has been labeled a war criminal by members of President Hamid Karzai's government."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: He worked for price stabilization for farm products. Sentence 2: Wage stabilization is necessary for industrial peace. Does stabilization mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"To determine if \\"stabilization\\" means the same thing in both sentences, let's break down the context of each sentence and analyze the meaning of \\"stabilization\\" in each case. Sentence 1: He worked for price stabilization for farm products. - Context: The subject, \\"he,\\" worked for stabilizing the prices of farm products. - Stabilization here refers to maintaining prices at a steady level so that they do not fluctuate excessively, which could cause problems for both farmers and consumers. Sentence 2: Wage stabilization is necessary for industrial peace. - Context: Stability of employee wages leads to industrial peace, i.e., a balanced and conflict-free working environment. - Stabilization in this instance refers to maintaining wages at consistent, predictable rates, preventing erratic changes that might lead to employee dissatisfaction or unrest. Now, let's compare the meanings of \\"stabilization\\" from both sentences: - In Sentence 1, stabilization refers to maintaining steady prices of farm products. - In Sentence 2, stabilization refers to maintaining consistent wages for employees. While the specific objects of stabilization ('prices' vs. 'wages') differ in the two sentences, the fundamental concept of \\"stabilization\\" remains the same in both cases.

Kidd was born in San Francisco, and raised in an upper middle class section of Oakland. His father, Steve, was African-American, and his mother, Anne, is Irish-American. As a youth, Kidd was highly scouted for AAU teams and tourneys, garnering various all-star and MVP awards. He attended the East Oakland Youth Development Center and frequented the city courts of Oakland, where he often found himself pitted against future NBA Hall of Famer Gary Payton. On July 1, 2014, the Milwaukee Bucks secured Kidd's coaching rights from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for two second-round draft picks in 2015 and 2019. The move did not come without controversy, as it was reported that Kidd had been seeking more management power over the Nets' general manager Billy King and after being denied began talks with the Bucks even though they still had a coach under contract in Larry Drew. He later stated that he felt the Nets truly did not want him nor were they committed to building a contender. In his return to Brooklyn on November 19, 2014, he was greeted with heavy boos and jeers.  The Bucks were one of the biggest surprises of the 2014-15 season. Under Kidd's guidance the young team improved from franchise-worst 15 wins in the previous season, finishing with a 41-41 record to advance to the playoffs as the 6th seed in the Eastern Conference. Milwaukee achieved that feat despite losing their 2nd draft pick overall Jabari Parker in December to a knee injury and trading star guard Brandon Knight to the Phoenix Suns in February. Kidd is the first coach in NBA history to lead two franchises to the playoffs in his first two years as a head coach. Kidd finished third in voting for the Coach of the Year Award behind Mike Budenholzer and Steve Kerr.  The 2015-16 season was less successful for Kidd, as the Bucks finished with a 33-49 record and did not qualify to the playoffs. On December 20, 2015 it was reported that Kidd would be out indefinitely as he would undergo hip surgery on December 21. While Kidd was recovering, his assistant Joe Prunty was acting as an interim coach. On a positive note, Kidd moved rising 21-year old Giannis Antetokounmpo into a point guard position, which helped the young player to record five triple doubles in the season and make progress in most statistical categories. Despite the disappointing season, the Bucks owners issued Kidd a vote of confidence and mentioned a possible prolongation of his contract expiring after the next season.  The following season Kidd led the Bucks to a winning record as they qualified to the playoffs for the second time in three years. Kidd had his projected starting unit available for just several minutes during the season. On February 9, the same day the shooting guard Khris Middleton was making his season debut after recovering from a hamstring injury, the power forward Jabari Parker went down with an ACL injury. Despite the setback, Kidd had the Bucks finishing the season strong with a 42-40 record. In the first round of the playoffs against the Toronto Raptors, the Bucks took a 2-1 lead after game 3, but went on to lose the series in six games.

QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: New findings suggest that brainy card games such as contract bridge   may temporarily raise production of a key blood cell including in fighting off illness. After 90 minutes of play, bridge players had increased level of immune  cell, according to research reported last week.  A researcher, Diamond, studies bridge players from a woman's bridge club. She chose bridge players because the game includes skills stimulating  a part of the brain called the dorsolateral cortex. Earlier animal research suggests that this part of the brain may play a role in the immune system. The findings are based on blood samples drawn from 12 women players. Their blood samples showed a rise in levels of white blood cells called T cells after they played bridge for 90 minutes. T cells are produced by the thymus gland  and used by the immune system against diseases. The T cells count jumped significantly in eight of the bridge players, and slightly in the other four.  The findings contribute to the field of neuroimmunology , whose name reflects the fact that the nervous system and the immune system are not considered separate and isolated systems. What isn't clear is whether the help to the immune system from an activity like contract bridge is lasting or temporary. It's also not clear whether the increase in T cells could finally be targeted against special illness. Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to this article?

He retired as an NFL player after the 1978 season, and then played one additional season in the Canadian Football League (CFL) for the Montreal Alouettes in 1980. While he lacked the breakaway speed for deep pass receptions, Biletnikoff was one of the most sure-handed and consistent receivers of his day. He was also known for running smooth, precise pass routes. He is a member of both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame.  - Florida State University (commonly referred to as Florida State or FSU) is an American public space-grant and sea-grant research university. Its primary campus is located on a 1,391.54-acre (5.631 km2) campus in Tallahassee, Florida, United States. It is a senior member of the State University System of Florida. Founded in 1851, it is located on the oldest continuous site of higher education in the state of Florida.  - The Fred Biletnikoff Award is presented annually to the outstanding receiver in American college football by the Tallahassee Quarterback Club Foundation, Inc. (TQCF), an independent not-for-profit organization which created the award in 1994 and has sponsored it since. The award is named for Fred Biletnikoff, who played college football at Florida State University and professionally with the Oakland Raiders. Any NCAA Division I FBS player who catches the football through the forward pass is eligible to be selected as the award winner, although every winner since 1994 has been a wide receiver. A national selection committee consisting of over 540 journalists, commentators, broadcasters, and former players selects the award winner. No member of the board of trustees of the foundation has a vote.  - History. Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.  Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs  the highest level  playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities  Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University  consist entirely of chairback seating.)  - A wide receiver (also referred to as wideouts or simply receivers) is an offensive position in American and Canadian football, and is the key player in most of the passing plays. They get their name because they are split out \\"wide\\" (near the sidelines), furthest away from the rest of the team. Wide receivers are among the fastest players on the field. The wide receiver functions as the pass-catching specialist.  - The Oakland Raiders are a professional American football franchise based in Oakland, California. The team commenced operations in 1960 as a member of the American Football League (AFL); they are currently members of the National Football League (NFL), which merged with the AFL in 1970. The Raiders currently compete in the NFL as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) West division and play their home games at the OaklandAlameda County Coliseum. At the end of the NFL's 2015 season, the Raiders boasted a lifetime regular season record of 444 wins, 397 losses, and 11 ties; their lifetime playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 18 losses.

Their house is near the house where the massacred family lived. As told by the neighbors, four years prior, a girl named Carrie-Ann Jacobson killed her parents, then fled into the forest and was never seen again, leaving her brother Ryan (Max Thieriot) as the sole survivor. Ryan now lives alone and is hated by his neighbors; Bill Weaver (Gil Bellows), a local police officer, appears to be Ryan's only supporter.

Waters told supporters, \\"If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.\\" The most prominent Democrat in the House of Representatives, however, disagreed with Walters. \\"Trump's daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable,\\" Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Twitter on Monday. \\"As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea.\\" Pelosi's tweet included a link to a CNN story about Waters encouraging harassment of Trump administration officials. Trump also responded to Water's remarks, saying on Twitter that the congresswoman — whom he referred to as an \\"extraordinarily low IQ person\\" — had called for his supporters to be harassed. In the social media message, the president concluded, \\"Be careful what you wish for Max!\\" Last week, protesters yelled at Department of Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen at an upscale Mexican restaurant near the White House. Earlier, Nielsen publicly defended the policy of separating children from parents who were apprehended for illegally entering the U.S., a policy the president has since reversed.

From its origins in the fur trade, the Hudson's Bay Company is the oldest corporation in North America and was the largest department store operator in Canada until the mid-1980s, with locations across the country. It also previously owned Zellers, another major Canadian department store which ceased to exist in March 2013 after selling its lease holdings to Target Canada. Other department stores in Canada are: Canadian Tire, Sears Canada, Ogilvy, Les Ailes de la Mode, Giant Tiger, Co-op, Costco and Holt Renfrew. Grocery giant Superstores carry many non-grocery items akin to a department store. Woolco had 160 stores in Canada when operations ceased (Walmart bought out Woolco in 1994). Today low-price Walmart is by far the most dominant department store retailer in Canada with outlets throughout the country. Historically, department stores were a significant component in Canadian economic life, and chain stores such as Eaton's, Charles Ogilvy Limited, Freiman's, Spencer's, Simpsons, Morgan's, and Woodward's were staples in their respective communities.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo.

Write an article based on this summary: – Supporters waved \\"Tax the Rich\\" signs Monday as Seattle's city council voted unanimously to do exactly that. By a vote of 9-0, the council approved an income tax that only applies to wealthy residents, with the 2.25% tax starting at income above 250,000 for individuals and above 500,000 for married couples filing joint returns, the Seattle Times reports. The city estimates that the tax will raise around 140 million a year from Seattle's 20,000 or so wealthiest residents. Washington state doesn't have a personal income tax and a 1984 law bans cities and counties in the state from taxing net income, meaning Seattle's move is certain to face legal challenges, the AP reports. Opponents vowed to fight the measure, with Washington State Republican Party Chair Susan Hutchison urging citizens to \\"forcefully resist\\" the tax and not pay a penny. Seattle Mayor Ed Murray says he'll sign the measure into law Friday—and he will welcome legal challenges. The goal is to replace the current \\"regressive\\" tax system with a fairer one, \\"while ensuring Seattle stands up to President Trump's austere budget that cuts transportation, affordable housing, health care, and social services,\\" the mayor tells Reuters. (Illinois has ended its long budget standoff with a 32% hike in the income tax rate.)","output":"Seattle City Council Unanimously Approves Income Tax on Wealthy Residents On Monday, supporters held \\"Tax the Rich\\" signs as the Seattle city council voted 9-0 to approve an income tax targeting the city's wealthiest residents. The 2.25% tax applies to income above 250,000 for individuals and above 500,000 for married couples filing joint returns, according to the Seattle Times. The city estimates that the tax will raise approximately 140 million annually from around 20,000 of Seattle's wealthiest individuals. Washington state currently doesn't have a personal income tax, and under a 1984 law, cities and counties are banned from taxing net income. This means that the newly approved tax is likely to face legal challenges, the AP reports. However, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray has stated that he will sign the measure into law on Friday and welcomes any legal challenges that may arise. Opponents of the tax, such as Washington State Republican Party Chair Susan Hutchison, have vowed to fight the measure. Hutchison urged citizens to \\"forcefully resist\\" the tax and not pay a penny. The primary goal of the tax is to replace the current \\"regressive\\" tax system with a much fairer one, while ensuring Seattle can stand up to President Trump's austere budget, which includes cuts to transportation, affordable housing, health care, and social services, Mayor Ed Murray told Reuters. The Move Towards a Fairer Tax System The decision to approve an income tax on wealthy residents is a significant step towards creating a more just taxation system in Seattle. According to a 2018 study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), Washington state has the \\"most regressive tax system\\" in the US. This means that lower-income households are taxed at a higher rate than higher-income households. In such a regressive tax system, taxes like property taxes and sales taxes disproportionately burden low-income residents. As a result, poorer individuals often spend a higher percentage of their income on state and local taxes compared to the wealthy. The introduction of the income tax targeting Seattle's wealthiest residents aims to alleviate some of this burden from lower-income households, while also generating additional revenue for the city to fund essential public services and programs. Legal Challenges and Future Implications Despite Mayor Ed Murray's readiness to sign the measure into law and face any legal challenges, opponents remain steadfast in their fight against the new tax. The 1984 law banning cities and counties from taxing net income in Washington state will likely be the primary legal issue when Seattle's tax measure is challenged in court. If the courts uphold Seattle's income tax, it could set a precedent for other cities and counties in Washington state to impose similar taxes on high-income residents. Furthermore, it could propel state-level discussions on the possibility of implementing a personal income tax in Washington.  However, if the courts strike down the tax, it could deter other cities and counties from attempting similar measures. The outcome of any legal challenge to the Seattle income tax will have significant implications for the city's taxation system, as well as potential effects statewide. In Conclusion Seattle's bold move to impose an income tax on its wealthiest residents indicates the city's commitment to addressing the issue of regressive taxation. This decision hopes to help create a tax system that not only alleviates some of the burden from lower-income households but also funds essential public services and programs in response to the current federal government's budget cuts. While Seattle awaits the inevitable legal challenges, this unanimous approval of the income tax could be a harbinger of change for the rest of Washington state and possibly nationwide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Given the below context:  As a result of Henry's expansion, St Peter ad Vincula, a Norman chapel which had previously stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls for himself and his queen. It was rebuilt by Edward I at a cost of over £300 and again by Henry VIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19th century. Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built at the same time as the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a simple structure, protected by a portcullis and gate. The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16th century, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower. Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663 just over £4,000 was spent building a new storehouse (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor.

A numerical element means any element that is a number, regardless of its format in the list. An element could be a string representation of a number and still be considered numerical. The list is in a format where each element is separated by a comma and the entire list is placed within brackets. Here are the steps to follow in order to complete this task: Step 1: Initialize a variable count to hold the number of numerical elements within the list. It will initially be set to 0. Step 2: Iterate through every element in the list.  Step 3: For each element, determine if it's numerical. This can be done by checking if the element can be converted to an integer without causing an error. If it can, the element is numerical. In Python, you could use a try-except block for this. In the try block, attempt to convert the element to an integer. If no error is produced, it means the element is numerical, and you should increment your count by 1.  Step 4: After all elements have been checked, the count variable will contain the total number of numerical elements in the list. Return this count as the answer. So, for the given list, the answer would be the count of all the elements that are numbers, regardless if they are written as strings.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What are the full names of the drummers of Warsaw? from the following article ?  On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions: driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off.In August...

He notices the words \\"Come and See\\" painted on several trees as he lifts the lid. Detective Aidan Breslin is a widower who has become emotionally distanced from his two sons, Alex and Sean, following the death of his wife three years prior to the film's events. Due to his former dental forensics expertise, Aidan receives a call regarding the contents of the tray, where it is revealed that it contained human teeth. After analyzing the teeth, Breslin is able to match them to a man who had been reported missing. Aidan is once again called to investigate the bizarre murder of a woman named Mrs. Spitz, who was discovered hanging in her bedroom, eerily displayed and strung up on a series of hooks connected to a rig; the words \\"Come and See\\" displayed prominently on the walls. According to her autopsy report, she drowned in her own blood due to a precise stabbing. They also discover that Mrs. Spitz had been pregnant and the fetus was removed. Aidan speculates that there were four attackers and that they had used a camera to record the murder. After leaving the crime-scene, Breslin comforts one of the Spitz's three daughters, their adopted Asian daughter Kristen, reassuring her that he will do his best to solve the crime. The next murder shares the same M.O. with the Spitz murder; the similar hook contraption leads Breslin to a local tattoo parlor. There, he is informed that the owner constructed four devices in total. Yet another murder occurs, but this time no hook rig was involved and the message only appears on three of the room's walls. While Aidan reviews the evidence at his home, Sean stumbles on one of the photographs. Sean's insights point Breslin to the Bible, where he...

In this task, you need to provide the parts-of-speech tag of a word present in a sentence specified within curly braces  ( '{{ ... }}' ). The parts-of-speech tags are coarse labels that represent a category of words with similar grammatical properties. The list of part-of-speech tags i.e. tagset of this corpus is 'ADJ': Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes, 'ADP': Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions, 'ADV': Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner, 'AUX': An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality, 'CCONJ': A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic relationship between them, 'DET': Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context, 'INTJ': An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation, 'NOUN': Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea, 'NUM': A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction, 'PART': Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech, 'PRON': Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context, 'PROPN': A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object, 'PUNCT': Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text, 'SCONJ': A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause, 'SYM': A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function or both, 'VERB': A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause, 'X': The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category.

(CNN) -- The publication this week of memoirs by Leon Panetta has stirred up a sharp controversy in the press, but as so often happens these days in Washington, the focus seems to be on the sensational rather than the important. And that leads to the larger argument: whether Panetta, Bob Gates et. al. should have published these books may be controversial, but it is a sideshow compared to what's really important -- and that's what they have to say about the making and execution of American foreign policy these days. White House aides and allies of the President were naturally upset to read some of the stinging comments by the former defense secretary and CIA director about the inner workings of the Obama administration.

The faint blue shimmer underground seems to be another possible means of entering, while the user and Lough are the characters actively trying to figure out how to get in. Step 4: Consider the characters' emotions and reactions Since the user felt an immediate loss and was breathless, it's important to consider how they might react to discovering the faint blue shimmer. They are likely to be relieved and excited to have found another potential solution.

Premise: \\"a large group of people inside a building with a stage\\" 1. A large group of people: This suggests that multiple individuals are gathered in one location. 2. Inside a building: This indicates that the gathering is taking place indoors. 3. A stage: This element implies that the environment is designed or set up for some kind of performance or presentation to occur. Hypothesis: \\"An audience is watching a performer.\\" 1. An audience: This term implies that a group of individuals is present, likely referring to the \\"large group of people\\" from the premise. 2. Watching: This suggests that the group of individuals is visually focused on a particular subject or event. 3. A performer: This element introduces the concept of someone conducting a performance or presentation for the audience. Although the premise does indicate that there is a gathering of people in a building with a stage, it does not provide explicit details about what those people are doing or whether there is a performer present. The presence of a stage implies that a performance could take place, but does not guarantee that it is happening at that precise moment or that the large group is actively watching a performance. There could be alternative explanations for the large group's presence in the building with a stage. For example, they could be attending a conference, participating in a workshop, waiting for a performance to begin, or taking part in social activities unrelated to a performance. Some other possibilities could be: - The large group is attending a lecture or seminar. - The people are present for a community meeting or town hall gathering. - The stage is set up for a later performance, but no performance is currently happening. - The large group is comprised of performers themselves, rehearsing for an upcoming performance. In conclusion, the premise provides some context that an audience might be present and that a performance could potentially take place, due to the presence of a stage. However, it does not confirm the hypothesis that \\"An audience is watching a performer\\" as true, as there are numerous alternative possibilities for the large group's presence in the building with a stage. To verify the hypothesis, additional information would be required, such as specific details about the event taking place or any ongoing performances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Question: \\"What facet of evolution by natural selection was highlighted by Wallace in the work presented to the Linnean Society?\\"  Context: \\"Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"In the work presented to the Linnean Society, the facet of evolution by natural selection highlighted by Alfred Russel Wallace was the role of ecological pressures in maintaining variation and adaptation among species to local conditions. Unlike Charles Darwin, who emphasized competition between individuals and drew similarities between natural selection and artificial selection practiced by animal breeders, Wallace focused on how environmental factors impacted the survival and reproduction of different varieties within a species. While both Wallace and Darwin presented the idea of natural selection as the mechanism driving the evolution of species, their perspectives on the process differed. Wallace's emphasis on ecological pressures as the primary driving force of natural selection highlighted the importance of the relationship between organisms and their environment in shaping the adaptations and survival of different varieties. This focus on the ecological aspect of natural selection was distinct from Darwin's approach, which placed more weight on competitive interactions between individual organisms and drew parallels with selective breeding practices in domesticated species. In Wallace's viewpoint, species continuously evolve and adapt to their local environments as a result of the selective pressures placed on them. These pressures arise from various ecological factors such as availability of resources, predation, and competition between and within species. Over time, the varieties that are better adapted to these specific local conditions tend to survive and reproduce more effectively, passing on their successful traits to future generations and perpetuating those adaptations as part of their lineage. It is important to note that some historians have argued that Wallace was discussing group selection instead of selection acting on individual variation. Group selection refers to the idea that natural selection could favor the survival and reproduction of groups of organisms, rather than individuals, based on certain beneficial traits within those groups. In this interpretation, Wallace's focus on ecological pressures might be seen as a basis for a more collective evolutionary process, emphasizing the role of cooperative interactions and ecological relationships between species or populations in driving evolutionary change. In conclusion, the facet of evolution by natural selection that was highlighted by Wallace in his work presented to the Linnean Society was the significance of ecological pressures in shaping adaptations and maintaining the diversity of species in different local environments. His perspective on natural selection was distinct from Darwin's in that it concentrated on the environmental aspects driving the process, rather than the competitive relationships between individuals or the analogy to artificial selection in domestic animals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two groups of children studied about some of the planets from our Solar system and their atmospheres. Group E studied about Earth, while group V studied about the planet Venus.  Which group studied less about thick atmospheres causing a strong greenhouse effect? The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer this question, let's consider the information provided: - Group E studied Earth - Group V studied Venus Now, let's analyze and compare the atmospheres of these two planets step-by-step to determine which group studied less about thick atmospheres causing a strong greenhouse effect. Step 1: Understand the greenhouse effect The greenhouse effect is the trapping of heat in a planet's atmosphere, causing its temperature to rise. This occurs when certain gases in the atmosphere (like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor) absorb and emit heat radiation, preventing it from being released into space. Step 2: Compare Earth's atmosphere to Venus' Earth's atmosphere consists of around 77% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and a small amount of other gases, including carbon dioxide (about 0.04%). On the other hand, Venus has an atmosphere that is over 96% carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and other gases. Step 3: Analyze the greenhouse effect on Earth and Venus On Earth, the greenhouse effect is a natural and important phenomenon that helps maintain temperatures suitable for life. However, an increased greenhouse effect due to human activities has led to global warming. Venus, on the other hand, has one of the strongest greenhouse effects in our Solar System, creating surface temperatures that are hot enough to melt lead (around 900 degrees Fahrenheit or 475 degrees Celsius). This extreme greenhouse effect is due to its atmosphere being mostly composed of carbon dioxide, which is a powerful greenhouse gas. Step 4: Determine which group studied less about thick atmospheres causing a strong greenhouse effect Based on the information and comparisons made above, it is evident that Earth's atmosphere has a much weaker greenhouse effect compared to that of Venus. Therefore, the group that studied less about thick atmospheres causing a strong greenhouse effect would be: The answer to this question is: Group E (the group that studied Earth)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The visit comes amid a period of increased collaboration between both nations, focusing on trade, military cooperation, and regional stability. Step 1: Analyzing the Objectives Russia's strategic objectives in the Middle East are apparent: to solidify its role as a leading regional player and to ensure the stability of its allies. The visit to Egypt aims to achieve these goals by forging stronger ties with the Egyptian government, which is at the heart of the current Middle East power dynamics. Step 2: Addressing Economic Cooperation Trade is a vital component of any bilateral relationship. During the Russian President's visit, both countries have expressed interest in expanding their economic cooperation. By investing in Egypt's infrastructure and energy sectors, Russia can showcase its commitment to the nation's prosperity and secure a closer partnership with Cairo. Step 3: Military Collaboration Military cooperation is equally important in fostering strong relationships. The Russian President's trip to Egypt allows for enhanced military collaboration, contributing to both countries' security and regional peace. It could involve joint military exercises, arms deals, and shared intelligence, further cementing Russia as a crucial security partner to Egypt. Step 4: Regional Diplomacy Having Egypt as an influential ally can help Russia extend its reach across the Middle East. With its strategic location, Egypt is a key player in the region's geopolitics, and having a significant partnership with Cairo opens doors for Russia to engage with other regional actors. The Russian President aims to utilize Egypt's position to increase Russia's clout in the broader Middle East. Step 5: Ensuring Regional Stability A key focus during the presidency visit will be on maintaining regional stability, something that benefits both Russia and Egypt. Russia's influence in the Middle East often intertwines with its own national interests. By working together with Egypt to address pressing issues such as counterterrorism and regional conflicts, Russia can be seen as a responsible actor within the international community. Conclusion: The Russian President's visit to Egypt symbolizes a significant step in strengthening Moscow's standing in the Middle East. By addressing their mutual interests, both countries can work more closely together, fostering economic growth, military collaboration, and regional stability. This strategic partnership benefits not only Russia and Egypt but also contributes to a more stable and interconnected Middle East."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD.

On 1 March 1849, Brown was charged with the murder of \\"unknown aboriginal natives\\". In late March or early April he appeared before a local magistrate in the district, Captain G. V. Butler, who committed him for trial. In May, Butler wrote a letter to Charles Hervey Bagot, a member of the South Australian Legislative Council, in which he listed the victims as one \\"old man blind and infirm\\", three female adults, two teenage girls (aged 15 and 12 years), and three female children (aged two years, 18 months, and a baby). Butler added that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\".Brown's trial came before the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The presiding judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week to investigate. The weakness of the case was directly related to the provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could determine the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an \\"uncivilised person or persons\\" was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given \\"great suspicion rested on the case\\", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General produced a summary of the investigation to date.

However, I can certainly guide you through it step by step.   1. **Grab The Bat Correctly:** First, the most fundamental step: Grabbing the bat. If you're right-handed, your left hand should be on top, vice versa if you're left-handed. This grip allows you to swing the bat across your body conveniently which aids in making a solid contact with the ball. 2. **Position Your Feet:** Your feet should be roughly shoulder-width apart, with your front foot slightly forward. This gives you a solid base and lets you pivot your body and swing more powerfully. 3. **Prepare To Swing:** Hold the bat up with elbows slightly bent. The bat should be a comfortable extension of your arms. Have the bat upright and just a little bit to the back. Be ready to swing as the ball arrives. 4. **Swing The Bat:** As the ball approaches, begin your swing. Rotate your hips and shoulders forward as you swing the bat. This adds power to your swing. Your eyes should be fixated on the ball until the very moment you hit it. 5. **Follow Through:** After hitting the ball, continue the swing. Don't abruptly stop right after making contact. The follow-through helps you maintain good balance and directs the ball where you want it to go, based on your swing.

Out of the given options, the most accurate answer is \\"pass sentence.\\" A judge's primary responsibility in a criminal trial is to ensure that the proceedings are conducted fairly and in accordance with the law. They need to uphold the rights of both the prosecution and the defense, as well as ensure that all procedures and legalities are followed strictly. The judge's role typically includes the following: 1. Conducting the trial: The judge oversees the trial proceedings, deciding on issues of law and making rulings on evidentiary matters. They provide instructions to the jury (if present) on the applicable law and ensure that the trial progresses smoothly. 2. Enforcing courtroom decorum: The judge enforces the rules of courtroom etiquette and decorum, maintaining a respectful atmosphere in the court. 3. Reviewing legal submissions: The judge reviews the arguments and evidence submitted by both parties. They may seek clarifications, ask questions, and even call for additional information if needed. 4. Ensuring impartiality: The judge guarantees that all parties involved in the trial are treated fairly and impartially, regardless of their social, economic, or political backgrounds. 5. Providing legal guidance: The judge instructs the jury about the law and the elements of the offense the defendant is charged with. They also clarify the burden of proof and the legal standard for a conviction. When a defendant is convicted of a crime (usually, this means that either they have admitted guilt by pleading guilty or the jury has found them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt), the judge's subsequent responsibilities include: 1. Determining the appropriate sentence: The judge, after considering the facts of the case, the crime committed, and any mitigating or aggravating factors, will decide on a suitable punishment in accordance with the sentencing laws. This may include incarceration, probation, fines, community service, and other forms of punishment. 2. Pronouncing the sentence: The judge formally announces the punishment in open court, providing an explanation for their decision. They will also inform the defendant of their rights to appeal the conviction and/or sentence. 3. Ensuring due process: The judge ensures that all legal requirements are met throughout the entire process, including the sentencing phase. This is essential to protect the defendant's rights and guarantee a fair trial. 4. Facilitating rehabilitation: In many cases, judges also play a role in encouraging or facilitating the rehabilitation of the convicted individual. This could include recommending appropriate programs, services, or interventions aimed at reducing the likelihood of reoffending. In conclusion, the primary duty of a judge when a defendant is convicted of a crime is to pass the sentence in accordance with the legal system's guidelines and regulations. This not only serves justice by holding the convicted individual accountable but also ensures that the punishment is fair, proportionate, and effective in preventing crime and promoting rehabilitation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

'My name is Monica Lewinsky - though I've often been advised to change it.’ That is how the bete noire of the late 90s introduced herself to a large crowd of millennials at Forbes’ Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia Monday morning, marking the beginning of Ms Lewinsky’s first public speaking engagement in more than a dozen years. By the time Lewinsky concluded her emotional presentation on the perils of public humiliation in the digital age, the Twitter-sphere was abuzz with excitement over Lewinsky’s apparent comeback, showering her with praise for her courage. Scroll down for video. In her own words: Monica Lewinsky, 41, delivered a speech about bullying in the digital age at Forbes' Under 30 Summit. Rare appearance: This is one of Monica Lewinsky's few public speeches, she last  spoke publicly 13 years ago. Not ashamed: Lewinsky told a crowd of more than 1,000 she fell in love with President Clinton as a 24-year-old woman straight out of college. Lewinsky, 41, joined Twitter less than two hours before taking the stage at the Forbes conference, where she was invited to speak about the ‘scourge of harassment in the digital age.’ ‘Overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one. I was Patient Zero, the first person to have their reputation completely destroyed worldwide via the Internet,’ Ms Lewinsky told a rapt crowd in a room where, according to multiple eyewitness accounts shared on Twitter, one could hear a pin drop. Lewinsky, best known worldwide for her sordid affair with President Bill Clinton, did not mince words when addressing that part of her biography. ‘Sixteen years ago, fresh out of college...I fell in love with my boss,’ Lewinsky declared from the stage in Philadelphia, before launching into an impassioned speech about the price she had been forced to pay for her youthful indiscretion. Sequel: For her second tweet, Lewinsky shared her excitement about taking part in Forbes Magazine's 30 Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia. Inaugural tweet: Monica Lewinsky joined Twitter Monday, sending out the hashtag 'HereWeGo' as her first-ever message. ‘I lost my public self, or had it stolen,’ she said of her ruthless treatment at the hands of journalists and late-night comics. ‘In a way, it was a form of identity theft. ‘In 1998, \\"public Monica, that Monica, that woman\\" was born. I was publicly identified and someone I did not recognize.’ Looking back on her experiences, Lewinsky explained to the 20- and 30-somethings in the audience that while there was no social media back in the 90s, there were 'gossip, news and entertainment websites' that latched onto the Clinton scandal, relishing each detail with gusto. 'Of course, it was all done on the excruciatingly slow dial up. Yet around the world this story went,' she recalled, according to Forbes. 'A viral phenomenon that, you could argue, was the first moment of truly \\"social media.”' Fighting back tears, Ms Lewinsky talked about how her mother was devastated by the suicide of bullied Rutgers University freshman Tyler Clementi in 2010. ‘She was back in 1998...when she might've lost me,’ Lewinsky confided in the audience, referring to the year when Drudge Report broke the news of her affair with the president online. In the months that followed the bombshell revelations, an emotional Ms Lewinsky said she was constantly tormented by thoughts of suicide. Despite overwhelming odds, Lewinsky said she somehow managed to survive the bullying, relentless harassment and public humiliation, but her outlook for the future is tinged with pessimism. ‘There is a compassion crisis, an empathy deficit,’ she pointed out. ‘There's no way to wrap your head around when it will end.’ Lewinsky used her first foray into the public sphere in more than a decade to announce her plan to launch a 'cultural revolution' against cyber-bullying. The 41-year-old said she was inspired by Tyler Clementi's story to share her own tale of hardship and perseverance in a bid to prevent the next tragedy. 'Having survived myself, what I want to do now is help other victims of the shame game survive, too,' she said. 'I want to put my suffering to good use and give purpose to my past.' At the conclusion of her remarks, the audience gave Ms Lewinsky a roaring standing ovation. Guests at the summit took to Twitter, describing Lewinsky’s speech as both ‘courageous’ and 'inspiring.’ The three-day conference hosted by Forbes Magazine opened  in Philadelphia Sunday. According to the description of the event on Forbes' website, the summit brings together more than 1,000 members of Forbes '30 Under 30' list of 'business leaders and mentors'. 'Lewinsky, who last talked publicly 13 years ago, will offer a singular perspective on what happened to her, and the scourge of harassment in the digital age,' Forbes explained in a statement. Besides Ms Lewisnky, speakers at the summit will include this year's Nobel Peace Prize recipient Malala Yousafzai, musician Questlove and model-turned-philanthropist Petra Nemcova. With the hashtag #HereWeGo, Lewinsky joined the Twitter community Monday just after 9am Eastern time, drawing more than 1,400 followers in the first 40 minutes. By 10.15am, Lewinsky, 41, already had 6,000 followers, and counting. After firing off her first tweet, Lewinsky quickly got the ball rolling, writing less than an hour later: 'excited (and nervous) to speak to #Under30Summit.' Ms Lewinsky became a household name – and the butt of countless late-night jokes - after her affair with President Bill Clinton was leaked to the press in 1998, ultimately resulting in Clinton's impeachment. After living in relative obscurity for more than a decade, Lewinsky penned an explosive tell-all article for Vanity Fair in May about the Clinton scandal and its destructive aftermath, describing her relationship with the married president as 'consensual.' 'Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any ‘abuse’ came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position,' Lewinsky wrote. Claim to fame: Lewinsky, pictured left next to Bill Clinton during her time as a White House intern, became a household name after her affair with the president  was leaked to the press in 1998. 'The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor’s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power.' She has since written several opinion pieces for the publication, including a blog post about cyber-bullying published in July, in which she talked about her reaction to 'Monica' jokes on the hit Netflix series Orange is the New Black. She also recently weighed in on the ongoing controversy surrounding hacked nude photos of female celebrities, writing in a personal essay that she felt outrage at the gross violation of privacy and compassion for the likes of Kate Upton and Jennifer Lawrence. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Monica Lewinsky, in her first public speaking engagement in over a decade, took to the stage at Forbes' Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia. She spoke about her own experience with public humiliation and harassment in relation to the digital age, garnering notable praise from Twitter users. Now 41 years old, Lewinsky created a Twitter account and began talking about her infamous past involvement with President Bill Clinton - an event that marked her as 'Patient Zero' for having her reputation destroyed worldwide on the internet. She particularly focused on the negative experiences she faced due to the media's reaction and her being publicly identified. Speaking with emotion, Lewinsky revealed how she often contemplated suicide during the aftermath of the scandal. However, she now wants to focus on creating a 'cultural revolution' against cyber-bullying, citing her inspiration as the story of Tyler Clementi - a student who committed suicide due to bullying. Monica Lewinsky received a standing ovation at the end of her speech. Her Twitter following had reached 6,000 people shortly after her appearance. Monica Lewinsky, once largely retired from the public eye, announced her intention to use her past suffering to help other victims survive their own ordeals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two football players, Skip (Nicolas de Toth) and Ronny (Rawley Valverde) are amongst the partygoers for the week-long festivities. While Spring Break is occurring, a mysterious biker appears and begins to dispatch people. The back of his bike has a lever that when pulled (combined with a button pushed by the biker) causes the victim to undergo a treatment similar to the electric chair. When Ronny ends up a victim of the mysterious killer, Skip attempts to find Ronny with the help of Gail, who works as a bartender during Spring Break. The duo soon find Ronny and learn that local police chief Strycher (John Saxon) and physician Doc Willet (Michael Parks) have covered up Ronny's death in order for the partygoers not to worry. However, as the body count rises, Gail and Skip begin to wonder if Diablo made good on his promise to return from the dead or is someone else responsible.

Summarize this article: The plane had no fuel on impact, an official said, corroborating audio of the pilot asking to land because of a fuel shortage and electric failure. The capital Bogota was mentioned on the flight plan as a possible refuelling stop, but the plane did not land there. The plane plunged into a mountainside near Medellin late on Monday. Only six of the 77 people on board the plane survived. \\"Having been able to do an inspection of all of the remains and parts of the plane, we can affirm clearly that the aircraft did not have fuel at the moment of impact,\\" civil aviation chief Alfredo Bocanegra told a news conference. Freddy Bonilla, another aviation official, said regulations stipulated that aircraft must have 30 minutes of fuel in reserve to reach an alternative airport in an emergency, but \\"in this case the plane did not have\\" it. \\"The engines are the electrical source... but without fuel, obviously the electrical source would have been completely lost,\\" he added. In a leaked tape, the pilot can be heard warning of a \\"total electric failure\\" and \\"lack of fuel\\". Just before the tape ends, he says he is flying at an altitude of 9,000ft (2,745m). The plane was carrying the Brazilian football team Chapecoense, who had been due to play a cup final against Atletico Nacional in Medellin on Wednesday evening. The team flew from Sao Paulo to Santa Cruz on a commercial flight, then switched to the chartered aircraft. Brazil's O Globo reported that because of a delayed departure, a refuelling stop in Cobija - on the border between Brazil and Bolivia - was abandoned because the airport did not operate at night. The pilot had the option to refuel in Bogota, but headed straight to Medellin. \\"The pilot was the one who took the decision,\\" Gustavo Vargas, a representative of Lamia, which operated the plane, was quoted as saying in Bolivian newspaper Pagina Siete. \\"He thought the fuel would last.\\" Approaching Medellin, the pilot asked for permission to land because of fuel problems, without making a formal distress call. But another plane from airline VivaColombia had priority because it had already suffered a fuel leak, the co-pilot of another plane in the air at the time said. The pilot of the crashed plane is heard asking urgently for directions to the airport before the audio recording ends. Officials say the plane's \\"black boxes\\", which record flight details, will be sent to the UK to be opened by investigators. A full investigation into the crash is expected to take months. There are some critical questions investigators need to answer. If the plane did indeed run out of fuel, why didn't the crew fill up en route, as was reportedly planned? And why wasn't it carrying the required 30-minute fuel reserve? Or maybe it was, and there was a fuel leak somewhere. Also, why was the aircraft told to circle while another flight with a problem was given priority to land? Did the crew make it clear to the ground that they had a crisis on their hands? Looking at the radar track, it appears to circle for around 13 minutes. Yet it was only around three or four minutes flying time from the airport. Accidents normally come down to a series of problems and decisions that add up to catastrophe. There are often moments, with hindsight, where a tragedy could have been averted. We still don't have an official explanation yet. So, there may be facts or problems yet to come out that put a totally different complexion on what happened. On Wednesday night, when the match had been due to take place, tens of thousands of fans gathered at the Medellin stadium - and at Chapecoense's home ground in Chapeco - to pay tearful tributes. Many wore white and carried candles as a mark of respect. Chapecoense lost 19 players in the crash. Twenty journalists were also killed. Of the survivors, Chapecoense said that two players remained in a critical but stable condition, while the club's goalkeeper had had one leg amputated and might still lose his other foot. An injured journalist also remained in critical condition, the club said.","output":"A chartered plane that crashed in Colombia killing 71 people, including members of Brazilian football team Chapecoense, had no fuel on impact, according to a Colombian official.

VW's labor chief says big US fines will hit workers' jobs WOLFSBURG, Germany, March 8 (Reuters) - Volkswagen may have to cut jobs in the United States as well as Europe and other countries depending on how big a fine has to be paid for its manipulation of diesel emissions tests, the carmaker's top labor official told a meeting of 20,000 workers at its German headquarters on Tuesday. The U.S. Justice Department has sued Volkswagen (VW) for up to 46 billion for breaching U.S. environmental laws, while there is still no fix for nearly 600,000 cars affected in the United States almost six months after the scandal broke. SEE ALSO: 10 most important tax deadlines in 2016 The extent to which VW may be forced to cut jobs to help meet the costs of 'Dieselgate' depends \\"decisively\\" on the level of fines, VW's works councils chairman Bernd Osterloh said on Tuesday at the meeting of workers in Wolfsburg which was also attended by the carmaker's top managers. \\"Should the future viability of Volkswagen be endangered by an unprecedented financial penalty, this will have dramatic social consequences,\\" said Osterloh, who also sits on VW's 20-member supervisory board.

Europe's largest automaker employs over 600,000 people at around 120 factories worldwide, including 270,000 in Germany. Its U.S. plant in Chattanooga, Tennnessee employs about 2,200 people. Speaking at the Wolfsburg meeting Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said the scandal would inflict \\"substantial and painful\\" financial damage on the carmaker, without elaborating. Volkswagen last year set aside 6.7 billion euros (7.39 billion) to cover the expected costs of recalling of about 11 million diesel vehicles globally. It has postponed the release of its 2015 results by more than a month until April 28 to better assess the financial implications of the crisis. \\"The software manipulations and its consequences will keep us busy for a long time,\\" Mueller said on Tuesday, adding that it would take years to determine the full extent of the financial impact of the scandal. The state of Lower Saxony, VW's second-largest shareholder, expects more \\"unpleasant news\\" to emerge over the months ahead but remains confident that the company has the financial strength to cope. \\"We will this year probably every now and then be confronted with unpleasant news related to 'Dieselgate',\\" Stephan Weil, prime minister of Lower Saxony, told the Wolfsburg meeting. \\"The damage will, on balance, not be minor, that much can already be said today, but Volkswagen luckily has a strong economic base,\\" Weil, also a member of the supervisory board, said. The Western German state, which holds 20 percent of VW's common shares, has \\"no reason\\" to alter its commitment to the carmaker despite the crisis, said Weil, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners. MORE SUSPECTS IN GERMAN INVESTIGATION Separately, German prosecutors said on Tuesday they have widened their investigation into Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal and are now targeting 11 more employees. Klaus Ziehe from the state prosecutor's office in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, which is leading the German case against VW, said 17 people were now being investigated, up from six previously. \\"The number of suspects has risen, although none are from the management board,\\" Ziehe said.

He was checking the radiators of his car and truck. He put antifreeze into the car radiator, but didn't put any antifreeze into the truck radiator. He was wondering how the vehicles would fare in coming hot weather.  But I can use this background: Antifreeze could also be called “antiboil” because it also raises the boiling point of the water in a car radiator. Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water. If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher. For example a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129 °C. Unless the water gets hotter than this, it won’t boil and ruin the engine.  What is an answer for this question: Which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and hot engine, car or truck? A:","output":"Based on the given background information, the truck would likely fare worse in hot weather and under hot engine conditions compared to the car. This is because the car radiator has antifreeze added to it, while the truck radiator does not have any antifreeze. Antifreeze, as mentioned, functions not only to prevent freezing of the coolant but also to increase the boiling point of the water in a car radiator. Since the car has a 50% antifreeze solution, its coolant boiling point would be raised to 129 °C. This means that unless the water gets hotter than 129 °C, it will not boil, and the car engine will not face the risk of overheating and becoming seriously damaged. The higher boiling point provided by the antifreeze solution effectively protects the car's engine from overheating during hot weather conditions. On the other hand, the truck does not have antifreeze added to its radiator. As a result, the boiling point of the water in the truck radiator remains at 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water. Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the truck's radiator above 100 °C. The lack of antifreeze in the truck's radiator increases the risk of water boiling, which can lead to engine overheating and potential damage to the engine.  In conclusion, the truck is more likely to suffer from performance issues and engine damage in hot weather and hot engine conditions due to the lack of antifreeze in its radiator. The car, with its antifreeze solution, has a higher boiling point for its coolant, and is better protected from the risks of overheating during hot weather."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To find the most recognized IQ test out there Step 1: Research the various types of IQ tests. Reason: There are several IQ tests available, and determining the most recognized one requires finding out which test is most widely utilized and respected. Step 2: Compare and investigate the popularity of each test. Reason: The most recognized IQ test should be the one most commonly referred to and used by experts, educators, and psychologists. Conclusion: The most recognized IQ test is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). This test is widely used worldwide and is considered the gold standard in measuring intelligence in adults. 2.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Stereolab were an English-French avant-pop band from London, formed in 1990 by Tim Gane (guitar/keyboards) and Laetitia Sadier (vocals/keyboards/guitar) who both remained at the songwriting helm across many line-up changes. Other long-time members included Mary Hansen (backing vocals/keyboards/guitar), who joined in 1992 and remained in the line-up until her accidental death in 2002, and Andy Ramsay (drums), who joined in 1993 and is still in the official line-up. Sean O'Hagan of the High Llamas was a member from 1993 to 1994, and continued appearing on later records for occasional guest appearances. The group's music combined influences from krautrock, lounge and 1960s pop music. Stereolab's music combines a droning rock sound with lounge instrumentals, overlaid with sing-song female vocals and pop melodies. It has been generally described as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock experimental rock, and experimental pop. Their records are heavily influenced by the \\"motorik\\" technique of 1970s krautrock groups such as Neu! and Faust. Tim Gane has supported the comparison: \\"Neu! did minimalism and drones, but in a very pop way.\\" Funk, jazz, and Brazilian music were additional inspirations, and the sounds influenced by minimalist composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich can be found on the 1999 album Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night. Regarding their later work such as Instant 0 in the Universe (2003) and Margerine Eclipse (2004), critics have compared the releases to their earlier guitar-driven style. Stereolab's style also incorporates easy-listening music of the 1950s and '60s. Joshua Klein in The Washington Post said that, \\"Years before everyone else caught on, Stereolab was referencing the 1970s German bands Can and Neu!, the Mexican lounge music master Esquivel and the decidedly unhip Burt Bacharach.\\"  Stereolab make use of vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands such as Farfisa and Vox and Moog. Gane has praised the instruments for their versatility: \\"We use the older effects because they're more direct, more extreme, and they're more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things.\\" The 1994 album Mars Audiac Quintet prominently feature Moog synthesizers.  Laetitia Sadier's English and French vocals was a part of Stereolab's music since the beginning; and would occasionally sing wordlessly along with the music. In reference to her laid-back delivery, Peter Shapiro wrote facetiously in The Wire that she \\"display[ed] all the emotional histrionics of Nico\\". Sadier would often trade vocals with Mary Hansen back-and-forth in a sing-song manner that has been described as \\"eerie\\" and \\"hypnotic\\". After Hansen's death in 2002, critic Jim Harrington commented that her absence is noticeable on live performances of Stereolab's older tracks, and that their newer songs could have benefited from Hansen's backing vocals.  In interviews, Gane and Sadier have discussed their musical philosophy. Gane said that \\"to be unique was more important than to be good.\\" On the subject of being too obscure, he said in a 1996 interview that \\"maybe the area where we're on dodgy ground, is this idea that you need great knowledge [of] esoteric music to understand what we're doing.\\" Sadier responded to Gane, saying that she \\"think[s] we have achieved a music that will make sense to a lot of people whether they know about Steve Reich or not.\\" The duo were up-front about their desire to grow their sound: for Gane, \\"otherwise it just sounds like what other people are doing\\", and for Sadier, \\"you trust that there is more and that it can be done more interesting.\\" How has Stereolab's style been described?","output":"Stereolab's style has been described as a blend of various genres and influences, making their music unique and diverse. It has been generally labeled as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock experimental rock, and experimental pop. Their sound is a combination of droning rock, lounge instrumentals, sing-song female vocals, and catchy pop melodies. Some of their key influences include the \\"motorik\\" technique of 1970s krautrock groups such as Neu! and Faust, as well as funk, jazz, and Brazilian music. Stereolab also incorporates elements of easy-listening music from the 1950s and '60s, and minimalist compositions by Philip Glass and Steve Reich.

Laetitia Sadier's English and French vocals have been a staple of Stereolab's music since the beginning, often singing wordlessly alongside the music or trading vocals with Mary Hansen in an eerie and hypnotic manner. As for Stereolab's musical philosophy, Gane and Sadier value uniqueness over simply being good and believe their music should make sense to listeners regardless of their knowledge of esoteric influences.

Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. What is most probably the case regarding why Trump did not make payment to the adult star directly? - the payment was made without his knowledge - not enough information - he wanted this payment to remain private - his lawyer insisted on handling all transfers of funds on behalf of his clients","output":"It is most probable that Trump wanted the payment to the adult star to remain private, which is why he did not make the payment directly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is essential to provide a comfortable space for your dog by placing a blanket, dog bed, or piece of carpet inside the house. If you choose to add carpet, cut it to a size one inch smaller than the floor panel and secure it using wood glue for a permanent attachment or duct tape for an easily removable option. Personalize the dog house further by hanging a name plate with your dog's name on it above the entrance. This can be made from various materials, such as metal or wood, or by repurposing spare dog tags. Be cautious not to let the nail protrude into the interior of the house. For added functionality, attach small hooks to the dog house's exterior, providing a convenient place to store your pet's leash or toys. With these suggested steps, not only will you create a comfortable and safe haven for your dog, but also a personalized and visually appealing space that reflects your dog's personality and your shared bond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: There is no hiding from the impact agenda. The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

Available options: [1]. 0; [2]. 1; [3]. 2; [4]. 3; [5]. 4; [6]. 5;","output":"To rate textual similarity between two sentences, it is necessary to consider the level of meaning that they share, as well as the details and aspects of the sentences that are common between them. In this case, the sentences are as follows: 1. The man is driving a white car. 2. A man is giving an interview. Let us first break down the sentences and compare their components: - Both sentences have a man as the main subject. This creates a minimal level of similarity based on the subject, even though the context of the man's actions may differ. - The first sentence's primary focus is on the man driving a white car, which indicates that the sentence revolves around the action of driving and the specific detail of the car's color. - The second sentence, on the other hand, is focused on the man giving an interview. This implies that the topic of conversation or the event taking place has a different focus than the first sentence. Considering these components, it appears that the similarities mainly arise from the presence of a man as the main subject in both sentences. However, the context and specific actions of each sentence differ significantly, with one focused on driving a car and the other centered around an interview. Given this assessment, it would be appropriate to rate the textual similarity of these two sentences as a 1 on the scale from 0 to 5. The rating of 1 signifies that there is some minimal meaning overlap due to the common subject (the man), but that the overall meaning and context of the sentences do not share significant similarities."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Write an article based on this summary: Paul Merton has clocked up more appearances on Just a Minute than veteran player Kenneth Williams. Article:","output":"Title: \\"Paul Merton Surpasses Kenneth Williams in Number of 'Just a Minute' Appearances\\" Article: Paul Merton has decisively etched his name into the history of BBC Radio 4’s beloved radio and television show, 'Just a Minute', as he has now outdone the remarkable veteran player Kenneth Williams in total appearances. This is noteworthy because 'Just a Minute' is a show well-known to value and celebrate longevity and cumulative achievements. To kick off a detailed dive into this event, it is essential to introduce both key players. Paul Merton, a cherished comedian and actor, enjoys immense popularity among 'Just a Minute' fans. Known for his wit and comic timing, he has regularly made audiences burst into laughter with his hilarious impromptu speeches, often led by outlandish trains of thought. On the other side, we have the legendary Kenneth Williams. A prolific actor and comedian in his own right, Williams was an essential part of 'Just a Minute'. His unique style, flamboyantly pitched voice, and quick retorts were a sell-out factor for the show through many of its formative years. His remarkable record in the show has been unparalleled until now. To quantify the scale of Merton's achievement, we need to understand the show's format. 'Just a Minute' is challenging – the participants have to talk for a full minute on a randomly assigned topic, without repetition, hesitation or deviation. To excel on this show, a unique blend of quick-thinking skills, general knowledge, comic talent and eloquence is required. Both Merton and Williams have these qualities in abundance, as demonstrated by their longevity on the series. It's apparent now, though, that Merton has taken a step ahead. The badge of distinction, symbolising the ultimate commitment and dedication to the show, has now passed hands from Williams to Merton. This development is not just a triumph of one player over another; instead, it marks a significant milestone in the rich history of 'Just a Minute'.  This accomplishment of Merton underlines not only his talent but also his commitment to the show he has been a part of for decades. While this impressive achievement surely brings him personal satisfaction, it also gives the fans of 'Just a Minute' a new milestone to celebrate and reflect upon in the show's long-standing tradition. However, as thrilling as this contest was, it's essential to take a moment to appreciate both performers. Williams set the benchmark with his performances, while Merton made matching, and now surpassing that benchmark, his mission.  In conclusion, Paul Merton's surpassing of Kenneth Williams' record for appearances on 'Just a Minute' is a remarkable achievement that re-asserts his standing as a significant contributor to the enduring success of the show. But more than anything, this milestone serves as a testament to Merton's skill, dedication and love for the game. The legacy continues, with many more minutes filled with renowned guests, riveting tales and timeless humor to be experienced. The progression of this step-by-step analysis first involved setting the context, then introducing the key players. This was followed by highlighting the show's challenge and explaining why the new record is substantial. Drawing attention to Merton's achievement while capitulating Williams' contributions was crucial. Lastly, the analysis concluded by forthrightly focusing on the importance of this milestone in the show's history and Merton's career."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The second stage was in Plymouth , the first time the Tour de France visited England . The second stage was in Plymouth , the first time that the Tour de France visited England . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, both of these sentences do indeed mean the same thing. They share an identical meaning, conveying that the second stage of the Tour de France was held in Plymouth and it was the first instance of the event visiting England. However, there are slight distinctions in sentence structure and emphasis which could potentially infer nuanced differences, depending on how the receiver interprets it. Let's break each sentence down: In the first sentence, \\"The second stage was in Plymouth, the first time the Tour de France visited England\\", the information is presented sequentially. It starts with the fact that the second stage of the race was in Plymouth, followed by additional information that it was the first time the Tour de France visited England. The emphasis is primarily on the location of the second stage (Plymouth), with the detail about it being the first time the Tour de France visited England serving as an additional piece of context. On the other hand, in the second sentence, \\"The second stage was in Plymouth, the first time that the Tour de France visited England\\", the addition of \\"that\\" forms a conjunction which links the previous statement to the next. The conjunctive \\"that\\" could be seen as more explicitly making the point that the Tour was in England for the first time. Arguably, the emphasis or focus of this sentence is slightly more on the significance of the tour's first visit to England. However, in reality, most readers would interpret these sentences as having the same overall meaning. The slight change in sentence structure doesn't substantially alter the conveyed information or significance of the components. So, in essence, they both communicate the historic first visit of the Tour de France to England during its second stage in Plymouth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In its most damning assessment, the report concluded that the country had \\"not been well served\\" by either agency and listed numerous recommendations for changes within the FBI. While the FBI has acceded to most of the recommendations, including oversight by the new Director of National Intelligence, some former members of the 9/11 Commission publicly criticized the FBI in October 2005, claiming it was resisting any meaningful changes. What is the answer to this question: Did many believe the FBI was resisting important changes?","output":"Yes, many people, including some former members of the 9/11 Commission, believed that the FBI was resisting important changes. The 9/11 Commission's final report, released on July 22, 2004, found that both the FBI and CIA had failed to effectively pursue intelligence reports that could have prevented the September 11, 2001 attacks. As part of its findings, the report provided numerous recommendations for changes within the FBI to address the shortcomings identified. While the FBI did accept and implement many of the proposed recommendations, such as the establishment of the new Director of National Intelligence to oversee intelligence efforts, some former members of the 9/11 Commission continued to criticize the Bureau in public forums. In October 2005, these critics claimed that the FBI was still resisting meaningful changes that would improve its ability to prevent future terrorist attacks. This resistance was perceived, among other reasons, due to concerns that certain bureaucratic and structural changes could interfere with the organization's traditional law enforcement role and compromise its effectiveness in responding to traditional crimes. Additionally, the FBI's culture and resistance to change were seen as contributing factors to reluctance in implementing necessary reforms. In summary, despite the FBI's implementation of certain recommendations put forth by the 9/11 Commission, the perception was widespread among critics, including some former members of the 9/11 Commission, that the FBI was not fully embracing important changes aimed at improving its capabilities to prevent future terrorist attacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A random sequence of events, symbols or steps has no order and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are by definition unpredictable, but in many cases the frequency of different outcomes over a large number of events (or \\"trials\\") is predictable. For example, when throwing two dice, the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will occur twice as often as 4. In this view, randomness is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome, rather than haphazardness, and applies to concepts of chance, probability, and information entropy.  - Nassim Nicholas Taleb (alternatively \\"Nessim \\"or\\" Nissim,\\" born 1960) is a Lebanese-American essayist, scholar, statistician, former trader, and risk analyst, whose work focuses on problems of randomness, probability, and uncertainty. His 2007 book \\"The Black Swan\\" was described in a review by the \\"Sunday Times\\" as one of the twelve most influential books since World War II.  - Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1 (where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty). The higher the probability of an event, the more certain that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is unbiased, the two outcomes (\\"head\\" and \\"tail\\") are both equally probable; the probability of \\"head\\" equals the probability of \\"tail\\". Since no other outcomes are possible, the probability is 1/2 (or 50%), of either \\"head\\" or \\"tail\\". In other words, the probability of \\"head\\" is 1 out of 2 outcomes and the probability of \\"tail\\" is also 1 out of 2 outcomes, expressed as 0.5 when converted to decimal, with the above-mentioned quantification system. This type of probability is also called a priori probability.  - Fooled by Randomness : The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets is a book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb that deals with the fallibility of human knowledge .  - A statistician is someone who works with theoretical or applied statistics. The profession exists in both the private and public sectors. It is common to combine statistical knowledge with expertise in other subjects, and statisticians may work as employees or as statistical consultants.

'Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets' is a book written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. In this context, genre refers to a category of artistic composition characterized by similarities in form, style, or subject matter. Here, the genre of 'Fooled by Randomness' refers to the fact that it is a written work and is thus a book. Other categories such as essayist, information, randomness, statistics, war, will don't quite fit into the concept of genre in relation to 'Fooled by Randomness'.

Please briefly summarize this news article: A Pre-Thanksgiving Ritual: Cocktails, Catch-Ups and Maybe a Kiss There was a short line outside the Stumble Inn on 76th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan on Wednesday night. Women decked out in what seemed to be matching puffy coats huddled together under the bar’s overhang. Men wore Uniqlo flannel. There was an excited energy in the air, but it was not holiday spirit. It was the hope, perhaps, that before the clock would strike 4 a.m. and the Prince Charmings and Cinderellas would have to retreat home in cabs for turkey and pumpkin pie, they might ring in the holiday season with a night of debauchery and unapologetic fun. And by the way, if you thought that the first snowstorm of the year would keep young 20-somethings away from the bars on what is infamously referred to as the most insane party night of the year, you thought wrong. So wrong. Inside, Justin Timberlake’s “Sexy Back” played loudly, and Shamar, the doorman, inspected IDs (but gave only his first name for privacy reasons). He has been working this job for three years, so he believes he is pretty good at judging the scene. The night before Thanksgiving usually turns out a similar size crowd as a regular Friday or Saturday, he said, but the energy is better. “Everyone just wants to be merry tonight,” he said of the crowd. Merry they were. Packets of friends monopolized dark brown leather booths, a group of eight guys threw back shots of tequila by the beer pong table, two girlfriends shrieked and embraced upon seeing each other for the first time in months. Tabs were opened and kept open. ’Twas the night before Thanksgiving. Once again, it was a big bar night around the country for the post-collegiate and barely legal set — traveling to their hometowns for the holiday. For some, it was about finding an hourslong romance in a crowded bar of strangers. For others, the lure was striding into that one place that used to deny them entry when they were underage and seeing everyone they grew up with and having, finally, a compelling answer to the questions of “What are you up to these days?” For all, it was about the possibility of a tipsy, consequence-free kiss. By Thursday, these same revelers would be kicking back with relatives, avoiding conversations about politics and religion, wondering if crazy Aunt Judy would again ask when they were going to finally settle down. (She’s not going to be around forever, you know, and she would like to see at least one of her nieces or nephews get married.) There would be food, family and football. But first would come flirting. Sitting at a corner of the mahogany bar were Wendy Dallis and Richie O’Mahoney. If you had only a minute to study them, you would think they were in a long-term relationship. Mr. O’Mahoney’s hand rested on Ms. Dallis’s leg. Now and again, she leaned in close to make a joke, then tilted her head back in wild laughter. They seemed blissfully unaware of any others. Turns out, they had only met two nights earlier. Ms. Dallis, a singer in the band Ferrari Truck, told the story of girl-meets-boy. Or in this case, bartender: Mr. O’Mahoney, 33, works at the Gael Pub, which is about 10 blocks from the Stumble Inn. She had wandered there last Monday night after having had a few drinks while singing downtown at the Mercury Lounge. “I told him I was hungry, and he gave me olives, and I told him he had to make sure I got home that night,” she said. “He texted me the next morning asking if I wanted to hang out.” Ms. Dallis told Mr. O’Mahoney she would meet him at the Stumble Inn on Wednesday night. From that perch, they discussed meeting up on Thanksgiving, too. As they focused on their new connection, a dozen or so fraternity brothers waxed about their old days at the University of Pennsylvania. Meeting up for Thanksgiving Eve drinks is their annual tradition, said Lionel Anderson, 32, of Philadelphia. He and a group of his Alpha Phi Alpha friends have dinner at Dallas BBQ on 73rd Street and Third Avenue, and walk a few blocks up to the Stumble Inn. Mr. Anderson, now the assistant director of academic research at Haverford College, said he is the only one of the brothers who doesn’t live in New York City. But this pre-Thanksgiving event is a priority for him: “I haven’t missed a Thanksgiving Eve night out since 2001.” He reminisced about the years when they were younger and a little more carefree, he said, adding that those nights were crazier. Now, he said, “it’s about catching up with old friends over a drink or two, and getting nostalgic for our college days.” By now, R. Kelly’s “Ignition (Remix)” had begun to play. The song is an anthem of sorts for anyone who was in high school or college in the early aughts (which, on Wednesday night was most everyone). One young woman stood on her chair and started dancing and singing along, every lyric memorized. The crowd whooped in delight. A bit farther south on Second Avenue, a different crowd congregated at Turtle Bay, a renowned party bar not far from the Queensboro Bridge, it’s a favorite spot for those traveling from Long Island and New Jersey in search of a night of big-city fun. The scene at Turtle Bay was younger and a little rowdier. A steady rain and snow mix fell as a line zigged outside the door. Sean Paul’s 2005 hit “Get Busy” could be heard thumping from inside. The cover charge was 5 for women and 10 for men. The doorman granted entry at his leisure. A soggy pile of umbrellas accumulated on the ground inside. Hanging out by the bar, trying to catch the attention of the blond bartender were two buddies — Charles Gehnrich, a senior at SUNY Geneseo, and Steven Davies, a senior at Towson University in Maryland. The two 21-year-olds, childhood friends originally from Syosset, N.Y., were home for the holiday and ventured into the city for their first official “legal night out” on Thanksgiving Eve. They had chosen Turtle Bay because a friend of theirs had won a free happy hour for a small group. “I’m a broke college student!” Mr. Davies said, never diverting his eyes from one of the seven TV screens showing the Knicks game. “I’m just trying to get drunk, that’s it.” Then he looked away from the game, for just a moment. “But there should be more girls here,” he said. Indeed, Turtle Bay was heavy on the cheap drinks, including neon-colored tubes of alcohol being sold for 5 by an aggressive saleswoman who ported them about, cigarette-girl style. But the guy-to-gal ratio did not favor gentlemen looking to hook up with women. And the women who were there, weren’t digging the vibe. “This is so not my scene,” Trisha Barry, 24, yelled over the music. Her friend Kelsey Demsky, who would turn 24 at midnight, nodded her head in annoyed agreement. The women said they had been invited to the bar by a colleague at T. J. Maxx, who had told them he wanted to ring in Ms. Demsky’s birthday “the right way,” Ms. Demsky said, “whatever that means.” What they really wanted to do was head home to Brooklyn to prep for their Thanksgiving, which they would be spending Thursday afternoon together in their apartment in Bensonhurst. They did not want to drink too much. “We have to cook tomorrow,” Ms. Barry said. Back uptown at the Stumble Inn, Mr. O’Mahoney and Ms. Dallis grabbed their coats and prepared to leave together into the rainy night. It was a successful second date, they both said, and then Ms. Dallis hinted it might not yet be over. “We already kissed,” she said, grabbing his hand. “And I’m still here.” A version of this article appears in print on November 30, 2014, on page ST1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Night for Hookups.

After the death of her mother, Carrie McLaughlin has been living with her grandmother in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. When her grandmother needs to go to a nursing home, Carrie has to move in with her father Hank, a rancher in Wyoming, whom she hasn't seen since she was a baby. Initially reluctant to adapt to country living, Carrie soon meets Flicka, a beautiful black Mustang that previously had belonged to Carrie's cousin Katy, who asked Hank to look after Flicka when her father sold their own ranch. Flicka is wild and dangerous and, according to the ranchers, longs for Katy. However, when Carrie is attacked by a rattlesnake, Flicka saves her and the two form a bond. Carrie also meets Jake, an attractive ranch hand hoping to become a country singer, and Amy Walker, the proud and arrogant daughter of a neighbour. Although Jake and Carrie take an immediate liking to each other, there is instant animosity between Carrie and Amy, mainly because Amy also likes Jake. When Carrie disobeys her father's rules regarding visits to the nearest town, Hank decides to punish Carrie by temporarily relocating Flicka to the farm of one of his ranch hands, Toby. After a midnight visit by Carrie, Flicka tries to follow Carrie home to Hank's ranch, but accidentally ends up on the ranch belonging to Amy's father HD Walker. Upon entering the Walker ranch, Flicka damages a fence and releases some of HD's prize cows. At Amy's request, HD asks for Flicka as payment for the damage, threatening to turn it into a lawsuit if Hank refuses. Amy then starts training with Flicka for a championship, but performs poorly during the actual competition because of Flicka's fear of the crowd and camera flashes from the audience. HD and Amy decide to have Flicka slaughtered the next day, but Carrie frees the horse during the night and sets her free to join a nearby herd of Mustangs.

In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Abattoirs providing the majority of British supermarkets with fresh pork use a stunning method that campaigners claim causes the animals 'severe distress' before they are slaughtered. MailOnline has learned LIDL, the Co-operative and Waitrose source all of their pig meat from plants using carbon dioxide to knock out the animals. Sainsbury's said the 'majority' of their pork is sourced from CO2 plants and ASDA's suppliers use the gas too. Tesco now wants every one of its plants to adopt the same method by 2018. It did not disclose the proportion which already do. Researchers and welfare groups say it is 'aversive' to the animals who can suffer for 'up to 30 seconds' before losing consciousness. Morrisons slaughters '100 per cent' of its fresh pork in its own abattoirs and uses electric stunning, which has drawn its own condemnation. During the CO2 stunning process Tesco wants implemented, groups of pigs are mechanically herded into cages which are then lowered into pits with high carbon dioxide concentration. Scroll down for video. Panic: CO2 stunning has been deemed humane because the pigs are moved in groups before they are stunned, but they can suffer for 'up to 30 seconds' when they are in the high concentration pits. Stunned: Tesco has called on every one of its fresh pork suppliers to stun their pigs (pictured in a CO2 stunning plant in North-west Europe) with carbon dioxide by December 31, 2017. Suffocating: CO2 is aversive to the pigs' breathing and can cause them 'severe distress', campaigners say. The procedure before stunning is considered humane because pigs naturally move around in groups without human interaction. But they can get stuck the wrong way in the machinery that shepherds them - and become frightened. When they are lowered into high concentrations of carbon dioxide, which is aversive to their breathing, they panic and kick out for 'a period of up to 30 seconds' before losing consciousness. In emails revealed to MailOnline, Tesco says it wants the plants to use a machine called the Butina backloader or an equivalent stunning system by December 31, 2017. Footage obtained from a plant in North-west Europe - using that very machine - shows the animals climbing over each other and gasping for breath as they enter the CO2 pits. The gas 'induces respiratory distress, causing hyperventilation and a sense of breathlessness,' researchers say. As one cage is brought to the surface, another is lowered into the pit and the cycle continues. Animal welfare group Eyes on Animals, who filmed inside the plant, says the pigs are 'out of sight out of mind until they come back up and their bodies are no longer reacting'. Robert Hubrecht, Chief Executive of the Humane Slaughter Association told MailOnline: 'As with many gas killing systems, carbon dioxide partly acts by displacing oxygen so the brain cannot function and brain death ensues. 'Carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid with a low pH when it meets moisture and probably because of this, inhalation of carbon dioxide at high concentrations causes irritation of the nasal mucosal membranes and lungs.' He added that all available commercial methods for the stunning and slaughter of pigs have their disadvantages, and the use of CO2 is 'often the most reliable' for large operations. 'Looking to the future, further research into inert gas mixtures and other controlled atmosphere systems might well lead to welfare benefits,' he said. Their director Lesley Moffat told MailOnline: 'I think Tesco rushed into making a really, really big decision that has an impact on animal welfare for years to come and on slaughterhouses. 'They made the wrong decision because they're expecting slaughterhouses that don't yet have the CO2 system to install it when maybe five to ten years down the road, it could be banned. 'It means a lot of animals will be slaughtered in a way that isn't ideal.' A survey carried out by the Food Standard Agency in 2013 found that a similar number of pigs were stunned using electricity and carbon dioxide - but the gas method was far more efficient. Of the 167,325 pigs it recorded slaughtered one week, 80,768 were stunned electrically at 116 plants. Whereas 86,456 were stunned using 'high concentration' CO2 at just seven abattoirs. Electric stunning knocks the pigs out instantly, but the herding leading up to it causes them more stress than during gas stunning because they move in single file and they can see the animal in front being stunned. Donald Broom, Professor of Animal Welfare at Cambridge University, said: 'The handling systems associated with gas stunning are generally better for pig welfare than those when electrical stunning is used.' But he added: 'When carbon dioxide stunning is used, the welfare of the pigs is poor until they lose consciousness, usually about 30 seconds. They gasp, throw their heads around and squeal.' Herded: Tesco wants its pig meat suppliers to adopt the Butina back loader (pictured) or equivalent, which mechanically herds the pigs into cages - which are then lowered into CO2 pits. Carousel: One group of pigs is lowered into an area of high-concentration CO2 as another is brought back up. The slaughter method has been previously criticised by the Farm Animal Welfare Committee (FAWC), which advises the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). One of their previous reports called for the practice to be 'phased out' out by 2008 after concluding: 'the use of high concentrations of carbon dioxide to stun and kill pigs is not acceptable.' It added: 'FAWC supports further research into and development of alternatives to CO2, such as mixtures including argon or nitrogen, which are less aversive.' Experiments using gases like as argon mixed with lower concentrations of carbondixodie have shown it is non-aversive to pigs, who lose consciousness without showing signs of stress. According to Butina, the CO2 back loader system is for slaughterhouses who want to implement the latest technology and focus on animal welfare and meat quality. Its components are thouroughly tested to prevent the pigs from becoming stressed. The concept for the product is based on the pigs being driven forward to the stunning system in groups in groups using a 'mechanical driveway'. The pigs are divided into smaller groups and driven into the stunning boxes which are lowered into a CO2 atmosphere using a 'paternoster' or continuous lift system. After stunning, the pigs are tipped out of the boxes for shackling and 'sitcking'. The back loader can manage four to eight pigs per stunning box and between 125 and 900 pigs every hour. But using argon is less profitable because the gas is more expensive, it can lower the quality of meat and it takes longer for the pigs to lose consciousness - so fewer pigs can be stunned every hour. According to Professor Broom: 'The small extra cost and the extra minute during the process are easily outweighed by the better image of both the pig industry and Tesco if the best method is used.' That message was echoed by Compassion in World Farming who is 'utterly opposed to the use of high levels of carbon dioxide stunning or killing pigs'. It was one of seven welfare groups who wrote to the European Commission in January urging them to phase out CO2 and discuss alternative methods that will not cause the animals pain and distress. A Tesco spokesperson said: 'We are committed to high animal welfare standards. All of our pork suppliers must be fully compliant with nationally recognised welfare assurance schemes as well as meeting additional Tesco requirements. 'We are guided by the advice of independent bodies such as the Farm Animal Welfare Council and available scientific evidence demonstrates that CO2 stunning, combined with moving pigs in groups together, reduces stress and injury. 'We will continue to work with our pork suppliers and acknowledged veterinary experts, to explore and invest in methods that can further improve animal welfare.' A Co-operative Food spokesperson said: 'Animal welfare is a priority for us and we only source fresh meat and meat product from UK abattoirs which adhere to our strict sourcing requirements and high standards.' Welfare concern: Donald Broom, Professor of Animal Welfare at Cambridge University, said: 'When carbon dioxide stunning is used, the welfare of the pigs is poor until they lose consciousness' 'Gondola system': Pigs are only slaughtered once they are completely unconscious and their pain reflexes have been tested. Waitrose stated: 'Animal welfare is a top priority for us. ​Our process has been described by Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) as ensuring stress is minimised. We are confident our welfare standards are among the highest in the UK.' ASDA said: 'Our suppliers do use carbon dioxide stunning in common with many others around the world.' And Lidl confirmed their fresh pork suppliers 'use abattoirs that adhere to the CO2 gassing method to stun their pigs prior to slaughter'. 'This method, which is approved according to both Freedom Food and Red Tractor animal welfare standards, is widely used in the UK and rest of Europe and commonly considered to be a more humane form of stunning than others,' its spokesperson said. Morrisons, who use electric stunning only, said it is 'the quickest and most effective way to minimise suffering and uphold the high level of animal welfare we operate in our abattoirs'.

Animal welfare groups and researchers argue that CO2 stunning is aversive, potentially causing pig distress for up to 30 seconds before unconsciousness. 4. While electric stunning is instantaneous, the process generates more stress for pigs due to single-file herding and witnessing the stunning of other pigs. 5.

It was recorded and made famous by American country music artist David Frizzell. Released in 1982, the song was the lead single from the album \\"The Family's Fine, But This One's All Mine.\\" It became a major hit on the country charts, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in July of that year. The song also crossed over to the pop charts, peaking at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song tells the story of a husband who is tired of his wife's incessant redecorating and overspending on their home. In response, he jokingly tells her that he will hire a wino (a person who drinks excessive amounts of alcohol, especially cheap wine) to come and decorate their home. The idea is that the wino would create such a chaotic and unappealing environment that it would deter the wife from wanting to spend more money on unnecessary home improvements. \\"I'm Gonna Hire a Wino to Decorate Our Home\\" was both a commercial and critical success for David Frizzell. The song's humorous lyrics and catchy tune resonated with audiences, helping it become one of his signature songs.

Answer the following question: Information:  - A silver medal in sports and other similar areas involving competition is a medal made of, or plated with, silver awarded to the second-place finisher, or runner-up, of contests or competitions such as the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, etc. The outright winner receives a gold medal and the third place a bronze medal. More generally, silver is traditionally a metal sometimes used for all types of high-quality medals, including artistic ones.  - The 1900 Summer Olympics, today officially known as the Games of the II Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1900 in Paris, France, and the last Summer Olympics to be held in the 19th century. No opening or closing ceremonies were held; competitions began on May 14 and ended on October 28. The Games were held as part of the 1900 World's Fair. In total, 997 competitors took part in 19 different sports. Women took part in the games for the first time and sailor Hélène de Pourtalès became the first female Olympic champion. The decision to hold competitions on a Sunday brought protests from many American athletes, who travelled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on their religious day of rest.  - At the 1900 Summer Olympics, six of the archery events that took place in Paris, France, were considered Olympic, with 153 archers competing in them. The identities of 17 of those archers are known, though a number of those are known only by their surnames. It was the first time that archery was featured in the Olympics. All six events were for men. Only France, Belgium, and the Netherlands sent archers. None of the Dutch archers are known by name and none won any medals.  - Silver is the metallic element with the atomic number 47. Its symbol is Ag, from the Latin \\"\\", derived from the Greek \\"\\" (literally \\"shiny\\" or \\"white\\"), and ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European language root reconstructed as *\\"her-\\", \\"grey\\" or \\"shining\\". A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (\\"native silver\\"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. Silver is more abundant than gold, but it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as \\"0.940 fine\\".   - Hubert van Innis ( 24 February 1866 -- 25 November 1961 ) was a Belgian competitor in the sport of archery . Van Innis competed in four events and won two first prizes and a second prize , and is now considered by the International Olympic Committee to have won two gold medals and a silver medal . His wins came in the shorter events , the 33 metre sections of each of the Au Chapelet and Au Cordon Doré competitions . In the 50 metre Au Cordon Doré , van Innis finished second to Henri Hérouin by a score of 31 -- 29 , with Émile Fisseux close behind at 28 points . Van Innis had his worst of his four outings in the 50 metre Au Chapelet event , finishing in fourth place . He also lost to Hérouin in the Championnat du Monde event , 22 -- 16 , though that event is not considered Olympic by the IOC . At the 1920 Summer Olympics held in Antwerp , van Innis won four gold and two silver medals , bringing up his total Olympic medal count to six gold and three silver medals . He 's the most successful archer in Olympic history .  - A medal or medallion is, strictly speaking, a small, flat, and round (at times, ovoid) piece of metal that has been sculpted, molded, cast, struck, stamped, or some way marked with an insignia, portrait, or other artistic rendering. A medal may be awarded to a person or organization as a form of recognition for sporting, military, scientific, academic, or various other achievements. Military awards and decorations are more precise terms for certain types of state decoration. Medals may also be created for sale to commemorate particular individuals or events, or as works of artistic expression in their own right. In the past, medals commissioned for an individual, typically with their portrait, were often used as a form of diplomatic or personal gift, with no sense of being an award for the conduct of the recipient.  - Henri Louis Hérouin, Sr. (born 19 February 1876, date of death unknown) was a French competitor in the sport of archery. Hérouin won the first prize, and is now considered by the International Olympic Committee to have won the gold medal, in the 50 metre Au Cordon Doré event at the first Olympic appearance of archery, in the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. His score of 31 put him 2 points above his closest competitor Hubert Van Innis.  - The Commonwealth Games (known as the British Empire Games from 19301950, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games from 19541966, and British Commonwealth Games from 19701974) is an international, multi-sport event involving athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations. The event was first held in 1930, and, with the exception of 1942 and 1946, which were cancelled due to World War II, has taken place every four years since then.  - International mostly means something (a company, language, or organization) involving more than a single country. The term international as a word means involvement of, interaction between or encompassing more than one nation, or generally beyond national boundaries. For example, international law, which is applied by more than one country and usually everywhere on Earth, and international language which is a language spoken by residents of more than one country.  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe.

Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - The International Olympic Committee (IOC; French: Comité international olympique, CIO) is the supreme authority of the worldwide Olympic movement. It is an international, non-profit, non-governmental organization based in Lausanne, Switzerland. Its mission is enshrined in the Olympic Charter: to support the development of competitive sport by ethical and environmentally sustainable means.  - Lausanne (, ) is a city in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, and the capital and biggest city of the canton of Vaud. The city is situated on the shores of Lake Geneva (or simply \\"Le Léman\\"). It faces the French town of Évian-les-Bains, with the Jura Mountains to its north-west. Lausanne is located northeast of Geneva.  - Émile Léon Fisseux (born 15 February 1868, date of death unknown) was a French competitor in the sport of archery. Fisseux competed in one event in Archery at the 1900 Summer Olympics, taking third place in the 50 metre Au Cordon Doré competition. His score of 28 points was one point behind the second-place archer, Hubert Van Innis, and three points behind the winner, Henri Hérouin. While Fisseux received no medal at the time, he is currently considered to be a bronze medallist by the International Olympic Committee.  - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France.

Although the reviewer notes that the naengmyun wasn't the best they've ever had, they still affirm that it was good. A clear sign that the overall experience was positive is the variety of other dishes the reviewer's family ordered and enjoyed; the reviewer singles out the kalbi (a Korean beef dish) for particular praise, noting that it was tender and well-seasoned, and was appreciated specifically by their children. Moreover, the service is described as \\"awesome\\" and \\"friendly,\\" descriptors that give a strong indication of a positive experience. The reviewer also expresses a desire to not only return to the establishment if in town again, but also bring friends, which suggests that they trust the quality and experience enough to recommend it to others. Finally, it's worth noting that negative reviews typically focus on problems or issues encountered during the service or with the food.

Payton was one of three children born to Peter and Alyne Payton in Columbia, Mississippi. His father was a factory worker who had played semi-professional baseball. Payton was an active member of the Boy Scouts, Little League, and his local church. At John J. Jefferson High School, Payton played drums in the marching band, participated in the track team and sang in the school choir. Payton's motto was \\"Never Die Easy\\", which is also the title of his posthumously published autobiography. Payton attributed this motto to Bob Hill, his coach at Jackson State. In practice, this meant that Payton refused to deliberately run out-of-bounds and always delivered some punishment to his tacklers before being forced off the field or forced down.  One of Payton's signature maneuvers was the \\"stutter-step\\", a high-stepping, irregularly paced run. He developed this as a way to distract his pursuers during long runs, saying that it startled them into thinking and gave him some advantage over players who were actually faster runners. In his autobiography, he likened the stutter step to a kind of \\"option play\\": when he was stutter-stepping, defenders would have to commit to a pursuit angle based upon whether they thought he would accelerate after the stutter-step, or cut -- he would read this angle and do the opposite of what the defender had committed to.  He re-invented the practice of stiff-arming his tacklers, which had gone out of favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.  After scoring touchdowns, Payton declined to celebrate; instead, he would often hand the ball to his teammates or the official. He disapproved of the growing practice of touchdown celebrations; he preferred post-game antics such as rushing into the locker room and locking his teammates out in the cold while taking a long shower. Although Payton would have won the respect of his peers and coaches by his running alone, he retired as the career leader in receptions for a running back with 492 for over 4,500 yards, and still holds the career record for a running back with 8 touchdown passes.

The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House.  The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports.  But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office.  Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers.  \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded.  \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.

The answer is:","output":"While I cannot predict exactly what Riley will do next, I can provide an analysis of different possible reactions Riley might have based on the context provided. It is important to remember that human emotions and reactions differ greatly depending on the individual's personality, past experiences, and the level of trust in their relationships.  1. Confront the friend: Riley may decide to confront their friend to have an honest and open conversation about the situation. In this case, Riley would need to approach their friend in a non-accusatory and calm manner to discuss the issue and share their feelings about being talked about negatively. This could lead to either a resolution and strengthened friendship, or a realization that their friendship isn't as strong as they once thought. 2. Seek advice from other friends: Before making any decisions, Riley could talk to their other friends who overheard the gossip. Asking for advice and getting their perspectives might help Riley better understand the situation and weigh possible reactions. 3. Ignore the gossip: Another option for Riley would be to ignore the gossip, not letting it affect their emotions, and not allowing it to alter their relationship with their friend. This might be an effective choice if Riley believes that the gossip was out of character for their friend or that it was simply a one-time occurrence. 4. Distance themselves: Alternatively, Riley might decide to distance themselves from their friend who was gossiping. This may happen gradually, by spending less time together and interacting less, or more abruptly, by ending the friendship altogether. Riley could determine that the trust in their relationship has been broken and choose to focus on other connections instead. 5. Reflect on their own behavior: It's also possible that Riley might take this as an opportunity to look inward and examine their own behavior. They might question if there's anything in their actions that could have led to the gossip, and whether they should make changes in their own life to improve their relationships with others. 6. Confide in a trusted adult: If Riley is still unsure how to proceed, they might choose to confide in a trusted adult-like a parent, teacher, or guidance counselor. Their experience and advice might help Riley navigate the situation. In conclusion, Riley's next step will depend on their personality, priorities, and the significance of their friendship with the person who was gossiping about them. Regardless of the chosen path, it is essential for Riley to communicate and confront the situation positively and constructively, keeping in mind the importance of trust, respect, and empathy in building strong, healthy relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Arrest: Former Montgomery County DA Bruce Castor said he wanted to arrest Cosby - but there was not enough evidence. The former District Attorney who decided not to charge Bill Cosby with rape today revealed to MailOnline that he wanted to arrest the star - but had insufficient proof. Bruce Castor was the DA of Montgomery County at the time that Andrea Constand claimed Cosby, now 77, drugged her and sexually assaulted her at his Pennsylvania home in January 2004. Miss Constand, a former director of operations for Temple University's women's basketball team and college basketball star, launched a legal suit against Cosby, a man she called her 'mentor', in March 2005. She was the first - and only woman - to press charges against the comic legend. And today, Mr Castor, who is now Montgomery County commissioner, told MailOnline exclusively: 'I wanted to arrest Bill Cosby because I thought he was probably guilty, but being able to prove anything beyond a reasonable doubt and thinking he's probably guilty are two different things. 'We knew back then that other woman had come forward, but even if they did it didn't mean anything for our case as none of those cases resulted in charges and were remote in time.' Commissioner Castor, a former two-term DA of Montgomery County and a private lawyer at the Bryn Mawr law office of Rogers and Associates., added: 'The lady who was allegedly attacked waited a year before she reported it. As a result of that delay, any possible corroborating physical evidence was unavailable to us. 'We couldn't test for hairs, fibers, DNA and drugs in her system that might match those at Mr Cosby's house. We didn't have any corroborative evidence. Scroll down for video. Happy, now: Andrea Constand pictured beaming while on a hike. She claimed in court papers she was attacked by Cosby at his Philadelphia home in 2004 - having previously considered him a friend and mentor. Post-traumatic stress disorder: Andrea Constand, former director of operations for Temple University's women's basketball team, sued Bill Cosby for rape in 2005. They settled out of court in 2006. 'Impish': NPR host Scott Simon said that when he asked Cosby about allegations of sexual assault, the star - joined by his wife of 50-years Camille - shook his head, wagged his finger and gave an 'impish, delightful' smile' 'There was almost no evidence on which to base a criminal case. The lady could not remember what happened with any detail, and she didn't report it for a year, all this made the case very difficult. 'I thought the failure to report the alleged incident would create a high hurdle to jump over. It was not like she could say what happened.' In her civil suit, Miss Constand, now 41, said she first met Cosby, a Temple University alum, in November 2002 and the pair became friends. She considered him a 'mentor' and was a frequent guest at dinner parties at his home. However, in court papers, she claims that after arriving at Cosby's house on an evening in January 2004,  the comic legend gave her three blue pills when she said she was stressed over work, which he described as 'herbal medication' to help her relax. Then, the suit states, her 'knees began to shake, her limbs felt immobile, she felt dizzy and weak, and she began to feel only barely conscious.' Alum: Bill Cosby poses with Cheerleaders at the Philadelphia Premiere of Fat Albert at the Liacouras Center of his alma mater, Temple University, in December 2004 - a month after his alleged assault on Andrea Constand at his home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Sports fan: Bill Cosby takes up the trumpet as he joins the Mississippi State band before the start of the first game of the NCAA Final Four in March 1996, in East Rutherford, N.J. Cosby then gave her another drug, she said, and led her to the sofa, where she says she was sexually molested. 'When Plaintiff awoke, her clothes and undergarments were in disarray,' the suit said. Miss Constand later returned to her native Canada, where she reported the incident to police in January 2005. Authorities in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, followed up with an investigation, but in February 2005, they declined to press criminal charges due to a lack of evidence. Commissioner Castor said: 'All she could say is that she was there (at Cosby's house) and then something might have happened due to how she was when she next remembered something. 'I also knew she had a civil court remedy with a much lower standard of proof, and in fact, she had initiated such a case. 'So this lady was going to get a measure of justice in civil court where the burden of proof is much lower: just more likely than not that Cosby had done it. 50 per cent plus a tiny bit. A far cry from proof beyond a reasonable doubt which, essentially, is just shy of proof beyond any doubt. As a result of the alleged incident, Miss Constand claimed she had suffered 'serious and debilitating injuries, mental anguish, humiliation, embarrassment, physical and emotional upset, including, but not limited to, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, sleeplessness, isolation, flashbacks, anxiety, the full extent of which injuries are not yet known and some or all which may be permanent in nature.' The suit also said she had been 'caused to suffer and continues to suffer severe emotional distress, humiliation, embarrassment and financial loss.' Miss Constand sued Cosby for more than 150,000 in damages. Thirteen other women were claimed to be supporting witnesses in her suit and she settled out of court for an undisclosed sum in 2006. Today, Miss Constand declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline. However, she seemed to make her feelings clear on the overwhelming publicity surrounding Cosby and his alleged sexual offences. She tweeted a saying from Dr Seuss: 'My heart goes out to you:Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.' Statement: Bill Cosby, pictured in April, broke his silence amid the allegations of sexual assault on his website. The post thanked fans for their 'outpouring' of support. Paid out: Bill Cosby and Andrea Constand came to an out of court settlement in 2006. When asked about the rape charges by NPR Weekend Edition host Scott Simon last week, Cosby - joined by his wife of 50-years Camille -  shook his head, wagged his finger and gave an 'impish, delightful' smile. A day later the comedian's lawyer called the charges 'discredited' and said the 'fact that they are being repeated does not make them true. The star would not 'dignify' the allegations with a response, he added.. 'He would like to thank all his fans for the outpouring of support and assure them that, at age 77, he is doing his best work. There will be no further statement from Mr. Cosby or any of his representatives.' However, this was later taken down and today, a joint statement from Dolores Troiani, counsel to Andrea Constand, and John P. Schmitt, counsel to Bill Cosby.statement was posted on billcosby.com saying:  'The statement released by Mr. Cosby's attorney over the weekend was not intended to refer in any way to Andrea Constand. 'As previously reported, differences between Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand were resolved to the mutual satisfaction of Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand years ago. Neither Mr. Cosby nor Ms. Constand intends to comment further on the matter.' Keeping quiet: Andrea Constand declined to comment on the latest allegations of sexual assault made by women against Bill Cosby. Support:  Andrea Constand has been posting a series of supportive messages on her Twitter feed. Joan Tarshis, a former publicist, is now the latest to accuse Cosby of rape, claiming he assaulted her on two occasions in 1969, when she was 19. Joan wrote an essay for Hollywood Elswhere, published on Sunday, saying that she felt she could not come forward because Cosby was idolized - but said she was going public in the wake of accusations made by other women. 'I thought nobody would believe me because of his image, you know, whiter than snow,' she told The Wrap. Allegations: Barbara Bowman claims years of hell at the hands of Bill Cosby. And Barbara Bowman, who last month described her years of hell at the hands of the comic legend exclusively to MailOnline, is now asking him to acknowledge her claims. She said: 'I understand why more women have not spoken up. But my plea is that ANY women sexually abused by Bill Cosby come forward now and speak out. You have an obligation to survivors. If you don't speak out, you're helping no one, including yourselves. If nothing else, don't you deserve closure yourselves? Your daughters are not immune to this if we all stay silent. What kind of message are we sending to our own children?' 'This is why I'm speaking out. Wouldn't you like your daughters to learn how to stay safe from sexual predators? That's why I'm pushing so hard.' Cosby has never been charged with any crime relating to the allegations now swirling around him. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This article covers several key points about the case of alleged sexual assault by famed comic figure, Bill Cosby, investigated by Bruce Castor, the former DA of Montgomery County. Castor has stated that while he wanted to arrest Cosby, he felt that the supporting evidence was insufficient for a criminal case. He explains his decision was rooted in challenges such as a lack of physical evidence due to the victim's delayed report, lack of case building details from the victim, and no charges being brought about in cases of other women who had come forward. The allegations against Cosby were brought by Andrea Constand, a former director of operations for Temple University's women's basketball team. According to her, Cosby, whom she called her 'mentor', drugged and sexually assaulted her at his home in January 2004. Her legal case began in March 2005. Castor notes that Constand's delayed reporting of the incident, as well as her inability to clearly remember certain events due to the effects of the supposed drugging, posed significant hurdles in building a successful criminal case. In her 2005 civil suit, Constand detailed her relationship with Cosby and the events of the alleged assault, involving Cosby supposedly giving her drugs to help her relax, following which she became incapacitated and was sexually molested. Following the incident, Constand returned to her native Canada and eventually reported the case in January 2005. However, the authorities declined to press charges due to a lack of evidence. Regardless, Castor mentioned that Constand also had the option of seeking justice in a civil court where the burden of proof is lower. Indeed, she initiated a civil case wherein she claimed to have suffered severe emotional and mental distress, along with physical injuries. Her lawsuit, which sought more than 150,000 in damages, was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum in 2006. The article further notes that Cosby and his representatives did not address the allegations directly. However, a joint statement from the counsel of both parties has clarified that any previous comments were not intended to refer to Constand and that all differences between Cosby and Constand had been resolved years ago. The article concludes by mentioning other women who also accused Cosby of sexual misconduct, such as Joan Tarshis and Barbara Bowman. Notwithstanding, Cosby has never been officially charged with any crime related to these allegations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Casey?\\", is \\"benevolent\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"Yes, \\"benevolent\\" could be considered a valid answer to describe Casey in this scenario. To provide a more detailed explanation, let us examine the definition and context of the word \\"benevolent\\". Benevolence is typically characterized by kindness, goodwill, and a disposition to do good to others. It is a quality that can manifest itself in various forms, such as showing empathy, offering support, or expressing genuine concern for the well-being of others. In the given scenario, Casey pays Carson a compliment after noticing their new outfit. Compliments are generally perceived as kind gestures that express one's appreciation or admiration for another. By complimenting Carson on their outfit, Casey is acknowledging Carson's effort to look good and expressing their approval in a positive and friendly manner. This act of offering a compliment can be seen as an expression of goodwill and positivity towards Carson. While it is true that a single act of kindness might not be enough to establish someone's overall character as benevolent, it can still be reasonable to describe Casey as benevolent, at least in this specific context. It is important to note that people's personalities and behaviors can be multifaceted and complex. Using benevolent to describe Casey may be accurate in this particular case, but it is always good to keep in mind that people can exhibit various traits and behaviors in different situations. In conclusion, labeling Casey as \\"benevolent\\" based on their compliment toward Carson's new outfit is a valid description in the given context.

As pet owners, it is our responsibility to provide an environment that mimics their natural habitat as closely as possible. This article will discuss the importance of temperature and light management in a vivarium and provide practical tips for setting up the ideal living conditions for your reptile friend. 1. Choose the Right Heat Source The foundation of a healthy environment for reptiles is an appropriate heat source. The specific requirements may vary depending on the species; however, most reptiles need a temperature gradient within their enclosure to regulate their body temperature adequately. To achieve this, you may use the following types of heating devices:     a) Heat lamps: These are one of the most commonly used heat sources for reptiles. They provide a basking spot, and the heat generated by the lamp can be easily adjusted if necessary. Ceramic heat emitters, infrared heat bulbs, and regular incandescent bulbs can be used for this purpose.     b) Under-tank heating pads: These devices are placed beneath the vivarium to heat the substrate, which in turn heats the air. This type of heat source is beneficial for burrowing reptiles that rely on ground temperatures to thermoregulate.     c) Heat rocks: While not recommended as the primary heat source, heat rocks can be useful for providing supplemental warmth, especially for reptiles requiring contact heat for digestion. 2. Monitor and Regulate Temperature Levels Once the desired temperature gradient is achieved, it is crucial to monitor and regulate the temperature regularly to ensure a stable environment. Inaccurate temperature control can lead to stress, illness, and even death in reptiles. Consider the following suggestions:     a) Invest in a reliable thermometer: A high-quality digital thermometer accurately measures the temperature inside the vivarium. It's a good idea to place one probe on the cool side and another on the warm side to get a better understanding of the gradient.     b) Use a thermostat: A thermostat can regulate the temperature by turning the heat source on or off. This not only helps maintain a consistent temperature but also saves energy.     c) Check temperatures daily: Regular monitoring helps to detect any fluctuations in temperature early and allows for timely adjustments, if necessary. 3. Creating a Daily Cycle of Light and Dark The natural daily light cycle is essential for reptiles, as it helps regulate their sleep patterns, feeding habits, and overall behavior. Providing an appropriate cycle of light and dark is crucial to ensure the well-being of your pet. Consider the following tips:     a) Set up a lighting schedule: This resembles the natural day and night cycle, typically consisting of 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness.     b) Choose the right type of light: Full-spectrum UVA and UVB lights promote overall health and natural behaviors. However, avoid using heat-emitting lights as the sole source of light. Instead, use a combination of heat and light sources.     c) Use a timer: Automatic timers make it easy to maintain a consistent daily light cycle and minimize the stress of manual intervention. 4. Positioning the Vivarium Lastly, it's essential to carefully consider the location where you place your vivarium. A suitable arrangement will help maintain consistent temperature and light conditions. Keep in mind the following advice:     a) Avoid direct sunlight: Exposure to direct sunlight can cause overheating, leading to potential stress and health issues for your reptile.     b) Keep away from drafts: Ensure that the vivarium is not close to windows, doors, or vents. Fluctuating air currents can negatively impact the temperature inside.     c) Steer clear of heat sources: Position the vivarium away from heating devices, like radiators, which can increase temperature levels and lead to overheating. Conclusion Ensuring the ideal temperature and lighting conditions is an essential aspect of reptile husbandry. By investing in the appropriate equipment, monitoring the temperature, and adhering to recommended guidelines, you can create a safe and comfortable environment that closely mimics your reptile's natural habitat. This, in turn, will contribute to the health, happiness, and longevity of your cold-blooded friend."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Who announced the death of President Kennedy on American TV????","output":"Walter Cronkite, a veteran and highly respected journalist, was the individual who announced the death of President John F. Kennedy on American television. At that time, Cronkite was serving as the lead anchor of CBS Evening News, a position he occupied from 1962 to 1981. The tragic news of President Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963, was an unforgettable moment in television history and was watched by millions of Americans who were glued to their television sets. On that fateful day, President Kennedy was in Dallas, Texas, participating in a motorcade through the city when shots were fired at him. The president was gravely wounded and was rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. The first bulletin reported by Walter Cronkite occurred at 1:40 PM, Eastern Standard Time, when CBS interrupted its regularly scheduled programming to deliver the breaking news that the President had been shot. Cronkite continued to provide viewers with updates throughout the afternoon, often using the ticker tape machine that was in the CBS newsroom as a primary source of information. The atmosphere in the newsroom, as well as across the nation, was one of shock and disbelief. At 2:38 PM, Eastern Standard Time, Cronkite received official confirmation from the Associated Press that President Kennedy had passed away. In a moment that has since become iconic, he removed his glasses and announced to the nation: \\"From Dallas, Texas, the flash, apparently official: 'President Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time.' 2 o'clock Eastern Standard Time, some 38 minutes ago.\\" Clearly emotional, Cronkite paused for a moment before continuing, \\"Vice President Lyndon Johnson has left the hospital in Dallas but we do not know to where he has proceeded; presumably, he will be taking the oath of office shortly and become the 36th President of the United States.” Walter Cronkite's coverage of the tragic event and the hours that followed serve as a testament to his professionalism in the face of intense pressure and emotion. His ability to deliver the news with accuracy and composure amid such shocking circumstances has forever cemented his place in broadcast journalism history. For many Americans, Cronkite's announcement of the death of President Kennedy remains a poignant memory from a tragic day in the nation's history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It may look like something straight from a toy store but this bizarre creature is a new species of insect found living in the South American rainforest. The 7mm-long creature is golden  and its elongated body is covered in orange dots and stripes. It has hair-like feelers sticking out of its rear which resemble the fuzzy hair of the colourful Troll Dolls, a popular toy in the 1990s. The 7mm-wide insect, pictured, was discovered after researchers from the University of Harvard trekked for three weeks to explore the untouched rainforest of southeast Suriname. The unnamed creature is covered in orange dots and stripes. Its feelers are made of wax that protrude from its rear end. Researchers believe the bug is an immature insect called a nymph, possibly fitting into one of four nymph families:. Dictyopharidae, Nogodinidae, Lophopidae, and Tropiduchidae. A nymph is an immature insect. In insects that undergo a gradual metamorphosis, the stage of the life cycle that hatches from the egg is called the nymph. These insects do not pupate like a butterfly. Often, the nymph looks like a smaller, wingless version of the adult. The nymph may molt several times to reach adulthood. Insects that undergo simple or gradual metamorphosis, and have a nymph stage, include grasshoppers and crickets, cockroaches, termites and dragonflies. Teams from the University of Harvard and. museums around the world trekked for three weeks to explore the. untouched rainforest of southeast Suriname. The new nymph was one of 60 new species recorded during the trek. Princeton's Dr Trond Larsen, who is a tropical ecologist and conservation biologist, spent days studying the creature. Dr Larsen said: 'I have spent hours searching drawers of nymphs to compare it to. other species, but have only been able to narrow it down from 16 to. four.' In insects that undergo a gradual metamorphosis, the stage of the life cycle that hatches from the egg is called the nymph. These insects do not pupate like a butterfly. The iridescent 'tail' that grows from the bottom of some nymphs is in fact made of wax. It is produced by specialised glands in the abdomen. The wax serves a variety of purposes - in some species it grows into a fan shape and can slow descent while falling. It can also act as a distraction for predators.

The country has a relatively low population and still maintains 95 per cent of its forest cover, but faces pressure from mining, road and dam projects. The scientists collected data on water quality and a total of 1,378 species, including plants, ants, beetles, katydids, fishes, amphibians, birds and mammals. Dr. Leeanne Alonso, the expedition's leader, said: 'I have conducted expeditions all over the world, but never have I seen such beautiful, pristine forests so untouched by humans.

Born in Southern Sudan, her idyllic childhood took a drastic turn as her native land was engulfed in a brutal civil war. Through sheer determination and an unwavering spirit, Wek has risen above the chaos that once surrounded her, becoming an internationally renowned model and philanthropist. This article takes a closer look at the remarkable journey of a woman who has not only defied the odds but has become an inspiration to millions. A Serene Start: Alek Wek's Early Years Born on April 16, 1977, in Wau, Sudan (now South Sudan), Alek Wek was the seventh of nine children in a loving, tight-knit family. Her father, Athian Wek, was an education minister, and her mother, Akuol Wek, was a stay-at-home mom. Her early years were marked by a peaceful and contented upbringing, surrounded by her siblings, who played together, attended the local school, and spent their free time savoring the natural beauty of their homeland. The Turmoil of War: Devastation in Southern Sudan However, the peaceful existence that Wek enjoyed in her early years quickly unraveled when the Second Sudanese Civil War broke out in 1983. This extremely violent and deadly conflict between the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army spanned over two decades and resulted in an estimated 2 million deaths and millions more displaced. For Wek and her family, the war hit close to home. Forced to flee their once-tranquil village, the family faced numerous challenges, including the heartbreaking loss of Wek's father due to complications from a hip replacement surgery. As the war raged on, Wek's family made the difficult decision to send her away to seek refuge in London, England, away from the horrors of the war. A New Life: From Refugee to Runway Arriving in London in 1991 at the age of 14, Alek Wek was able to live with her sister Aida and attend school, immersing herself in a new culture and experiences. What appeared to be another life-changing moment occurred in 1995 when a modeling scout discovered Wek at a South London park. Her striking beauty and unique features, which broke the mold of conventional European standards of beauty, caught the eye of the fashion world. Before long, Wek was signed to one of the top modeling agencies, and her career skyrocketed. In 1997, she became the first African model to appear on the cover of Elle magazine, a monumental achievement that challenged traditional norms and stereotypes in the fashion industry. Over the years, Wek has graced countless magazine covers, runways, and global fashion campaigns, working for prestigious designers such as Chanel, Calvin Klein, and Gucci. Philanthropy and Activism Alek Wek had not only conquered the fashion world but also used her platform to advocate for humanitarian issues. As a former refugee, she feels a deep connection to the plight of displaced populations and has worked tirelessly to raise awareness and contribute to their support. In 2002, she was named a Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and from that platform, she has shone a light on the critical issue of refugees, sharing her personal experiences with the world. Wek has also been involved with several other charitable organizations, such as World Vision, Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), and Save the Children. Conclusion The incredible journey of Alek Wek, from her idyllic childhood in southern Sudan to her struggle through civil war and her eventual triumph as an internationally recognized model and humanitarian, serves as a powerful reminder of the human spirit's resilience. Her life is a testament to the fact that amidst the chaos and destruction brought on by conflict, greatness can still emerge. Alek Wek will remain an inspiration for generations to come as she continues to break barriers, both in fashion and philanthropy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It seems there is only one thing more irritating than the rotund opera singer from the Go Compare TV commercials – any attempt to do away with him. Two commercials where the character was attacked drew more complaints than any other to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) last year. The Italian character, Gio Compario, created by Welsh singer Wynne Evans, was designed to be deliberately annoying as he repeatedly blasted out the company jingle. Scroll down for videos. An ad showing Go Compare's opera-singing character Gio Compario being kicked in the stomach by Stuart Pearce generated over 1,000 complaints. Opera singer Gio Compario lies injured on the ground. Viewers complained the ad was potentially harmful to children. Stuart Pearce as he appears in the ad. Unsurprisingly, the price comparison website thought the nation would welcome a series of creative and funny efforts to wipe him off our TV screens. However, it appears many were upset by the dastardly comic book methods they came up with. The first commercial featured former England left back, Stuart Pearce, who is famous for his hefty left foot, aiming a football at the annoying Gio. More than 1,000 people complained that kicking a football into the singer’s stomach was likely to set a bad example to children. The ASA disagreed, insisting most people would understand it was light-hearted and comical. The second commercial saw Sue Barker, the BBC sports presenter and former tennis player, firing a rocket launcher at the character in a bid to kill him off. This time there were 797 complaints from people who were unhappy at the suggested violence. Again the ASA backed the company, saying the images were clearly meant to be a joke, while Gio was unharmed. The two commercials feature at the. top of a list of the ten most complained about advertisements of 2012 in. the watchdog’s annual report published today. In. third place was a more serious advertisement by Channel 4 for its. controversial series, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, which was deemed to have. sexualised a teenage girl. The poster showed the 15-year-old. blonde, who was heavily made up, spilling out of a low cut top that. revealed her breasts and cleavage. The. broadcaster was also criticised over a second poster of a 10-year-old. boy with an aggressive expression which was deemed to have stereotyped. youngsters from the traveller community. One commercial saw Sue Barker, the BBC sports presenter and former tennis player, firing a rocket launcher at the Go Compare character in a bid to kill him off. The watchdog’s annual report reveals that it rejected the vast majority of the 31,298 complaints received about 18,990 ads last year. Among those to be cleared were images of a naked rambler character in a TV ad for Richmond ham, which provoked complaints from more than 300 viewers that it was unsuitable to be seen by children. Asda came under fire last Christmas for a commercial that suggested the job of preparing for the festivities was essentially woman’s work. Women complained it promoted sexist stereotypes while men, including Fathers for Justice, were unhappy that it failed to recognise the value of dads. However, the ASA sided with the supermarket which produced research showing that mums really do carry the burden of organising Christmas. The organisation received more than 300 complaints about advertisements on the YouTube channel of the Paddy Power betting firm, which poked fun at transsexuals. It could not make a ruling as the firm is based in Ireland, however it did censure the firm over a similar commercial that appeared on British TV. Surprisingly, the St John’s Ambulance was responsible for one of the most controversial advertisements of the year. Its TV ad showed a man and his family coping with his diagnosis, treatment and eventual recovery from cancer, only for him to die by choking to death on a piece of food. More than 144 complained, however the ASA ruled the strong storyline was justified because it carried an important message that relatively simple first aid techniques can prevent a tragedy. Other commercials in the top ten, included a Morrisons ad where a dog was apparently being fed Christmas pudding, which might be harmful, and a Kellogg’s cereal ad which some thought was distressing because it showed a man being attacked by a snake. The ASA partly upheld complaints about a TV ad for the Kayak Software Corporation which showed a man receiving brain surgery. Some viewers thought the theme was distressing. The watchdog’s work led to just 3,700 ads being changed or withdrawn last year. Its chairman, Lord Smith, the former Labour Culture Secretary, said: ‘We want to make sure that consumers aren’t being misled, misinformed, harmed or offended. ‘They need to be able to make proper, informed choices about what products and services are available to them. And we want to make sure that there is a fair comparison between advertisers, so that responsible marketing isn’t being under-cut by the irresponsible.’ 1. Gocompare.com (1,008 complaints, not upheld)Stuart Pearce kicking a football into the stomach of an opera singer. 2.  Gocompare.com (797 complaints, not upheld)Sue Barker shooting opera singer with rocket launcher. 3. Channel 4's Big Fat Gypsy Wedding (373 complaints, upheld in part)Poster sexualised girl of 15; poster showed aggressive young boy, stereotyped travellers. A poster advertising the forthcoming season of Channel 4's Big Fat Gypsy Wedding series generated 373 complaints due to the sexualised image of a 15-year-old girl. 4. Kerry Foods Richmond Ham, (371 complaints, upheld in part)Naked. rambler viewed as upsetting for children. Criticism of nudity rejected. Claim that meat was ‘Britain’s only ham’ was misleading. A naked rambler in a Kerry Foods ad for Richmond Ham was criticised for potentially upsetting children. 5. Paddy Power (Transsexual theme, 311 complaints, out of remit)Commercial on YouTube channel made fun of transsexuals. No ruling as company registered in Ireland. A Paddy Power ad with a transsexual theme angered viewers, who lodged over 300 complaints, but no ruling was made as the company is registered in Ireland. 6. Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut cereal (234 complaints, not upheld)Man attacked by snake as he tried to capture it in kitchen. A Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal ad generated 234 complaints by people who were alarmed by the sight of a snake attack on a man in his kitchen. 7.

A dog apparently being fed Christmas pudding in a Morrisons ad caused concern among animal lovers. 8. ASDA (620 complaints, not upheld)Mum seen doing all the hard work to prepare for Christmas. An Asda ad in which a mother is seen doing all the hard work to prepare for Christmas was deemed offensive by viewers. 9.

Two men were jailed for a year in 2012 for stealing a sculpture called Sundial (1965) and the bronze plinth of another work, also from the foundation's estate. In October 2013 Standing Figure (1950), one of four Moore pieces in Glenkiln Sculpture Park, estimated to be worth £3 million, was stolen. In 2012, the council of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets announced its plans to sell another version of Draped Seated Woman 1957–58, a 1.6-tonne bronze sculpture. Moore, a well-known socialist, had sold the sculpture at a fraction of its market value to the former London County Council on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. Nicknamed Old Flo, it was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997. Tower Hamlets Council later had considered moving Draped Seated Woman to private land in Canary Wharf but instead chose to \\"explore options\\" for a sale.

Suzannah Hills. PUBLISHED:. 05:30 EST, 16 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 05:32 EST, 16 August 2013. A retired family doctor killed himself after he wrongly convinced himself he had cancer, an inquest heard yesterday. Dr Philip Squire, 59, was found hanged at his home where he'd left a note saying he found 'the idea of operations and long suffering just unbearable'. But the inquest in Somerset was told how test results had given the GP the all clear and he had probably brought on the symptoms on himself physiologically. Tragedy: Doctor Philip Squire, 59, was found hanged at his home in Taunton, Somerset (stock image pictured), where he left a note saying his cancer was too much to bear despite being given the all-clear. His own GP, Doctor William Chandler, said the medic lived alone and suffered depression. He believed Dr Squire feared cancer rather than actually suffering from it. Neighbours found the retired GP in his home in Taunton, Somerset, where he left two notes. One of them read: 'My last 16 months have been hell, knowing something serious is happening but not being able to convince others. I have also felt rather alone and isolated. 'The idea of operations and suffering was just unbearable.' His niece Judith Sumner said he was 'conscientious and hard working' and retired in 2010 as senior partner because he was finding life as a GP 'very stressful' and suffered anxiety and low moods. West Somerset coroner Michael Rose recorded a verdict of suicide at the Taunton hearing. He said: 'Sadly he had a phobia about dying with cancer of the pancreas. Nothing could disabuse him of the fact that he felt the symptoms. 'It is a sad end for a man who has given an awful lot of his life to this town.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This is a sad story about a retired family doctor named Dr. Philip Squire. He was 59 years old and lived by himself. Dr. Squire thought he had cancer and was very scared about it, even though tests showed he didn't have it. He was also feeling alone, and was having a very hard time. Unfortunately, Dr. Squire decided to end his life because he thought he had cancer and couldn't handle it. It's very sad because he was a hard-working doctor who helped a lot of people in his town."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Investing in companies that worsen poverty: The trust invests in companies that have been criticized for exacerbating poverty in developing countries, where the foundation is aiming to alleviate poverty. This creates a contradiction between the goals of the foundation and its investments. 2. Supporting polluting companies: The foundation invests in companies that heavily pollute the environment, which may lead to negative environmental impacts in the developing countries where they operate. This could further undermine the foundation's mission. 3. Lack of access to pharmaceuticals: The trust's investments in certain pharmaceutical companies that do not sell their products in developing countries can lead to limited access to essential medications for the people in those countries. This might hinder the progress made by the foundation toward improving healthcare and overall well-being in those regions. 4. Insufficient focus on social responsibility: The foundation initially announced a review of its investments in 2007 to assess social responsibility. However, the review was eventually cancelled, and the trust continued with its policy of maximizing return on investment. This may raise concerns about the foundation's commitment to ethical and socially responsible investing. 5.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which pond will the family most likely catch more fish, Ridge Pond or Happy Pond?  Our family was going to go fishing on Saturday. A few years ago we went fishing down the hill from a mushroom farm called Happy Pond. Since that time, there has been a lot of rain and we noticed Happy Pond had a green coating across the top of it. We also thought about going to a new pond in center of the park called Ridge Pond. We are hoping to catch a lot of fish to serve at our family reunion.  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. You can see it Figure below . Answer:","output":"The family will most likely catch more fish at Ridge Pond. This is because Happy Pond has a green coating across the top of it, which is likely caused by an overgrowth of algae due to excess nitrogen in the water. The presence of a mushroom farm nearby and heavy rainfall could have led to fertilizer runoff into Happy Pond, causing this algal bloom. Algae can use up so much oxygen in the water that it creates a dead zone, leaving little to no oxygen for other aquatic organisms, including fish. On the other hand, Ridge Pond does not have any mentioned issues, making it a more suitable choice for the family to catch fish for their reunion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After decades of division in Cyprus, there is genuine belief a political solution will bring together Turkish Cypriots in the north and Greek Cypriots in the south. Since 1974, when a brief Athens-inspired coup was followed by a Turkish military invasion, the island has been cut in two, with the northern third controlled by Turkish Cypriots and the southern two-thirds by Greek Cypriots. So, why now? The catalyst for the negotiations was the election last April of the Turkish Cypriot President, Mustafa Akinci, who campaigned on a promise to broker a peace deal with the south. Negotiations between Mr Akinci and Nicos Anastasiades, the Greek Cypriot President of the island, began last May. It is fitting that the bulk of their talks are being held at Nicosia airport, a site that symbolises the stalemate in Cyprus. Abandoned during the conflict of 1974, it is now sandwiched in the UN buffer zone, frozen in time. The lonely shell of a Cyprus Airways passenger jet lies on the tarmac. The terminal, which opened in 1968, is now home only to nesting pigeons and the smell of damp. Advertising posters from 1974 remain fixed to walls. You could forgive the pessimism of Cypriots who shrug their shoulders when the prospect of a peace deal is raised. They have seen this before. In 2004, the UN's plan to make Cyprus a federation of two states was emphatically rejected by the public in a referendum. Twelve years later, there is a sense the political atmosphere has changed. A short stroll from the airport is the office of Aleem Siddique, the spokesman for the UN on the island. \\"One of the key reasons why people are a lot more optimistic this time around is the trust between the two leaders,\\" he tells me. The two presidents share much in common.  They are a similar age, and both were born in the southern city of Limassol. In December, they delivered a joint TV address to wish residents a happy holiday and spoke of their hopes for a deal in 2016. In the centre of Nicosia, it's impossible to escape the reminders of the conflict. The UN buffer zone snakes through Europe's last divided capital. It is lined with derelict, crumbling buildings and endless spirals of barbed wire resting on oil drums. There is one place in the buffer zone where the atmosphere is much more welcoming. The Home for Cooperation, a community centre open to everybody on the island, hosts classes where people can learn Greek, Turkish and English. Language remains a big obstacle to integration in Cyprus. Yaprak Aydin, who lives in the Turkish-controlled north, says the centre is also about people coming together and developing empathy for those not from their own community. She smiles as she recalls a story of a Greek Cypriot lady who got in touch with the centre to tell them she had met her best friend in their cafe. The friend was Turkish Cypriot. \\"Never underestimate the power of a cup of coffee, especially in Cyprus,\\" Ms Aydin tells me. Despite the sense of hope, there remain big obstacles to overcome. During the conflict, tens of thousands of people were displaced from their homes. The delicate question remains what happens if the island unites. Is the property returned or will the owners compensated? And from where would the money come? Security is a further complication. For many Greek Cypriots, the departure of Turkish troops from the island is non-negotiable. For some Turkish Cypriots though, the Turkish military presence provides reassurance. However, following the financial crisis on the island in 2013, there was recognition a solution could reap economic dividends, with trade routes opened up to Turkey. For Mr Siddique, though, Cypriots should consider not only the economic benefits, but the international example that would be set in the region. \\"The symbolism of a largely Muslim Turkish Cypriot community and a largely Christian Greek Cypriot community coming together would send such a strong signal across the world,\\" he says. Summary:","output":"The decades-long division in Cyprus between the Turkish Cypriots in the north and Greek Cypriots in the south could finally be nearing a political solution, offering hope for reunification, peace, and potential economic benefits for the island."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He buys her a yacht and they set off sailing for the weekend. After a session of love making, Libby falls asleep. She wakes to find her husband missing and blood all over her hands, clothes, legs, and the boat's floors. A Coast Guard vessel appears and Libby is spotted holding a bloody knife she found lying on the deck. She is arrested, humiliated in the media, tried, and convicted of her husband's murder. Libby asks her best friend, Angela Green (Annabeth Gish), to look after her 4-year-old son, Matty (Benjamin Weir), for the duration of her prison sentence. On a phone call with Matty from prison, Libby hears a door open in the background, then Matty exclaims, \\"Daddy!\\" right before the line goes dead. Libby realizes that Nick possibly faked his death and framed her, leaving their son as the sole beneficiary of his life insurance policy, as people convicted for murder are not allowed to collect the life insurance on their victims. After attempting (unsuccessfully) to get investigative help, she is told by a fellow inmate named Margaret (Roma Maffia) that if she were to get paroled for good behavior, she could kill Nick with impunity due to the Double Jeopardy Clause in the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Libby is paroled after six years and begins searching for Nick and Matty, while living in a halfway house under the supervision of parole officer Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones). Libby violates her curfew and is caught breaking into Matty's school on Whidbey Island to try to get Angela's records, but manages to escape from Lehman and continue her search. After discovering Angela has recently died in Colorado, Libby recognizes a Kandinsky painting in a newspaper photo.

As the blockade still needs to be broken, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard has the ship raised and puts George E. Dixon in charge. He starts looking for a crew and after some difficulty finally finds enough volunteers to man it. They practice cranking the propeller. The crew do not all get along with each other. Dixon flashes back to the Battle of Shiloh, where a gold coin given to him by his wife (who was later killed in a steamboat explosion caused by a drifting mine) deflected a bullet and saved his life. They take the ship down and sit on the bottom to see how long they can stay down and almost get stuck. The U.S. Navy is warned about the sub. The crew votes that if after an attack they are stuck on the bottom, they will open the valves, flooding the ship, rather than suffocate. They go out to attack the USS Wabash, but the attack fails. Following the warning the ship has draped metal chain netting over the side. Also the rope which was attached to the torpedo they were to release under the ship gets loose and becomes entangled in the propeller. It has to be cut loose while sailors on the Wabash shoot at the Hunley. Beauregard proposes putting the torpedo at the end of a long spar. The USS Housatonic is ordered to change its position in the harbor and always be ready to steam, meaning it cannot hang metal netting over the side. The Hunley's second in command, Lt.

News article: Other than Diamond Stone, Terps have not gotten much from bench When Maryland guard Melo Trimble picked up his second foul midway through the first half of Tuesday night’s 70-67 loss to Michigan, Coach Mark Turgeon looked down his bench and pondered the mix of talented reserves he has trumpeted since the summer. He tinkered with his lineups all evening to neutralize his team’s foul trouble and the Wolverines’ relentless attack, attempting to create depth instead of relying on it. He inserted 6-foot-7 small forward Jared Nickens at shooting guard for a stretch. He relied on 5-7 reserve Varun Ram, normally a situational defensive specialist, to spell Trimble for 14 minutes. He paired Ram and backup point guard Jaylen Brantley at one point and rotated a front-court lineup that featured another sensational outing from freshman center Diamond Stone. Despite his team’s first loss in six weeks, Turgeon is confident that he has expanded his options as No. 3 Maryland (15-2, 4-1) prepares to host Ohio State on Saturday. “I think we built depth the other night. We didn’t win the game, but we built depth. We had to overcome a little foul trouble to do that,” he said Friday. [LeDay’s surprise emergence bolsters Hokies’ rebuilding job] The chief option in reserve is Stone, who is averaging 16.8 points over his past 10 games — coming off the bench in nine of those contests — and has quickly become the most dominant sixth man in the country. But his surge underscores the recent offensive struggles of Maryland’s second unit. Against Michigan, all of the bench’s 22 points and 11 rebounds were compiled by Stone. Excluding Maryland’s blowout win over Rutgers earlier this month — when the freshman center inadvertently started because an error was made in the scorebook and the bench was emptied early with the Terps’ lead ballooning to 42 points — Stone has scored 82 of the bench’s 87 points in four conference games. He also has collected 30 of the 40 rebounds among the reserves over that stretch. Turgeon will stick with his usual starting lineup for Saturday’s game against the Buckeyes (12-6, 4-1) , who have won eight of nine, which means he will continue to bring Stone off the bench behind junior center Damonte Dodd. While Stone is playing starter’s minutes and has emerged as the centerpiece in the front court, Turgeon said earlier this month that he needs more production out of Dodd and sophomore center Michal Cekovsky. Cekovsky has logged 32 minutes in five conference games and posted one point and seven rebounds over that stretch. [Which Pac-12 team will capi­tal­ize on Arizona’s bad luck?] Nickens, considered the best three-point shooter on the team, has been held scoreless in each of the past two games and three of the past five. Brantley, who made considerable strides near the end of the nonconference season, played 15 minutes against Rutgers after Trimble went down with a hamstring injury but has since logged just one minute in the past two games as Turgeon has turned to Ram. “I’m going to coach by feel,” Turgeon said. “Jared didn’t make shots, but Jared played pretty well. Defensively, I thought he did a really nice job. I thought Varun really helped us. I think it was a breath of fresh air.” Ram made several key defensive plays to keep Maryland close Tuesday night, but he also found himself open for two three-pointers in the second half. He missed both, admitting Friday that he wasn’t mentally prepared enough to knock them down. It can be difficult for a reserve such as Ram to find an offensive identity off the bench, given the amount of scoring firepower already available on the roster. Turgeon has said that playing time among his reserve guards is often dictated by their skills and the situation at hand — Brantley can stretch the floor with his shooting ability, while Ram is one of the team’s best perimeter defenders. But Ram added that the offense can’t play “four on five” when he’s on the floor. “When you’re on the floor with all these future NBA players, you want to make sure they’re the ones shooting the ball,” the senior said. “At the same time, you have to be ready to take an open shot.” Turgeon vowed earlier this season not to talk about the impact that sophomore Dion Wiley’s season-ending knee injury would have on his team, but it clearly has affected his depth at times. But while Turgeon can do nothing about Wiley’s absence, he is still carrying unflinching trust in the offensive capabilities of his bench. The more significant growth of the second team has come on the defensive end, including for Stone, who had the furthest ground to make up of any player on the roster. “We all feel comfortable with who we’re playing,” Turgeon said. “We just have to play a little bit better.” Roman Stubbs covers the University of Maryland athletics for The Washington Post.

Maryland's bench excluding Stone has only scored 5 points in the last four conference games, with Stone scoring 82 of the bench's 87 points. Turgeon will continue with his usual starting lineup against Ohio State, bringing Stone off the bench behind junior center Damonte Dodd. Both sophomore center Michal Cekovsky and small forward Jared Nickens have experienced a slump in their game and need to improve. Turgeon has acknowledged that the team needs better production out of Dodd and Cekovsky. Despite the team's lack of depth at times due to Dion Wiley's season-ending knee injury, Turgeon remains confident in the offensive capabilities of his bench and has seen significant growth in their defensive performance. Coach Turgeon and his team are aiming to improve and build depth as No. 3 Maryland (15-2, 4-1) prepares to host Ohio State on Saturday."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: PARENTS' GUIDE TO VISITING DAY AT CAMP THERE is a short but special season of the year that fits neatly between the beginning of July and the end of August. It is the time when parents of children away at summer camp have finally adjusted to tiny loads of laundry, sinfully small grocery bills and plenty of peace and quiet, and it precedes the period when they start dashing off to concert halls, R-rated movies, getaway weekends for two and other ''adult'' activities - before the kids come home. By the middle of summer, the family dog has reluctantly left his post at the kitchen door, having given up hope of seeing his favorite people trooping in at 3 o'clock. Even the family car has accepted the new routine; it has stopped turning automatically onto its old routes - the roads to school, the orthodontist, barbershop, soccer field, dancing lessons and birthday parties. It now knows the way to art museums, antique shows and Japanese restaurants that specialize in sushi. And it appreciates taking a nice, relaxing drive without having its back seat battered by juvenile wrestling and rioting. At this special time, when the eight weeks of summer camp so beautifully balance - four weeks gone and four more weeks to go - parents jump into cars, planes, trains and buses and run off to the country, eager to be the first adults their children will see at camp on Visiting Day. The kids are encouraged by the camping staff to play catch, clean their bunks or ''just play quietly'' while waiting for Visiting Day to begin, but soon after breakfast, they all start drifting toward the main gate. A glimpse of one's parents - or the parents of a friend - can give instant status to someone with sharp eyes. Many things should be considered by parents as they make their way from the parking lot, lugging lawn chairs, blankets and shopping bags filled with ''goodies.'' The following information is presented as a guide to these parents: 1. Be prepared for some changes in your child's appearance. Do not cry, ''Good grief! They're starving you! You must have lost at least 10 pounds!'' Even if your daughter (on whom you have spent close to 2,000 for this summer in the sun) looks like an inner-city advertisement for ''send this poor child to camp,'' don't admit it in front of her. Also, don't comment on other peculiarities; try to ignore tattoo marks (they'll probably wash right off with nail polish remover), experimental hair-dos and recently pierced ears. 2. Remember, you are at camp only for one day. Control the urge to speak your mind. Lay off the scolding. Do not say, ''You needn't call home collect every time you get a stomach ache. This camp has two competent nurses,'' even if you're bursting to do so. Within a week, you'll be swearing they have acute appendicitis and are afraid to let you - or anybody else -know. Do say, ''Things are very quiet at home. Most of the time we just sit around the house and say how glad we are that you're out of the hot city.'' 3. When you visit your child's cabin, studiously avoid any close examination of his or her toilet kit. The toothpaste, soap and shampoo you assiduously purchased in June may still be unwrapped. Furthermore, delving into a dirt-encrusted clothes cubby might excite a field mouse or other country creature that may have made a home for itself in some warm, wet socks. 4. If you must take food, don't take anything perishable. Aunt Helen's chopped liver may be a family treat at home, but it will quickly turn to moldy paste in summer heat. If you buy candy or other snack items, don't buy more than the amount your child will be able to stuff into his or her mouth that night. It is an unwritten custom among campers to gorge themselves on as many food treats as possible within 24 hours after Visiting Day. 5. Do not attempt to give your son a midsummer haircut. He probably thinks he was already scalped in June and his hair is just beginning to ''grow in.'' Also, do not tell him his kid sister stuck her hands into his fish tank ''just to pet them, Mommy,'' and three swordtails died from shock. The bad news can wait until he comes home from camp. 6. You may have received one or two frantic letters written the week before Visiting Day, with outrageous requests such as ''please bring the dog. We can smuggle her into my bunk during General Swim,'' and ''You've got to get me out of here! This is the third night I've had to sleep under the bunk!'' Don't let these pleas get to you on Visiting Day. It's normal to expect some dissatisfactions. One mother spent an entire visit listening to a litany of complaints from her 10-year old daughter. The food was horrid. The other kids hated her. The camp director was always yelling and the head waterfront counselor had threatened to drown her if she didn't master the Australian crawl. By the end of the day, the mother was reduced to jelly. Wondering if she should tell the child to hurry and pack her bags, she tremblingly hugged her and kissed her on the cheek. Before she could speak, her daughter was off, running down the camp trail back to her bunk. Over her shoulder, she called, ''when I come back next year, I want to be in Bunk 8!'' 7. Do not bring any treasured possessions from home. You will immediately hear, ''Let me see it, let me see it,'' from his bunkmates, and the next words may regretfully be, ''Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to break it...'' 8. Be sure to wear comfortable, closed-toe shoes. One mother wearing high-heeled pumps speared as much grass and litter with her stiletto spikes as an overzealous sanitation worker in Central Park. One father, all decked out in new, imported sandals, spent half the car ride home picking gravel and tar off the soles of his feet. 9. Do not leave the camp grounds, especially if you're not familiar with the territory. At one camp in Massachusetts, picnic lunches were offered to campers and their families. A 12-year-old boy invited his folks to eat with him at a ''special place'' he had discovered in the woods. ''Look at the grass,'' he told them, ''it's so warm and moss-like.'' They spread his jelly-roll blanket down on the ground and rubbed their hands on the soft, furry surface. Lunch was eaten and while everyone was relaxing, the head counselor appeared. ''Hi,'' he said, and then he paused nervously. They could tell bad news was coming. ''I hate to tell you this,'' he fidgeted, ''but you're sitting on top of the camp cesspool.'' 10. At departure time, don't be surprised if, having seen what all the other parents brought their children, your child has made a new list of ''must-haves'' for you to send by mail. 11. Make your goodbyes short. Nobody likes to pry his own kid's fingers off the car fender, or shut the car door on a forlorn face. One family drove three miles before they discovered what the ''extra weight'' was in the trunk. Your best bet is to leave a half-hour before Visiting Day concludes, so you and your kids aren't stimulated by the tearful separations around you. Besides, by leaving early you'll beat the other parents back to the city and have more time to enjoy your remaining weeks alone! --------------------------------------------------------------------- Susan J.

Information:  - The UK Singles Chart (currently entitled Official Singles Chart) is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC), on behalf of the British record industry, listing the top-selling singles in the United Kingdom, based upon physical sales, paid-for downloads and streaming. To be eligible for the chart, a single is currently defined by the Official Charts Company (OCC) as either a 'single bundle' having no more than four tracks and not lasting longer than 25 minutes or one digital audio track not longer than 15 minutes with a minimum sale price of 40 pence. The rules have changed many times as technology has developed, the most notable being the inclusion of digital downloads in 2005 and streaming in 2014.  - The Official Charts Company (previously known as the Chart Information Network (CIN) The Official UK Charts Company and also referred to Official Charts) is a British inter-professional organisation that compiles various \\"official\\" record charts in the United Kingdom, including the UK Singles Chart, the UK Albums Chart, the UK Singles Downloads Chart and the UK Album Downloads Chart, as well as genre-specific and music video charts. The OCC produces its charts by gathering and combining sales data from retailers through market researchers Millward Brown, and claims to cover 99% of the singles market and 95% of the album market, and aims to collect data from any retailer who sells more than 100 chart items per week.  - Rough Trade Records is an independent record label based in London, England. It was formed in 1978 by Geoff Travis who had opened a record store off Ladbroke Grove. Having successfully promoted and sold records by punk, very early indie pop and early post-punk bands such as The Smiths and Desperate Bicycles, Travis began to manage acts and distribute bands such as Scritti Politti and began the label, which was informed by left-wing politics and structured as a co-operative. Soon after, Rough Trade also set up a distribution arm that serviced independent retail outlets across Britain, a network that became known as the Cartel.  - New Musical Express (NME) is a British music journalism magazine published since 1952. It was the first British paper to include a singles chart, in the edition of 14 November 1952. In the 1970s it became the best-selling British music newspaper. During the period 1972 to 1976, it was particularly associated with gonzo journalism, then became closely associated with punk rock through the writings of Julie Burchill, Paul Morley and Tony Parsons. It started as a music newspaper, and gradually moved toward a magazine format during the 1980s and 1990s, changing from newsprint in 1998.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe.

Daniel Willingham: The false promise of brain game apps Who wouldn’t like to be smarter? According to several software companies, it’s not that hard. Just load their apps on your phone and play them regularly. The games challenge your memory and attention and thereby strengthen the mind, just like exercise strengthens a muscle — or so they promise. A new review of the evidence, however, concludes they don’t work. Here’s the basic premise: When you practice something (say, math), you not only improve on the task, you improve on more general mental abilities. This was how educators used to justify having students study Latin. Sure, the language is dead, but studying it will improve memory and make kids think more logically. But when researchers put this idea to the test, they found it didn’t work. While practice makes you better at the specific task, it doesn’t improve a broader mental ability. In a dramatic example from the 1970s, a few students practiced remembering strings of random digits. They got to be very good, remembering upwards of 70 digits at a crack. But when asked to remember letters, they could remember fewer than 10, about the same as before training. Practice improved only the specific task, not more general mental abilities. In 2008, a new experiment cast doubt on this conclusion. Researchers at the University of Michigan trained subjects on a working memory task. Working memory refers to your ability to juggle information in your mind, as when you try to calculate 36 x 16 in your head. The researchers found that people who practiced working memory tasks were better at other working memory tasks. A fist full of diodes: 'Westworld' comes to HBO That tantalizing study hinted that perhaps researchers had been too hasty in concluding we can’t train the brain. A steady stream of research followed, with many studies seemingly supporting brain training, but some — especially those done with extra care — casting doubt on the findings. The stream of research ran parallel with a torrent of commercial brain games making big promises. Did they overpromise? A new review of 375 scientific studies, conducted by a team of seven researchers unaffiliated with any of the companies, concluded there’s no evidence brain games work. Crucially, many of the reviewed studies failed to account for the placebo effect. That’s where people feel less pain after taking a sugar pill; the mere expectation of relief provides some relief. The same thing happens with brain training. When people know that the games they are playing are supposed to make them smarter, they do a little better on the final test — but only because they focus attention and try a little harder, not because they have gotten smarter. A study published earlier this year offered a dramatic example of this placebo effect. Researchers posted fliers around a college campus. All the fliers offered a chance to participate in a research study, but some listed the subject as “Brain Training & Cognitive Enhancement,” whereas others didn’t mention the purpose. Everyone played brain games for an hour, too short for any possible benefit. Yet the people who thought they were in a study of brain training showed improvement at the end of the hour. The people who had completed identical training but did not expect to improve didn’t. Mandated train control tech could've stopped NJ Transit wreck This was the fatal flaw of most experiments: They didn’t account for people’s expectations. In the few studies done the right way (or close to it), the researchers found that people always get better at the task they practice and sometimes get somewhat better at similar tasks. But there’s no evidence of an across-the-board increase in smarts from brain games. So what should you tell your elderly father who worries that he’s thinking a little slower? Staying mentally active is always a good idea, and if they enjoy the games, playing them can’t hurt. But simple tasks that make you smarter remain a hope, not a reality. Willingham is a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. The basic premise of brain game apps is that practicing specific tasks will improve general mental abilities. 2. Previous research has shown that practicing specific tasks only improves that task, and not broader mental abilities. 3.

He defeated Peter Gruenstein with 62.5% of the vote in 1988 and then faced John Devens, the Mayor of Valdez, Alaska, in 1990 and 1992. Young defeated him by 99,003 votes (51.66%) to 91,677 (47.84%) in 1990 and then faced a serious challenge in 1992. He was challenged in the Republican primary by State Senator Virginia M. Collins and defeated her by 24,869 votes (52.98%) to 19,774 (42.12%). In the general election, he was re-elected against Devens by 111,849 votes (46.78%) to 102,378 (42.82%). This is both the lowest winning percentage of his career and the only time he has won without a majority of the vote. Did more people vote in the 1984 general election or the 1992 general election?","output":"To find out if more people voted in the 1984 general election or the 1992 general election, we need to compare the total number of votes cast in both elections. In the 1984 general election, the total votes were 113,582 (55.02%) for the winner and 86,052 (41.68%) for Pegge Begich, which sums up to: 113,582 + 86,052 = 199,634 votes. In the 1992 general election, the total votes were 111,849 (46.78%) for the winner and 102,378 (42.82%) for John Devens, which sums up to: 111,849 + 102,378 = 214,227 votes. Comparing the total votes in both elections, we see that the total number of votes in the 1992 general election (214,227) is higher than the total number of votes in the 1984 general election (199,634). Therefore, more people voted in the 1992 general election."},{"instruction":"Q: Given a sentence in Bulgarian, generate a new Bulgarian sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the process that involves sweat changing into a gas, heat being drawn from the sweat, and the body being cooled through the process of evaporation is known as sweating and the ensuing evaporation. This process plays a significant role in thermoregulation, ensuring that our body maintains a stable internal temperature. To fully understand the entire process, let's break it down into individual steps: 1. Production of sweat: The process begins with the production of sweat by sweat glands, primarily eccrine glands, which are distributed all over the body. Sweat glands are stimulated by the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for regulating body temperature, particularly when the body's internal temperature begins to rise (due to external factors like heat, exercise, or fever). The sympathetic nervous system activates the sweat glands to produce sweat, which is mostly composed of water, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and chloride), and trace amounts of other compounds such as lactate and urea.  2. Secretion of sweat: Once produced, the sweat is secreted onto the surface of the skin. At this point, sweat is in its liquid form and is capable of absorbing excess heat from the body. The secretion of sweat is a continuous process as the body attempts to maintain a constant internal temperature, and the rate of sweating can be influenced by various factors such as humidity, air movement, level of physical activity, and individual differences. 3. Evaporation of sweat: The first step explicitly asked for in the question refers to the actual process of the sweat evaporating from the surface of the skin. The liquid sweat comes into contact with the surrounding air and turns into a gas through endothermic evaporation, a physical process that requires heat. The heat necessary for this process is drawn from the body and absorbed by the sweat, thus cooling the body down. 4. Cooling effect: As heat is drawn from the body into the evaporating sweat, this lowers the overall body temperature, leading to a sensation of cooling. The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body, further contributing to the cooling effect. In summary, the first step of the process, as requested in the question, is the evaporation of sweat from the body's surface. This step is part of a broader process that begins with the production and secretion of sweat by the sweat glands, followed by the evaporation of sweat and the cooling effect it has on the body, all of which work together to maintain an ideal internal body temperature."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Rabbits that are not spayed or neutered are far more likely to become aggressive when they become mature, usually around 3-9 months of age. Getting your rabbit spayed or neutered could drastically improve its behavioral issues. Some rabbit owners might think that breeding their female rabbit will have the same effect on her behavior as having her spayed. This isn’t true. Breeding your female rabbit isn’t an alternative to having her spayed. Any change that might appear in her behavior while she’s pregnant is only temporary, and those aggressive traits will reappear after she has given birth. Aggression or viciousness might come about as a response to being in pain or being ill, so if your bunny shows this type of behavior—especially if it is sudden—make sure you get it to the vet to make sure it isn’t suffering from any kind of ailment or injury.  At the vet, make sure you ask about your bunny’s overall health. Ask about ways you might work to correct the bad behavior, and see if your vet has any suggestions or advice pertaining to your particular rabbit. If the vet says anything you aren’t clear about, ask questions, and get the information you need. You can do a quick check of your own at home before seeing a vet. Some signs of sickness might be runny eyes or nose, a spike in or lowering of body temperature (best felt through touching their ears), or even a loss of appetite. Any of these could be signs of a problem, so take your bunny to the vet if it displays any or some combination of them. Avoid trying to pull your rabbit out of his cage. Don’t take out its toys, food bowls, or anything else from its cage while it’s in it. Wait until it isn’t in its cage to clean it. If your rabbit bites you when you are reaching into its cage, it is likely being protective. The best thing to do when reaching into your rabbit’s cage is to reach in just to pet it. Give your rabbit a little affectionate rub each time you reach in. Then, your rabbit will eventually learn that the hand reaching into the cage isn’t a threat, but rather something positive.

Information:  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - No Policy is the only studio release by the American hardcore punk band State of Alert, the first band to be fronted by Henry Rollins. It was released on 7-inch vinyl in March 1981 through Dischord Records (No. 2). Since Dischord was tied up in releasing Minor Threat's debut EP, the production of \\"No Policy\\" was funded entirely by Rollins.  - Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label specializing in the independent punk rock music of the D.C.-area music scene. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release \\"Minor Disturbance\\" by The Teen Idles. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.  - Straight edge (sometimes abbreviated sXe or signified XXX or X) is a subculture of hardcore punk whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco and other recreational drugs, in reaction to the excesses of punk subculture. For some, this extends to refraining from engaging in promiscuous sex, following a vegetarian or vegan diet, and/or not using caffeine or prescription drugs. The term \\"straight edge\\" was adopted from the 1981 song \\"Straight Edge\\" by the hardcore punk band Minor Threat.  - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network.  - The Teen Idles were an American hardcore punk band formed in Washington, D.C. in September 1979. Consisting of teenagers Nathan Strejcek, Geordie Grindle, Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, the Idles' recorded two demo sessions and the 1980 \\"Minor Disturbance\\" EP before they broke up in November 1980. The influential independent record label Dischord Records was originally created with the sole purpose of releasing the Teen Idles 7\\" record. They were an early landmark in the D.C. hardcore movement, and MacKaye and Nelson would later form the seminal punk outfit Minor Threat.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - State of Alert (often abbreviated to S.O.A.) was an American hardcore punk group formed in Washington, D.C. in October 1980, and disbanded in July 1981. The group was formed after the members' of previous group, The Extorts, lost its vocalist Lyle Preslar and hired Henry Rollins, then known by his birth name Henry Garfield.   - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.  - Henry Rollins (born Henry Lawrence Garfield; February 13, 1961) is an American musician, actor, writer, television and radio host, and comedian.

The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - String instruments, stringed instruments, or chordophones are musical instruments that produce sound from vibrating strings when the performer plays or sounds the strings in some manner.   - Minor Disturbance is the only studio release by the American hardcore punk band The Teen Idles.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The majority of blisters will heal naturally, without the need to be drained. This is because the unbroken skin covering the blister forms a protective shield which prevents infection. After a couple of days, the body will reabsorb the fluid inside the blister (known as serum) and the blister will disappear. This is the best option if the blister is not causing you any pain, as it minimizes the risk of infection.  If the blister is on your hand or somewhere it will not be exposed to further friction, you can leave it uncovered as the air will help it to heal. If it is on your foot, you may want to cover it with a gauze or moleskin pad, which will protect the blister but also allow it to breathe. If the blister bursts on its own, allow the fluid to drain, clean the area well, then cover in a dry, sterile bandage until it heals. This will heal to prevent infection. Although doctors recommend that you avoid bursting a blister if at all possible, in some scenarios it is necessary to drain a blister, especially if is causing a lot of pain or pressure. For instance, competitive runners may need to drain a large blister on the sole of their foot if they have a race coming up. If you need to drain a blister, it is very important that you follow the correct procedure in order to avoid infection. The first thing you need to do is clean the skin on and around the blister using warm water and soap. Any soap will do, but antibacterial soap is best. This will help to remove any sweat or dirt from the area before you proceed with the draining. Take a clean, sharp needle and sterilize it using one of the following methods: wipe it down with some rubbing alcohol; scald it with boiling water; hold it over an open flame until it glows orange. Use the sterilized needle to puncture the blister in several spots around the edges. Use a clean piece of gauze or tissue to gently compress the blister, allowing the fluid to drain. Do not remove the loose skin covering the blister, as this will help to protect it. Once all of the fluid has drained, dab a little antibacterial ointment or cream on the blister. Any over-the-counter antibacterial product will do, like Neosporin, Polymyxin B or Bacitracin. The ointment will help to kill any bacteria around the blister and fight off infection, while also preventing the bandage from sticking to the loose skin. After you have applied the ointment, cover the drained blister with some gauze padding or a gel-based plaster. These will prevent any dirt or bacteria from entering the open blister, and also provide some comfort when walking or running if the blister is on the foot. You should apply a new plaster every day, especially if the existing plaster becomes wet or dirty. After two or three days, remove the bandage and use sterilized scissors to cut away any loose, dead skin. Don't attempt to peel away any skin that is still attached, however. Clean the area again, apply more ointment and cover with a clean bandage. The blister should be completely healed within three to seven days. In some cases, an infection will develop despite your best efforts to avoid one. If this is the case, you should see your doctor immediately. S/he may prescribe a strong topical antibiotic or an oral antibiotic to clear the infection. Signs of infection include skin redness and swelling around the blister, a build-up of pus, red streaks on the skin and fever. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how blisters heal naturally and how to take care of them. It explains that most blisters don't need to be drained because the skin protects them from infection, and our bodies will reabsorb the fluid inside. If a blister is not painful, it is best to leave it alone and let it heal.

Q:Information:  - GTM Cars is a component kit car manufacturer located in Kingswinford, UK.  - A kit car, also known as a component car, is an automobile that is available as a set of parts that a manufacturer sells and the buyer then assembles into a functioning car. Usually, many of the major mechanical systems such as the engine and transmission are sourced from donor vehicles or purchased new from other vendors. Kits vary in completeness, consisting of as little as a book of plans, or as much as a complete set with all components included.  - An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy. Heat engines burn a fuel to create heat, which then creates a force. Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion; pneumatic motors use compressed air and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy. In biological systems, molecular motors, like myosins in muscles, use chemical energy to create forces and eventually motion.  - Kingswinford is a suburban area of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, in the West Midlands, England.

The premise and the hypothesis are related to different subjects and do not have a clear logical connection. To analyze the premise and hypothesis, let's break them down: Premise: Cpk values (Process Capability Indices) have an additive effect on various individual parts when each part is integrated into the final product. This statement is related to the field of process and quality control in manufacturing, specifically how Cpk values help assess the capability of a manufacturing process to achieve desired quality levels for each individual part. The higher the Cpk value, the better the quality performance of the process in question. Hypothesis: Many of these products are sold in department stores. This statement is related to the retail and marketing aspect of products, and it concerns the sales and distribution channels through which the products are made available to consumers, such as department stores. Although both the premise and hypothesis involve products, their connection to each other is not evident or logically sound. The premise is primarily concerned with the manufacturing process and quality control, while the hypothesis deals with sales and distribution.  Ultimately, the sale of products in department stores typically depends on factors separate from the manufacturing process and Cpk values, such as market demand, branding, pricing, and a variety of other factors that influence consumer behavior. If the premise is true, it might imply that the final product has a higher level of quality. However, a connection between the manufacturing process's Cpk values and the sales of the product in a specific retail outlet like a department store cannot be established with certainty based solely on the premise's truth. In conclusion, the truth of the premise does not guarantee nor provide sufficient evidence for the truth of the hypothesis. The two statements concern different aspects of a product's lifecycle and do not hold a direct logical connection that would allow one to derive the latter's truth from the former."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This year thee comets would be of interest, comet A, comet B, and comet C. Comet A and comet B would enter the inner solar system. But comet C would not enter the inner solar system. Moreover, comet A is categorized as a bright comet, but comet B is categorized as a faint comet.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which comet's dust would not reflect sunlight, comet A or comet C?  Hint: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, comet C would not enter the inner solar system. Since a comet tail and coma only become visible when a comet is illuminated by the Sun as it passes through the inner Solar System, comet C's dust would not have the chance to reflect sunlight.

Use the formula P=4x{displaystyle P=4x} to find the perimeter of a square. Find the perimeter given other information.","output":"Title: Understanding the Perimeter of a Rectangle and a Square: Formulas and Applications Introduction: Geometry plays a significant role in our daily lives, from designing artistic patterns to planning construction projects. At the core of these applications lie fundamental geometrical shapes such as rectangles and squares. Understanding the properties and formulas related to these shapes is crucial for practical applications. In this article, we will discuss how to set up the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, use the perimeter formula to find the perimeter of a square, and explore ways to find the perimeter given other information. Setting up the Formula for the Perimeter of a Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles and opposite sides equal in length. The two dimensions of a rectangle are referred to as its width (w) and height (h), also known as its length (l). The perimeter of any geometrical shape is defined as the total distance around the shape. For a rectangle, we can calculate the perimeter by adding the lengths of all four sides. To set up the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, we first consider its dimensions (width and height). Mathematically, we can write the formula as: P = 2w + 2h Where: P = Perimeter of the rectangle w = Width of the rectangle h = Height (or length) of the rectangle Alternatively, the formula can be written as: P = 2(w + h) In this form, it emphasizes that we sum the width and height and then multiply by 2. Using the Formula to Find the Perimeter of a Square: A square is a special type of rectangle where all four sides are equal in length. Therefore, the width and the height of a square are both equal to its side length (s). To find the perimeter of a square, we can use the perimeter formula for a rectangle. Using the alternative form of the rectangle's perimeter formula (P = 2(w + h)), we can substitute w and h with s, the side length of the square. This results in the formula: P = 2s + 2s Simplifying this formula, we get: P = 4s Where: P = Perimeter of the square s = Side length of the square Finding the Perimeter Given Other Information: There may be cases where we are provided with different sets of information and are required to find the perimeter. For example, we may be given the area of a rectangle, and one of its side lengths, but not the other side. In such a case, we can leverage existing knowledge of the shape's properties to find the missing information. For instance, the area of a rectangle is given by: Area = w × h If we know the area and one of the sides (either width or height), we can solve for the other side using the formula. Once both dimensions are established, we can plug in the values into the perimeter formula (P = 2w + 2h) to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. Conclusion: Geometry and its formulas are essential tools for understanding and manipulating the world around us. The perimeter of a rectangle (P = 2w + 2h) and a square (P = 4s) serve as crucial parameters in a myriad of applications in design, construction, and various other fields. By gaining a deeper understanding of these formulas, we can enhance our ability to work with geometrical shapes and solve real-world problems."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

They are classified into different categories based on their temperature, mass, and brightness. Stars' temperature and brightness are related: hotter stars tend to be brighter, and cooler stars are generally less bright. The cooler stars are less bright because they have lower temperatures and emit less energy. The question states that a main sequence star that is very bright is not among the coolest stars, which implies that in order to be very bright, the star must have a higher temperature than the coolest stars in the main sequence. This is because the emitted energy (brightness) is directly related to the temperature of the star. So, higher temperature stars will be brighter than cooler stars in the main sequence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hypothesis: Gordon Campbell is also a retired NHL player.","output":"Based on the given context, we cannot draw the hypothesis that Gordon Campbell is also a retired NHL (National Hockey League) player. The context provided does not contain any information about Gordon Campbell's past or current career in professional hockey. Gordon Campbell is referred to as the 'premier of British Columbia, Canada,' in this context, implying that he is a political figure, but no evidence points to him having been a professional hockey player. In real-world information, Gordon Campbell was a Canadian diplomat and politician who was the 34th Premier of British Columbia from 2001 to 2011. He also served as the Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Europe from 2011 to 2016. However, no public records exist of him being a professional hockey player in the NHL or any other league. The hypothesis could only be confirmed if there were information available in the context to support it. For example, if the context had mentioned something like, \\"Gordon Campbell, after retiring from his career as an NHL player, went on to become the Premier of British Columbia, Canada,\\" we could confirm the hypothesis. However, as is, it remains unsupported because it lacks evidence in the given text. So, for accurate interpretation or hypotheses, the existing context is critically important. Without any references to Gordon Campbell being an NHL player, we can not confirm or even suggest that he could be a retired NHL player. Please note, in the general context, hypotheses ought to be formulated based on the information available or perceived from the context. Formulating a hypothesis with no foundational support from the context might lead to inaccurate assumptions or interpretations. For correct inference, ensuring context relevancy is crucial.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"To analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let us first provide a clear definition of entailment. In the context of logic and argumentation, entailment refers to a relationship between statements, such that if the premises are true, the conclusion (or hypothesis) must also be true. In other words, it is a logically necessary consequence of the premises. Now, let us examine the given statements - the premise and the hypothesis: 1. Premise: People often dropped by asking to run a few plays. 2. Hypothesis: Nobody dropped by asking to run plays. The premise states that it is a common occurrence for people to drop by and ask to run a few plays. This implies that there have been instances where individuals made such requests. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that there have been no instances where someone dropped by asking to run plays. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is contradictory rather than entailment. This is because the premise suggests that people do frequently make requests to run plays, while the hypothesis states the opposite – that there are no instances of people making such requests. Thus, based on an analysis of the statements, we can conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In fact, if the premise (statement 1) were true, it would directly contradict the hypothesis (statement 2), making it false. Entailment requires that the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion, which is not the case here."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

Like at least one other reviewer, I was, on numerous occasions, laughing out loud. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-aware, explorative. Don't expect Bergman here. This movie is about a youth in the early- to mid-60s in Sweden and about the issues, read *contradictions*, that the nation and the world were facing. At times Yellow appears to be an earnest social-political documentary, with Lena, the main character, and others interviewing both common people and politicians (e.g. Olaf Palme at home). At other times, Yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary. All the while, Yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring Lena's life - her home life, her loves, her political views, her view of herself. She is a complete person  complex, flawed, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director, Sjöman, and his crew documenting themselves documenting Lena. It is this that, for me, really gives Yellow wings. Not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways, reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice, but their presence is itself another layer of the film; they are filming themselves filming themselves. I am reminded of a Bjork music video with this same quality  a music video about the making of a music video, ad infinitum, with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish.

In 1688, the Spanish sent three more expeditions, two by sea and one by land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, Juan Bautista Chapa, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location. In early 1689, Spanish authorities received a plea, written in French. Jumano scouts had received these papers from the Caddo, who asked that they be delivered to the Spanish. The papers included a parchment painting of a ship, as well as a written message from Jean L'Archevêque. The message read: I do not know what sort of people you are.

Step 1: Define \\"cuddle\\" Cuddle is a verb, meaning to hold someone or something close in one's arms in a loving, comforting, or affectionate way. Step 2: Analyze the context of \\"cuddle\\" in the first sentence In the first sentence, \\"I'm cold; can you roll over here and cuddle me, honey?\\", the speaker is asking another person to hold them close in a loving and comforting way to keep them warm. The context implies affection and warmth between the two individuals, likely in a romantic relationship.

Step 4: Compare the two contexts By comparing the two contexts, we can see that the word \\"cuddle\\" is used in a similar way in both sentences, as it involves holding someone close in a comforting and affectionate manner. The primary difference is the relationship between the individuals involved in cuddling – a romantic relationship in the first sentence and a caregiver-infant relationship in the second sentence.

Summarize this article: Simultaneous solitaire is a type of double solitaire that allows for as many players as possible. Make sure that each deck is different and distinguishable from the others to avoid confusion. Remove the 2 jokers from each deck. It's important to make sure that every player properly shuffles their deck. If not, 1 player could have a massive advantage over the others. To shuffle, you can spread all the cards from a deck out on a table faced down. Mix them up with your hands and assemble them back into a pile when you're finished. Don't mix more than 1 deck at a time in a single area. If you're spreading the cards out, it's very easy for them to get mixed together. Simultaneous solitaire is played by everyone at once and revolves around speed. To ensure that the game is as fair as possible, use a whistle or a clap to announce the start of play. Players must place lower numbered black cards beneath higher numbered red cards and vice versa. With your stock pile facing down, flip the top card on the deck. Look at the card and look at the tableau and assess your options. You must place the cards in alternating colors in descending numerical order. You can only place cards in descending numerical order on top of each other. You cannot place a black 8 above a red 7. However, if you have a red 7 in your stock pile and a black 8 on the tableau, you can place the red 7 below the black 8.  For example, a jack of diamonds or hearts can only be placed below a queen of spades or clubs. You can send cards that you can't place from the stock pile to the discard pile. You can take cards from the piles in the tableau and place them beneath other piles. If pile 1 has a 10 of clubs and pile 5 has a jack of hearts, place the 10 of clubs below the jack of hearts in pile 5. Flip the last card in pile 1 upwards after you've moved the 10.  As the game goes on, you'll be using the tableau more and more. You will also need to move the cards on the tableau so you can access the face down cards in the piles. It's customary in solitaire to place all the aces in their own section of the playing area. To finish a pile, you need to place all of the 12 cards of each suit on top of their ace. For example, you have an ace of spades off to the side and you find the 2 of spades. Place the 2 on top of the ace. Do the same when you find the 3 of spades and so on. The winner is the first person to complete all 4 piles. If nobody is able to finish the game, the winner is the person with the most piles completed.  A completed pile consists of 13 cards from ace to king in the same suit. You can keep playing after the winner finishes to find out who comes second, third, fourth, and so on. Summary:","output":"Simultaneous solitaire is a multi-player, speed-based game where each player uses a distinguishable deck with jokers removed. Players need to properly shuffle their decks to avoid imbalances. The game starts with a signal, such as a whistle or clap, and players aim to place cards in alternating colors and descending numerical order. Aces are placed in their own section and the goal is to complete piles with 13 cards of the same suit, from ace to king. The winner is the first to complete all four piles or the one with the most piles completed if no one finishes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  An antidote to cure vampirism.  for the following movie plot:  Three strangers--Thomas, Marc, and Brigitte--are coming to cure four sisters (for want of names, I shall call them Catherine, Nicole, Sylvie, and Marie) of their vampirism. Legend has it that vampire hunters ran a sword through Catherine's heart during the reign of Louis XV, and villagers raped Nicole and blinded Sylvie with a pitchfork. But they neglected to cut off their heads, and so the sisters survived. Today, they live on a manor, surrounded by crosses and protected from the villagers. Thomas, Marc, and Brigitte don't buy the legend. They think the sisters are simply humans who have been driven mad by years of persecution and villagers who think of them as monsters. Curing them will require only dispelling the sisters' belief that they are vampires. The first step is to burn all the crosses around the house. Catherine succumbs to Thomas' promise to cure her, but Marie feels that this is a betrayal and that Catherine must die to protect the other three. Catherine and Marie stage a sword fight, but it is Marie who gets stabbed. The next morning, Catherine goes off with Thomas to see if she can get over her fear of sunlight (she can't).With the crosses removed from around the house the sisters are free to roam. This causes fear among the villagers, and they gang up to search for and kill the sisters. When Nicole goes wandering in the village, the villagers get her. They also kill Brigitte, who happened to be standing nearby. The villagers then storm the manor. Sylvie is wounded. Thomas tells Catherine that he doesn't think she is a monster and asks for 'the kiss of the vampire.' Catherine obliges. When Thomas comes to, he has been turned into a vampire. So the legend was true! To escape the angry villagers, Catherine takes Thomas through a secret passage leading to the beach. Marc follows and, knowing that Thomas is now a vampire, he shoots both Thomas and Catherine, leaving their dead bodies on the beach.As the lord of the manor checks the dead bodies of Thomas and Catherine, he is surrounded by a group...

People thought that poetry was the new rock 'n' roll. However, despite the brief popularity of a few pop poets, poetry and pop music didn't seem to mix. But are they really so different? If you look back at the origins of poetry, there is a strong connection between poems and popular music. In Greek mythology, for example, the muse   Erato is pictured with a lyre   in her hand, and looks just like the ancestor of the modern rock star with his electric guitar. In addition, the poets Shelley and Byron were as famous in the nineteenth century as the pop stars of today. But despite their common origins, there are many differences between poetry and pop music. Pop songs are always written for a public performance, whereas poetry often isn't. And the lyrics in pop songs sometimes have less rhythm than those in poetry. This is because the music provides the rhythm rather than the words. Pop lyrics are also simpler and often keep on saying the same thing. This repetition works well in a performance and means that pop songs are easier for people to sing and learn by heart. Both songs and poems tell a story or talk about feelings. Songs in particular deal with the different stages in a relationship, such as falling in love or breaking up. The words and ideas in songs are usually easier to understand than those in \\"serious\\" poetry. However, talented performers like Paul McCartney, or newer stars like Robbe Williams, often give simple songs more expression when they perform them. And some of the best lines from pop lyrics are as beautiful as poetry. So although pop music and poetry have many differences, they do have one important thing in common: the power to make us think about how we feel.","output":"Which of the following statements is NOT true about the relationship between poetry and pop music?

Mountains are formed through various geological processes such as tectonic plate movements, volcanic activity, or erosion, making them a natural fit for a type of hill. Let me expand on the other options as well: - Flat land: This option is not in line with the answer because flat land, as its name suggests, is characterized by an even terrain with little to no elevation. Hills, on the other hand, are known to have a higher elevation compared to their surroundings and feature a distinct slope. - Pool: A pool is a body of water, either natural or man-made, and therefore doesn't qualify as a type of hill. It is more related to water bodies like ponds, lakes, and reservoirs. - Valley: A valley is a low area between hills or mountains, which can be formed through the erosion of the surrounding land by rivers or glaciers, or simply due to the movement of the Earth’s crust. Valleys generally have a lower elevation than hills or mountains, so this option isn't a suitable answer for the question. - Flat ground: Similar to flat land, flat ground is characterized by its evenness and lack of significant elevation. It is more associated with plains and plateaus, rather than hills, which typically have a higher elevation and a sloping terrain.

Answer the following question: Two women have just undergone different types of mutations without them being aware of it. Kim has just had a mutation in the DNA of her sex cells. Holly has had a mutation in her body cells. Both mutations would be able to be discovered if they happen to go to a doctor, and the doctor knows to look for it, but that is unlikely since the women are unaware these changes happened.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Whose mutation is less likely to cause cancer?  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Answer:","output":"Kim's mutation is less likely to cause cancer. This is because her mutation occurred in the DNA of her sex cells (germline mutation), which does not directly affect her body cells' functions. While a germline mutation can be passed on to her offspring and potentially cause a hereditary disease in the next generation, it does not typically lead to cancer in the individual with the mutation. On the other hand, Holly's mutation occurred in her body cells (somatic mutation). Somatic mutations can directly impact the functions of the body cells and potentially lead to serious medical conditions, such as cancer, if the mutated gene is involved in cell growth regulation or other crucial cellular processes. Since Holly's mutation affects her body cells that can proliferate and pass the mutation to their descendants, the likelihood of cancer development is higher in her case compared to Kim."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mayor Marion Barry was arrested July 4 and charged with stalking, police said. On July 4, the U.S. Park Police arrested Barry and charged him with misdemeanor stalking. About 8:45 p.m. in Anacostia Park, a Washington woman flagged down a Park Police officer on patrol and pointed to Barry, who was in another car. The woman said Barry was stalking her, Park Police spokesman Sgt. David Schlosser said. Barry was taken into custody, processed and released, but he must make a court appearance for the charge. A court date has not been set. Barry's other run-ins with the law have included a federal sting operation in 1990, when he was mayor. Surveillance cameras caught him smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room. Despite his fall from grace, he was re-elected in 1994 to a four-year term as mayor. In his latest political comeback in 2004, Barry won a seat on the D.C. Council, on which he continues to serve. Barry was arrested in 2002 when traces of marijuana and cocaine were found in his car after he was stopped in the Buzzard Point area of Southwest D.C. No charges were filed, and Barry claimed that the drugs were planted. And in 2006, Park Police officers stopped him for driving too slowly, prompting him to accuse authorities of targeting him. Barry had been on probation since 2005 for not filing or paying income taxes for several years. Last year he again failed to file a tax return, and his probation was extended to May 2011, according to the Washington City Paper. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article focuses mainly on the repeated legal issues faced by former D.C. Mayor and current Washington councilman, Marion Barry.  The significant events detailed in the article are as follows: 1. Recent Arrest for Stalking: The article starts by reporting Barry's most recent arrest on July 4, for misdemeanor stalking. A woman in Anacostia Park accused him of stalking her. He was arrested, processed, and released, but is required to appear in court. The date for this court appearance has not yet been set. 2. Historical Legal Troubles: The article provides a brief overview of Barry's history with legal problems. It makes mention of a 1990 federal sting operation where Barry was filmed smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room at a time he was serving as the mayor of D.C. Even after that, he was re-elected as Mayor in 1994, serving a four-year term. 3. Barry's Comebacks: Despite his history with the law and drug use in particular, Barry successfully won a seat on the D.C. Council in 2004, a position he still held at the time of this article. 4. Previous Arrests and Accusations: The article also mentions several other incidents involving Barry. In 2002, he was arrested when traces of marijuana and cocaine were found in his car in the Buzzard Point area, though no charges were filed. Barry implicated that the drugs were planted. In 2006, Park Police stopped him for driving too slowly, which led him to accuse authorities of targeting him specifically. 5. Tax-Related Legal Trouble: Fiscal issues have also caused problems for Barry. His noncompliance in filing and paying his income taxes resulted in a probationary period that began in 2005. The article mentions that Barry failed to file his tax return in the year prior to this report, which caused his probation to be extended to May 2011.

Village Beta was bigger, because their inhabitants already knew about and practiced agriculture.  But I can use this background: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly.  What is an answer for this question: Which village had a more dependable food supply? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, it can be concluded that Village Beta had a more dependable food supply in comparison to Village Alpha.  There are several factors that contribute to this conclusion. First, Village Beta existed 9,000 years ago, which is closer to the time when agriculture was invented (around 10,000 years ago). By this period, the inhabitants of Village Beta had already gained knowledge about and practiced agriculture, which led to a larger and more stable food supply compared to Village Alpha, which was from 11,000 years ago - prior to the invention of agriculture. The practice of agriculture provides several advantages that result in a more dependable food supply. Agriculture allows for the cultivation of crops, which can be grown according to the needs of the population. This contrasts with a reliance on hunting and gathering, as practiced by the inhabitants of Village Alpha, in which the availability of food is subject to the availability and abundance of wild animals and plants. Agriculture also enables individuals to predict and manage their food resources more effectively, as crops can be grown and harvested systematically. Moreover, as mentioned in the background information provided, the advent of agriculture allowed humans to settle in villages and cities for the first time. This suggests that Village Beta was likely a more stable, established community that could more effectively support its population's food needs. Its larger size echoes the fact that agriculture, with its dependable food supply, had a direct impact on population growth due to the presence of more food and the benefits of a settled life. While the higher death rates occurring from crowded living conditions and diseases did affect the population growth, the fact that there was a steady increase in birth rates associated with the dependable food supply indicates the advantage that Village Beta had over Village Alpha in terms of food availability. In summary, the more dependable food supply in Village Beta, resulting from the practice of agriculture, the settled lifestyle, and the larger population size, establishes it as having a more reliable food supply compared to Village Alpha, whose inhabitants did not yet have access to the benefits of agriculture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Seeders are those who continue to share the file after it has been downloaded. The more the seeders there are the faster the download will be. Can we draw the following conclusion? Utorrent does not involve file sharing.","output":"No, we cannot draw the conclusion that \\"uTorrent does not involve file sharing.\\" On the contrary, uTorrent is a BitTorrent client that enables file sharing through the BitTorrent protocol. The BitTorrent protocol relies on peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, allowing users to distribute files, such as movies, music, games, and software, more efficiently and reliably than traditional centralized file-serving methods. When you use uTorrent or any other BitTorrent client to download a file, you are essentially downloading small chunks of the file from multiple sources or peers who have the file (or parts of it) on their computers. These sources are called \\"seeders\\" if they have the complete file and \\"peers\\" when they have a portion of it. After downloading a chunk, your computer simultaneously becomes a source for that chunk, uploading it to other peers who are attempting to download the file. Therefore, uTorrent and similar clients facilitate file sharing by leveraging network connections and resources from users who have the desired file or parts of it. This distributed nature of file sharing in BitTorrent allows for faster downloads, as you are downloading from several peers at once, and improved reliability since it is less reliant on centralized servers. To make uTorrent faster, consider: 1. Updating to the latest version of uTorrent, as newer versions may have performance optimizations and bug fixes. 2. Checking your internet connection speed and ensuring that it is stable and fast enough to support file sharing. 3. Limiting the number of active downloads and uploads to avoid overloading your bandwidth and network resources. 4. Allowing uTorrent through your firewall to ensure that it can establish connections with other peers and seeders. 5. Adjusting the settings of uTorrent, such as setting an appropriate maximum upload and download speed based on your internet connection, enabling protocol encryption to bypass ISP throttling, and configuring port forwarding in your router if necessary. 6. Choosing torrent files with a high number of seeders relative to leechers, as this would mean that the file is widely available and you can download it from multiple sources simultaneously. 7. Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to avoid ISP throttling or any restrictions that may be placed on P2P file sharing by your internet service provider. 8. Maintaining a good seed-to-leech ratio, which means uploading files as much as you download. This not only helps the community and the health of the torrent ecosystem but also could improve your download speeds, as some trackers may prioritize seeders over leechers when allocating resources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Lions from Africa and leopard in a box found in residential area of Bangkok. Pet-shop owner Montri Boonprom-on, 41, arrested and could face prison. Thailand is a hub of the international black market in protected animals.","output":"Title: Bangkok Police Seize African Lions and Boxed Leopard, Arrest Pet-Shop Owner In a shocking incident at a residential area in Bangkok, authorities discovered several African lions and a leopard confined in a box. The seizure followed the arrest of the pet-shop owner, Montri Boonprom-on, 41, who is now facing possible imprisonment for his involvement in the illegal trade of protected animals. As a significant hub of the international black market for protected animals, Thailand has struggled to eliminate this nefarious trade. This recent arrest highlights the persistent problem in the region and raises growing concerns over animal welfare. The investigation began when local residents raised suspicions about the presence of exotic animals in their neighborhood. Police responded promptly and were astonished to find the lions from Africa and a leopard boxed-up in terrible conditions. Many of these animals are protected under international law, which prohibits their sale and trade. Montri Boonprom-on, the pet-shop owner, is now in police custody. If convicted, he could face several years in prison for possessing and trading protected animals. This incident underscores the need for stricter law enforcement and increased vigilance against the illicit animal trade. Thailand's position as a hub in the black market for protected animals has been well documented. The country's porous borders and lax enforcement have made it an attractive transit point for traffickers. This latest incident also highlights the demand for exotic and often illegal pets, which continues to fuel the trade. In response to this steady increase in the illegal wildlife trade, authorities have begun to ramp up efforts to tackle the issue. Steps include stricter border controls, the implementation of tougher penalties for offenders, and the promotion of public awareness campaigns. Animal welfare organizations and activists have frequently called for harsher measures against the perpetrators involved in this black market trade. Many argue that only with severe penalties and diligent enforcement of laws will the illegal animal trade be curtailed. As the plight of the African lions and boxed leopard in Bangkok makes headlines, the crackdown on the illegal wildlife trade will likely experience a renewed sense of urgency. All eyes now turn to the Thai authorities to see how effectively they can address this persistent problem and protect some of the world's most vulnerable species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Where is a tree hugger likely to reside? Options: - forest - rainforest - san francisco - state park - university  The answer is \\"san francisco\\" because Answer:","output":"To determine where a tree hugger is likely to reside, let's analyze each option step-by-step. 1. Forest: A tree hugger is someone who deeply appreciates and wants to preserve nature, particularly trees. While a forest may be an ideal place for a tree hugger to visit and appreciate nature, it is not an ideal place for them to reside due to the lack of human infrastructure, amenities, and other resources for a comfortable life. 2. Rainforest: Similar to the forest, a rainforest would be an attractive destination for a tree hugger to explore and appreciate the dense ecosystem. However, residing in a rainforest would pose significant challenges due to environmental factors like high humidity, heavy rainfall, and a vast number of diverse species, some of which could be dangerous. Additionally, a human presence might disrupt the delicate balance of the rainforest. 3. San Francisco: San Francisco is a city known for its environmentally conscious culture and various green initiatives. This would make it a viable option for a tree hugger to reside in, as they can participate in conservation efforts, engage with like-minded individuals, and have access to city amenities. 4. State Park: While a state park may provide a beautiful natural environment that a tree hugger would appreciate, it is not an optimal place for them to reside due to similar reasons as the forest and rainforest. It is more suited for visits and hikes rather than permanent residence. 5. University: A university is a location where students, faculty, and staff come together to learn and work. While it is not an environment specifically catering to tree huggers, it is possible that a tree hugger might reside in a university if they are pursuing a degree in environmental science or similar fields. However, the university itself would not be the primary reason for their residence. After analyzing each of the options, the answer is \\"San Francisco.\\" Out of the available options, San Francisco provides the best combination of environmental awareness, conservation efforts, and access to amenities and resources for a tree hugger to reside comfortably."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

There he meets his friend, Italian Major Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), a doctor. They go out carousing, but are interrupted by a bombing raid. Frederic and English Red Cross nurse Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes) take shelter in the same place. The somewhat drunk Frederic makes a poor first impression. Rinaldi persuades Frederic to go on a double romantic date with him and two nurses, Catherine and her friend Helen Ferguson (Mary Philips). However, Rinaldi becomes annoyed when Frederic prefers Catherine, the woman the major had chosen for himself. Away by themselves, Frederic learns that she was engaged to a soldier who was killed in battle. In the darkness, he romantically seduces her, over her half-hearted resistance, and is surprised to discover she is a virgin. Their romantic relationship (forbidden by army regulation) is discovered. At Rinaldi's suggestion, Catherine is transferred to Milan. When Frederick is wounded by artillery, he finds himself in the hospital where Catherine now works. They continue their affair until he is sent back to the war. Now pregnant, Catherine runs away to Switzerland, but her many letters to her beloved sweetheart/lover are intercepted by Rinaldi, who feels he needs to rescue his friend from the romantic entanglement.

The Bears visited Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis to play the Rams, again without Jay Cutler. However, the Rams were also without starting quarterback Sam Bradford, and instead had Kellen Clemens as backup. The Bears had won four consecutive games against the Rams. Two rookie players the Bears' defense had to contain were running back Zac Stacy, who recorded an average of 107.7 yards and three touchdowns in the previous three games, along with ranking second among rookie running backs with 537 rushing yards; and receiver Tavon Austin, who recorded 314 yards against the Indianapolis Colts in the previous week. Additionally, the Rams' offense was ranked fourth in the NFL with 54.6 percent of yardage occurring after the catch. For the Bears' offense, Jeff Joniak wrote they needed to avoid attempting to score in the red zone; in the previous three games, the Bears had 12 drives in the red zone, but managed to score only four touchdowns, while also allowing a turnover, and was ranked 13th after scoring 55 percent. Meanwhile, the Rams had forced quarterbacks to record only a 45.8 passer rating when in the red zone, along with the second lowest completion percentage, and the third fewest completions recorded. Also, St. Louis led the league in red zone interceptions with six. Finally, the Rams led the league in overall sack percentage with 9.4, while defensive end Robert Quinn had the most knockdowns and hurries in the NFL, and was second in sacks with 12. An advantage Chicago had, however, was the second-most passing touchdowns in the NFL with 15, while Josh McCown's average gain per pass is higher than Cutler's, with a 7.47 to 7.20. The Rams also did not have the capable secondary to cover the trio of Martellus Bennett, Alshon Jeffery and Brandon Marshall. St. Louis scored first on Austin's 65-yard run, and would reclaim the ball after James Laurinitis stripped Matt Fort&#233;, leading to Stacy's one-yard touchdown run. The Bears would then score on McCown's seven-yard touchdown pass to Bennett, but the Rams ended the quarter with a 21-7 lead after Clemens' six-yard touchdown pass to Jared Cook. In the second quarter, McCown threw an incomplete pass, which appeared to be a fumble, and after Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson picked up the ball, Bears fullback Tony Fiammetta pulled him to the ground by the facemask. Kyle Long would then be involved in an incident with Rams defensive lineman William Hayes, which led to Long kicking Hayes, causing Long's brother Chris Long to restrain Kyle, who would then be penalized for a personal foul. McCown and Fiammetta would also be penalized, for intentional grounding and facemasking, respectively. Halfway through the quarter, Chicago scored after McCown threw a three-yard pass to Marshall, but Greg Zuerlein would score on a 29-yard field goal to give the Rams a 24-14 lead at halftime. The lone score of the third quarter was Zuerlein's 40-yard kick. Early in the fourth quarter, Hester recorded a 62-yard punt return for a touchdown, which was overruled by Craig Steltz's holding penalty. the Bears reached the Rams' one-yard line, but required eight plays: Michael Bush's run went for no gain; McCown's pass to Jeffery was incomplete, but a holding penalty on Brandon McGee gave the Bears a first down; Bush lost two yards on the following run; McCown's touchdown pass to Bennett was nullified by Jermon Bushrod's holding penalty; McCown's 13-yard touchdown pass to Fort&#233; was also nullified, after Fort&#233; failed to break the plane, instead placing the Bears back on the one-yard line; McCown was then sacked by Michael Brockers, but Brockers was penalized for roughing the passer; Bush failed to gain a yard on the next play; the Bears finally scored on the drive on Bush's one-yard run. On the Rams' ensuing drive, Benny Cunningham gained 27 yards, while the offense gained 48 yards from Clemens' 19 and 29 yards passes to Chris Givens and Cook, respectively. Four plays later, Cunningham scored on a nine-yard run, while Isaiah Pead scored on the two-point conversion. Devin Hester would fumble on the following kickoff, but recovered at the Bears' ten-yard line. After the Bears' offense reached their own 39-yard line, Quinn stripped McCown, and scored on the following fumble return. The game marked the third time the Bears allowed 40 points during the season for the first time since 1964. McCown set the team record for most completions with 36, two greater than Jim Miller's and Brian Griese's 34 set on November 14, 1999 and September 30, 2007, respectively.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What is a kestrel?\\" is in \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Question: Article: Henderson Island is a coral island raised above the South Pacific Ocean, No people live on it. The island is 9. 6 km long and 5. 1 km wide. It has an area of 37, 3 square kilometers. It became a World Heritage Site in 1988 because of its bird life.     All the four kinds of special land birds can only be seen on Henderson Island. There are also fifteen non-local seabirds. Other local things include nine kinds of plants, four kinds of land snails, and one butterfly. Although no people live on the island, archaeological   evidence suggests that a small Polynesian group lived here between the 12th and 15th centuries until it disappeared. The reasons for its disappearance are unknown, but are probably related to the similar disappearance of the Polynesians on Pitcairn Island. Then Hendersonians would have depended on them for many of the basics of life.     On January 29* 1606, Henderson Island was discovered by Portuguese sailor Pedro Fermandes, who named it San Joao Baptista. On January 17, 1819, the island was rediscovered by British Captain Henderson, who named it Henderson Island. On March 2* 1819* Captain Henry King, sailing on the Elizabeth, landed on the island to find the Union flag already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship on a tree, and for some years the name of the island was Elizabeth or Henderson. In the early 1980's, American businessman Arthur expressed interest in buying Henderson Island, and establishing a small settlement with an airport, farm and large houses. But the British government refused it at last* after environmentalist groups persuaded them to protect the natural ecology and environment of the island which became a World Heritage Site later. Question: Who gave the Henderson Island its present name? Yes or no, is the answer \\"A British captain.\\"?

Around 100 complaints had come into the BBC 24 hours after it went out, with numbers rising on Tuesday. The BBC said: \\"We take audibility seriously and we will look at the sound levels on the programme in time for the next episode.\\" The drama stars Sam Riley as an officer working simultaneously with the Nazis and the British Resistance. Some viewers took to Twitter to air their views on the sound levels. One user Luanne wrote: \\"I am 12 minutes into SS-GB & I'm turning on the subtitles. All this tough guy, breathy, growling, mumbling, I can't understand you!\\" TV critic Emma Bullimore told the BBC: \\"We are living in astonishingly ambitious times for TV drama, attracting world class talent to the small screen, and sometimes this means the basics of storytelling get slightly overlooked - either in terms of audibility or making a story too complicated or difficult to follow (as Sherlock was criticised for). \\"However, it does feel that mumbling is the latest bandwagon for BBC bashers to jump on and the odd muffled word gets spun into a story. Actually, my enjoyment of SS-GB wasn't marred by sound issues.\\" It's not the first time the issue of mumbling on TV dramas has been raised, with past programmes such as Jamaica Inn and Happy Valley having hit the headlines over the audio.

Leo Kelion, technology desk editor As televisions get thinner, their makers have less space to build in speakers unless they opt to add sound equipment to the sides and/or below the screens, threatening to make them look less \\"sleek\\". In many cases families might be best advised to buy a separate soundbar or speaker system. This isn't just the case for budget TVs. In many cases manufacturers assume those that can afford the higher-end models will invest in the extra technology. Sony recently took a new approach to the problem with a TV that has no dedicated speakers but rather produces sound by vibrating the OLED screen itself. The jury is still out on how well that works. But in general, if the vast majority of programmes on yours set sound fine and only a few don't, then the problem is likely to be with how they have been mixed rather than the TVs themselves. Speaking on the Today programme, ITV's Victoria creator, Daisy Goodwin, pointed out that Riley may have made a conscious choice to not speak with perfectly clear diction in keeping with his character.

A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A−, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.  Paragraph: David is a chemical engineer. Yesterday, he was working on two samples, sample A and sample B.

Derrick ran away from the rats.;","output":"Adam was scared of rats, but Derrick loved the small creatures. Adam ran away from the rats. This sentence exemplifies the vast difference between the two characters, Adam and Derrick, in their perspectives on and feelings towards rats. Adam's fear of rats is not uncommon; many people suffer from musophobia, which is the irrational fear of rodents like rats and mice. This fear can be attributed to a variety of factors: some people find the appearance of rodents repulsive, while others may associate rats with diseases or discomfort. In contrast, Derrick's love for these small creatures indicates that he likely sees rats in a completely different light. Instead of focusing on the potential negative aspects, Derrick might appreciate the fact that rats are intelligent and social animals that are capable of forming strong bonds with humans and their fellow rats. The sentence ends with \\"Adam ran away from the rats,\\" which reinforces the idea that his fear of the animals is overpowering. It is possible that Adam's fear is so intense that he cannot bear to be in close proximity to the rats even if Derrick, his friend, is present. The sentence illustrates a common and relatable scenario in which one individual’s fear may contrast another's love or fascination for the same thing or creature. It tells not only about the difference in perceptions between the characters, but also highlights human nature demonstrating how diverse and unique our opinions and feelings can be. In summary, by ending the sentence with \\"Adam ran away from the rats,\\" we emphasize Adam's strong fear and discomfort when faced with the presence of rats, offering a stark comparison to Derrick's love for the small creatures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:  Paragraph: Two neighboring farms both had depleted soils due to intensive agricultural practices for decades. Apple far decided to start an agroforestry system and other methods to protect their depleted soils, while Pear farm did nothing and had big losses the following years.

Given the context: How would Jesse's parents feel as a result?  Possible answers: Excited about a possible divorce, That Jesse was back to soon, Happy to see their daughter","output":"In this context, it can be inferred that Jesse's parents would most likely feel happy to see their daughter. Given that Jesse has just returned from her honeymoon in France, the situation indicates that Jesse has recently entered a new milestone in her life – marriage. As such, her parents would most likely feel proud and excited for her.  Parents are typically inclined to feel joy and happiness when their children are successful and leading lives filled with love and happiness, and marriage is regarded as a significant step towards building a fulfilling life. The honeymoon, being a celebratory trip that follows the wedding, would have without a doubt been a special opportunity for Jesse to create wonderful memories with her spouse. By visiting her parents right after her honeymoon, it is discernible that Jesse likely wants to share this happiness and these memories with her family, particularly with her parents. Therefore, her parents would understandably be delighted to see their daughter and learn about her experiences. The possibility of Jesse's parents feeling excited about a potential divorce would be quite unlikely and inappropriate in this context. A divorce would be an unhappy and emotionally challenging event, one that parents would not typically look forward to – especially after their daughter has just embarked on a new, exciting journey with her honeymoon. Moreover, there has been no indication that Jesse is unhappy in her marriage or that she desires a divorce. As a result, any form of enthusiasm surrounding a possible divorce would be entirely unconnected to the context and devoid of substantiating evidence. Similarly, the notion of Jesse's parents thinking that their daughter is \\"back too soon\\" also fails to align with the given context. Considering that Jesse has returned to visit her parents after her honeymoon, it's reasonable to assume that her parents would appreciate the opportunity to see their daughter after her important life event and would heartily welcome her. They would likely be more focused on the significance of her visit and the joy of reuniting with her, rather than obsessing over the timing of her return. In conclusion, out of the three possible answers, the most plausible feeling Jesse's parents would be experiencing is happiness and joy at seeing their daughter, especially after such a significant event as a honeymoon in France. The excitement of a possible divorce and assuming that Jesse was back too soon are not in sync with the given context and appear to be out of place when considering normal parental emotions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Briefly summarize this sentence: stocks fell sharply thursday , as investors stepped up their profit-taking amid rising interest rates and mounting pessimism about corporate earnings .","output":"On Thursday, there was a significant drop in the stock market, largely due to investors deciding to increase their profit-taking activities. This surge in profit-taking activities arose in response to a combination of factors. Firstly, interest rates have been on an upward trend, causing investors to reassume their positions and strategies.  Higher interest rates can often dissuade investments as they raise the cost of borrowing, making it more expensive for businesses to finance their operations and for investors to take out loans. Thus, rising interest rates can signal economic tightening, which can inadvertently lead to lower corporate profits and therefore, less attractive stock investments. Secondly, investors' optimism around corporate earnings has started to wane, contributing further to their decision to take profits instead of investing. Corporate earnings are an important indicator of a company's performance and a primary driver of stock prices. If investors are beginning to feel pessimistic about these, it may suggest they have concerns about the future profitability of these companies.  This mass profit-taking and pessimism towards future earnings can potentially create a snowball effect, as other investors might also start selling their shares out of fear of a market downturn, leading to a sharp fall in stock prices. Overall, the significant fall in stocks is a reflection of changing investor sentiment due to rising interest rates and a bleak outlook on corporate earnings. It serves as a warning signal for potential market volatility and uncertainty in the future, leading investors to readjust their strategies accordingly."},{"instruction":"Q: Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed.

Select the topic that this about: Scientists have decoded the complete sequence of all DNA in the bacterium responsible for potentially deadly Legionnaires' disease.","output":"The topic of discussion here is the successful decoding of the complete sequence of all DNA in the bacterium responsible for Legionnaires' disease, a significant breakthrough in the field of bacterial genetics and disease prevention. Legionnaires' disease is a severe and sometimes fatal type of pneumonia caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila. The disease typically spreads through water systems, such as air conditioners, cooling towers, and plumbing systems. Decoding the complete DNA sequence, also known as the genome, of Legionella pneumophila has provided scientists with valuable insights into the bacterium's functions, growth, and mechanisms for causing disease. Understanding the genetic makeup of the bacterium allows researchers to better comprehend the biological processes underlying its infection, proliferation, and pathogenicity. This, in turn, may lead to the development of more effective diagnostic techniques, therapeutic strategies, and preventive measures for Legionnaires' disease. The genome of Legionella pneumophila comprises a single circular chromosome that contains approximately 3.3 million base pairs and encodes around 3,000 protein-coding genes. The successful sequencing of this genome required the combined efforts of biologists, microbiologists, and bioinformaticians. They used advanced techniques, such as next-generation sequencing and computational analysis, to assemble, annotate, and interpret the genetic data. The decoded genome has revealed several interesting features of the bacterium. Some key observations include: 1. Virulence factors: The genome contains numerous genes that encode for proteins involved in the invasion of host cells, evasion of the immune system, and replication within the host. These virulence factors allow the bacterium to infect human lung cells and cause severe pneumonia. 2. Type IV secretion system (T4SS): The T4SS is a complex molecular machine present in the genome of Legionella pneumophila. It plays a crucial role in the transport of bacterial proteins into host cells, contributing to its virulence. 3. Metabolic capabilities: The genome sequence has unveiled the diverse metabolic capabilities of the bacterium, enabling it to survive and thrive in various environments, such as water systems and human lungs. 4. Regulatory mechanisms: The genome contains numerous genes that regulate the expression of other genes and control various cellular processes. Some of these regulatory mechanisms involve the response to environmental stimuli, whereas others are crucial for the bacterium's survival within host cells. The decoding of the Legionella pneumophila genome has opened the door to various research directions. Scientists are now able to study the bacterium's gene functions and interactions in detail, giving them a robust foundation for creating targeted treatments and prevention strategies. This includes the development of vaccines, specific antimicrobial agents, and novel methods for eradicating the bacterium from water systems. In conclusion, the successful decoding of the complete DNA sequence of the bacterium responsible for Legionnaires' disease has provided valuable insights into the organism's biology and pathogenicity. This breakthrough offers hope for the development of more effective interventions in combating this potentially deadly disease and underscores the importance of continued research in bacterial genetics and genomics.

Information:  - Hip hop music, also called hip-hop or rap music, is a music genre formed in the United States in the 1970s which consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching, break dancing, and graffiti writing. Other elements include sampling (or synthesis), and beatboxing.  - Def Jam Recordings is an American record label, focused predominantly on hip hop and urban music, owned by Universal Music Group. In the UK, the label takes on the name \\"Def Jam UK\\" and is operated through Virgin EMI, while in Japan, it is \\"Def Jam Japan\\" operating through Universal Sigma Music. The label distributes various record labels, including Kanye West's GOOD Music, Ludacris' Disturbing Tha Peace, and ARTium Recordings, headed by Def Jam's current executive vice president, No I.D.. Current artists include Iggy Azalea, Logic, Big Sean, Kanye West, Leona Lewis, 2 Chainz, Axwell  Ingrosso, Mother Mother, Afrojack, Jeezy, Jeremih, Ludacris, Alesso, Pusha T, Desiigner and Jhené Aiko, among others.  - The Show is a 1995 documentary film about hip hop music .

The components of rapping include \\"content\\", \\"flow\\" (rhythm and rhyme), and \\"delivery\\". Rapping is distinct from spoken-word poetry in that it is performed in time to a beat (external meter). Rapping is often associated with and a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon can be said to predate hip-hop culture by centuries. It can also be found in alternative rock such as that of Cake, Gorillaz and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Rapping is also used in Kwaito music, a genre that originated in Johannesburg, South Africa, and is composed of hip-hop elements. Another form of rap that predates hip hop was Muhammad Ali's rhythmic poetry used to taunt his opponents in the 1960s and 1970s.  - Michael \\"Mike\\" Tollin (born October 6, 1955) is an American film and television producer/director.

This can be interpreted as a criticism or negative remark. 2. \\"since\\" - This conjunction word is used to connect the first part of the sentence to the next part, which is a reason or cause. 3. \\"simone is not real\\" - Simone, presumably a character in the movie, is described as \\"not real.\\" This could be interpreted either negatively or neutrally, depending on the context. In this case, understanding that the statement is part of a movie review, it could indicate disappointment or a negative aspect of the movie. Taking these steps together, it can be inferred that the sentiment of the movie review sentence is negative, as it critiques the lack of direction or purpose in the movie due to Simone not being real (in whichever sense the reviewer meant)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 75-year-old lived very happily in a village and had a beautiful family. Joe had four grandchildren, and they visited him during their holidays. During one vacation, Joe was preparing his home for the kids: cleaning and buying their favorite foods. After he finished working, he realized he lost his favorite watch. The watch was a gift from his wife when their first child was born. Joe loved the watch very much, especially after his wife's death. He was very upset about losing it. Once his grandchildren came, they promised him they would find the watch. One granddaughter asked: \\"Grandpa, do you remember when you saw the watch last before it went missing?\\" \\"I guess when I was cleaning the barn !\\" Joe replied. The children looked for more than two hours with Joe, but they could not find it. The kids were now also sad, but they tried to comfort  their grandfather. One grandson went back to the barn to search again. Joe asked why he was going there a second time. But the little boy just asked the others not to follow him and to remain silent. He was there for about fifteen minutes and then rushed to his grandfather. He found the watch and happily gave it to Joe. Joe was surprised and asked how he was able to find it.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -9*m - 27 = -0*m for m.","output":"Alright, kiddo, let's look at this math problem together. First, we need to understand the equation: -9*m - 27 = -0*m. Think of \\"m\\" like pieces of candy. So, we have -9 pieces of candy times \\"m\\" minus 27 equals -0 pieces of candy times \\"m\\". Now, when we look at -0*m, that just means we have zero pieces of candy times \\"m\\". No matter what value \\"m\\" has, if you multiply it by zero, you'll always get zero. So, our equation becomes -9*m - 27 = 0. Now we want to solve for \\"m\\", which means we want to find how many pieces of candy \\"m\\" represents. To do that, we first need to move the 27 to the other side. Imagine you're moving 27 Lego bricks from one side of a balance to the other. You want to add 27 to both sides to keep it balanced: -9*m - 27 + 27 = 0 + 27 That simplifies to: -9*m = 27 Now, we need to find \\"m\\" by getting rid of the -9. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -9: (-9*m) / -9 = 27 / -9 This simplifies to: m = -3 So, little buddy, the solution is m = -3. It means that \\"m\\" represents -3 pieces of candy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The rise of the Amorite kingdoms in Mesopotamia brought about deep and lasting repercussions in its political, social and economic structure, especially in southern Mesopotamia.  The division into kingdoms replaced the Babylonian city-states in southern Mesopotamia. Men, land and cattle ceased to belong physically to the gods or to the temples and the king. The new Amorite monarchs gave or let out for an indefinite period numerous parcels of royal or sacerdotal land, freed the inhabitants of several cities from taxes and forced labour, which seems to have encouraged a new society to emerge: a society of big farmers, free citizens and enterprising merchants, which was to last throughout the ages. The priest assumed the service of the gods and cared for the welfare of his subjects, but the economic life of the country was no longer exclusively (or almost exclusively) in their hands.  In general terms, Mesopotamian civilization survived the arrival of Amorites, as the indigenous Babylonian civilisation had survived the short period of Gutian dynasty of Sumer's domination of the south during the restless period after the fall of the Akkadian Empire that had preceded the rise of the Third Dynasty of Ur (the \\"Neo-Sumerian Empire\\"). The religious, ethical, technological, scientific and artistic directions in which Mesopotamia had been developing since the 4th millennium BC were not greatly affected by the Amorites' hegemony. They continued to worship the Sumero-Akkadian gods, and the older Sumerian myths and epic tales were piously copied, translated, or adapted, generally with only minor alterations. As for the scarce artistic production of the period, there is little to distinguish it from the preceding Ur III era.  The era of the Amorite kingdoms, c. 2000 - 1595 BC, is sometimes known as the \\"Amorite period\\" in Mesopotamian history. The principal Amorite dynasties arose in Mari, Yamhad, Qatna, fairly briefly in Assyria (under Shamshi-Adad I), Isin, Larsa and Babylon.  Babylon, originally a minor state at its founding in 1894 BC, became briefly the major power in the ancient world during the reign of Hammurabi in the first part of the 18th century BC, and it was from then that southern Mesopotamia came to be known as Babylonia, the north long before it evolved into Assyria.

By. Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor and Gerri Peev. PUBLISHED:. 07:05 EST, 18 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:08 EST, 18 July 2013. David Cameron and Nick Clegg today stepped up government pressure on Muirfield golf club to end its ban on women members. As the prestigious Open Championship began at the historic course, the Prime Minister condemned policies which 'look more to the past than they do to the future' while his deputy tore into the 'inexplicable' and 'anachronistic' rules. Culture Secretary Maria Miller is boycotting the Open in protest as her Labour opponent Harriet Harman called for male-only clubs to be banned by law. Row: David Cameron and Nick Clegg spoke out against the 'anachronistic' male-only rules which they said belong in the past. Teeing off: The controversy erupted as play got under way at the Open Championship which is being held at Muirfield Golf Club, East Lothian but boycotted by senior ministers. Muirfield, in East Lothian, has been home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers - one of the oldest clubs in the world - since 1891. Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond,. Culture Secretary Mrs Miller and Sport Minister Hugh Robertson have. all announced they will boycott this week’s golf for its perceived. sexism. However it has faced a storm of controversy in the run-up to the Open because it still refuses to admit women members. The Prime Minister's spokesman said Mr Cameron was not attending the Open and 'entirely understands' why Mrs Miller was not going. Asked about all-male clubs, he added: 'The Prime Minister has a great deal of sympathy with the view that exclusive memberships of this sort look more to the past than they do to the future.' Mr Clegg used his LBC 97.3 phone-in. to voice his opposition to the male-only policy: 'I was just dismayed. and incredibly surprised to hear this still goes on in this day and age. 'I find it so out of step with everything else that's happening in the rest of society. 'I think many people will just shake their head and say \\"how on earth is this still possible in this day and age?\\".' Demand for action: Maria Miller wants further action after the offensive comments were made. However the head of golf's governing body claimed male-only golf clubs are ‘for some. people a way of life that they rather like’. Peter Dawson, chief executive of the. Royal and Ancient, insisted that it was not sexist to exclude women from clubs. He said yesterday: ‘I really don’t think that a golf club. that has a policy of being a place where like-minded men or indeed women. go, play golf together and do their thing together, ranks up against. some of these other forms of discrimination. ‘For some people, it is a way of life. they rather like. I don’t think they are intending to do others down. You can dress it up to be a lot more if you want. ‘But if on a Sunday morning the guy, or. the lady, gets out of the marital bed, if you like, and plays golf with. his chums and comes back in the afternoon - that is not on any kind of. par with racial discrimination or anti-Semitism.’ The row comes after Culture Secretary Mrs Miller also delivered an extraordinary attack on the BBC’s sexist sports coverage. In a scathing letter to the director-general Lord Hall, she expressed her anger at presenter John Inverdale’s remarks about Wimbledon singles champion Marion Bartoli. Mrs Miller, who also called for better coverage of women’s sport, demanded updates on ‘further action that is likely to be taken’ over the comments, which prompted hundreds of complaints to the BBC. Earlier this month Inverdale, who is thought to be paid about £600,000 a year, said of Miss Bartoli during coverage of the Wimbledon women’s final: ‘I just wonder if her dad did say to her when she was 12, 13, 14 maybe: “Listen, you are never going to be, you know, a looker. ‘“You are never going to be somebody like a [Maria] Sharapova, you’re never going to be 5 feet 11, you’re never going to be somebody with long legs, so you have to compensate for that. You are going to have to be the most dogged, determined fighter that anyone has ever seen on the tennis court if you are going to make it.” And she kind of is.’ The comments generated more than 700 complaints, and led to demands that Inverdale should be sacked. But the 55-year-old escaped severe sanction by writing a letter of apology to the French champion, and apologising on-air the day after the final. French tennis player Marion Bartoli, was the subject of Inverdale's comments. The beleaguered presenter faced criticism several years ago after he seemed to joke about the Duchess of Cornwall’s appearance. She told Lord Hall: ‘I am writing to express my concern over the comments made by John Inverdale about Marion Bartoli, during the BBC’s radio coverage of the Wimbledon women’s final.’ She added: ‘It is ... a matter of some concern to me that any comment on the looks and stature of a female athlete could be made in the context of one of the highlights of the UK’s, and indeed the world’s, sporting calendar. ‘I am sure you will agree with me that it is vital that young women and girls in this country feel motivated both to take part in and to watch coverage of sport, and to know that they are included in the enjoyment of sport, and catered for by the media just as much as the male audience. ‘Whilst I note that Mr Inverdale has. apologised both on-air and in writing to Ms Bartoli, I would be grateful. for an update on any further action that is likely to be taken. following [the] complaints, and whether there may be positive steps that. the BBC could take in the future to ensure that the perception of and. commentary on female athletes, and women’s sport generally, are as. positive and inclusive as possible.’ The 55-year-old escaped severe sanction by writing a letter of apology to the French champion, and apologising on-air the day after the final. The letter was also copied to the chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten. Inverdale. is already set to be replaced as the BBC’s main athletics presenter by a. woman, Gabby Logan, who agreed that his comments on Bartoli ‘wasn’t. appropriate’. The beleaguered Inverdale faced down criticism several years ago after he seemed to joke about the Duchess of Cornwall’s appearance. In a radio interview with Zara Phillips in 2006, he asked if his studio colleagues could remember the name of the horse Princess Anne rode when she won the European Championship in 1971. When no answer was forthcoming, he suggested: ‘Camilla.’ His latest comments drew a furious response from other sports stars and politicians. Men’s singles champion Andy Murray’s mother Judy described it as a ‘huge gaffe’. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC has made clear that John Inverdale’s comments were unacceptable and fell well beneath the standards expected of our presenters. ‘John sincerely regrets that he made such an inappropriate statement and for the offence caused. As he said on-air the following day, he has written to Marion Bartoli to apologise and the BBC has also apologised for John’s remarks.’ He added that ‘the BBC has a proud record of supporting women’s sport, with the current coverage of Euro 2013 [the women’s football European Championships] the most recent highlight in a summer of unprecedented coverage’. Of the 16 Euro 2013 matches it will show, 14 will be on BBC Three, with just two on BBC Two. The letter was also copied to the chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten. The spokesman also stressed that the BBC has appointed an ‘editorial lead’ for women’s sport ‘which has helped ensure significantly increased coverage across our daily sporting output’, while the company as a whole ‘is taking steps to clearly communicate to those who work for us what constitutes inappropriate behaviour or language’. A BBC source claimed the Inverdale controversy was a ‘one-off’. However, the outrage following the Bartoli comments does not mark the first time the BBC’s sports coverage has been criticised due to sexism. Jacqui Oatley, who became Match of the Day’s first woman commentator in 2007, said she had a ‘very difficult time’ due to outdated attitudes. ‘Mentally it was a huge  challenge. I didn’t enjoy it for a second, I can’t pretend I did,’ she said. The BBC also drew criticism when no women made the ten-strong shortlist for the Sports Personality of the Year award in 2011. In the row over Muirfield’s men-only policy, Mrs Miller is to be joined in her boycott of the Open by sports minister Hugh Robertson and Alex Salmond. Last weekend Mrs Miller accused golf of turning a blind eye to sexism, saying: ‘The Open Championship is the biggest tournament in golf and it sends out completely the wrong message for it to be held at clubs that don’t allow women members. ‘Sport’s governing bodies should be doing all they can to promote equality and address the sexism that still exists in some quarters, not turning a blind eye to it.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"Here are some key points from the complex article you shared: 1.

Summarize the following: Making sure your body is in top physical condition before labor begins can reduce the likelihood of a prolonged labor. Preparing your body for what's to come can make labor easier and quicker when your baby arrives. Walk or swim regularly, and incorporate a few specialized exercises.  Kegels, small internal contractions of the pelvic muscles, can help your body with the pushing stage of labor and also reduce the risk of hemorrhoids in the weeks after childbirth. You can do kegels virtually anywhere. Simply contract the muscles around your vagina, as you would when holding in urine, then hold for four seconds and release. Repeat this 10 times. Three or four sets, done about three times a day, is ideal.  The pelvic tilt, also known as the angry cat, can strengthen abdominal muscles and reduce back pain during pregnancy. Get on your hands and knees, keeping your arms straight without locking your elbows. Tighten your abdominal muscles when breathing in and move your buttocks below your back. Relax your back when you breathe out and repeat at your own pace. Move in time to the rhythm of your breath.  Squatting helps open your pelvis, important for labor. Stand with a chair facing your back and, using the chair for support, contract abdominal muscles, lift your chest, and relax your shoulders. Lower your tailbone to the floor, as if you were going to sit down on the chair, and then rise again to the standing position. Making sure your body is healthy before delivery is vital to a smooth labor. Nutrition is just as important as exercise. Each woman's body is different, so there's no one-size-fits-all guideline to how much weight you should gain.  The adage that you're eating for two is false as your caloric intake does not double. However, you should increase the amount of calories you're eating as your pregnancy progresses. In general, a woman with a BMI between 18.5 and 25.9 should gain between 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy. A woman with a BMI higher than this should only gain 15 to 25 pounds. Discuss how much weight you should gain with your doctor and know how much you should increase your caloric intake to achieve this goal. If you are pregnant with twins or multiples, you will probably need to gain more weight; discuss this with your doctor. Be sure you get plenty of fresh fruits and veggies. Focus on whole grains, such as oatmeal, whole wheat breads and pastas, brown rice, and barley. Incorporating dairy will give you plenty of potassium and calcium for you and your baby.  Be careful with fats. Stick to heart-healthy fats found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil.  Fruits and veggies high in vitamin C, vitamin A, iron, and folate are especially good for pregnant women. Try apples, oranges, green beans, spinach, sweet potatoes, pineapple, mangoes, and squash. Zinc is particularly important during pregnancy as its vital in cell development. Chicken, turkey, ham, shrimp, dairy products, beans, and peanut butter are all great sources of zinc. Eating fish can also be a great source of protein, but you should avoid fish that may have high mercury levels, such as swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish, and shark. When your contractions begin, stay calm so you're able to relax in between. This saves up energy for the later and more trying stages of labor.  There will be continual breaks between contractions throughout labor. Take advantage of such respites, especially during early labor when contractions themselves are gentler.  If possible, sleep between contractions. Practice deep breathing and other relaxation techniques. Have reading and viewing material on-hand so there's something present to distract you and help you relax during the process.","output":"To reduce the likelihood of a prolonged labor, it is crucial to maintain physical fitness through exercises like walking, swimming, kegels, pelvic tilts, and squats. Nutrition is also vital; focus on whole grains, dairy, heart-healthy fats, fruits, vegetables, and zinc-rich foods, while avoiding fish with high mercury levels. Controlling weight gain and consulting with a doctor about individual needs ensures a healthier pregnancy journey. When labor begins, stay calm, take advantage of breaks between contractions, and practice relaxation techniques to save energy for the later stages of labor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Humm…you don’t categorize best as either fun or interesting so maybe I have one of each! Interesting one; while Clinton was still in office he was at a fund raising dinner at a restaurant I managed. I met his personal valet from the white house mess, Oscar, and he casually said, if you are ever in DC…. To which I replied, I sure can be! My husband and I made the trip a month or so later, we met up with Oscar for dinner on our first night there. We had just started planning all we wanted to see as it was our first visit there. We had no idea that Oscar would invite us for not one but two private tours of the White House. We saw the oval office, the situation room, the rose garden, the mess, the press room and the OEOB.

Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David. Semira has Varga, her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity. With Selene in her power, Semira begins draining her blood, which she intends to drink to steal her power. Thomas and David attempt a rescue, but are attacked by Semira and Varga. Thomas is killed, but David and Selene escape. The pair takes refuge at the Nordic Coven, pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira.

After experiencing harsh pains in his back, Adam learns from his doctor that he has schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma (a malignant tumor) in his spine, and must undergo chemotherapy. He sees on the Internet that his chances of survival are fifty-fifty. After Adam reveals his diagnosis, his overbearing mother, Diane, who already cares for her husband Richard suffering from Alzheimer's, wants to move in and care for him.

If The Galleria provides a sheltered, much trafficked pedestrian passage from the Duomo to another holy entity, the revered 18th-century La Scala theater, high temple of opera., can we conclude that \\"The Galleria is a famous theater.\\"?","output":"The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, often referred to simply as \\"The Galleria,\\" is a historical and architectural landmark in Milan, Italy. While it is true that it provides a sheltered and bustling pedestrian passage from the iconic Milan Cathedral, or Duomo, to the renowned La Scala theater, asserting that \\"The Galleria is a famous theater\\" would be an inaccurate conclusion based on this information. The Galleria is primarily known for its distinctive architectural design, which features a soaring, iron-and-glass domed ceiling, elegant mosaic floors, and historic facades. Designed by Italian architect Giuseppe Mengoni in the 19th century, the gallery is named after Vittorio Emanuele II, the first king of the united Italy. The Galleria serves as an early prototype of the modern shopping mall and is home to a number of luxurious shops, cafes, restaurants, and even a luxury hotel. While the La Scala theater, an 18th-century neoclassical building widely regarded as one of the world's premier opera venues, resides near the Galleria, the latter does not function as a theater itself. The proximity between these two renowned locations serves as a testament to the cultural and historical significance of the area in Milan's city center, but it does not indicate that the Galleria plays a direct role in hosting theatrical performances or other similar events. In conclusion, defining the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II as a famous theater based on its connections to the nearby Duomo and La Scala would be a misinterpretation of its true function and purpose. It is better to identify the Galleria as a significant architectural treasure and an elegant shopping destination with a fascinating history, rather than attempting to categorize it as a theater."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Bolshoi ballet head Anatoly Iksanov replaced      Anatoly Iksanov had a year left to run on his contract      Continue reading the main story Related Stories      The head of Russia's Bolshoi Theatre has been removed from his post, following a series of scandals including an acid attack on the ballet company's artistic director.      Anatoly Iksanov is to be replaced by Vladimir Urin, the Russian culture ministry announced.      The acid attack on Sergei Filin exposed vicious internal rivalries at one of the world's top ballet companies.      Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said the Bolshoi needed \\"renewal\\".      \\"A difficult situation had developed around the theatre and the troupe - everything pointed to the need for renewal,\\" he said.      Mr Iksanov had been accused of mismanaging the Bolshoi's 1bn (£860m) renovation - which ran years over schedule and over budget.      He had also become embroiled in a war of words with dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze.      Mr Tsiskaridze, a principal dancer and teacher at the Bolshoi, complained of corruption and called for the theatre's entire management to be sacked and for himself to be put in charge.      Nikolai Tsiskaridze demanded he be put in charge of the Bolshoi      Mr Iksanov hit back, suggesting Mr Tsiskaridze might have played a role in inciting the attack on Mr Filin, which left him with severe burns to his face and almost completely blinded.      Mr Tsiskaridze has denied having anything to do with the attack, for which three other people are awaiting trial.      But he has been told his contract at the theatre will not be renewed.      Mr Iksanov had been the head of the Bolshoi Theatre for the last 13 years, and had more than a year of his contract to run.      Culture Minister Mr Medinsky said he would still have a role advising his successor, Mr Urin, who has been general director of the Stanislavsky Musical Theatre.      Mr Urin \\"will be able to unite the troupe and continue the development of the best theatre in the country and one of the best in the world,\\" Mr Medinsky said.      Commenting on his appointment, Mr Urin said \\"I don't plan any revolutions and understand perfectly that in this theatre, as in any other, one person alone cannot do anything.      \\"I very much hope that the majority of people working in this theatre - talented, remarkable people - will be my allies,\\" he said. ||||| The Russian culture ministry on Tuesday fired the director general of the famed Bolshoi Theater that has been mired in scandal since an acid attack on its artistic director.      FILE - In this March 19, 2013 file photo, Anatoly Iksanov , the general director of the Bolshoi Theater, speaks to the media in Moscow, Russia. The Russian culture ministry has fired the director general... (Associated Press)      Anatoly Iksanov would be replaced by Vladimir Urin, head of another major ballet and opera troupe, the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Theater, said the culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky.      He said that a \\"difficult situation at the theater\\" was the reason for the dismissal. Iksanov, however, was offered to work as Medinsky's adviser in the ministry.      The Bolshoi has been shrouded in scandal for years but a fierce conflict erupted in January when an assailant threw acid into the face of Sergei Filin, the artistic director of ballet.      In March, police arrested Bolshoi soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko over his involvement in the attack. Dmitrichenko admitted that he had agreed to an offer from an acquaintance to rough up Filin, but he insisted that the man had used acid on his own initiative. Despite Dmitrichenko's confession, many in the ballet company have stood by him, saying they do not believe him capable of staging such a crime. About 300 dancers and staff, led by principal dancer and Iksanov's key opponent Nikolai Tsiskaridze, signed an open letter claiming that Dmitrichenko had slandered himself under police pressure.      The Bolshoi reopened in 2011 after a 1 billion renovation. Despite the lavish sums, some of the work was of poor quality, with cracks appearing in the walls and gold leaf crumbling away.      Iksanov has been at loggerheads with many of the troupe's famous dancers, including Tsiskaridze who accused him of mismanaging the Bolshoi's reconstruction, ruining its repertoire and abusing dancers' rights. Iksanov and his backers have dismissed the criticism. |||||Summary:","output":"Anatoly Iksanov, the head of Russia's Bolshoi Theatre, has been replaced by Vladimir Urin, according to an announcement by the Russian culture ministry.

This is especially true of minority or coalition governments who may face accusations that they do not have a mandate for certain policies , or situations where minority groups are exercising their right to self-determination .","output":"The sentences provided appear to be discussing the concept of \\"Direct Democracy versus Representative Democracy.\\" Here's my step-by-step analysis: 1. The first sentence mentions laws \\"passed by public approval\\", which refers to a characteristic of direct democracy where people vote on policies directly. The phrase \\"less open to challenge\\" suggests an advantage of this system, as it can address issues around legitimacy and acceptance of laws. 2. The second sentence emphasizes the nature of the issues, describing them as contentious or controversial. In direct democracy, such issues can be addressed by public vote, ensuring that the result reflects the majority's viewpoint.  3. The third sentence points towards minority or coalition governments' difficulties in getting a mandate for certain policies. In a representative democracy, minorities can often feel unheard or misrepresented, raising questions about the system's fairness. By analyzing all these sentences put together, they seem to be discussing or debating the advantages and disadvantages of direct democracy against a representative democracy.

Make this lower case","output":"Here's the instruction you provided, converted into lower case: \\"use your left and right arrow keys to move your ranger, the up arrow key to jump and the down arrow key to duck.\\" Just to give a bit more details to your request: These directions are typically used in many video games or other screen-based interactive modules where moving a character or navigating through the platform is required. Your left and right arrow keys are used to make your character move horizontally. Pressing the left arrow key will make your ranger move to the left on your screen. Similarly, pressing the right arrow key will make your ranger move to the right on your screen. These keys allow you to dictate the direction in which your character moves. The up arrow key is typically used to make your character jump. In the case of your ranger, pressing this key will cause them to leap off the ground and into the air. This can often be a crucial part of gameplay, as it can help your ranger avoid obstacles, reach higher platforms, or evade enemies. Finally, the down arrow key is generally associated with making your character duck or crouch. Pressing this key will cause your ranger to lower their stance. Ducking can be used for a variety of purposes within a game, such as dodging incoming attacks, sneaking under low barriers, or maneuvering through tight spaces. Remember, practice makes perfect. The more you get used to these controls, the more effective you will become at using them to navigate through the game and act strategically. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the unique mechanics and rules of the game, as this will give you a deeper understanding of when to utilize each movement, and of course, practice as much as possible to improve your skills and reflexes!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: Michael Lasky thought ahead and steered his business in the right direction before the market changed.  Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Okay, let us imagine a person named Michael Lasky. He was a racing person who had a business called Inphomation with psychics who told people about the future. They used to talk on TV for a long time and became famous as Psychic Friends. Now, let's pretend that two years ago, Michael knew that his business would not make much money because there were too many other psychic people and nobody watched those long TV talks anymore. He also thought that the name Psychic Friends was not so special anymore. So, the idea we are talking about is that Michael used his knowledge to make decisions that would help his business do well when the market started to change and become not so good anymore. Now, let's see if this idea is connected to what we first talked about. If Michael really thought about all these things two years ago and decided to make changes to his business, then yes, the idea we are talking about is connected to the first information we had.

The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using DVD players. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions.  - In computing and optical disc recording technologies, an optical disc (OD) is a flat, usually circular disc which encodes binary data (bits) in the form of pits (binary value of 0 or off, due to lack of reflection when read) and lands (binary value of 1 or on, due to a reflection when read) on a special material (often aluminium ) on one of its flat surfaces. The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually polycarbonate) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track. The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed). Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer. The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems.  - Matthew Abram \\"Matt\\" Groening (; born February 15, 1954) is an American cartoonist, writer, producer, animator, and voice actor.

I like to think it was in the heart of Florida, because it was, and is, in my heart. Its name was Dogland. Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes. And then Grandma Bette wouldn't say a word for half an hour or more, a very long time for Grandma Bette to be quiet. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding  Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get  Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How many months passed after the meeting between Karl Inderfurth, Michael Sheehan and General Musharraf and the subsequent visit of President Clinton to Pakistan?\\" is \\"9\\"?","output":"The answer is incorrect. Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the meeting between Karl Inderfurth, Michael Sheehan, and General Musharraf took place in January 2000. President Clinton visited Pakistan on March 25, 2000.

Answer:","output":"The autistic children were not helped by the clinic, but the school was helpful, as the clinic lacked the proper educational resources. The school provided an array of specialized services and accommodations tailored to meet the unique needs of the autistic students, equipping them with essential tools to overcome the challenges they faced in learning and socializing. Unlike the clinic, which focused primarily on addressing the medical and therapeutic aspects of autism, the school invested in creating an inclusive, nurturing, and supportive environment that promoted the development of foundational academic skills as well as vital social and emotional competencies.  At the school, a team of dedicated educators and professionals, consisting of special education teachers, speech and language pathologists, occupational therapists, and behavioral consultants, collaborated closely to design and implement personalized and evidence-based educational programs for each autistic student. These programs incorporated various pedagogical approaches, such as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), Social Stories, and TEACCH, which proved effective in enhancing communication, social interaction, problem-solving, and adaptive living skills in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Moreover, the school offered a variety of extracurricular activities and clubs, such as art, music, and sports, that catered to the diverse interests and abilities of the students and fostered their creativity, self-expression, and physical fitness. Additionally, the school emphasized the importance of fostering a culture of empathy, understanding, and acceptance within the broader school community. By conducting regular awareness campaigns, workshops, and professional development opportunities for staff, teachers, and students, the school sought to dispel common misconceptions and stereotypes about autism and encourage meaningful and positive interactions between neurotypical peers and autistic students. This helped to build a safe and supportive atmosphere, where all students felt valued, respected, and empowered to reach their full potential. In contrast, the clinic focused mainly on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of the medical and psychological aspects associated with autism, such as cognitive, language, motor, and sensory impairments, along with comorbid conditions like anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and sleep disturbances. Despite its role in providing essential healthcare services to autistic individuals, the clinic lacked the necessary expertise, infrastructure, and resources to address their educational needs effectively, thereby limiting its capacity to support their overall development and well-being. In conclusion, the school played an instrumental role in helping the autistic children by providing a holistic approach to their education, personal growth, and social inclusion. The educators and professionals at the school dedicated themselves to crafting individualized interventions and curriculums that empowered the students to thrive academically, emotionally, and socially, unlike the clinic, which primarily dealt with medical and therapeutic interventions. By recognizing and responding to the diverse and complex needs of autistic children, the school managed to significantly enhance their quality of life and equip them with valuable skills to navigate and succeed in an ever-changing world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Where did money to fund the 9/11 plotters come from and where didn't it come from?\\" is \\"Foreign government\\"?","output":"According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Where did money to fund the 9/11 plotters come from and where didn't it come from?\\" is that the money came from al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM.

These marriages were to leading actresses and personalities in the entertainment industry, with each marriage capturing significant media attention. 1. Mimi Rogers (1987-1990) Tom Cruise's first marriage was to American actress and producer Mimi Rogers. The two got married on May 9, 1987, after meeting through a mutual friend. Mimi Rogers, born Miriam Spickler, is best known for her roles in movies such as \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\" (1987), \\"The Rapture\\" (1991), and \\"Reflections in a Golden Eye\\" (1997). Rogers is also known for introducing Cruise to the Church of Scientology, which became an essential part of his life. Unfortunately, their marriage didn't last long, and the couple decided to part ways in 1990, finalizing their divorce on February 4 of the same year. 2. Nicole Kidman (1990-2001) Shortly after Tom Cruise's divorce from Mimi Rogers, he met Australian actress Nicole Kidman on the set of their film \\"Days of Thunder\\" in 1989. The two quickly fell in love and got married on December 24, 1990. This high-profile marriage attracted significant media attention, and the couple went on to star in several films together, including \\"Far and Away\\" (1992) and \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" (1999).

Given the question: Hormones control many cell activities, so they are very important for homeostasis, and homeostasis is the chemical equilibrium of the body. Given these facts, hormones control many cell activities and are important to what among the following options: - h2o  - an organism's body  - weather  - increases a body's strength  - production of energy  - Transfers energy  - maintaining density  - chemical equilibrium of body The answer is:","output":"Hormones control many cell activities and are important to an organism's body and the chemical equilibrium of the body. Hormones are chemical messengers that are secreted by various glands in the endocrine system. They travel through the bloodstream to target cells or organs in the body and regulate various physiological processes. These processes include growth and development, metabolism, immune function, and reproduction. Therefore, hormones are essential for the proper functioning and homeostasis of an organism's body. Homeostasis is the maintenance of a stable internal environment within the body, despite changes in external conditions. This involves the maintenance of a constant temperature, pH, and the concentrations of various ions and molecules in the body fluids. It is crucial for the survival and functioning of cells, tissues, and organs in an organism's body. Hormones play a critical role in maintaining homeostasis and chemical equilibrium in the body. For example, insulin and glucagon, hormones produced by the pancreas, work in a balanced manner to regulate blood glucose levels. When blood glucose levels rise, insulin is released, which stimulates the conversion of glucose to glycogen for storage. In contrast, when blood glucose levels drop, glucagon is released, triggering the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, thus increasing blood glucose levels. Another example of hormones maintaining homeostasis is the action of the antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which regulates water balance in the body. ADH is released from the pituitary gland when there is a decrease in blood volume or an increase in blood osmolarity. This hormone stimulates the kidneys to reabsorb water, allowing the body to conserve water and maintain proper hydration levels. Therefore, among the given options, hormones' importance lies in their role in controlling many cell activities and maintaining the chemical equilibrium of an organism's body. It is important to note that while hormones have various effects on the body, they do not directly control weather, increase a body's strength, produce energy, transfer energy, or maintain density."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: what kind of drug is vyvanse classified as? A:","output":"A: Vyvanse, also known as lisdexamfetamine, is classified as a central nervous system stimulant, specifically part of the amphetamine class of drugs. It is primarily prescribed for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents, and adults. However, it is also sometimes prescribed off-label for other conditions such as binge eating disorder and narcolepsy.  Vyvanse works by affecting the levels and activity of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, particularly dopamine and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters are essential for processes like focus, attention, and impulse control. When someone has ADHD, they may have an imbalance in these neurotransmitters that can lead to inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity issues. Vyvanse helps to increase the levels of these neurotransmitters, thereby improving concentration, focus, and reducing hyperactivity in individuals with ADHD. As a prodrug, Vyvanse is different from other stimulants because it is inactive in its original form and needs to be metabolized in the body to become active. Once ingested, the body's enzymes break down the lisdexamfetamine into d-amphetamine, which is its active form. This metabolic process helps to provide a consistent and gradual release of the drug throughout the day, which can reduce the potential for abuse and addiction compared with other stimulants that have a more rapid onset of action. Despite the lower potential for abuse, Vyvanse is still classified as a Schedule II controlled substance in the U.S. under the Controlled Substances Act. This is because it has a high potential for misuse and addiction, as well as the potential for severe psychological or physical dependence. Therefore, it is important for individuals taking Vyvanse to follow their doctor's prescription instructions and never share the medication with others. Some common side effects of Vyvanse include dry mouth, loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, dizziness, irritability, and insomnia. Serious side effects can also occur, such as increased heart rate, high blood pressure, and psychiatric issues (including new or worsening symptoms of depression, anxiety, or aggressive behavior). It is essential for patients to talk with their healthcare provider about any side effects they may experience while taking Vyvanse.   In conclusion, Vyvanse is a central nervous system stimulant belonging to the amphetamine class of drugs. It is primarily used for treating ADHD by affecting neurotransmitters, providing a slow-release effect through metabolic processes. Although it is a Schedule II controlled substance with the potential for misuse and addiction, the risks can be well-managed under proper medical supervision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Released in 2013 and directed by John Moore, the movie stars Bruce Willis reprising his iconic role as John McClane, alongside Jai Courtney, who plays his son, Jack McClane. The choice of Budapest as the main filming location was due to its diverse architecture, which allowed it to stand-in for multiple locations and offer a unique atmosphere for the story. Some of the key locales and landmarks used in the movie include: 1. Budapest's Széchenyi Chain Bridge: The crucial car chase scene, featuring Bruce Willis maneuvering through heavy traffic and causing chaos, was predominantly shot on and around this famous Hungarian landmark. 2. St. Stephen’s Basilica: Surrounding areas and adjacent streets of this prominent neoclassical church were included in the film's sequences. 3. Miklós Bercsényi Barracks of MH 59th Military Base: This former military base served as the backdrop for the scenes featuring Moscow's CIA Safe House. It is situated in an industrial area of Budapest called Csepel. 4. Kemény-Zsigmond Mansion: This 19th-century mansion in Budapest was transformed into a luxurious Russian hotel for the movie's purposes, where John McClane and his son find shelter. Additional filming occurred at various locales throughout Budapest, including the Hungarian State Opera House, Kossuth Square, Népliget Bus Terminal, and Nagyszombat Street. The production also utilized the Origo Film Studio in Budapest for several interior sequences. It is important to note that a few scenes were actually filmed in Russia, particularly in Moscow's Red Square and at the Hotel Ukraina. However, these sequences were relatively short and served to enhance the movie's setting authenticity.

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive.

Miranda fantasizes about the speech she plans to make when, one day in their future, she will give this tiny infant away at her wedding.

Well-fitted leggings can quickly transform a flat butt to round and perky. Don’t be afraid to use bright colors and styles to bring attention to your butt.  Leggings and yoga pants are great for working out, running errands, and informal gatherings.

Al Sharpton calls verdict \\"an atrocity\\"      NAACP urges Justice Department to pursue civil rights charges against Zimmerman      Leaders appeal for calm      Angry civil rights groups on Sunday were pressing for new criminal charges following George Zimmerman's acquittal on second-degree murder and manslaughter in a Florida courtroom.      The NAACP website featured an online petition -- also posted on the liberal site MoveOn.org -- asking the Justice Department to bring federal charges against Zimmerman in the February 2012 fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin.      \\"The most fundamental of civil rights — the right to life — was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,\\" the petition says. \\"We ask that the Department of Justice file civil rights (criminal) charges against Mr. Zimmerman for this egregious violation.\\"      Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson issued a statement Sunday saying federal prosecutors were continuing to review evidence in the case, including testimony from the state trial.      \\"Prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate,\\" Iverson said.      Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, pressed for those charges, blasting the state verdict as a \\"tragic miscarriage of justice.\\" She also urged Trayvon's family to pursue a civil lawsuit.      \\"No matter how you look at this situation, if it were not for the actions of Mr. Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin would still be alive with his family today,\\" Arnwine said.      She said she hoped the verdict would spark a national conversation about racial profiling and the \\"broken criminal justice system.\\"      After the verdict was announced Saturday night, a clearly shaken NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said, \\"This is a heartbreaking moment. This will confirm for many that the only problem with the New South is it occupies the same time and space as the old South.\\"      NOT GUILTY: Zimmerman acquitted      'SYSTEM HAS FAILED': Crowds react to verdict      He referenced another killing of a black youth that many have compared to the Trayvon Martin slaying, the 1955 killing of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was killed in Mississippi for allegedly flirting with a white woman. \\"Trayvon Martin's case has focused a generation the same way that the Emmett Till case focused a generation 60 years ago. I had hoped that this time we would get a verdict that fit the gravity of the case.\\"      The Rev. Al Sharpton, who led thousands of protesters in Sanford seeking a prosecution of Trayvon's killer, called the verdict \\"a sad day in the country\\" and \\"a slap in the face to those that believe in justice in this country.\\"      \\"I think this is an atrocity,\\" Sharpton said. \\"It is probably one of the worst situations that I have seen.\\"      Jesse Jackson called the verdict \\"Old South justice.\\"      \\"I'm disappointed and I'm saddened for the family,\\" Jackson said.      While the jury's verdict was a crushing blow for many, there were no reports of serious unrest by early Sunday morning. Authorities in Martin's hometown of Miami and in Miami Gardens, where his father lives, said the streets were quiet.      Demonstrators took to the streets of four California cities, and there were reports of protesters breaking windows and damaging cars in Oakland, officials said early Sunday.

In Sanford, Tristan Bailey, 15, who was outside the Seminole County courthouse, was stunned after hearing the verdict. \\"I don't know what to say,\\" said the teen, who identifies with Trayvon Martin. \\"He was just a teen, trying to live his dreams.\\"      Shannon Mickey, 41, was also disappointed. \\"We were all nervous when we knew the verdict was coming down,\\" Mickey said. \\"It was a sense of shock. And unbelievable sadness.\\"      In Detroit, the Rev. Charles Williams II, president of the National Action Network of Michigan and pastor of Detroit's Historic King Solomon Baptist Church, said he planned a special prayer service at the church to pray for the Martin family.      \\"In the South, it's still hard for an African American to get justice,\\" Williams said. \\"Mr. Zimmerman deserved at least manslaughter and the jury wouldn't even do that. There is not faith in the jurors or in the diversity of the process.\\"      Williams said that National Action Network will examine legal options. \\"We're going to continue our calls for justice for Trayvon Martin,\\" he said.      In Fort Myers, Fla., people voiced feelings of anger, dismay and concern about keeping the peace immediately following the verdict.      \\"Oh my goodness, this is unreal to me. I'm very upset,\\" said Antoinette Anderson, 48, a school district employee who is African American. \\"It shows we're not equal in the justice system.\\"      Joe D'Alessandro, a 74-year-old former state attorney who now has a private legal practice, had a different take: \\"I never thought the state had a second-degree murder case,\\" he said. \\"Self-defense trumps all. I just hope there's no violence.\\"      Despite his disappointment with the verdict, Jealous urged calm. \\"It's important that the public focus on the fact that there are still additional avenues for holding this man accountable and bringing him to justice,\\" he said. \\"It is critical that people keep the peace and focus their energy on encouraging the federal authorities to make sure that Zimmerman is held accountable for taking young Trayvon Martin's life.\\"      Jackson also called for calm. \\"I hope there will be dignity and discipline, and not street justice,\\" he said. \\"We cannot dishonor the innocent blood of Trayvon Martin with acts of violence.\\"      Tampa resident Craig Woodord brought his 13-year-old son, Dante, to the courthouse Saturday afternoon to watch history in the making. Dante wore a blue hooded sweatshirt and carried a bag of Skittles candy and a can of watermelon Arizona Iced Tea.      \\"My son's 13,\\" Craig Woodord said. \\"And it could have been him.

HolderSam Clovis is a terrible pick for the USDA Holder: Obama never asked me to consider dropping a case Schumer: Trump must withdraw USDA nominee to show he doesn't 'tolerate hate' MORE faces a crucial decision on whether to press federal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman, after the neighborhood watchman was acquitted Saturday in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.      The NAACP and other leading civil rights groups are pressing for Holder to open a federal case against Zimmerman, after he was found not guilty on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges by a Florida jury.      ADVERTISEMENT      The public pressure leaves Holder, the nation’s first African-American attorney general, facing a difficult decision on a controversial case that has grabbed the nation’s attention and sparked renewed debate about racial profiling.      In a statement from NAACP President Ben Jealous, the civil rights group said they were “not done demanding justice for Trayvon Martin.”      “The most fundamental of civil rights—the right to life—was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin. We ask that the Department of Justice file civil rights charges against Mr. Zimmerman for this egregious violation,” said the group in a petition unveiled Saturday night. “Please address the travesties of the tragic death of Trayvon Martin by acting today.”      On CNN Sunday, civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson also demanded that the Justice Department “intervene” and “take this to another level.”                  Many Democratic lawmakers are also joining those calls, with Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) tweeting a message from Jealous asking for the DOJ to act.      Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) tweeted he was “deeply saddened” by the verdict, but was “pleased that DOJ is continuing to evaluate evidence.”      The DOJ launched a review of the shooting earlier this year and Holder said that they would take proper action if they had evidence of a civil rights crime.      “If we find evidence of a potential federal criminal civil rights crime, we will take appropriate action, and at every step, the facts and law will guide us forward,” said Holder in a speech in April to Al Sharpton’s National Action Network.      But Holder had cautioned in subsequent remarks that the DOJ faces a “very high barrier” when seeking to bring federal criminal charges in such cases.      The decision to act against Zimmerman after a jury acquitted him could also put Holder again at odds with Republican lawmakers, with whom he has had a contentious relationship.      The House voted him in contempt last year after he failed to turn over documents subpoenaed in a probe of the ATF’s botched gun-tracking program, Operation Fast and Furious.      Holder has also faced congressional anger over the DOJ’s probe of journalists over national security leaks, including questions about whether he lied when testifying before Congress that he was unaware of efforts to prosecute reporters.      Holder spoke in April about the shooting death of Trayvon Martin personally, saying that “as a parent, I reacted to it.”      “This is a pain that no parent should have to endure. The notion of having to bury a child is something that is, I think in some ways for a parent, the ultimate pain,” Holder said.      “The primary responsibility we have in the Justice Department is to support the state in its ongoing investigation, to do our own thorough and parallel investigation which we are in the process of doing and try to resolve this matter in as fair and complete a way and as quickly as we can.” ||||| Editor's note: The George Zimmerman trial: What happened? What's next? Watch an \\"Anderson Cooper 360\\" special tonight at 8 ET on CNN.      (CNN) -- This might sound like a legal conundrum:      A Florida jury has pronounced George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon Martin.      But a court could still hold him accountable for the death.      Martin's family so far has only commented that it wants the public to respect the Florida court's verdict.      Two options, however, are available: A civil suit, or a civil rights suit. Though they sound similar, they are very different.      A civil suit allows one party to seek monetary damages against another for causing physical or emotional harm, regardless of the outcome of a criminal trial.      A civil rights suit involves criminal charges for violating someone's civil rights, which are protected under federal law.      Feds are asked to act      Civil suit      Take what happened to O.J. Simpson 17 years ago.      After a criminal court acquitted him of charges in the 1994 killing of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson, a civil court held him responsible in 1997 for her \\"wrongful death.\\"      It ordered him to pay her family more than 33 million in damages. Various courts then stripped Simpson of every asset they could get their hands on.      Wrongful death is easier to prove than murder or manslaughter.      A defendant can be held liable, even if he or she didn't intend to cause the victim's death, according to Florida law.      Simple negligence is enough, if it results in death.      Did Zimmerman act negligently, when he exited his vehicle to pursue Martin on foot while carrying a gun -- although a 911 operator told him not to?      Would the 17-year-old still be alive if Zimmerman had not done so?      Those are questions a lawyer for Martin's family would be sure to ask in a wrongful death suit.      Martin's family has so given no indication so far of wanting to pursue an additional suit.      But someone else has.      Trayvon's dad: My heart is broken, my faith is not      Civil rights suit      The NAACP is pushing the U.S. Department of Justice to file a civil rights suit.      They accuse Zimmerman of racial profiling that led to Martin's death -- an allegation that Zimmerman, his family and his supporters have denied.      Analysis: The role that race played      \\"The most fundamental of civil rights -- the right to life -- was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,\\" the group said.      NAACP President Benjamin Jealous told CNN's \\"State of the Union\\" on Sunday that remarks made by Zimmerman and people who live in his Sanford, Florida, neighborhood had sparked the group's concern.      \\"When you look at (Zimmerman's) comments, and when you look at comments made by young black men who lived in that neighborhood about how they felt especially targeted by him, there is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon,\\" Jealous said.      The NAACP leader's allegations drew sharp criticism Sunday from Robert Zimmerman Jr., who argued that FBI interviews have already shown that his brother isn't racist.      \\"I don't think (Jealous) does anything for civil rights by perpetuating a narrative that has now been proven false. ... They've investigated I think about three dozen of his closest friends and acquaintances. And there is not any inkling of racism. In fact, there's evidence to show the opposite,\\" he said. \\"I would encourage them to cool their jets, give everyone some time to kind of process what's going on. Agitation doesn't help us. It doesn't do anybody any good right now.\\"      The Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN's \\"New Day\\" on Sunday that his Rainbow PUSH Coalition also wants the Justice Department to look into possible civil rights violations in the case.      \\"There's a Trayvon in every town,\\" he said. \\"That's why the Department of Justice has a role to play, to look at this pattern, because equal protection under the law remains elusive.\\"      The Justice Department did not respond directly to the NAACP demand. It has a separate federal investigation going on.      \\"Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial,\\" it said in a Sunday statement.      It's a legal path that worked in the case of Rodney King, whom Los Angeles police officers clubbed down in 1991 after a car chase.      The beating of the African-American man was caught on video and later aired on news broadcasts.      When a criminal court failed to convict the white officers of police brutality, riots ensued in Los Angeles over alleged racial discrimination.      The Justice Department filed a civil rights suit against the officers, alleging racial profiling, and two were convicted in 1993 as a result.      A court sentenced them to 30 months in federal prison.      CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","output":"In 2013, civil rights groups pushed for new criminal charges after George Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida.

This article: The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind while he awaited trial. His limousine driver and a witness to the arrest, Louis Goldblatt, described him as \\"genuinely dumbfounded by the whole affair.\\" Tour manager Eric Barrett said that he looked \\"as if there had been a plane crash\\". Hendrix biographers Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek described the incident as \\"a nightmare which ... plagued\\" him for seven months. According to Redding, \\"the bust knocked any positive feelings Jimi was holding onto out of him\\" and that he was in \\"agonised suspense\\" from the arrest until the trial. In 2012, Plummer wrote: \\"The real possibility of prison hung over Hendrix like a spectre ... a threat to his career and the cause of much brooding and rumination.\\" Journalist Charles Shaar Murray asserted that the incident jeopardized what he described as \\"Hendrix's increasingly fragile peace of mind\\". Two weeks after the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: \\"Whatever I have done ... getting hooked on heroin is not one of them.\\" He explained that his fear of needles discouraged him from using the drug and that having known junkies convinced him that it was not something he should get involved with. Soon after the story of his arrest became public, he drew a connection between the bust and anti-establishment sentiments: \\"All of that is the establishment fighting back ... Eventually, they will swallow themselves up, but I don't want them to swallow up too many kids as they go along.\\"According to Shapiro and Glebbeek, in 1969 there was little confidence in the staying power of rock stars; it was assumed that their careers were going to be short, and industry insiders operated under a \\"take the money and run\\" mentality. For this reason, they speculated that had Hendrix been convicted it would have ended his music career.

Despite worries over the space agencies ability to pay for the project, officials said they have completed a rigorous review of the Space Launch System (SLS). Towering a staggering 384 feet tall, the Space Launch System (SLS) will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds. Scroll down for video. An artist's impression of the giant rocket taking off. Nasa doesn't have enough money to get its new, 12 billion rocket system off the ground by the end of 2017 as planned, federal auditors warned in July. The Government Accountability Office issued a report Wednesday saying Nasa's's Space Launch System is at 'high risk of missing' its planned December 2017 initial test flight. 'They can't meet the date with the money they have,' report author Cristina Chaplain said. She said it wasn't because the space agency had technical problems with the congressionally-required program, but that Nasa didn't get enough money to carry out the massive undertaking. 'We are on a journey of scientific and human exploration that leads to Mars,' said Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden. 'And we’re firmly committed to building the launch vehicle and other supporting systems that will take us on that journey.' For its first flight test, SLS will be configured for a 70-metric-ton (77-ton) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed Orion spacecraft beyond low-Earth orbit. In its most powerful configuration, SLS will provide an unprecedented lift capability of 130 metric tons (143 tons), which will enable missions even farther into our solar system, including such destinations as an asteroid and Mars. This decision comes after a thorough review known as Key Decision Point C (KDP-C), which provides a development cost baseline for the 70-metric ton version of the SLS of 7.021 billion from February 2014 through the first launch and a launch readiness schedule based on an initial SLS flight no later than November 2018. Conservative cost and schedule commitments outlined in the KDP-C align the SLS program with program management best practices that account for potential technical risks and budgetary uncertainty beyond the program's control. 'Our nation is embarked on an ambitious space exploration program, and we owe it to the American taxpayers to get it right,' said Associate Administrator Robert Lightfoot, who oversaw the review process. 'After rigorous review, we’re committing today to a funding level and readiness date that will keep us on track to sending humans to Mars in the 2030s – and we’re going to stand behind that commitment.' The biggest rocket ever made: The SLS will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds. 'The Space Launch System Program has done exemplary work during the past three years to get us to this point,' said William Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for the Human Explorations and Operations Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. 'We will keep the teams working toward a more ambitious readiness date, but will be ready no later than November 2018.' Nasa has been testing small scale versions of the rocket amid fears it could be too loud. Four SLS RS-25 engines will be used to power the world's biggest rocket into orbit. 'A 5-percent scale model, including solid rocket motors, of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) is ignited to test how low- and high-frequency sound waves will affect the rocket on the launch pad,' the agency said. 'The data collected from the tests will be used to help direct and verify the design of the rocket's sound suppression system.' Previous tests have shown that most ofthe acoustic energy being emitted from a rocket engines is concentrated in the low to mid frequency ranges. 'This may have the potential to damage structures or harm personnel in the immediate vicinity of the test stand.' a Nasa report warned. The SLS is set to become the largest rocket ever built, dwarfing the rockets that took man to the moon and paving the way for manned missions to Mars. Nasa today said it is about to start testing the  engines for the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket - on the same stand that were used to perfect the Apollo rockets. Four engines, a modified version of the space shuttle main engine that powered missions into space from 1981 to 2011, will be used on the mega-rocket. 'This test series is a major milestone because it will be our first opportunity to operate the engine with a new controller and to test propellant inlet conditions for SLS that are different than the space shuttle,' said Steve Wofford, SLS Liquid Engines Element manager. Earlier this year Nasa signed a 2.8 billion contract with Boeing to build the giant rocket it is hoped will take us into deep space. How it compares: The SLS is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the Moon. It will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today. Russia's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled. However construction of the first stage of Russia's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway.

Summarize the following: Locate a source for vegetable oil that has been used in cooking. Contact local fast food restaurants, cafeterias, hotels and other commercial food establishments to see if you can take their waste oil, or pay a very small fee for it. You may compete with rendering companies, who also pay restaurants to take used oil off their hands.  Try a restaurant that sells a lot of fried food, like French fries or fried chicken, as they are very likely to have large quantities of used oil that they need to dispose of. Ask restaurants if they use canola or olive oil, as these are typically the best oils for creating biodiesel. Avoid hydrogenated oils, which are generally higher in Free Fatty Acids and cause problems in biodiesel production.  You can buy new cooking oil from the grocery store, but using waste oil is less expensive and helps reduce waste that would otherwise end up in a landfill or in sewer pipes. Look at the oil you obtain to roughly determine its quality. It should look darker than fresh or unused vegetable oil, and will likely include small food matter left from the frying process.  If the oil appears milky or cloudy, do not use it, as it is likely too high in water content and/or animal fats, which will interfere in the biodiesel production process. Make sure to follow the proper procedures to dispose of cooking oil that you do not use. Contact your local waste management company or ask the restaurant you obtained the oil from to find out how they safely dispose of the oil. Take any transparent plastic jug from juice, soda, or any other household product and pour your used oil into it for storage.  Ensure that any storage jug is completely clean, dry, and free of any other residue or materials, including water. Use a container with a tight lid and no cracks or leaks. The oil may already have come to you in an acceptable container when you obtained it from a restaurant or other source. However, you will need several clean containers (at least 3) on hand for storing oil at each stage of the filtration process. Label oil containers, and all other materials used in biodiesel production, clearly. At this stage, you can label the oil as “used oil” or “unfiltered oil” in order to avoid confusion in later steps of the process.","output":"To obtain used vegetable oil, contact local fast food restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, and other commercial food establishments, and offer to take their waste oil or pay a small fee for it.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period, mainly in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi. They show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs.  Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes. The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously St Peter's, Rome) over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church. The beliefs of many cultures, including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture). In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers, explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or \\"Art of Dying\\".  It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope Urban VIII by Bernini (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy.  As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones.","output":"The Catacombs of Rome are a critical source for understanding the emergence of Christian iconography. In the early stages, Christians took inspiration from the popular Roman decorative art, which was evident in the style of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi found in the catacombs. However, Christians initially avoided using iconic images of religious figures on these sarcophagi. Instead, they decorated them with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram, and later, narrative religious scenes. As the Christians' persecution ended, and they began to build churches over the burial places of martyrs, this led to the development of distinctive Christian funerary art, such as the church monument or tomb inside a church. This practice deviated from the beliefs of many other cultures, including Judaism, Hinduism, and classical paganism, which considered the dead ritually impure and avoided mixing temples and cemeteries. During the late Middle Ages, more explicit memento mori imagery became prevalent in northern Europe, reflecting the influence of the Black Death and devotional writers.

Trevor gets back with her and decides to rob a local mobster.  Trevor wants some cash to buy Laura some gifts and Andy was told by some local mobsters that they are investing money with huge profits and he wants some cash to buy in. However, their robbery is very sloppy and the head mobster quickly figures out what happened.

Billy finds out what is going on and is mildly amused by it until he realizes that Trevor has gotten back together with Laura behind his back.

Answer a question about this article: BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams. Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \\"Cougars\\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday, as well as expelling players due to honor code violations. Beginning in the 2011 season, BYU football competes in college football as an independent. In addition, most other sports now compete in the West Coast Conference. Teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men's volleyball program in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. For outdoor track and field, the Cougars became an Independent. Softball returned to the Western Athletic Conference, but spent only one season in the WAC; the team moved to the Pacific Coast Softball Conference after the 2012 season. The softball program may move again after the 2013 season; the July 2013 return of Pacific to the WCC will enable that conference to add softball as an official sport.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.  Question: \\"How much is the registration fee hike and what is cited as the reason for the lack of generated funds?\\" Answer: \\"22 increase to shore up the charities for lawyers families\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

As mentioned, lifestyle- and obesity-related diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent all around the world. There is little doubt that the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development. The food processing industry is a major part of modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g., nutritional recommendations, agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life is more the trend. In general, whole, fresh foods have a relatively short shelf-life and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods. Thus, the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive, but nutritionally superior, whole, fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior, processed foods. Because processed foods are often cheaper, more convenient (in both purchasing, storage, and preparation), and more available, the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutrition-related health complications.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there will be weaker earthquakes happens, how will it affect MORE/STRONGER earthquakes.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation – weaker earthquakes – can have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the process that leads to more intense or stronger earthquakes. The relationship between weaker earthquakes and stronger ones can be understood in the context of the seismic activity and stress accumulation in the Earth's crust. 1. Direct effects: Release of stress: Weaker earthquakes can sometimes release the built-up stress in the Earth's crust along faults or cracks. This release of tension reduces the chances of a more significant, stronger earthquake occurring in the same region as the stress has been partially or wholly discharged. However, this doesn't guarantee that a stronger earthquake won't happen, but it might delay or decrease the intensity of a future seismic event. Triggering of other earthquakes: Conversely, weaker earthquakes can sometimes increase the likelihood of a stronger earthquake. When a weak earthquake occurs, it can transfer stress to adjacent faults, causing an imbalance and concentrating tension in nearby areas. This transferred stress may cause the adjacent fault segment to be pushed closer to its breaking point, leading to a more substantial, more potent seismic event. 2. Indirect effects: Understanding fault network and interactions: Weaker earthquakes can provide valuable information about the fault network in an area, including the connections between different faults and how stress is transferred among them. Through the study of seismic activity, including weaker earthquakes, scientists can better understand the chances of stronger earthquakes occurring and manage their potential impacts more effectively. In summary, the perturbation of weaker earthquakes can have both direct and indirect effects on the process that leads to stronger earthquakes. Weaker earthquakes can either release built-up stress, mitigating the risk of stronger earthquakes, or transfer stress to neighboring faults, potentially triggering more significant seismic events. Additionally, the study of weaker earthquakes can help scientists better comprehend fault networks and interactions, contributing to our understanding of the likelihood of stronger earthquakes in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1933 Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced their way through three Warner Brother musicals that offered Depression era audiences a momentary distraction from their woes. Gold Diggers of 1933, 42nd Street and Footlight Parade were all set in the world of Broadway Theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on. In addition to Keeler and Powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of Busby Berkeley, show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players. All are arguably classics of their genre but I must admit a clear preference for Footlight due to it's pace energy and lead James Cagney. Warren William in Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter in 42nd Street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads- particularly Baxter as the burned out Julian Marsh in search of one last box office smash. Both lack the infectious energy of Cagney however, who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a Broadway musical. He is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend. Of course Cagney alone does not make Footlight the classic that it is. The script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell who cuts everyone down to size. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risqué and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the Hollywood Code in 34.

After receiving an unexpected phone call that she has won a spot to participate on a television game show, she becomes obsessed with regaining the youthful appearance she possesses in an old photograph. To reach her goal, she goes to a doctor to discuss weight loss. The doctor gives her a prescription for weight-loss amphetamine pills throughout the day and a sedative at night. As the months go by, Sara's tolerance for the pills adjusts and as a result she is no longer able to feel the same high the pills once gave her.

The idea that Earth is a magnet is far from new. It was first proposed in 1600 by a British physician named William Gilbert. Knowing it acts like a magnet is one thing. Knowing why it acts like a magnet is more difficult. In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery. To find out why required new technology. It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal. The liquid metal moves as Earth spins on its axis.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the other names of the Monte Ne Hotel?, using the article: As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him., what would be the answer ?

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Where were infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century?  In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

Thanku for making a film like this one. Just wonderfully awkward, beautiful kind characters who are flawed and graceful all at once. Just great. I can't submit this without 10 lines in total so I will simply go on to say that I wish for more from this director, more from all the actors in this film and more from the writer. I didn't want it to end. The end Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?

These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families  within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers. It closed in 1970 and was demolished in 1972. Notable old boys included Doctor Who actor Jon Pertwee and..., can you guess it ?

Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years. Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something.

A senior Justice Department official told a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on Thursday that several agencies including the FBI are investigating partisan political activity inside the IRS, and that former official Lois Lerner's disappearing emails are on the menu. A criminal investigation, Deputy Attorney General James Cole testified, 'is being conducted by career attorneys and agents of the Department’s Criminal and Civil Rights Divisions, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Cole declined to provide lawmakers with details about what the DOJ has uncovered. 'I can, however, tell you,' he added, 'that the investigation includes investigating the circumstances of the lost emails from Ms.Lerner’s computer.' Lerner, who led the IRS division tasked with vetting and monitoring tax-exempt nonprofits until her retirement late last year, is Republicans' central bête noire in the controversy over how her sub-agency targeted conservative groups with aggressive scrutiny and years-long delays when they applied for the coveted charitable status. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Deputy Attorney General James Cole told the House Oversight Committee on Thursday that the Justice Department's investigation into the IRS tea party targeting scandal includes a probe into Lois Lerner's missing emails. Lerner (R) headed the IRS division that policed nonprofit groups, and is accused of purposely targeting right-wing organizations for unusually intrusive scrutiny. Republicans on the oversight committee hit the roof when IRS Commissioner John Koskinen confirmed last month that years' worth of Lerner's government emails, which they had been demanding since 2013, were casualties in a hard drive crash. Koskinen drew gasps during a congressional hearing when he acknowledged that after forensic experts failed to retrieve the emails, the agency recycled the drive – rendering it permanently unavailable to investigators in the legislative branch of government. He also admitted, under questioning by Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, that the IRS failed to look at a backup tape that could have provided copies of Lerner's emails for a six-month period. Cole's statement on Thursday is the first indication that the Obama administration may have moved with purpose to probe what happened, despite the GOP's hints at a partisan slow-walk – or, worse, a cover-up in which Lerner herself destroyed evidence of her alleged wrongdoing. Lerner's attorney, William Taylor III, did not respond to an email seeking comment. On July 9 he released a statement claiming that his client 'did not destroy any records subject to the Federal Records Act, she did not cause the computer assigned to her to fail, and she made every effort to recover the files on the computer.' Although Republicans learned of the email losses in June, her hard drive crashed in 2011. Some Republicans believe the data loss as happened at too opportune a time to have been an accident: Just days earlier, the GOP had begun publicly questioning the IRS's partisan activity. That was two years before Lerner herself outed the program by answering a planted question at a conference for tax professionals in May 2013. Her admission presaged a report, long in the making, that the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration released days later. That same year, a surviving email shows, Lerner cautioned her colleagues and underlings to communicate via instant message instead of by email, because the latter would be open to congressional inquiries. Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan reacted to Cole's written testimony late on Wednesday, telling The Wall Street Journal that it was overdue. 'Finally, someone in the administration admits that the destruction of two years of emails from Lois Lerner is fishy,' Jordan said. Clash: Republican Rep. Darrell Issa (R) has continually crossed swords with Democrat Elijah Cummings (L) over the question of whether Lerner can claim Fifth Amendment privileges and refuse to testify about her agency's partisan activities. Like other Republicans, Jordan wants the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor instead of relying on its own lawyers to conduct the investigation. That seems unlikely, as Cole's appearance at Thursday's hearing appears calculated in part to quell conservatives' fears about the DOJ's impartiality. 'This whole thing is about Democrats in power abusing Republicans,' a senior staffer to an Oversight Committee Republican member told MailOnline on Thursday morning. 'Why would we trust that another agency in the same administration will behave any better?' Lerner raised the GOP's temperature at a May 2013 committee hearing when she offered a self-serving opening statement before refusing to answer questions, citing her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Attorneys working for the committee's GOP majority later determined that she had waived that right by offering an oral defense that wasn't subject to cross-examination. Republicans have since pushed a Contempt of Congress resolution through the House of Representatives, citing her refusal to answer questions while under subpoena. One conservative member, Steve Stockman of Texas, proposed last week that the House sergeant-at-arms should arrest her.

He is the founder of celebrity news website TMZ.  - Brooklyn is the most populous borough of New York City, with a Census-estimated 2,636,735 residents in 2015. It borders the borough of Queens at the southwestern end of Long Island. Since 1896, Brooklyn has had the same boundaries as Kings County, the most populous county in the U.S. state of New York, and the second-most densely populated county in the United States, after the county of New York (which is coextensive with the borough of Manhattan).  - Celebrity Justice is an American news show/nontraditional court show which ran from 2002 to 2005.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - The Daytime Emmy Award is an American accolade bestowed by the New Yorkbased National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in recognition of excellence in American daytime television programming.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.  I am facing a new situation today: Ben and Jerry were two friends with very different dietary habits. Jerry ate healthy food, and was always on top of his caloric consumption, while Ben overate because he loved fatty foods such as butter, bacon et al.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which friend was at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, the friend who is at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease is Ben.  The reasoning here is that, according to the background article, high dietary lipid intake can lead to unhealthy weight gain and increased levels of lipids in the blood which in turn can increase risk for cardiovascular disease. Ben overeats with a preference for fatty foods like butter and bacon. These foods are likely to be high in lipids including the concerning saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. Overconsumption of these can lead to the issues described in the article in the long-term, including arterial narrowing, atherosclerosis, and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, Jerry eats healthily and monitors his caloric intake closely, indicating a lower lipid intake and therefore, a lower risk for cardiovascular disease. These habits are more in line with mitigating the risks described in the background article. Therefore, considering these points, it is fair to say that Ben is at a higher risk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:My first memory of cooking was with my grandmother, Rosemary, in Sydney. She taught me how to make scrambled eggs on her electric stovetop, the kind with the coiled heating elements, in her small, linoleum-lined kitchen with cupboards that stuck a little when they closed. She was not an exceptional cook — I can remember plenty of bland and overcooked vegetables and custard made with powder to pour into pre-bought pie cases with tinned pineapple, her specialty — but she worked hard to put a balanced, home-cooked meal on the table three times a day, every day. The eldest of eight children, she dropped out of school during the Depression to help her single mother look after her siblings and work as a seamstress at David Jones. When the Second World War broke out and she was engaged to my grandfather, Aubrey, she started working on war-torn planes (“sometimes looking as if a steam roller has gone over them,” she said) as a sheet metal worker, putting them back together, when many of the men who used to do this work were off fighting the war. She said it was just like dressmaking, only using different materials. She had a twinkle in her eye and a distinct laugh that can really only be described as a cackle. She was a strong, incredibly smart woman with a fighter spirit who led her female co-workers out on the airport tarmac one day on a strike to earn equal wages to men. I am so proud that her story is taught as part of the Australian primary school curriculum. Her dream was to have a home with that electric stove. In 1943 when she was 28 she was interviewed for Australian Women’s Weekly magazine for an article on women in men’s jobs during the war, where there is a photo of her that is etched in my memory, dressed in white, wearing a white bandana tied in a knot at the top of her dark curls, a plane behind her.

Here is a question about this article: Canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as Venezuelan extra-heavy and Mexican heavy oil in chemical composition, and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery. Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and refined asphalt without any preprocessing. This is particularly common in areas such as the US Gulf coast, where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US Midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline. By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over 1.3 million barrels (210×10^3 m3) per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States. What is the answer to this question: What industry is capable of refining bitumen directly into gasoline without preprocessing?","output":"The oil refining industry, specifically modern and sophisticated oil refineries, are capable of refining bitumen directly into gasoline without preprocessing.

Now for the first time Payne wrote to a magazine from the prison about what happened on the night of 13 October 1999. I had to stay late at the hospital that night to do an operation. I finally left at about 11p.m.. I drove home slowly because the wind was blowing and it was raining heavily. I was running into our road when a man suddenly ran in front of my car. I almost hit him but I stopped just in time. I was scared and the man looked scared, too. I got out of the car but he ran away before I could ask if he was all right. It was very strange. When I got home, the lights were on but it was very quiet. I called to my wife but there was no answer. Then I remembered that she was out at a concert. I was still very unhappy about what happened on the road, so I made myself a drink. Then I went upstairs to have a bath. I saw that the window in the bedroom was open. This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out. She was afraid of burglars. When I went to close it, I found Ellen. She was lying on the floor. There was blood everywhere. I rushed over for her pulse but she was dead. I was so scared. I sat on the floor beside her body without knowing what to do. The next thing I knew was that the sky was getting light. I can't remember a thing about that night. In the morning I phoned the police. They arrived half an hour after I phoned them. But it seemed like hours. During that time I tried hard to remember anything I could about the night before. I couldn't stop thinking about the man in the road.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who showed a Continental influence in his use of the Dutch gable?  Another major influence in his work was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T. A. Richardson and James Harrison and it came to be developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.A characteristic of Douglas's work is his attention to both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building.

Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Steelers, the Chargers went home for a Week 12 Sunday Night game with the Indianapolis Colts.  In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri made a 23-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the 'Bolts took the lead as kicker Nate Kaeding got a 35-yard field goal, while QB Philip Rivers completed a 39-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson.

Born in 1926, Harper Lee grew up in the Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, where she became close friends with soon-to-be famous writer Truman Capote. She attended Huntingdon College in Montgomery (1944–45), and then studied law at the University of Alabama (1945–49). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time. In 1950, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a reservation clerk for British Overseas Airways Corporation; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a literary agent recommended by Capote. An editor at J. B.

Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method — that of the problem of induction. Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past. Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.\\"? Answer:","output":"1. What was Hume's perception on the establishment of all knowledge, even the most fundamental beliefs about the natural world? Hume maintained that all knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about our natural world, could not be conclusively determined by reason alone. According to Hume, our beliefs are more a result of accumulating habits over time, which are developed in responses to our collection of sense experiences. Therefore, our knowledge and beliefs are not solely influenced by logic and reason, but are greatly influenced by familiar patterns and routine experiences. 2. Explain Hume's perspective on inductive reasoning and its justification. In Hume's view, inductive reasoning poses a problematic situation. He argued that in order to reach the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, one requires to employ inductive reasoning itself. Thus, the justification for inductive reasoning becomes a circular argument, trapped within its own logic and methodology. This essentially points to a challenge in the validation of inductive reasoning, rendering its clear justification an issue. 3. What does Hume's problem of induction imply about our ability to predict future events? According to Hume, the problem of induction limits our capacity to predict future events with absolute certainty. He believed that there exists no guarantee that the future will always mirror the past. As an example, he posited that although we expect the sun to continue rising from the East because it has done so in the past, we can't be certain of this by relying on inductive reasoning alone. Reasoning that future events will be similar to past ones is a product of our habitual thinking, formed from repeated past experiences, and it does not assure us of their occurrence in the future. 4. How does Hume's argument shift the debate about the scientific method? Hume added a pivotal slant to the deliberation about the scientific method by indicating the problem of induction. By arguing that the premises for inductive reasoning rely on inductive reasoning itself, he disrupted a widely accepted belief in scientific methodology - the reliance on inductive reasoning to predict and establish theories. This can be seen as questioning the certainty and reliability of scientific conclusions drawn purely based on inductive reasoning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It was the contrast of the note's messy handwriting and the book's clean print that gave Olga pause. Her fingers danced across the parchment, trying to make sense of the jumbled words. The hastily-written note had been left on her doorstep the night before, and something deep inside her told her it was important. As her concentration bore down on deciphering the note, the words began to take shape. Olga realized with a jolt that it was a warning from an unknown sender about her family's long-held secret. A secret that was only mentioned in whispers and kept in the pages of the sacred book she now held in her hands. The secret was intertwined with her bloodline, tracing back generations of practitioners of ancient and powerful magic.

British tuner Kahn reveals the Flying Huntsman pickup British tuner Kahn has done many things to many Land Rover products in the past â some tasteful, some rather less so. Here is the company's latest, the Flying Huntsman 105 Pick Up. As you have correctly deduced, the definitely-not-hilariously-mispronounceable Huntsman started life as a Defender pick-up, but - as with the other also-definitely-not-hilariously-mispronounceable Flying Huntsman - gets a lengthened nose. That bonnet is 400mm longer than the standard Landie's, together with an increase in width of 150mm. There are also wider, extended front and rear fenders with vents and apertures, new headlights, a new front bumper with lights, side vents, a \\"captivating gold stripe\\" and matte black 18-inch wheels. In fact, the whole thing is finished in matte black, too. Underneath, there's Land Rover's 2.2-litre diesel engine - the 105-horsepower version - and unspecified brake and suspension upgrades. Kahn says it has upholstered many things inside the cabin - there's no image of the interior, perhaps thankfully - and fitted a 'Churchill' clock and rev counter fascia, machined aluminium pedals, a billet steering wheel and two ‘GTB' sports seats. Prices start from £58,875 (about 89,000). A cruel thing to do to the venerable Defender? Or curiously appealing? A version of this story originally appeared on TopGear.com.

Sentence 1: The Green Mile is a fat old whore who thinks appealing to an audience's most self-congratulatory instincts--stroking it until it goes blind--is a public service. Sentence 2: The Green Mile appeals to the audience's self-congratulatory instincts. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"If the first sentence were to be considered semantically valid, rather than being an aggressive, subjective statement, then one could argue that the second sentence is true given the context provided in the first sentence.  The first sentence metaphorically refers to \\"The Green Mile\\" as a \\"fat old whore\\" likely to convey the idea that it is a pandering and manipulative piece of work. The statement suggests that \\"The Green Mile\\" appeals to the audience's self-congratulatory instincts by stroking their ego, making them feel better about themselves, even if this approach may cause them to lose touch with reality (illustrated metaphorically as \\"going blind\\"). The second sentence is a summarization of the idea presented in the first sentence, stripped of the inflammatory language. It states that \\"The Green Mile\\" appeals to the audience's self-congratulatory instincts, which is a more neutral way of conveying the idea. In essence, if one takes the intention behind the first sentence – the notion that \\"The Green Mile\\" is a piece of work that panders to the audience's self-congratulatory instincts – as a valid observation, then the second sentence is true, as it reflects this idea in a more concise and neutral manner.  It is important to note that both sentences are subjective opinions rather than objective statements.

Answer the following question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what states have legalized prostitution Suggested answer: As with other countries, prostitution in the United States can be divided into three broad categories: street prostitution, brothel prostitution, and escort prostitution. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"While the suggested answer provides a brief overview of the different categories of prostitution, it does not directly address the question \\"What states have legalized prostitution?\\" Therefore, you should not validate the answer as it does not provide the requested information. To answer the question properly, as of now, in the United States, prostitution is illegal in all states except for parts of Nevada. Nevada has specific laws governing the industry, and prostitution is restricted to licensed brothels. It is important to note that this does not mean that prostitution is legal throughout the whole state. The law only permits legalized prostitution in counties with a population of less than 700,000 residents and where local governments have opted to legalize brothels. Some of Nevada's most populous counties, including Clark County (where Las Vegas is located) and Washoe County (where Reno is located), have outlawed prostitution. Outside of Nevada, U.S. states continue to treat prostitution as an illegal activity under both federal and state level laws. However, some local jurisdictions have taken steps to decriminalize or reduce penalties for individuals engaged in the sex trade, which can include sex workers and their clients. For example, in 2021, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance announced that his office would no longer prosecute prostitution and unlicensed massage cases. In summary, prostitution is officially legalized only in certain parts of the state of Nevada. Other states and local jurisdictions may implement various policies related to the decriminalization or tolerance of prostitution, but that does not make it fully legal within those locations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although part of a prominent family with strong ties to its community, Dickinson lived much of her life in reclusive isolation. After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. When she was eighteen, Dickinson's family befriended a young attorney by the name of Benjamin Franklin Newton. According to a letter written by Dickinson after Newton's death, he had been \\"with my Father two years, before going to Worcester - in pursuing his studies, and was much in our family.\\" Although their relationship was probably not romantic, Newton was a formative influence and would become the second in a series of older men (after Humphrey) that Dickinson referred to, variously, as her tutor, preceptor or master.  Newton likely introduced her to the writings of William Wordsworth, and his gift to her of Ralph Waldo Emerson's first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, \\"whose name my Father's Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring\\". Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of tuberculosis, he wrote to her, saying that he would like to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw. Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862--\\"When a little Girl, I had a friend, who taught me Immortality - but venturing too near, himself - he never returned\\"--refers to Newton.  Dickinson was familiar not only with the Bible but also with contemporary popular literature. She was probably influenced by Lydia Maria Child's Letters from New York, another gift from Newton (after reading it, she gushed \\"This then is a book! And there are more of them!\\"). Her brother smuggled a copy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Kavanagh into the house for her (because her father might disapprove) and a friend lent her Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre in late 1849. Jane Eyre's influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a Newfoundland, she named him \\"Carlo\\" after the character St. John Rivers' dog. William Shakespeare was also a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to one friend, \\"Why clasp any hand but this?\\" and to another, \\"Why is any other book needed?\\" Ask a question about this article.","output":"What was the significance of Benjamin Franklin Newton in Emily Dickinson's life and her development as a poet?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Палеомастодонты Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The word \\"Палеомастодонты\\" in English translates to \\"Paleomastodons.\\" Paleomastodons belong to the family Gomphotheriidae within the order Proboscidea. These were ancient relatives of modern elephants that lived during the early Tertiary period, approximately 40 to 20 million years ago. They were one of the first mastodon species that emerged after the extinction of the Dinosaurs. The fossils of the Paleomastodon have been discovered in parts of Africa with the majority of significant findings in Egypt. Paleomastodons were medium-sized proboscidean mammals that had a distinct shape compared to their cousins, the mammoths, and modern elephants. A few major differences included the tusks; Paleomastodons had long, curved upper tusks in addition to smaller straight lower tusks. These tusks were used as tools to strip off bark from trees or dig in the ground for roots and other vegetation. On their skull, they had low but elongated bony crests, which were used for attachment of strong muscles needed to carry the massive head and large tusks. Their molars were also different from modern elephants; Paleomastodons had uniquely shaped teeth that could grind a wider variety of plants, including leaves, twigs, and aquatic plants. The diet of Paleomastodon was highly diverse, which was one of the crucial factors for their long survival and success during the Tertiary period. Paleomastodon's body weight is estimated to have been around 4 tons. They were shorter and slightly stockier compared to modern elephants, and their legs were comparatively shorter. Their trunks, while similar in use to modern elephants' trunks, were not as dexterous, since they lived in a different environment and their lifestyle did not require such agile trunks. Research and study of Paleomastodons provide valuable information about the evolution and adaptation of these mammals through millions of years. Their fossils also help us understand the changing environments and the variety of ecosystems they inhabited throughout their existence. As we continue to unearth more fossilized remains, we expand our understanding of the incredible diversity and development of these fascinating creatures, as well as their role and impact on the ancient world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Monroe was born on his family's farm near Rosine, Kentucky, the youngest of eight children of James Buchanan \\"Buck\\" and Malissa (Vandiver) Monroe. His mother and her brother, Pendleton \\"Pen\\" Vandiver, were both musically talented, and Monroe and his family grew up playing and singing at home. Bill was of Scottish heritage. Because his older brothers Birch and Charlie already played the fiddle and guitar, Bill Monroe was resigned to playing the less desirable mandolin. Monroe's fortunes began to improve during the \\"folk revival\\" of the early 1960s. Many college students and other young people were beginning to discover Monroe, associating his style more with traditional folk music than with the country-and-western genre with which it had previously been identified.  The word \\"bluegrass\\" first appeared around this time to describe the sound of Monroe and similar artists such as Flatt and Scruggs, the Stanley Brothers, Reno and Smiley, Jim and Jesse, and the Osborne Brothers. While Flatt and Scruggs immediately recognized the potential for a lucrative new audience in cities and on college campuses in the North, Monroe was slower to respond. Under the influence of Ralph Rinzler, a young musician and folklorist from New Jersey who briefly became Monroe's manager in 1963, Monroe gradually expanded his geographic reach beyond the traditional southern country music circuit.  Rinzler was also responsible for a lengthy profile and interview in the influential folk music magazine Sing Out! that first publicly referred to Monroe as the \\"father\\" of bluegrass. Accordingly, at the first bluegrass festival organized by Carlton Haney at Roanoke, Virginia in 1965, Bill Monroe was the central figure.  The growing national popularity of Monroe's music during the 1960s was also apparent in the increasingly diverse background of musicians recruited into his band. Non-southerners who served as Blue Grass Boys during this period included banjo player Bill Keith and singer/guitarist Peter Rowan from Massachusetts, fiddler Gene Lowinger from New York, banjo player Lamar Grier from Maryland, banjo player Steve Arkin from New York, and singer/guitarist Roland White and fiddler Richard Greene from California.

The canyon was formed by glaciers which retreated at the end of the last glacial maximum approximately 15,000 years ago, leaving behind a U-shaped valley. The canyon lies between Rendezvous Mountain to the south and Mount Hunt to the north. The trailhead for the canyon is on the Moose–Wilson Road about north of Teton Village. One of the most popular hikes from the trailhead is to Marion Lake by way of the Granite Canyon Trail which traverses the length of the canyon. Another popular hike involves riding the aerial tram located at the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in Teton Village to the top of Rendezvous Mountain, and then descending back to Teton Village by way of Granite Canyon.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Process:  - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is less pollution happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let's break down the volcanic eruption process and examine if pollution plays a role in it. Step 1: Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - Various gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, are trapped beneath the Earth's surface. These gases are produced by geological processes, and their accumulation can lead to an increase in pressure. Step 2: The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - As the pressure beneath the Earth's surface increases, it becomes sufficient to push the magma towards the surface. The movement of magma depends on factors like the viscosity of the magma and the presence of cracks or faults in the Earth's crust. Step 3: The magma cools - When the magma reaches Earth's surface, it is called lava, and it starts to cool down. The cooling process solidifies the lava, forming new landmass and volcanic rock. Step 4: With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - As geological processes continue, pressure builds up beneath the Earth's surface again, and the cycle repeats, possibly leading to another eruption. Step 5: The resulting volcano may explode - If the pressure buildup reaches a critical point or if there is a sudden decrease in pressure in the volcano's chamber, it can result in an explosive eruption, releasing a large amount of ash, gas, and pyroclastic materials. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis: If there is less pollution, how will it affect smaller eruptions? Pollution, in general, has minimal direct effect on the geological processes or factors that influence volcanic eruptions. Pollution is mainly a byproduct of human activities, like burning fossil fuels, and its effects on the atmosphere, climate, and ecosystems may affect climate patterns and global temperatures, among other things. However, these changes in climate and temperature do not have a significant impact on the processes that lead to volcanic eruptions. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggesting that less pollution would lead to smaller or less frequent volcanic eruptions is not supported by the available evidence. The processes leading to volcanic eruptions are primarily geological and influenced by factors that are not affected by pollution levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dr Tony Cole said the Liverpool Care Pathway scandal would not have been exposed without the Daily Mail and a free Press. A leading medical figure who helped abolish the Liverpool Care Pathway has praised the Daily Mail’s campaign as he condemned attempts to fetter the free Press. Dr Tony Cole – who persuaded ministers to set up the official inquiry that led to the demise of the LCP – said: ‘We would never have got it off the ground if it had not been for the Daily Mail and the Press. I am very concerned about freedom of the Press and anything which might endanger it.’ Dr Cole spoke in the wake of the proposal by ministers that newspapers should accept a new regulator which gives MPs a final say in how regulation should work. Newspapers are thought likely to reject the plan by Culture Secretary Maria Miller because they fear it would give politicians power to censor and intimidate the press. Dr Cole, a prominent paediatrician, praised the Mail in a speech at the Royal College of Medicine on Saturday. He said the Press had stood up for truth while the Government and the medical profession closed ranks to try to silence criticism of the Liverpool Care Pathway. ‘Had it not been for the Press, the relatives who have suffered would not have been able to link up and get their stories heard,’ Dr Cole said. ‘That’s why you need a free Press.’ During the summer the Government changed its mind and abolished the LCP following the verdict of Baroness Neuberger’s inquiry. The inquiry found patients and their families were suffering ‘poor care, appalling communications and of a lack of attention or compassion’. The inquiry was set up after the Mail made a series of damaging disclosures about the system, which had been introduced across the NHS hospital network, and which was meant to provide dignity and comfort to patients in their last hours of life. The Government abolished the LCP after an inquiry into standards of care prompted by the Mail's investigations (file picture) This newspaper highlighted the disquiet of senior doctors who thought the LCP was being used to get rid of elderly patients and free up hospital beds. We reported the agony of families whose loved ones had died, usually after being drugged and refused liquids. The Mail also revealed the ‘bribe’ system under which hospitals were paid millions in bonus money in return for hitting targets for numbers of patients dying on the LCP. The official inquiry said in July that desperate patients were being denied water and there were suspicions that patients had been ‘hastened towards death’ for financial reasons. It said the LCP should be abolished. Dr Cole, a member of the Medical Ethics Alliance which campaigns against euthanasia and abortion, was one of two senior medical figures who persuaded Lib Dem Health Minister Norman Lamb to establish the Neuberger inquiry. He said: ‘In this business we have come up against the entire establishment – the Government, the Royal Colleges, the bulk of the medical profession, all closing ranks – and we came in for a fair amount of stick for having actually questioned the LCP. Newspapers are thought likely to reject the regulation plan by Culture Secretary Maria Miller (pictured). Dr Cole expressed concern at any rules that would impinge on the freedom of the Press. ‘But had it not been for the Press, the. relatives who have suffered would not have been able to link up and get. their stories heard. ‘And their stories were absolutely dreadful – people were dying of thirst, people were being rendered unconscious unnecessarily, some very emotionally upsetting things were happening. That’s why you need a free Press.’ Dr Cole spoke as he received the Schindler Prize from disability rights campaigner Baroness Campbell for his work to expose the effects of the LCP. He added: ‘The British Medical Journal published a report that most GPs supported the LCP, but the Press were publishing more and more stories of awful deaths. ‘If I may say so, the demented elderly who were in great danger from the misapplication of the LCP, are now in a safer place. We must all acknowledge the importance of the Press in all of this from their first description of the so-called “death pathway”.’ Dr Cole told the Mail yesterday: ‘The medical establishment were trying to silence criticism. Damn right they were. Health Minister Norman Lamb called the LCP a 'national disgrace' The medical profession condemned the Daily Mail’s disclosures about the Liverpool Care Pathway.A string of professional bodies and charities combined with NHS managers to form a front to isolate and shout down our coverage of the Pathway. On September 24 last year, 22 organisations, including professional associations and the NHS End-of-life Care Programme, united to issue a ‘consensus statement’ endorsing the LCP. ‘Published misconceptions and often inaccurate information about the Liverpool Care Pathway risk detracting from the substantial benefits it can bring to people who are dying and their families,’ it said. On October 18, Royal College of General Practitioners council chairman Dr Clare Gerada said: ‘The RCGP is appalled at the media coverage in the Daily Mail and elsewhere about planning for end-of-life care. 'As well as being inaccurate and deliberately misleading, this coverage is creating unnecessary distress and fear for patients who might be nearing the end of their life and for their families.’ The Lancet, which describes itself as ‘one of the world’s leading medical journals’, said: ‘The reporting of the story has been appalling.’ In July this year, the inquiry set up by the Department of Health found the treatment of many patients on the LCP had been ‘uncaring, rushed and ignorant’ and called for its abolition. Health Minister Norman Lamb agreed, saying: ‘This is not civilised. It is a national disgrace.’ On the day the inquiry reported, Dr Gerada put out a new statement, saying her Royal College ‘supports the move away from the end-of-life pathway’ and adding: ‘We have expressed concern about the implementation of the LCP.’ ‘They were not willing to contemplate any possible criticism. I can remember one chap from a Royal College telling me that he knew hospital registrars were getting it wrong, but that was no reason for them to change their minds.’ Dr Cole, who retired last year after serving as a hospital paediatrician in London and Worcester, spoke as the row over Press regulation appeared to be reaching a crisis. Ministers have rejected a proposal for self-regulation put forward by newspapers that would incorporate the recommendations of Lord Justice Leveson in his inquiry into the culture, practice and ethics of the press. They prefer a system agreed by the political parties in a late night meeting in the offices of Labour leader Ed Miliband, at which several representatives of the anti-Press campaign group Hacked Off were present, but no representative of the newspaper industry. The regulation method proposed by Mrs Miller would be imposed by Royal Charter. It would allow the system to be amended by a two thirds majority in Parliament. Newspapers have indicated they will reject the scheme, which would mean statutory controls on the Press for the first time in 300 years. Documents from GCHQ leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden (pictured) were reportedly copied on to a USB memory stick and sent by FedEx. The Guardian newspaper reportedly sent top-secret files to the US by household courier FedEx in a move security experts branded ‘astonishing’. Former anti-terror law watchdog Alex Carlile QC said the suggestion that the paper used the courier may have put the lives of British spies in danger. He said: ‘I think it is astonishing that top-secret material has been placed in a public parcel delivery system.’ He also called on the Attorney General to consider legal action against the newspaper and accused the Guardian of playing a ‘parlour game’ with national security. Last week, the head of MI5 warned that publishing confidential documents handed a ‘gift’ to terrorists and caused harm to the work of security services. Security chiefs are ‘very concerned’ at the reported use of the courier service. A source said: ‘Any leak like this is extremely concerning and part of that concern is the handling arrangements.’ Documents from GCHQ, the Government’s secret listening post, leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden, were reportedly copied on to a USB memory stick and sent by FedEx. Last night, the Guardian refused to say how the material was sent.

But I can use this background: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.
